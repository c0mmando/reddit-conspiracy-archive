       I'm generally curious as to why some of you are here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm here after being awakened about 7 years ago to what's really going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       My former mind could have never conceived the concept of a group of the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet, convening to take over every aspect of our lives for their own selfish desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I know this, I felt an incredible energy. I felt angry, sad...I suppose all of the basic stages of grieving essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly, I am driven by a combination of revenge/focus/and love. Revenge against those who have stolen our destiny from us, focus to properly expose them, and love for all of my fellow humans who suffer because of their Greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assumed most people who recently became awake thought as I did, however I often see some more pessimistic outlooks on this sub. Seems odd to me that a pessimistic conspiracy theorist would bother to follow the narrative and engage in active discussion with other human beings who are trying to awaken the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       This lead me to ask, what is your personal reason for being here? What are you motivated by?

       I mostly just read the threads. Some appeal to me and some don't. I tried not to wake up for years of my boyfriend telling me information but I finally woke up about a yr ago and can't deny what is going on anymore. I work at a desk where I have a lot of free time. I guess I go through the sub to try not to fall back into being complacent or not fall asleep again I guess. I find that I have no interest in a lot of the mainstream conspiracy theories and skim past them. I just like to see what people are talking about. I do not post anything or talk about anything with people offline or really online often. Hope that helps.

       Just curious, what would you call "mainstream conspiracy theories"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm under the impression that there is really only one major conspiracy by the elites. The various "mini conspiracies" are towards establishing that goal.

       Okay so I guess I am just not interested in politics. Not for any reason other than I find myself passing by anything that has to do with trump, Awan, rallies or why navy ships keep colliding. I do like to read about 9/11 and pizza gate sometimes. Not interested in Podesta. I will read about CERN, sometimes flat earth is interesting to read or Mandela Effect. It is just personal taste.

       Flat earth is believed by many to actually be a Psy op. Since it's so ridiculous, it makes the conspiracy culture as a whole look kind of wacky and outlandish. It's an old archaic theory from thousands of years ago lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that these are the plans
      </p>
      <p>
       -race war
      </p>
      <p>
       -global collapse
      </p>
      <p>
       -microchipped population
      </p>
      <p>
       -indoctrinated youth
      </p>
      <p>
       -planned obsolescence
      </p>
      <p>
       Any "moves" you see being made that are forwarding towards these goals, odds are they are part of the agenda.

       I get that. The question was what I look at on reddit. I watch more youtube videos about those topics than I read posts. The question was about my purpose on this thread. I don't know why but posts on some of these subjects seem like a lot of reading to get a little bit of information. Even youtube I have to go through like 8 videos to find one that seems like a legit possible explanation or opinion on a topic. Any recommendations? I have kids (mixed kids) and one is in school. He goes to a Montessori school, which may or may not be better than public or christian school. I have prepped for what circumstances I can (food, water, solar lanterns, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, I am trying. I wish I could be more gung-ho about research and being more informed but I just seem mentally blocked some times.

       I woke up in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still to this day don't remember how I came across Alex Jones, but I saw his Bohemian Grove video and was completely mindblown.
      </p>
      <p>
       I must have spent the next 3 to 6 months staying up until the sun came up every single night, reading everything from Project Bluebeam, to Operation Paperclip, to reptilians. You name it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was enlightening for me in more ways than one as it completely relieved me of the writer's block in which I was facing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cost me friendships and has taken over my artistic purpose on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't regret being red pilled, but sometimes I do miss the days when I was oblivious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, I was never completely blue pilled because even as a teenager I had a dislike for authority and the government in general, but never really knew why. It was instinctual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use these negatives as positive energy to put forth what I like to do, which is create music and animation.

       For me, it started with organized religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was forced to go to catholic school and I used to mock the religion at 8 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       They used to put me at the "bad kid table" by myself and this young girl would be really nice to me and try to understand why I wasn't following along like the other kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me thinks it maybe part of past life trickling through with preconceived notions to help shape your brain in your current life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be completely wrong, but that is what it "feels" like.

        I don't regret being red pilled, but sometimes I do miss the days when I was oblivious.

       Hypothetically, if somebody were to explain to you that you are not, in fact, actually red-pilled
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
       , but you could be within a few hours, would you take them up on their offer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Me personally, probably not. I already feel like I know too much. I causes distance between myself and those I care about. Not friction, because I am not dumb enough to bore them with stuff they don't care about, but distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since I learned that
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/37-things-normies-believe/">
        the deception goes much further than mere media lies
       </a>
       , nothing has been the same, really. I kinda miss being a normie. Although I was less healthy back then. Learning some truths has helped me to improve my lifestyle, which is good.

       But, there was something delightful about thinking the worst scandal in the white house was "who sucked Bill's dick?".

       The worst part was trying to tell everyone I know about what I learned. Once you stop giving a fuck about waking up others and just enjoy your own...its much more rewarding.

       Spectating and seeing if the world ever becomes something worth living in, and the power elite get overthrown, see if there really is some sort of light at the end of the tunnel, or if all this talk of ascension and awakening and overthrowing the elite/archons/aliens and shit is just another ruse by TPTB to keep humanity complacent and confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm one of the pessimistic observers that don't really do anything. I'd love to be a part of something bigger, something better, in truly making the world a better place by overthrowing all the evil shit in it, but I don't have the competence and confidence to do it, I work horribly with other people, or just working at all. I'm just not capable of efforts like that, so the most I can do is attempt to support people who are able to work, unlike me.

       I'm here because firstly the truth may be straining through here bit by bit, and I want to catch it. Secondly I've been reading conspiracy forums for 10+years so I'm fairly knowledgable on some of the older topics. And thirdly on one of those conspiracy forums there was a post one day about google giving up news of a comet that landed in the pacific. It had a graphic with an x to mark the spot and everything. They also gave the time roughly. I was at work at the time telling a coworker what I saw. I kept saying the world was about to end and joking around and stuff. Time came and like 5 - 10 mins later bam a cold front with heavy snow came rolling in over the mountain. From an otherwise sunny day. I deduced that the meteor/asteroid did hit the ocean sending h2o so far into the atmosphere it caused that front. I felt this was a 'leak' and started into the conspiracy game.

       I'm here for whatever support I can. I'm starting to think that there are many like us that are just patiently waiting for the ball to drop. It's people like us that will step forward to help the uneducated and entranced souls break free from their chains. I always felt like I was meant for something greater than this, along with not caring for authority or government growing up. I grew up very poor and often homeless so It allowed me to see a wide spectrum of what life had to offer. Most of the problems I saw were direct effects of this hypnosis that has become modern society.

       I read a book by Timothy Good like 25 years ago, been chasing rabbits ever since. I don't really have any specific goals, I think more than anything I am just fascinated by hidden things. And once I stopped worrying about absolute truth, and started focusing on the negative space, things got a lot more interesting. I have met some really amazing people sifting through all this stuff, that is probably an even bigger reason for my interest.

       I am a rich Jew and it makes me laugh how you idiots jack off furiously about killing all the Jews so you can "take back" control of your lives when the reason your all broke losers is because you fucking suck- your failures in your business lives and personal lives and need to find anyone to blame for it but the white male your looking at in the mirror
      </p>
      <p>
       So I like reading all about the Oy Vey, and Goy, and Talmud and how apparently I eat people and babies and there was no Holocaust and I am a khazar and that I am poisoning the water to stop white babies and that I am replacing everyone with Muslims- I need to know this to make sure to never ever ever, not for one day or one minute- feel anything but contempt for poor white christians like op who are now WOKE- I have to remember I am the one the want to kill, it's my money op wants, my family he wants to kill, because he in his core thinks he deserves it more then me
      </p>
      <p>
       Well op, and lightbringerflex, and 1800gofuckyourself and the other head Jew haters on the sub(you know who you are) your not getting my money, your not getting rid of Israel and your not going to do shit- cause the one true conspiracy is rich people, like me, control poor people like you
      </p>
      <p>
       And as long as you stay off the grid, worrying about the fluoride killing your sperm your never going to ever accomplish shit
      </p>
      <p>
       So all of you go watch your 9/11 documentaries, protest Israel, talk about sacred economics and deny to Holocaust- I live in china in a Jewish community of about a hundred people, we are all millionaires, doctors lawyers scientists-we are going to be just fine as you guys get poorer and poorer and angrier and angrier

       Not at all, I am being honest, something that is very fucking rare on this sub
      </p>
      <p>
       I read post after post of people who bitch and moan about how Jews like me stole their shit- I didint steal their shit- their failures are their own and they fucking know it
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a god damn child sacrificing moloch worshiping satanic beast- I am more successful because I fucking worked hard at school and took my education and job seriously and was willing to make sacrifices- like moving to fucking china- that most people won't make

       Not fuck trolling, I am speaking truth- no aliens are coming, no revolution, no great awakening- it's just going to more of this to you die- new technology rendering your skills further redundant unless you get real degrees and get real jobs- no one needs your off the grid farming, no one needs your artisanal carpentry- people need STEM the need multilingual accounting and lawyers admitted in multiple countries to deal with international law- you will not like our future because it's hard and it's not going to be fun, buts that's what's going to be
      </p>

       I repeat facts on this sub because most people on it are very stupid- they create an illusion to give themselves comfort because the facts are they are failures in their lives, they can't deal with the basic truth that the windows of opportunity that determine where their career would go have closed and they did not take that time seriously so now they are poor, they are being locked out of the future and they neeeeeed to believe in a clean slate- a magic event to set them free from their failures

       Hmmm I've seen you (unbidden) cite your education and profession a number of times recently. Why do you deem it necessary? Far from adding credence to your position, it demeans you as one lacking the linguistic clout to formulate compelling statements in their own right

       I started bringing up my credentials after I talked with a huge hero on this sub lightbringerflex in regards to his insane economic model sacred economics- I felt it important to explain that I work with money around the world, and he does as far as I can tell, nothing- and that no matter how many upvotes he gets for explaining that Jews are destroying the world and that we can all just live on "labor credits" that none of that shit makes sense
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end I live in a world of fact- the earth is round and not hollow and filled with monsters, the moon is not made of cheese or a hologram and NASA landed on it, 9/11 was done by Saudi Arabia not by Jewish art students, JFK was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, the Holocaust happened
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it just is- and everyone here needs to believe in a different reality, one without credit scores or jobs because their credit sucks and their job is bad

       Life is hard, we are all going to die, most for no reason with no meaning. It's depressing, deal with it like adults

       You can type whatever you want but it will not change anything, I am in china right now, I am a lawyer at Lee and Li, I have a law degree from a top 25 American law school and a masters of law from Tsingua University- you can't just will me away

       In your comments, you mentioned you moved to China after the recession - so 2007- 2010. 
Tinder started 2012.

       Hilarious stuff.  Just an fyi, a long while back, I happened to argue with a person claiming to study in china but is Jewish, and they kept mentioning they were a
       <em>
        student
       </em>
       and in their history I saw they work in a bingo hall of all places-- or it was something akin to that.  Funny thing is, I think they were studying to be a lawyer.  Take all this for what you will, but that person was also extremely irrational.  No matter what, it does seem amusing to me that we seem a lot of chinese diaspora who just happen to frequent this sub.  Nihow guys!

       The reason why people don't like jews is because it's always the same song and dance with you people.

       You rise to the top of a civilization. (Legally and intelligently, I might add) Then you corrupt it so nobody outside of your circle can prosper. Through fraud, war, deception, etc. Whatever it takes to keep people at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why your type hates free speech and want to label anything you don't like "hate speech". It's a way to ride the coat tails of an atrocity from the last civilization of people who got sick of you.

       Fast foward 70 years and it starts all over again. People are sick of you and your ancient parlor tricks. Except this time, people are privy to it a lot quicker than they used to be.

       I'm motivated by the quest for truth in every and any form. I believe our purpose is to communicate truth. Look how we do se well naturally, at arguing to arrive at the truth. Every time I hang with a friend, I tend to tell them the things I learned since we last talked. This propensity is what leads people to talk about untrue things, which are spread under the guise of truth- movies and television are literally false realities which people "prefer" and in doing so, fall victim to entertaining as fact. The brain doesn't know the difference between the tv and reality, and logs tv in memory as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, that the truth must be carefully preserved at all times, and even kept safe from ways we share it incorrectly (through very careful practice of the power of words). It is very single person's purpose to achieve this feat, which is why people tend to fall into intellectual traps (it is our nature to entertain ideas about the truth of reality).
      </p>
      <p>
       My being here, then, is heavily based on my desire to fight the good fight, in the presence of many witnesses! Though a new Dark Ages approaches, I will not renig on my promise, to come back for all of you, and lead the last resistance of mankind should it be revealed as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been working on my blog for over 10 years, and started with a report on the document entitled "A World Effectively Controlled by the United Nations". From Nov 13th 2015 until last December I ran alternative news from my blog. Since I foresaw the coming censorship, I decided to get out of the muck, and write my own truth my way. I call it, Operation Versive Prism. Enjoy, if you dare. I was on LJ before the Russians bought it, and I'm not switching for anyone.
