       Voting for politicians (including presidents) means nothing when they are merely managers for their owners. Voting for a new manager, yet keeping the same abusive owner seems highly counterproductive, if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owners have diabolically crafted a system in which the people believe they can actually change or make a difference to it while being within it. I have seen plenty of owners fire their employees, I however, have yet to see any employee fire their company's owner. That's the system we are living in. We are the employees, and as such, have no rights merely privileges of the Corporation.

       No, I didn't vote for anyone. There is no point. That would be like me voting on whether I wanted a rusty metal dildo forcibly shoved up my ass with or without lube.

       That's what most huge trump supporters do in this sub. They pretend they don't support Trump to seem unbiased and their opinion is so so cool and well thought out. I don't really give a shit if he pretends he doesn't support him. He does. As all white nationalists do.

       I see both of you in every thread, and I have very distinct opinions that I've built over time based on what I've seen in every one of those threads. Using logical fallacies to appeal to what you assume to be the knowledge of "the community" only makes your argument weaker.

       He's been longer than I have, which has been 4+ years. You're specifically in this sub to discredit the main contributors to this sub and put them in a box with all the buzzwords that make white people seem racist, or support trump. I've never seen him support trump, in fact, he has the same belief that I have: they're in bed together, all of politics. You should be banned fm this sub but you won't be because the mods are in your back pocket. And if you did get banned you switch to your alt, RunDogRunDogRun. You have another alt that I've seen, but I forget the name of it. You're too obvious. I could do your job better than you. But I have a conscience.

       I voted for him, but that was before I traveled down some of the deeper rabbit holes. The point is, we cannot change anything within this system the owner's have created, or else you end up like JFK. I'm not truly sure if Ron Paul knew the extent of all of that or not. A huge part of me thinks, he didn't. Look into

       After the Civil war, they basically had no idea who was alive or who was dead, so they just declared everyone to be "dead/lost" at sea which effectively makes us all criminals of the state and committing fraud on the daily (using federal reserve bank notes is also fraudulent). Which bring us to the 13th:

      </blockquote>

       We are all considered criminals, because of the former. Hence why they can unlawfully kidnap and lock us up at any time. Which then brings us to the 14th:

       I left America and work as a lawyer in china now, it's pretty great

       America is in an economic death spiral and it can not recover, our GDP was at 1% for 8 years and when we needed real leadership on the issue all we did was talk about gender

       If you want a better life learn mandarin and get a masters at Tsingua, it's free for Americans at the moment since our whiteness is still of value but eventually that will change

       People need to accept the positive aspects of globalization which is that there is no actual reason for you to stay where you are living, any of you can leave, you can all get jobs teaching English in china for relatively high pay and use that as a way to eventually go to college in china for free and get high paying jobs in a field you like

       Yeah, but people have to
       <em>
        realize
       </em>
       that no one can save them. Doesn't take much to 'con' people; we've been mentally shackled forever. It's easier for some to believe a lie than open their mind to truth. The world perpetuates the myth of "the hero".

       Half of the people on this sub can't even figure it out, so you can't expect your average schmuck to get it. Last year this place was full of people tripping over themselves to suck Trump's cock because he was "one of us." I mean, all these other politicians were fakers and liars...but

       When you treat politics like a sport, it's easy to get people to buy into the narrative every single term. Nothing ever changes. Nobody ever learns a lesson. Kind of like Seinfeld but not funny.
