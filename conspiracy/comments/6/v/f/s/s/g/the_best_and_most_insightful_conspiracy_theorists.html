       Think about it, why do the rich and powerful conspire against us? It's important to ask why these conspiracies are Happening and who is behind them, not just marveling over the fact that they are happening, and Patting yourself on the back for being considered a "fringe researcher".
      </p>
      <p>
       Trace these things back. Use your intuition. By Doing this, myself and many others have formed an accurate snapshot in our heads of a power structure that dominates the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now ask yourself WHY are they doing it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do these powerful people have a plan of some sort? I think you'll find that they do, and the plan is to assume total control over everyone's lives and all of the world's resources. These people have a sadistic and insatiable hunger for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep asking "why" and you'll find the truth.

       Globalization is bad because it widens markets beyond the scope of small to medium organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like how Starbucks killed the mom and pop coffee shop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like how outsourcing killed the local manufacturing industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like how other governments owning our debt has led to the U.S. slipping from the peak of the world economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalization just means we take everything good from here and spread it out thin in the world, and get back a bunch of crap for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people that win in globalization are the ultra wealthy that can extract value from the economic gradient.

       The us economy tanked because of bad real estate lending, and then when our GDP collapsed instead of it being the primary goal to fix it we had 8 years of 1% GDP under Obama with everyone just saying that was fucking great 👍
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalization has increased the overall income of every one on earth massively- most people on earth are now food stable- that was simply not true even 20 years ago. Most people on earth now have access to the internet, mobile phones, computers, housing, cars, banks, and healthcare- just did not exist in most of the world until recently
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are not good in America because of bad economic policy during the recession, which is still happening, GDP is only 3.4%
      </p>

       I packed my shit and left America, once you leave and see how an actual growing economy is doing you realize the issue is America and Europe are just currently fucked

       Better for what, for corporate profits? Sure!

      <p>
       Taking a cozy and comfortable nook of a coffee shop that knows its customers by name and is a home away from home, and trade it for a plastic pressed corporate dressed substitution that brands everything and everyone as inauthentic and saccharine.
      </p>
      <p>
       My coffee shop used to host open mic poetry and music nights. It used to be a gathering place for the young and idealistic to talk about how to make a better world.
      </p>
      <p>
       My local starbucks is just a mcdonalds that mainly serves coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better business model indeed...
      </p>
      <p>
       And factory farms are a better business model for growing food, if you want less nutritious, cruelty enhance foodstuffs...

       You don't like Starbucks, most people do
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people do not want a open mic night and home away from home when they are buying coffee- they want coffee
      </p>
      <p>
       If they could get it from a robot they would, hence why it's a better business model for most people who do not want to have a personal relationship with the goon making them coffee- they just want coffee before they go to work or when they are on lunch
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes factually factory farms grow the food cheaper and faster so people can buy it to eat it- animals are just animals and no one cares about how the sausage is made, it's just meat 🍖
      </p>

       Why? Because I believe people have the right to make their own choices? That they don't need people like you deciding what's best for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you and your coffee house know what's best for the Ethiopians who grow the coffee you drink and who have become the fastest growing economy in the world thanks to the globalization you hate, that they are now food stable, that their capital city is as wealthy as New York and it is the headquarters of the American Africom military command bringing in billions of dollars a year that is reinvested into the neighboring nations like Chad in multinational agreements with china that have helped millions of people
      </p>
      <p>
       More of Africa today has access to advanced healthcare and technology then any time in history, with a few exceptions African governments are fighting corruption and are spending money to help their people and are experiencing massive growth and it is saving lives.
