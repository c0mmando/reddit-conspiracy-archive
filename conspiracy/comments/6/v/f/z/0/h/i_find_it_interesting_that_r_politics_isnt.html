       I'd criticize the left, the anti-war / pro civil liberties movement under Bush was gutted by Obama.  I really hopes they would come back under Trump but they haven't.  I've seen more people advocating going to war with Russia or argueing we need to keep fighting proxy war in order to maintain power.  It's sad, because no one looks at our foriegn policy over a long time.  How many us lead military interventions in the last 40 years have worked out for the people of that country?

       Yeah, the republicans are just as bad, been biching about Neocons since the early 2000's.  Hillary was also advocating putting thousands of troops in Syria as well.  This isn't a left vs right, it's a foriegn policy always seems to go in one direction.

       The partisan politics is strong with you.  If you can't look at our foriegn policy and not recognize it as only lining the military industrial complexs pockets and to make areas of the world unstable, than you're lost.  Keep defending Hillary and hating on Trump, I'm going to continue to continue to criticizing our entire foriegn policy which IMO benifits no one.

       So you're agreeing with me, she said she wouldn't put boots on the ground. Trump said he would, IIRC.

       And no, you don't need troops on the ground to fly planes in the air. The person who said it wouldn't work wasn't a general. And she clearly said it would be done with other nations who do have ground forces already.

       Syria is a complicated situation. There are people who believe we should never help when people are being killed by their own government and others that believe we have a moral responsibility to protect innocent lives regardless of country or race.

       So no denying you deleted over 30 posts?

       Hilarious. Why support someone if you are too embarrassed to keep your posts about him?

       I bet you got real worked up about deleted emails too.

       I don't think I deleted any of them, I'll check after my flight.   But I they definitely weren't supportive of Trump.

        How many troops did we send into Syria again?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you only think the US is involved if we have boots on the ground.  You don't consider providing direct support anf arming the various factions with weapons through Saudi Arabia &amp; Qatar does count?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Which side wanted to send in troops? Oh right, Republicans.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yeah, the republicans are just as bad, been biching about Neocons since the early 2000's.  Hillary was also advocating putting thousands of troops in Syria as well.  This isn't a left vs right, it's a foriegn policy always seems to go in one direction.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who has continued, arguably escalated the involvement? Trump.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I know, been pointing that out as well, and I've been surprised by the left's ability to still argue for it.
