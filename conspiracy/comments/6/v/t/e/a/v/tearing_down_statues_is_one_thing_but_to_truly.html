    <div class="md"><p>If modernism is the age of reason, then postmodernism describes a movement away from reason.</p>

<p>Instead, &quot;it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or <em>political</em> discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed.&quot; (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>Feelings are more important than reality; it is closely related to cultural Marxism, a term you scoffed at.</p>

<p>A symptom of postmodernism is identity politics, &quot;a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;re fighting for some peoples&#39; rights. 
Whole other groups are having theirs - even their free speech - taken away. 
These idiot progressives are actually causing a huge regression. They&#39;re reliant on the fact that a majority of &#39;progressives&#39; are pig ignorant, mass mind controlled mainstream media junkies who watch mainstream dribble that is literally lulling them into hypnotic states and imparting the dogmatic agenda you&#39;re calling &#39;progressive&#39;. It&#39;s horse shit. It&#39;s not progressive to run around taking down historical statues - regardless of what they represent. It&#39;s not progressive to continually insist that it is okay to use violence if it is against people whose opinions you find bigoted or offensive. 
Since when did speech trump action? You&#39;re allowed to think and say anything you want, as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt people. Are we really at a point where offending someone constitutes assault? People need to get some perspective. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve got an elite Cabal basically in the final stages of enslaving the entire human race - regardless of the color of their skin, the elites don&#39;t give a fuck. And most of the population is too busy deciding which bloody gender they want to be today, creating chaos because some people (not even very many people!) have some offensive ideas, and totally buying in to the mass re-write of history taking place to position Republicans as the slave masters, and Democrats the social justice warriors. The Democrats were, historically, the actual upholders of slavery. </p>

<p>But the truth doesn&#39;t matter. It only matters what people believe. And most people are so caught up with the Kardashians they have absolutely know idea that the crazy conspiracy theorists wanking on about the deep state Cabal that is about to take over the planet were correct. </p>

<p>You call that progressive? </p>

<p>You have no clue what a monument actually is. It&#39;s a celebration and tribute to the subject. Germans aren&#39;t forgetting about Hitler because there&#39;s no statues of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what a monument is. It seems it is you that doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>noun
1. something erected in memory of a person, event, etc., as a building, pillar, or statue: the Washington Monument.
2. any building, megalith, etc., surviving from a past age, and regarded as of historical or archaeological importance.
3. any enduring evidence or notable example of something:
a monument to human ingenuity.
4. an exemplar, model, or personification of some abstract quality, especially when considered to be beyond question: a monument of middle-class respectability.
5. an area or a site of interest to the public for its historical significance, great natural beauty, etc., preserved and maintained by a government.
6. a written tribute to a person, especially a posthumous one.
7. Surveying. an object, as a stone shaft, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of real estate or to mark a survey station.</p>

<p>Statues of Hitler - and all of the American leaders whose statues are coming under fire - fit many of these definitions. However your assertion that they are &#39;celebrations&#39; is absolutely incorrect. Throughout history there have been numerous monuments to heinous events and individuals. But again, these are of historical significance and should be preserved as we would preserve the details of history itself. Although increasingly we are seeing that history doesn&#39;t matter at all. Some of the past leaders whose statues people are demanding be taken down were not even white supremacists and did not own slaves. In fact Republicans never owned slaves, they voted to abolish slavery and the Democrats opposed it. They voted to give African Americans the vote, Democrats opposed it. But for the most part nobody is trying to tear down the statues of Democrats. Largely the focus is being put on Republicans, based off the sorry levels of ignorance in America - ignorance of any facts of history. They are being targeted and manipulated by the mainsteam media to experience reactionary, emotionally driven responses to agenda driven stimuli. 
What we are seeing is a re-write of history to stimulate a race war like revolution of civil strife in the US where. Running around tearing down statues that you emotionally claim are &#39;celebrations&#39; of fictitious ugliness propagated by the mainstream media is not progressive, it&#39;s not constructive. It is in fact totally destructive. Not just to the nations monuments, but also its history. </p>

<p>Incidentally replying &#39;lol&#39; just makes you look like an idiot. A trolling, shill.

Left vs Right is defined based on big government, regulations, or government owning means of production in the extreme. Pretending like nationalism makes a Leftist socialist government suddenly Right-wing is absurd.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point here. </p>

<p>Yes. Antifa is a fringe group. But so are white supremacy groups. The difference being we&#39;ve been hardwired to reject Nazism, but we&#39;re completely overlooking the actions of Antifa as a result.

<p>Yes, Nazis believe disgusting things. But if they want to gather peacefully in a park that&#39;s their business as citizens of a free society. Objectively, they are not <em>doing</em> anything wrong. </p>

<p>Antifa, on the other hand doesn&#39;t really have a forward moving belief system as far as I can tell. Much like the Occupy movement, there are vague grievances with certain oppressive groups, but no real proposed solutions or positive agenda. Their name has become literal new speak because </p>

<p>Fascism = bad

<p>We have numerous riots in various cities around the continent, attacks with weapons like bike locks and piss bottles, you name it. </p>

<p>The problem here isn&#39;t that people are defending Nazis, it&#39;s that we have TWO terrible fringe groups fighting in the streets amongst otherwise peaceful protests but ones obviously getting preferential treatment when it comes to fear mongering when the other has been extremely violent in recent months.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Nazism and white supremacy are two wholly separate things.  Google it. </p>

<p>You keep changing the goal posts in this argument. My original comment was that many right wing outlets are trying to paint everyone who is a counter protester as &quot;antifa&quot;.  This talking point has been made ad nauseam the last week. You can&#39;t argue this - the president himself made the same claims just yesterday.  </p>

<p>The counter argument was that the left calls everyone Nazis.  This isn&#39;t the case.  Your post showing an oped by a single politician  about how republican policies are for the benefit of whites also does not support that claim. </p>

More general skepticism is that it&#39;s hard to believe anyone that owned a tricked out challenger would hate some random protester more than they love their car.<br/>

<p>There isn&#39;t a crisis, but here are people defending Nazism regardless of how many actual Nazis there are in the us, Trump partially included. That&#39;s the real issue. Nobody thinks the fucking SS is patrolling streets </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how do we disavow Nazis and still speak our opinions on Antifa, media, and all that other buzz shit without becoming Nazi apologist?</p>

<p>Where do we find that line where we can express our identity and the reality of our communities as conservatives but not Nazis?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are jumping to defend Nazis, they are jumping to prove that they aren&#39;t and disavowing the group that is calling every conservative a racist and Nazi is the only way I can think to do that. Or do we just join the counter protesters since it&#39;s the proper thing for a civilized society to do?</p>

<p>There is an identity crisis on the right and they are attempting to completely psychologically subvert them to actually rise up with the Nazis. The moderate conservatives are keeping their fucking mouths shut because they aren&#39;t risking a backlash to their company or career, so now that they are either old, in hiding, or trying to protect their family and career they are forced to watch literal Nazis attempt to co-opt their nationalism (the kind that helped Trump) and subvert it to equal only white nationalism. They are speaking out because they have no idea how to combat these accusations since they aren&#39;t the racists marching with tiki torches.</p>

<p>At least that is the sentiment from the old red elephants in my neck of the woods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mechanism could be simpler, without the need for a puppet master. In Sweden, antifa has been around for a long time, but for the longest time they wrestled with a serious problem: They identified as &quot;nazi-hunters&quot;, but there were no nazis in Sweden to hunt. I mean, sure, there was old Hans, but hunting him was getting old. So what they did was to become ever more &quot;liberal&quot; in their definition of nazis, until anyone right of center became fair pray (via exactly the same &quot;you provide cover for nazis by being right-wing, that makes you nazis!&quot; logic as you see applied against Trump supporters in the US). Generally, they were seen with disdain, although slightly less disdain than nazis because &quot;at least antifa hate nazis&quot;. Finally, with the refugee crisis, some actual immigration skeptics dared voice timid concern - not actually being nazis, of course, but close enough! Oh, how antifa rejoiced. Finally the <em>real</em> hunt was back on the menu. And with more immigrants came more critics, and antifa grew. At this point, with the country concerned about the rise of the horrible nazis, antifa could even go back to beating up old Hans to the cheers of a nation (Hans represents the thousand or so real nazis that always exist in pretty much any western country). Funnily enough, that also gained Hans some sympathy so amazingly, actual nazis started gaining some tolerance. All the better for antifa, more prey for the hunt and more good press when they hunted. That&#39;s where Sweden is currently, with nazis and antifa growing each other in symbiosis. Sure, clever puppet masters might have set the spiral off (e.g. with immigration) but I think what we see here is a feedback loop that doesn&#39;t need external coordination. But the point to remember is that antifa are the only ones who <em>need</em> nazis to exist - it is their whole raison d&#39;etre, and Sweden is full of examples of them actually manufacturing nazism (including false flags) to give the impression that they are important and good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a good summary of antifa&#39;s general tactics in Sweden, though does not go into their symbiotic relationship with the nazis. Still good confirmation that, yes, what they seem to be is really what they are (thugs):</p>

<p>Famous nazi false flag: Swedish biggest daily newspaper (leftist) Aftonbladet hires nazis to plant an axe in the door to the home of Swedish multiculturalist profile Alexandra Pascalidou and photograph it. Not antifa? In Sweden it can be hard to say, antifa is deeply involved with several newspapers, including Aftonbladet, via their &quot;stasi branch&quot; (they call it that themselves, bragging) that registers people who aren&#39;t radically anti-facist enough for their tastes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weird bonus tidbit:</p>

<p>The &quot;Sweden Democrats&quot; (SD), which is the Swedish nationalist party, were getting fed up with being called nazis all the time by all the other parties, the media, etc. They had already ran several drives to rid their party of extremists, but it seemed like every week would reveal some new SD-member from some random little town who wanted to share their deep nazi beliefs with the press.</p>

<p>This was straining the patience of the party&#39;s leadership, who would have to appear yet again in the media to explain that, no they didn&#39;t share those views and that the member had been booted. This had been going on for too long. Just recently they had to boot their <strong>entire</strong> youth organization for being too right wing. They just were not able to root out all the nazis in their own party by themselves...</p>

<p>Who could they ask for help?  </p>

<p>You guessed it: Antifa, specifically their &quot;stasi branch&quot; called the &quot;research group&quot;. And so it came to pass, as evidenced in the inevitable leaks, that SD had fed Antifa confidential information about SDäs members, asking Antifa to tell the SD leadership who among them were dirty rotten nazis that needed the boot.</p>

<p>Strange bedfellows? Or a pertinent commentary on the realpolitik of the situation? Swedish Antifa didn&#39;t go &quot;sure we&#39;ll help, we&#39;d love to strengthen the brand of Swedish nationalists!&quot;, but it still shows that Antifa activities can actually be useful for nationalists that have a branding problem with nazis. In other words, perhaps Trump should embrace Antifa, say that it&#39;s great they help him fight the evil nazis and that no real patriots mind, because no real patriots stand with the nazis. It could be quite the move.</p>

<p>Yeah man, remember when we were individuals with interests all our own and had the gumption to follow that. Sorry that doesn&#39;t make me look like a clean cut washington liberal man, I&#39;m sorry I like flannel shirts and iron ranger boots. I&#39;m sorry that if I&#39;m around someone that fucking hunts or has issues with the DNC somehow equates me to a nazi. Sorry that I have questions about 9/11 and other weird shit that goes against the grain.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;d consider why judging others based on their appearance is kinda incredibly fucked up for people who like to take the moral high ground. It seems to be the Anti of being a decent human being.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my fault that Nazis just tend to end up looking like poor rednecks. 
Fuck man,  even if I class it up, how can I avoid looking like <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/White.jpg">this</a></p>

<p>This is my issue, the literal nazis you wanna bash. They dress normal. They wear suits and thanks to political correctness, they have a roadmap on how to say the most heinous inflammatory shit without getting called out on it by avoiding buzzwords. </p>

<p>So, back to the only point I&#39;ve ever had through my whole day arguing this cyclical issue with people all day. How do we speak out against issues we disagree with, while still understand that we both hate nazis? Because the only answers I seem to get are like yours or &quot;Well if you&#39;re being associated with them&quot; and such. That hasn&#39;t happened, but I&#39;ve been called a Trump supporter for my appearance and demeanor. I&#39;m not. I&#39;ve seen whats happened in Boston for the ones who weren&#39;t white supremacists and I watched the videos of what happened to them.</p>

<p>How do I guarantee my safety when the black blocs decide that they don&#39;t like my face or super radical ideas about how the military industrial complex runs this nation and craves violence to endlessly demoralize us to the sickened state of worms? How can I speak out against big monied interests, conspiracy theories involving political parties and our rulers, military, and the often co-opted by the government activists movements. </p>

<p>How can I question you or the ones who can only see this issue as completely black and white?</p>

I don&#39;t think he is racist and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s an idiot, but I think this you are also right that he is very easy to cover. I wouldn&#39;t even say social activism is trendy, it&#39;s a right that every American should exercise. We are a progressive society and we should be able to push to make changes that enrich people&#39;s lives in this country. The injustice we should all be fighting to dismantle is the Military Industrial Complex. </p>

<p>Socialism is commonly cited as the transition period to a theoretical Communist utopia. Let&#39;s be real though - which is more likely, the State gives the means of production to the people after seizing them, or the State holds onto the means of production and implicitly forces the people into serving the State?</p>

<p>Communism never works. Socialism is a slippery slope to Fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like a question about cops is more complicated that, cops good or cops bad.</p>

<p>In general I feel pretty good about cops since 99% of them have an entire career without doing stupid shit.  Every segment of society, no matter how you slice it, has it&#39;s share of psychopaths, greed, murder, hate, rape etc etc.</p>

<p>So when negative behaviors as mentioned above intersect with a position of authority like cops, it tends to magnify the severity of the crime.  If a cop rapes someone, it&#39;s a much bigger deal than if an occupy Wall Street protestor rapes someone.  Similarly, if a toy poodle bites someone it&#39;s not as big a deal as if a pitbull bites someone.</p>

<p>It still sucks, but there are measurable differences in how bad it sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched pol as this meme began. It was posted about 20 times in a day and a half before it went to twitter and was pointed at being right wing conspiracy. It was a total play. It&#39;s like any forum. If you flood the forum with the same topic over and over again, eventually the real ones who tell you to fuck off are no longer telling you to fuck off, they are probably looking at your Web traffic to find you. So by the time the 15th comes around, you get a lot of biters. A lot of people who didn&#39;t see the originals telling op he was scum, so they perceive it to be a real thing. Meanwhile, people who find it funny start contributing. Hard to say it&#39;s a right wing conspiracy when you step back and see how anon forums function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are dodging the point. many people feel that genocide and hate speech etc should be exceptions to protected free speech. they believe we should no longer recognize racism and bigotry as political statements but rather as violence. </p>

<p>and that&#39;s like <em>as far as it goes</em>  There is no &quot;well then what&#39;s next to go away?&quot; the answer is nothing. That&#39;s literally it. If your message is nothing more than &quot;I want people to die&quot; then you don&#39;t have a message worth discussing. </p>

<p>You may think they are wrong or that they are right, and strong arguments can be made for both sides. But there are also many people that call the people I described &quot;just as bad as Nazis&quot; which you then dodged and pointed towards the 0.001% of people who are violent, who weren&#39;t even referenced in OP&#39;s statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the problem man.  Nobody has a right to physical harm anyone else.</p>

<p>The fact you Support that sort of action shows that you DON&#39;T Support free speech or the rule of law.  When you start pushing society away from being civil and towards being violent you better be real damn careful what you normalize.  This sort of normalization of violence in conjunction with political speech is EXACTLY how the Nazi party took power in Germany.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence_in_Germany_(1918%E2%80%9333)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence_in_Germany_(1918–33)</a></p>

<p>So if you think antifa is guaranteed to win, you might actually pave the way for real Nazis or something far worse that the world has never known to take advantage of the chaos and your worst nightmare become reality.</p>

<p>Personally I would prefer that we stay civil and use our words.  Let&#39;s leave political violence where it belongs, in the history books associated with Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that you realize that violent oppression of political speech is what the climate was in the Weimar republic before it changed its name to Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>Oh it only goes so far as to redefine problematic ideologies as violence and make content-based restrictions on free speech?? </p>

<p>Firstly, genocide isn&#39;t speech so why you included that in your sentence escapes my understanding.  Secondly &quot;hate speech&quot; and &quot;free speech&quot; can not both exist in the same frame.  As Soon as you prohibit hate speech, then you have a multitude of groups lobbying to define what hate speech is so they can exclude themselves from criticism.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s assume we get a law passed that makes hate speech a felony punishable with 10 years in prison.  Okay then someone successfully argues in court that political speech against patriarchal white men is hate speech.</p>

<p>Congrats you just nuked your own ideology.</p>

<p>Then someone argues that speech against the wealthy is hate speech.</p>

<p>Boom! No more we are the 99% talk, no more criticisms of your boss or the CEO of company-X.</p>

<p>People really have no idea how dangerous hate speech laws are, where actual hate speech tends to just get laughed off stage.</p>

<p>Hate speech laws have been on the books for years in many countries (France, Germany, etc.). They may be cumbersome to interpret and enforce, but they haven&#39;t lead to widespread censorship or societal collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize that the Nazis marched on Charlottesville with their faces shown and we&#39;re doxxed, which makes sense right?

<p>This shit is cyclical.</p>

<p>The group that hides their identity to commit faceless violence will always be the more dangerous group in my opinion because they are the closest representative to a police state that I&#39;ve seen in a long long time. It&#39;s just weird seeing violent protestors praised by everyone since they are fighting another group of violent jackasses. I thought our country would have been above this stuff honestly, it&#39;s making us seem like a wartorn middle Eastern country.</p>

<p>Why is it so impossible to disavow both groups since they are violent? Why can&#39;t we hate both and be cool with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that is because they&#39;ve watched Antifa violence since the inauguration and this last event has been the first jumping off point of actual Nazis, until Charlottesville they&#39;ve only compared the conservativea to Nazis.</p>

<p>Most of us have watched every single YouTube video, the bike lock, burning of free speech signs, openly pepper spraying, sucker punching anyone with a Maga hat, and even to the point of throwing their own body fluids. We&#39;ve watched the brawls and until Charlottesville, it was only Trumpers vs. Antifa.</p>

<p>This is why there are hundreds of hyberbolic Antifa violence videos online, because it has been happening.</p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s the time to talk about Nazis, but Antifa hasn&#39;t really been talked about much besides praising them for being &#39;counter protestors&#39;. The fact they are getting praise is why you&#39;re seeing the backlash, not the fact they are trying to defend Nazis. The real right hates the media more than they hate Antifa, because the media fanned the flames for both.</p>

<p>They are two sides of a coin now, whether we like to admit it or not. They have attempted to wrap the entire country in their ideologies and are willing to take it by force. So yes, fuck both of them equally and eternally.</p>

<p>ok... stop yourself right here. Where is teh context for this? You watched a bunch of videos - got it. But how representative is what you&#39;re watching of actual real life? I can go right now and look up all the videos I can find about Nazis, and I will probably walk away believing nazis are a bigger deal than they really are. Does it mean that nazis became a bigger deal while I watched the video? </p>

<p>You need to offer some sort of data or context to support the argument that it&#39;s an actual problem, or to what degree of a problem it is. Not just &quot;I watched videos on youtube&quot; </p>

<p>Well, you raise a good point as well, because during the election night and the week after. Do you remember the sudden rise in hate crimes? Did you wait around to see how many were proven false? Guess who didn&#39;t correct their articles or stories? This is why I have trust issues towards Antifa, because they are willing to spray swastikas badly anywhere to justify their presence, or there will always be masked ones in the group who will. It&#39;s hard to trust the media&#39;s read on this situation, so it leads me to look at youtube videos, trashy articles, 4chan, scientific journals, diving into the fine print of legal documents and all sorts of asinine shit to try and understand why my southern reality (WHICH SHOULD BE INFESTED WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS, but they couldn&#39;t even get a protest started here, they tried and fuck we have the highest numbers of KKK members here too) doesn&#39;t match up with social media, the news, and the one website I&#39;ve been using for over four years.</p>

<p>No, but it gives a more apt description of their actions besides listening to the MSM, which I&#39;ll do just to cover my tracks. I watch both now, since I cannot trust social media, national news, and even our own government to disseminate information to the people anymore.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t my real life because I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead in a neo-nazi protest on either side. And I don&#39;t care how delusional you believe me to be, it&#39;s not worth losing my career just to be misidentified as a facist for not huffing the fumes of a bandana clad group of pissed off college kids.</p>

<p>The problem is the fact that the american people have no way to be informed over what the fuck is really happening at these protests, we are expected to choose a side and fucking root for one or the other without an apt description of what is actually taking place. We are left to our hysterics, which in turn will lead to more violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel like we need people who are just completely near anti-government on both sides to come together and play watchdog over these protest. Film them for the masses, report on them, get interviews.</p>

<p>I would almost say get a group of people here, on all sides. Working towards actually delivering a truth or some semblance of what is happening and who is directing these groups. Like a pirate media thing in the vein of Libertatia dedicated to stopping oppression, government or otherwise. Let&#39;s take the absolute shitheeliest of each side and have em work together to accurately depict the events, and then we will be blasted by both sides every protest. We might have more info to go off of though.</p>

<p>countless laws in this country have specific &quot;this is how and where the line is drawn&quot; precedent regarding all sorts of things. Every single one of them we could have the same argument that we need to remove that line altogether because &quot;it&#39;s a slippery slope&quot; yet you would seem absolutely insane and get no attention for saying that, because you can&#39;t operate under ridiculous absolutes like that. Practicality and reason have to be used to establish clear boundaries where one person&#39;s rights end and another&#39;s begin. It&#39;s not always perfect but in no way has it succumb to the &quot;slippery slope&quot;  It&#39;s very rare to overturn such precedents. We update the limits on where free speech ends and someone else&#39;s rights begin, and we don&#39;t take it lightly. It&#39;s been 250 years, and it will be a long time again before there is any need to update it. This isn&#39;t a descent into chaos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whelp, first you have to use words accurately and not hyperbolically.</p>

<p>nazis with a capital n, were members of of a now defunct, authoritarian, racial-purity, corporatist (i.e. facist) political party in germany in the early to mid-20th century. they were built on a a well established prussian mindset that predominated germany for a century. a mindset that only the wealthy in our country have every praised and attempted to implement here, without much success, other than our prussian-modeled, factory-based instuitional public education system that teaches people to come and go with bells, sit in rows, and perform tasks in a proscribed way.</p>

<p>nazi with a lower case n, is a colloquial slur for people who unapologetically espouse racist, biggotted, sexist beliefs, who typically vote republican and typically are staunch supporters of 2nd amendment, who may or may not advocate for racial purity and/or racial apartheid, who may or may not associate themselves with swatiskas, and who may or may not associate themselves with the confederacy. while they typically support strict deportation of illegal imigrants and immigration law enforcement, along with rigid borders, what they are calling for is actually the current law, bipartisanly passed and enforced. none are calling for genocide AFAIK. they are typically small govt proponents and live in terror of being enslaved by the state. they typically see the govt as their enemy and take it to extreme heights by hording food and weapons.</p>

<p>it is a misnomer to call these people facists and nazis (even if they style themselves as neo-nazis).</p>

<p>facism is the political merger of the state and corporate (special) interests, creating bundle of power and wealth for the benefit of both. citizens in facists states are viewed as sticks to be bound together in a faces. their sole purpose is to further the goals of those bundling the sticks (i.e. tying them up in faces).</p>

<p>the govt of the united states is facist. and has been for a very long time.</p>

<p>facists are those who believe that citizens exist solely for the benefit of the state. they see the idea of being a straight, sturdy stick within a bundle of straight, sturdy sticks as the duty of every citizen (except for the bundlers). they see those who refuse to be sticks or whom they view as crooked, weak sticks as existential enemies. for facists, the greatest threat is always from within. wars are waged to keep the sticks tightly bound, not because the opponents are percieved as exsistential threats.</p>

<p>almost everyone in power in the united states, officially or unofficially, is a facist.</p>

<p>almost no one without power in the united states is a facist. those you call nazis have no anticedent in european history. they are uniquely american as their greatest fear is being a bound up stick. this is true of all of us. one can be a hateful, ignorant, POS sons of bitches without being a nazi or a facist. if you truly wish to counter them, calling them hateful, ignorant, OOS sons of bitches is more effective than using a lazy, inaccurate trigger word, chosen solely to trigger.</p>

<p>racism and bigotry are tools of facist govts, as are patriotism, the police, the military, media, and centralization, but only the last four are requiste. racism is neither necessary nor sufficient for facism. and it is as american as apple pie. focusing on ZOMG!!! NAZIS!!!! is a way for those uncomfortable with this fact from disowning it. hitler learned from us, we didn&#39;t and aren&#39;t learning from him.</p>

<p>every brick in the beloved UVA quad was not only laid by slaves, but made by slaves, who were owned by the president who owned more slaves than any other and who ranks up there with the largest slave holders in our history, who employed the most notoriously vicious foreman of his time, so much so that it made his peers uncomfortable, who refused to free them on his death, and condemned them and their descendents  to 3/5ths personhood. if you haven&#39;t been, the slaves quarters at monticello are always a highlight of the tour.</p>

<p>c&#39;ville is a rigidly segregated town. UVA students are predominantly white, upper middle class, legacy kids, with next to no minority classmates or friends. they are terrified of richmond. </p>

<p>what&#39;s evil is using the caricature of racism in america to feel self-righteous and absolve yourself from the sin of your own racism. go march to pull down the quad, monticello, and jefferson&#39;s statue, and those same kids fighting against &quot;nazis&quot; are going to turn on you, they will make every apology for TJ, they will accuse you of erasing history and not judging people by their own time. if you call them racists, facists, nazis, they will scream godwin&#39;s rule. and should you so much as spit on TJ&#39;s toe, they will beat the living shit out of you, while a crowd cheers on, and the police will look the other way.</p>

<p>anyone who tries to control what can and cannot be thought, believed, or said, is tyrannt, mabe just a teeny one, but a tyrant nonetheless. you don&#39;t have to be a facist or a nazi to be tyrannical. just a self-righteous, entitled POS.</p>

<p>fuck antifa. as an anarchist i hate them for what they are doing to anarchism. they are returning us to the haymarket days and they aren&#39;t even fucking anarchists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty easy to understand this one, man. Hitler wanted to take all of the money from the Jews and give it to his people. He had the standard socialist mentality of the rich people were taking advantage of the common man.  Therefore he took control of all the Jewish banks and started up all kinds of social programs like free day care and free schooling. </p>

<p>I mean you do know he was ruler since 1933 and started the Nazi party in 1934, the war didn&#39;t start until he invaded Poland in 1939. Which he did because he wanted Poland to become part of his socialist Utopia and Poland said NO.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of this</p>

<p>Crap from the left lately. It&#39;s really lazy and doesn&#39;t hurt my feelings at all, just makes you look super closed minded. Next time I suggest go through my comment history and find some dirt about me there. Make a real insult, instead of being lazy, as socialists are so known to be.</p>

<p>I hope you go read some history and try and prove me wrong instead of being such a tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mechanism could be simpler, without the need for a puppet master. In Sweden, antifa has been around for a long time, but for the longest time they wrestled with a serious problem: They identified as &quot;nazi-hunters&quot;, but there were no nazis in Sweden to hunt. I mean, sure, there was old Hans, but hunting him was getting old. So what they did was to become ever more &quot;liberal&quot; in their definition of nazis, until anyone right of center became fair pray (via exactly the same &quot;you provide cover for nazis by being right-wing, that makes you nazis!&quot; logic as you see applied against Trump supporters in the US). Generally, they were seen with disdain, although slightly less disdain than nazis because &quot;at least antifa hate nazis&quot;. Finally, with the refugee crisis, some actual immigration skeptics dared voice timid concern - not actually being nazis, of course, but close enough! Oh, how antifa rejoiced. Finally the <em>real</em> hunt was back on the menu. And with more immigrants came more critics, and antifa grew. At this point, with the country concerned about the rise of the horrible nazis, antifa could even go back to beating up old Hans to the cheers of a nation (Hans represents the thousand or so real nazis that always exist in pretty much any western country). Funnily enough, that also gained Hans some sympathy so amazingly, actual nazis started gaining some tolerance. All the better for antifa, more prey for the hunt and more good press when they hunted. That&#39;s where Sweden is currently, with nazis and antifa growing each other in symbiosis. Sure, clever puppet masters might have set the spiral off (e.g. with immigration) but I think what we see here is a feedback loop that doesn&#39;t need external coordination. But the point to remember is that antifa are the only ones who <em>need</em> nazis to exist - it is their whole raison d&#39;etre, and Sweden is full of examples of them actually manufacturing nazism (including false flags) to give the impression that they are important and good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If modernism is the age of reason, then postmodernism describes a movement away from reason.</p>

<p>Instead, &quot;it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or <em>political</em> discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed.&quot; (Emphasis mine)</p>

<p>Feelings are more important than reality; it is closely related to cultural Marxism, a term you scoffed at.</p>

<p>A symptom of postmodernism is identity politics, &quot;a tendency for people of a particular religion, race, social background, etc., to form exclusive political alliances, moving away from traditional broad-based party politics.&quot;</p>
