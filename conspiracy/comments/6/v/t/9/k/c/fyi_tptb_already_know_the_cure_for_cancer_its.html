       That's a proven fact. Research it on Google. Dozens of articles Proving it. Too many to list.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why both of these Cures are BANNED in USA. Who do you think Banned them? Satanic Pharma.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the biggest scam in America. That's how your Doctors can afford Porsches, Mercedes, Bentleys and Rolls Royces. Ask yourself where the fuck did they get all that money? By scamming poor people, poor patients out of their life savings.
      </p>
      <p>
       These Doctors are Pure Evil. Pure Refined Evil. They make Doctor Mengele look like an Angel.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is The Scam of the Century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry: Drain The Swamp (DTS) also applies not only to Politicians but also Doctors. In fact Doctors are more evil than Politicians. Politicians just swindle generic government funds, but Doctors make billions off of the misery of poor people, and sick patients; Doctors Milk their Misery, for Money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, they will all be Purged in the flaming fires of Hell. (DTS)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Evil Pharma Shills have now been triggered and are coming out of the woodwork like rats and roaches to Downvote and Suppress the Truth about a NATURAL Cancer Cure like Hemp Oil, B17, and Cannabinoids..
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the massive Shill Pushback. That tells you Everything you need to know. They want to keep the Sheeple stupid so they can continue to rake in that sweet sweet Pharma Cash Money.

       Buy a bag of apricot kernels and a bag of help marijuana Cannabinoids. Both will cure many pathogens and illnesses including cancer. You need to go on a Vegan Alkaline diet. Stop eating sugary sweets, you need to Starve out the carcinogenic cells.

       then why does wiki state you can get cyanide poisoning from apricot kernels?

       <p>
        Apricot kernels can cause cyanide poisoning when consumed, which can be deadly. Other symptoms include nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, increased thirst, lethargy, nervousness, various aches and pains in joints and muscles, and a drop in blood pressure.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or “ARfD”) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA’s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel.

       You might have a death wish or are willing to let others risk themselves - but I am not, dumbass.  You don't know if the person eating them is eating cyanide from other sources at the same time, thereby bringing you closer to the lowest reported lethal dose.

       Did you know that chocolate is also poisonous? Might as well never eat chocolate ever again since you have "an aversion to eating poison".
      </p>
      <p>
       OR you can educate yourself.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chocolate contains a substance called theobromine, which is similar to caffeine. In large amounts, theobromine can be toxic for both dogs
        <strong>
         and humans
        </strong>
        ; however toxicity is very rare in people even when very large quantities of chocolate are consumed. Dogs metabolise, or break down, theobromine much more slowly than humans.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But I'm gonna guess you are going to reply with: " but chocolate is different" when it's actually not.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea, lets agree to disagree. I'll rather read up on the why's and how's when it comes to stuff like this instead of going on something from a history book and never read about it ever again.

       <p>
        Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it  into D-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (cyanide); while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, D-glucose, and ammonia.[18]

       Yeah the science on this seems to be complex and easy to confuse people over. I note that the EFSA website has an article warning about apricot seeds, but then goes on to talk about cyanide in isolate, disregarding the fact that the cyanide in the seed is part of a molecule that may or may not break down directly into the type of cyanide (anion) that kills you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the key fact:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion by the action of a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Note the use of "can be released" (not "will be released") and also that it requires the action of beta-glucosidase.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this next article goes on to explain how the action of beta-glucosidase happens, and why apricot seeds target cancer without poisoning you:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/b17-laetrile-alternative-cancer-treatment-suppressed-50-years/">
        https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/b17-laetrile-alternative-cancer-treatment-suppressed-50-years/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have things like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery, and as "the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's the quack attack. Whenever I see this I roll my eyes at whoever is talking, because they are not being scientific. So what about chemo? Chemo is poisonous, not guaranteed, and can kill people. It could be said chemo is the most sophisticated quack cancer treatment out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing worth mentioning is, don't you think the government would do something to prevent or shut down websites instructing people to ingest poison and kill themselves because it might be a cure? Do you think they'd allow these "Charles Manson" and "Doctor Kevorkian" types to be writing death sentences to desperate people online?
      </p>
      <p>
       This leaves me with an unsavory conclusion. The only way to know if it kills cancer or kills you is to try it. And that's a scary thought. It's such a scary thought most people won't even attempt it. And this is where there might be a conspiracy.

       Can in some circumstances be poisonous + does nothing = we probably shouldn't give this to people
      </p>

       There's no conspiracy in making sure that the people you test medication on don't die.

      <p>
       There's literally an amendment to the constitution that prevents the government from doing that. They can prosecute for endangerment afterwards but not shut down websites. (This is what they do)

       Oh wait.. You can't quote me on that since I never said such thing. You are simply just trying to throw words in my mouth so you can strengthen your ad hominem arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you trying your hardest in this thread again? There are less people you haven't replied to than people you have. What is your motive? Your motive is to imply my motives? Cheap.. You don't even fit on this sub.

       I'm asking for sources. If you can't provide them, either you are to lazy to argue your point, or you don't actually trust your sources. This is debating 101, you must provide evidence when you make a claim, otherwise it is worthless

       I did that. The first article is from EFSA, which has basically suffered tremendous science lobbying and regulatory capture. A report found that 60% of EFSA's "experts" were rife with conflict of interest, having direct or indirect ties to the food and feed industry.

       So it would appear your Google search for "Apricot Kernels Cyanide" does in fact take you straight to Big Pharma propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, whether or not apricot seeds will cure cancer or kill you, I do not know. It appears there are many types of apricot seeds, which means there could be a lot of "sugar pills" or "bad apples" out there, it is said the more bitter ones are what you're after. A drug based on this was developed called latriole, which still seems to be in use today in some parts of the world. It is hard to find more than anecdotal evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I understand it is how the cyanide is present in the seeds, it's not the same as taking straight cyanide. Your body carries an inhibitor that will make this cyanide "non-poisonous" to your normal cells, but cancer cells do not have this inhibitor so the cyanide works to attack the cancer cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all I'd say this is an interesting topic definitely worth more research/study.

       Ketogenic diet has also shown lots of promise as well. I think the issue with meat and animal fat is mostly to do with the way it's raised. Animal products are not inherently bad for us, we evolved eating them.

       While certainly having a high fat content in your nutritional intake is very important, there is indeed some scientific evidence for red meat being carcinogenic:

       Because that type of meat contains a sugar molecule - Neu5Gc - which is not natural to the human body and causes inflammation when the organism tries to process that sugar.

       Very interesting, will review! Keto prescribes pretty moderate levels of proteins though, around 20% of calories, and it doesn't have to come from red meat (although I love for it to)

       How? Cancer cells get their energy from glucose, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well glucose is vital for our bodies to function. You literally die if it drops too low. Even if you eat absolutely nothing for several days, your body will break tissues down to maintain a minimum glucose level. Even if you avoid sugars and carbohydrates entirely, your body will maintain a minimum blood sugar level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer cells always have energy. If other cells in the body are getting nourishment, cancer cells are getting nourishment.

       Maybe this can prevent but if you have cancer this doesnt work to get rid of it. I know multiple people that tried this and it failed. So not only did they have to suffer the cancer they also couldnt enjoy food.

       in the pit of a few fruits you can find cyanide.  Peaches and I think apples have this attribute...

      <p>
       from apricot kernel wiki:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Apricot kernels can cause cyanide poisoning when consumed, which can be deadly. Other symptoms include nausea, fever, headaches, insomnia, increased thirst, lethargy, nervousness, various aches and pains in joints and muscles, and a drop in blood pressure.

       I've eaten those since I was a kid. We had 3 apricot trees in my yard. as a kid, i would find all the ones fallen to the ground, take them home, sit on the ground put the seeds all around me (20 -30) crack them one by one with this mini hammer i had, and eat them in one setting. Im just fine. I still eat them when i can, but not as much as i used to when I was a kid. so, no... it won't kill you. I call bullshit.

       I've eaten those since I was a kid. We had 3 apricot trees in my yard. as a kid, i would find all the ones fallen to the ground, take them home, sit on the ground put the seeds all around me (20 -30) crack them one by one with this mini hammer i had, and eat them in one setting. Im just fine. I still eat them when i can, but not as much as i used to when I was a kid. so, no... it won't kill you. I call bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been eating like 5 a day since my work started brining them to the kitchen. so goooood

       They taste like nothing else. Have their own distinct taste.  I love it.  It's bitter sweet. Remember,  you have to Crack the seed to get to the nut. Don't chew the seed lol. I put them in a paper towel and hammer lightly. (I actually use my 5 year award thing they gave me at work.lol) If you don't have them in a towel,  they shoot to the side and you end up wasting them.

       Whaddya know, we got the logical fallacy fallacy! This assumes that someone's argument is invalid, simply because they used a logical fallacy! It keeps going on, too - for example, if this post assumed your argument was wrong because of this fallacy, it would be a logical fallacy fallacy fallacy!

       I dunno. Hell if I'd want to be the cancer patient who for goes his doctor's advice and just eats hemp oil and apricot seeds to prove "the man" wrong. I'd be a bit scared and besides apricot stones are hard to swallow, I'd imagine. Maybe if I was terminal, though. Any shot is worth it when it's a last shot.

       Why would the entire medical community be in on a hoax? That seems hard to orchestrate. Not saying the things you claim don't have some sort of health benefits. I mean there are studies showing the benefits of a vegan diet. In saying that personally, it's be nervous to go against my doctor's advice and just eat apricot stones and hemp oil, but like I said before maybe as a last ditch effort. I'm sure there would be terminal patients willing to give this a go. They could study them. The cyanide that the other commenter mentioned, though...

       Why? It's all about the fucking money. If Pharma cured cancer today they would lose billions and billions. How else do you think they live lavish lifestyles with Porsches and Bentleys? On the back of poor people and patients they scam out of their life savings on expensive bullshit drugs.

       I think you are forgetting that cancer is being researched all over the globe by thousands of scientists. It would be impossible to hide something like this. If one of these doctors came out tomorrow with a cure for cancer he would be the richest man alive in a few days ..sadly we have no miracle cure

       Scientist here. Every single scientist that would face censorship of a cancer cure would go directly to the medias and try to stir shit up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that thinks that the scientific community is in on a conspiracy is wrong beyond comprehension. The vast majority of scientists are underpaid and overworked, we're not getting mad money to make shit up. The main driving force is trying to make the world a better place. Having a cancer cure under your belt is  also guaranteed to make your career. Absolutely nobody is going to slave away for shit pay and then not publish a cancer cure because they get money, since they could get more money, fame, international recognition and same millions of lives by publishing it.

       I personally know a doctor that genuinely cares about her patients. She also is very into natural cures (vitamins, herbs, etc.). She treats children with autism (and similar issues).

       She was fired from a large firm years ago. Now she owns her own private practice.

       I don't claim to know enough to say that apricot pits + hemp oil will cure cancer, but you wouldn't have to get every single doctor to willingly participate in the hoax. If they learn in school that natural cures are bullshit, and only pharmaceuticals or chemo can help, they'll be pushing the agenda without actively knowing it.

       I didn't go to medical school so I don't know if they all teach that natural cures are bullshit or not, but I'm sure there are enough terminal patients that might be willing to be part of a study to test the accuracy of op's claim. It's been erased from the post, but op originally made a claim that these natural cures would starve the cancer to death, which seems fishy to me since cancer doesn't eat... But, really I have no idea since I'm not a doctor. All I initially said would that id be a bit scared to go against medical advice to test this out unless maybe I was terminal and had nothing else to lose.

       I just went to medical news today and it said that it is estimated that eating 50-60 apricot stones a day would deliver a lethal dose of cyanide, but also recommends that cancer patients eat up to 60 stones a day to cure cancer. Seems odd and dangerous to me, but to each his own, I guess.

       I suggest you educate yourself a bit about cyanide with the following video.

       Also you can safely consume a few of those apricot kernels with no problem. Stop fear mongering.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Studies indicate 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams (mg) cyanide per kilogram of body weight can be lethal. EFSA’s Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain set a safe level for a one-off exposure (known as the Acute Reference Dose, or “ARfD”) of 20 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. This is 25 times below the lowest reported lethal dose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on these limits and the amounts of amygdalin typically present in raw apricot kernels, EFSA’s experts estimate that adults could consume three small apricot kernels (370mg), without exceeding the ARfD. For toddlers the amount would be 60mg which is about half of one small kernel.

       How am I fear mongering? I was simply pointing out something another commenter stated. I never made any claims to the amount of cyanide that is needed to ingest to kill a person. Also, the quoted text you provide states that a human can consume only three small stones and a toddler only one half. Not sure how a toddler is only going to swallow one half of a whole stone. Regardless, that's not a lot for anyone. I'm guessing you probably need more than that small amount in this supposed cancer cure, but I digress that I have no real idea.

       So drinking the whole glass wouldn't have given him some sort of cyanide poisoning? He said he had some ill effects from just the sip he took. I'm not sure what the point of the video was. Did anyone say that any amount of cyanide would kill you? I know I never made that claim. Like I said in another comment, according to medical news today, 50-60 stones would deliver a lethal dose, but at the same time it is recommended that cancer patients consume up to 60 stones a day. Just seems dangerous to me. I'll stick to my belief that a majority of the medical community wants to actually help patients and follow their advice if I have cancer until I'm terminal, then maybe I'd go for any last ditch efforts. K? Thanks!

        trillion

       Die faster??? How about dragging it out for as long as they can. They won't give you the 'cure' but they won't let you die either. They will keep you sick.

       Doctors aren't evil; they're products of the education they receive.  Medical school focuses on pharmaceutical solutions and the potential interactions which would result in malpractice lawsuits of prescribing those same drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no wonder doctors have become pill pushers because that is the focus of the training and knowledge doctors receive by default.  They need to show initiative to expand their toolset beyond pills and not all of them do.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr:  Doctors are a product of their training; they're not evil.

       I have eaten apricot kernels with no detrimental effects.

       They are NATURAL apricot seeds with trace amounts of cyanide that bonds with tumor cells and causes cell death.

       It will not harm healthy cells because the cellular receptor is different and will not hind to them.

       The process you are describing does not occur. The cyanide group is liberated upon initial ingestion of amygladin because it enters a metabolic pathway aimed at processing similar molecules. There is no binding and then unbinding. That's just not how your body works.

       To all the uneducated people in this thread that read the word "cyanide" and go all crazy that it's a poisonous chemical. I suggest you educate yourself a bit about cyanide with the following video.

       Cyanide is lethal when you consume about 300 milligrams of it, which is a lot.

       Sure, you can consume a small amount of most things once and be totally fine. Heck, Cody has a box full of uranium that he gets out every not and then and its to no ill effect. The issue I have with this is this guy is promoting taking an unknown amount of cyanide on what I assume to be at least a semi regular basis. Notice that even with a small amount of cyanide Cody experienced some symptoms. That's because no matter how much cyanide you take, your etc is gonna be affected to an extent. Neurons in your hippocampus for example are fairly sensitive to anoxia environments and therefore a lack of atp. You might get away with it a few times, but if you start chronically depriving sensitive cells there will be an effect even if it doesn't necessarily kill you.

       Wow. My uncle had aggressive lung cancer that spread to his spinal column, we did everything. Every weird thing out there that claimed to cure cancer. All the research. Read every book. Spent ass loads of money in other countries. Bought herbs and supplements and produced our own pills. Stem cells. Bacterial therapies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know he used cannabis oil, but can't remember if he did the B17/apricot kernels.
      </p>
      <p>
       We bought him a few extra years, but he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even want to look into it. If we missed that and it actually is THE thing that works, that would make me feel much regret.

       Some people will believe anything if the word "conspiracy" is associated with it. Any idiot can make a website full of lies and fake "evidence" and people will link to it. Just look at all the recent stuff about the eclipse being a fake conspiracy. Things are getting ridiculous.

       I'm gonna be optimistic here and hope this is just a troll. In any event this is so far off base it's not even funny. The fundemntal principle of cancer biology that you don't understand is that cancer is a many headed hydra, and the "cure" for cancer likely does not exist. I say likely because CRISPR editing of cytoxic T cells and other immunological therapies show some promise. The simple reason for this is any number of cell regulatory systems can fail resulting in cancer. The down regulation of growth inhibitors and the up regulation of growth factors provide a basic mechanism for cancers genesis, but other mutations must occur to circumvent the immune system and other processes which would stymie it. My point here being that some half cocked concoction will not sufficiently affect the multiple mechanisms required for cancer formation.

       Furthermore, it is an objective and verifiable fact the vitamin b17 contains a cyanide group on it which will be released during metabolism via beta glucosidase. This action can be understood by anyone with any experience in biochemistry, and will cause inevitably bad things to occur. So this cute you're pedaling is a poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a biologist and researcher in Biology who is looking to be a physician so I am one of the evil ones you're talking about. I doubt you'll take me seriously, but I implore you to delete this as your advice has potential for harm and no basis in science. While big pharma may not always be scrupulous, the truth of the matter is that cancer has the upper hand for now, and there is no easy cure available that is somehow being repressed.

       You might have a death wish or are willing to let others risk themselves - but I am not, dumbass.  You don't know if the person eating them is eating cyanide from other sources at the same time, thereby bringing you closer to the lowest reported lethal dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why risk it?  Why so energized for this?  Why so emotional over it?
