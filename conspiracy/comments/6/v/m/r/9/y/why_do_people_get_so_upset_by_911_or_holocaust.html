<p>d and guarded since the end of WWII at Arolsen, Germany, the Official IRC records reveal the actual Concentration Camp total death toll was 271,301
For years, people around the world – “the West” in particular – have been told that “six million Jews were systematically murdered by Germans in ‘Concentration Camps’ during World War 2.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jew here. Its people who cant have a open mind. Example.. i believe Hitler killed Jews,poles,gypsies,russians etc. i know Jews were definitely targeted. That said i do not think the number was 6 million. I get hate for that but it was possible to be honest. It was a horrible thing but people get hung up on a number. If it was 1 child it sucks. As for 9/11 no one wants to think .gov did or allowed it but to me 9/11 is the biggest load of bullshit ive ever been fed to believe. Its truly not believeable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently become really interested in this topic, but the road to exploring it is pretty fraught with dodgy data and theories (and, of course, some virulent racists). </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone believes the number is exactly 6 million. I mean, that would be very silly indeed. But what is the hypothesis put forward by people who disagree with the mainstream view, and what is its basis? Is there any agreement among those with alternative hypotheses (other than &quot;it&#39;s not 6 million&quot;), or do they vary wildly as well?</p>

<p>Sorry, I realise you probably don&#39;t personally have answers to these questions. Just thinking out loud I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While having an open mind about history is important, it is also important to point out that anyone who claims that WWII genocideS  never took place at all is an ASS. </p>

<p>Yes, there were camps, yes people were worked to death or shot or gassed and then burned or buried. And yes, thousands of your grandfathers or great uncles saw the camps and the dead with their own eyes and cameras.</p>

<p>Finally, yes, some people have pushed these historic facts on us in a coordinated P.R. campaign to bring awareness to the issue of genocide while also creating a system of guilt that delivers benefits to a small group of people who are allowed to break international law  and commit war crimes in order to guarantee &quot;NEVER AGAIN&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never understood the logic behind the &quot;staging&quot; of these crimes.  Whether 9/11, Sandy Hook, or any other mass-murder.  The people running the show have shown countless times throughout history that they will happily kill thousands or millions of people if it earns them a dime or advances their agenda 1 inch.  It doesn&#39;t make sense that they would hoax one of the events when a hoax could potentially be exposed while actually killing people off would further their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people actually die, such as in 9/11, the relatives of the deceased are relentless in uncovering the truth. No deaths means much less backlash to worry about for TPTB. If you want proof that Sandy Hook was staged, watch Sandy Hook Line &amp; Sinker on YouTube. Also, Ole Dammegard&#39;s recent appearance on The Higherside Chats &quot;Staged Terror: Manchester, London, Charlottesville, Barcelona&quot;  is well worth listening to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off topic but this reminds me of a while back, I mentioned gamergate to a friend and he immediately went &quot;oh crap not that bullshit. its a harassment campaign.&quot; Now I was never a part of it but I followed it, it was intriguing, I like internet drama. Anyways I began tp break down what he thought he knew about it until he admitted he was wrong and admitted he made a decision based on mostly nothing (and by nothing i mean only kotaku). People seem to just swallow everything some authority tells them, I am not exempt. From birth we are told to listen to and respect authority. Some people never move past this, or only question things in a superficial manner.</p>
