       I don't agree with a lot of people but I like to hear all sides. Why do people get so angry? Almost everyone agrees that the Nazis were bad, some don't agree on the number of people they killed. Why is that upsetting? I really don't understand it at all.

       Because it's pretty Earth shattering if true. No one likes to have their reality get completely warped. Think about the scale of 9/11 man. If it was truly a hoax, then just think about that; 3,000 people killed (supposedly) in a false flag, ritualistic, pre-planned attack by our own government.

       Think about the even bigger scale of the holocaust. If even a little bit of crucial details are discovered to be fabricated or exaggerated, imagine the kind of doubt that would be cast on everything that's been done in its name since then. People still use it to this day as justification for things.

       d and guarded since the end of WWII at Arolsen, Germany, the Official IRC records reveal the actual Concentration Camp total death toll was 271,301
For years, people around the world – “the West” in particular – have been told that “six million Jews were systematically murdered by Germans in ‘Concentration Camps’ during World War 2.”

       Jew here. Its people who cant have a open mind. Example.. i believe Hitler killed Jews,poles,gypsies,russians etc. i know Jews were definitely targeted. That said i do not think the number was 6 million. I get hate for that but it was possible to be honest. It was a horrible thing but people get hung up on a number. If it was 1 child it sucks. As for 9/11 no one wants to think .gov did or allowed it but to me 9/11 is the biggest load of bullshit ive ever been fed to believe. Its truly not believeable.

       My favorite piece of info to drop on people to change their 9/11 view point is WTC 7. A LOT of people are completely unaware that a 3rd tower fell. Then you show them the footage next to a controlled demo and watch their eyes go wide.

       I've recently become really interested in this topic, but the road to exploring it is pretty fraught with dodgy data and theories (and, of course, some virulent racists).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think anyone believes the number is exactly 6 million. I mean, that would be very silly indeed. But what is the hypothesis put forward by people who disagree with the mainstream view, and what is its basis? Is there any agreement among those with alternative hypotheses (other than "it's not 6 million"), or do they vary wildly as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, I realise you probably don't personally have answers to these questions. Just thinking out loud I guess.

       Well.. like i dont wanna demean any of my people who lived thru it or had a loved one live thru. It was a horrible terrible time but facts exist too. And factually todays modern cremation couldnt keep up with 6 million people. I really hate even debunking it but that number even counting non jews simply isnt possible.

       While having an open mind about history is important, it is also important to point out that anyone who claims that WWII genocideS  never took place at all is an ASS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there were camps, yes people were worked to death or shot or gassed and then burned or buried. And yes, thousands of your grandfathers or great uncles saw the camps and the dead with their own eyes and cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, yes, some people have pushed these historic facts on us in a coordinated P.R. campaign to bring awareness to the issue of genocide while also creating a system of guilt that delivers benefits to a small group of people who are allowed to break international law  and commit war crimes in order to guarantee "NEVER AGAIN".

       Perdidas is one of the people OP is talking about.

       He got his panties in a twist because he realized that and tried his very best to attack OP as a defensive mechanism.

       He's offended, so he makes up what he thinks is a good analogy, but comes up with one that just reflects his inner turmoil.

       It clashes with their world view. 
All of us are brought up with the idea that our country or people could do no wrong. Some gradually start to question that while the others feel a sense of belonging and glory to believe in the mainstream conspiracy theories.

       You think people are sitting there actively accepting the fact that their government lies to them, and they enjoy knowing that?  No, they just don't think the government is humanly capable of doing these things, they have never been shown 1000 examples of governments doing horrible shit, especially not ours, so why would they believe that 9/11, arguably the "most horrible shit", was done by the government.

       I never understood the logic behind the "staging" of these crimes.  Whether 9/11, Sandy Hook, or any other mass-murder.  The people running the show have shown countless times throughout history that they will happily kill thousands or millions of people if it earns them a dime or advances their agenda 1 inch.  It doesn't make sense that they would hoax one of the events when a hoax could potentially be exposed while actually killing people off would further their agenda.

       When people actually die, such as in 9/11, the relatives of the deceased are relentless in uncovering the truth. No deaths means much less backlash to worry about for TPTB. If you want proof that Sandy Hook was staged, watch Sandy Hook Line &amp; Sinker on YouTube. Also, Ole Dammegard's recent appearance on The Higherside Chats "Staged Terror: Manchester, London, Charlottesville, Barcelona"  is well worth listening to.

       Off topic but this reminds me of a while back, I mentioned gamergate to a friend and he immediately went "oh crap not that bullshit. its a harassment campaign." Now I was never a part of it but I followed it, it was intriguing, I like internet drama. Anyways I began tp break down what he thought he knew about it until he admitted he was wrong and admitted he made a decision based on mostly nothing (and by nothing i mean only kotaku). People seem to just swallow everything some authority tells them, I am not exempt. From birth we are told to listen to and respect authority. Some people never move past this, or only question things in a superficial manner.
