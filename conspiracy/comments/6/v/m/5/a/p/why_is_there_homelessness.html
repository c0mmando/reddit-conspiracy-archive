        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m wondering why there is homelessness?  There was one office building I worked in that was 75% empty for most of the ten years I worked there.  Other office buildings are similarly under occupied.  If you just assume conservatively that the tens if not hundreds of square feet of office space is almost always unoccupied then there should be shelter for a significant number of the homeless.  This would make it easier to get treatment for the addicted and mentally ill, would make it easier to make sure they are nourished etc.  They could do work for the local communities maybe for twenty hours a week.  It would be easy to craft legislation that would make the utilization of under occupied building space accessible for the homeless.  So why isn&#39;t it being done?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very ease to abuse and oppress the homeless, the more the merrier for the richest. Homeless people don&#39;t vote, and die early.</p>

<p>The national low income housing program was murdered by Nixon way back in 1970 when he stole the poverty funds and handed them out to his developer friends to use for their tax money stealing, &quot;urban renewal,&quot; projects.  </p>

<p>Urban renewal meaning remove public funded housing and replace it with pricey condos.</p>

<p>Then made permanent in the 1980s, with that lie, &quot;the tax subsidized free market will provide the housing.  </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t considered a failure that there is no housing for our poor, it was the goal and they don&#39;t even thank us for our tax money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just in the metropolitan area I live in there is almost 500 million square feet of commercial space with a vacancy rate of about 12%.  Multiply this by at least ten and there is 5 billion square feet of commercial space available in the US.  If we devoted just one percent of this space to the homeless we could take 100,000 people off the street considering they need 500 ft² of space.  You mean we can&#39;t even devote a measly one percent for the homeless?  Even when the vacancy rates are above 10%?</p>

<p>In A Christmas Story Scrooge says, &quot;Are there no prisons...union workhouses?&quot;</p>

<p>The short answer is we have not changed very much, we&#39;re still heartless sons-a-bitches. Doesn&#39;t matter what justification these idiots come up with. We&#39;ve entered the Vulture Capitalism stage in the decline of the United States because of the same Scrooge assholes: a fish rots from the head down. As we circle the drain, the cruelty will mount. As soon as you hit the skids you&#39;re not human anymore, you are a dispossessed &quot;thing&quot;. </p>

<p>We spend a Trillion Dollars a year as Israel&#39;s Golem, and pay them 3 Billion a year for the privilege. Detroit, poison water gets zip, nada.</p>

<p>The wealth is being extracted and given to the 1% by the Federal Reserve (which is neither). It&#39;s gonna get worse. Most of the money that could be used for homeless is going for head stomping goons and bombs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My profession dealt with Infrastructure and as soon as a major sports team&#39;s owner started whining that he was going to throw a tantrum the city backed down and we had to spend money for the infrastructure supporting his facilities.  We had a developer who actually made &#39;memorandum of agreement commitments&#39; but when he found out they were too expensive he somehow got out of doing them.  There had to be corruption because no developer would just do this on his own without some guarantee.</p>

<p>I worked with a lot of dispossessed &quot;things&quot; and most were high level.  The things they did were shameful and all to impress their bosses.  They had no problem stomping on colleagues who couldn&#39;t defend themselves.  I wonder what they tell their children when they get home from work.  &quot;Today I hurt a person who couldn&#39;t defend themselves&quot;.  </p>

Turns out, people are much more able and willing to sober up, etc when they have a stable home. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because we are not free we are only free to be slaves. the government has decided it owns what it did not create aka the land. It is not like the old times where people create their own homes on land that is unoccupied and create their own communities and survive off of local resources. We are all slaves with a limited degree of freedom given to us by government. The class structure was created to keep people at war with one another as they live in diffetrent level of comforts always at odds with one another without realizing the extent of their government enslavement. The police have arrested a girls parents because she was selling lemonade for 25 cents a cup with no business license and you wanna tell me we are fucking free? rflmao free to be slaves. The nature of the enslavement has shifted but the goal remains the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It used to be a crime, vagrancy, now society lets them camp. Check out Skid Row in LA its a huge tent city. If they are mentally ill they should be forced to take their meds. Addicted? 30 days in solitary cures all addictions.</p>

<p>I am sick of having to dodge hobo feces and needles on my walk to work to one of my three jobs. I pay taxes so they don&#39;t have to, they can mooch off me. I stayed away from addictive drugs and moderated my drinking and kept a good credit rating. Now I am being punished for being responsible and have to pay for the bums who lived a reckless life. </p>

<p>To answer your question most office building are zoned for commercial you cant turn them into apartments, hotels, or homeless shelters. </p>

<p>Homelessness is a lifestyle choice and I have no reason to feel guilty about it. Also I don&#39;t want to support the parasitic homeless industry. That is the army of outreach workers, addiction specialists, social workers, counselors, etc etc. I read an article about how each homeless person in my city costs the tax payer 100 thousand a year in shelters and costs for the all the homeless industry workers. Do you think those people want the homeless to get homes? I think they want the job security. My rent only totals 12 grand a year, why are the taxpayers paying hundred thousand and these people are still in shelters? Put them in apartments and treat them like retards by paying their rent for them, give them very little money because they can&#39;t handle it. Handing them a welfare check is a poor way to do it, they can&#39;t handle it. If they can&#39;t handle an apartment because they are too crazy put them in a mental hospital. Wandering the streets with major mental illness isn&#39;t the solution</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are basically giving up on trying to help your fellow man and that they deserve their misery.  Let&#39;s just kill them.  I think many homeless would prefer this than their miserable existence.  And it would cost the taxpayers much less than it does now.</p>

<p>Also - homelessness is a lifestyle choice!!?  The only thing that kept me going to my hideous job was the fear of being homeless.  Homelessness is a horrible existence and not a lifestyle choice.</p>

<p>And having to force them to take their meds would be much easier if they were properly sheltered.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t even think past what something is &#39;zoned&#39; for and you can&#39;t do anything else with the property.  Governments do other things with &#39;zoned&#39; property all the time.</p>

<p>Boy and you can&#39;t even refrain from disparaging mentally challenged people - &#39;RETARDS&#39; give me a break.</p>

<p>You are an awful person.  Does anyone in your life actually love you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because people don&#39;t see the homeless as their fellow man who needs help, they see him as a leach and a stain on society. They don&#39;t care about his past or his story, they just see him as a freeloader who wants a handout. They don&#39;t see him sleeping under bridges or trying to stay warm in the winter, they just see them as lazy people who don&#39;t want a job. </p>

<p>Basically, because people are cruel to their fellow man. A lot of us aren&#39;t individually, but societally we can be. And our society frowns on the homeless, and helping the homeless because we value &quot;hard work and personal responsibility&quot;, without ever realizing that no matter how hard we work we sometimes stumble and fall, and we should be there to help each other up. </p>

<p>Not to mention, nobody would allow homeless in their office building because t would probably open them up to all kinds of liabilities and other problems. </p>
