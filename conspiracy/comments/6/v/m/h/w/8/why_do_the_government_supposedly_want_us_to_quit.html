        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I mean, they mislead us into eating and drinking shit and they poison &quot;everything&quot; we consume, food, water and air, etc...
Chemicals and poison can be found everywhere which can cause serious illnesses. 
Which they obviously want in favour of making money while slowly depopulating the world. 
So I&#39;m wondering why they go to all these lengths to make us quit smoking? 
It has to be something beneficial to smoking which they dont tell us about, in my opinion. 
Ya&#39;ll feel me? 
Read somewhere that nicotine increases testosterone.
But is that all? 
And another thing, I&#39;ve seen and known healthy old people who have been smoking 90-95% of their life, which goes to tell that it isnt really THAT damaging as they want it to be. 
And all this &quot;propaganda&quot; against smoking , seems to work as a kind of &quot;mass suggestion&quot;, to enable all this illnesses to happen to the smoker. 
Because he &quot;thinks and knows&quot; that if I smoke, I WILL get cancer. Laws-of-attraction-wise. 
Am I into something here? Anyone got a view on this? Thanks</p>

<p>Edit; spelling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tobacco has been considered sacred in many indigenous cultures in the Americas. The commodity you buy at the gas station has pesticides and other chemical crap in it in addition to the complex chemical compounds it contains naturally. I personally believe if used wisely tobacco has many medicinal (and perhaps spiritual) benefits. I grow Hopi tobacco in my garden. I don&#39;t use it much but it feels right to have it there for whenever I&#39;m drawn to it, much like many of the other herbs I grow.</p>

<p>I do find it a little odd this recent push to limit nicotine in cigarettes. There&#39;s definitely got to be more to the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I suppose the nicotine is the essential benefit in sigarettes here. 
Not all the other chemical bullshit they put in it. 
But why does the tobacco-company put so much crap into their sigarettes? 
One would think that they would take &quot;care&quot; of their consumers? 
Not making them sick and killing them of? 
Obviously it will affect sales in the long run. Which it clearly does. 
This doesnt make sense to me, yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here in the US, just in the past two weeks or so, the government announced a plan to reduce the nicotine content in cigarettes. I assumed that was in part what prompted you to post this, not realizing you live elsewhere. Their announcement has me scratching my head. How will this be accomplished? Will cigarettes contain less tobacco but more fillers, or will they use the same amount of tobacco but employ a chemical process to essentially leach out the unwanted nicotine? Either way it will probably mean even more chemicals in cigarettes. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very suspicious to me that suddenly the government wants to make tobacco less addictive. Since when did they start caring? And has the tobacco lobby suddenly lost their clout? I don&#39;t think so. Something else must be going on behind the scenes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah actually I do. Its a business! 
But how many get cancer solely by smoking sigarettes? 
Cancer needs certain conditions to grow, like low pH, low oxygen% and access to glucose, to name a few. 
And they dont get cancer instantly from the first sigarette, right!?
Usualy takes them a decades before cancer manifests, if it ever does. 
Some people smoke all their life without getting it. 
And IF they get it, its most likely caused by diet, contaminated water, radiaton or whatever...thus making sigarettes just a catalyst for cancer in a &quot;bad environment&quot;.
And by that time, they have contributed ALOT with money to/for the government. You cant deny that. </p>
