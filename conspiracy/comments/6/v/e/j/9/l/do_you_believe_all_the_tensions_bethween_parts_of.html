       The protest, the statues, the rallies, the brainwashed college kids, the radicalisation of feminism, the MSM picking their prefered side they want to push for, sensational headlines stating that a second civil war in the US is about to begin...
      </p>
      <p>
       To me as an outside observer this seems looks like an obvious divide and conquer strategy. As I said, I don't live in the US or western Europe, but even here in Slovakia we have a far-right political party rising in the popularity among the youth. And there is sites on Facebook specifically to serve as their opossition, since there is no prominent far-left movement here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people need a label for themeselves? Why do some people feel the need to violently silence the "other tribe"? Even the racial relations seem to be going downhill...
To me this seems too artificial. Who are the people that would want to divide the society so much and what would they gain from it? People like Soros obviosly come into mind, but I doubt he is the only one in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your opinions? Is it all je the tribal nature of the human brain or is someone fueling it?

       Actively combat the homogeneneity of a nation and this is what you get. It doesn't matter if outside forces are helping at this point. Our choices created this inevitability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never intended to think this way, but it is almost obvious when you look at different human demographics interact. Every group wants more political power. Individually, most are moderate. But moderates are never the agents of change. The extremists are fanning each other's flames and eventually the people who never wanted to play will pick a side. That's how humans work. Individualism as a center piece of America's ideals has failed, and it's because of the radical and idiotic fantasy that "diversity is our strength".

       It is definitely outside sources fudning and fueling it through their bought off politicians and the main stream media.  I figured out a long time ago that the MSM will do as their told to do.  For some reason they are playing an extremely dangerous game now and must be for very high stakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion on all this is that the people behind all this unrest have gotten away with so many horrible crimes so they just kept committing more and more horrible crimes and outrages but I think they know that things may begin to unravel.

       There a lot of front men who come to mind who are providing funding and organization like Soros, Kochs, etc.  The true powers remain hidden and these are very old powers like the Rothchilds and European and Chinese royalty.

       Interesting... makes me wonder where all queer non binary pomogender trans types of people are comming from all of the sudden. Few years ago you barely heard about them and now they are all in your face claiming that they are entitled to all sorts of rights just because they are the opressed victims here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean , if you want to mutilate your genitals ok, that's your choice, you are dree to do that but it seems like someone is trying to undermine the established social principles a little too hard. Just look at the bill C-16.

       Podesta emails planned this. Compare your opponent to Hitler. This nazi shit is their last defense.

       The nazis showed up after October, which is when Soros said he donated 10 million to fight hate crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charlottesville stinks to high heaven. Brennan Gilmore helping Muslim rebels overthrow a govt in Central African Republic. He happens to film the car attack and be right there to deliver the "trump is nazi antifa nonviolent" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kessler the former Occupy and Obama volunteer is now like being cartoonishly evil. How is he the head of neonazis that nobody heard of less than a year ago? Where did they get the money for those tiki torches and snappy clothes? Remember when they were identifying the nazis to get them fired? They were from all over the country working shit jobs. How could they all afford to fly to Virginia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kessler went to school with Richard Spencer and Brennan Gilmore. That's your CIA-DNC-Alt Right connection. This is Soros fighting back he knows they're all going down. That's why he's making CNN and MSNBC push nothing but nazis.

       Trans people where always in tv and movies, they just now have been more embraced by the political left then they used to be, trans people where ostracized from gay and feminist community's until pretty recently- when that changed they gained a lot more political legitimacy, that's about it
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been lots of famous trans movies- three examples- Rocky horror, Pricilla queen of the desert, to wang fu, thanks for everything juli numar
      </p>
      <p>
       Chuck palanuk the writer of fight club is a gay transvestite and has always been an advocate for them
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, they have existed in Hollywood before Now, it's just become a much more excepted thing
      </p>
      <p>
       Also most trans people do not actually get genital reassigned, some do, most don't
      </p>
      <p>
       Trans isn't really an issue to me since I am not trans and I don't care, also I live in china so I really don't care what anyone does in America at this point

       Yeah that is true, the reason I am focused so much on Soros as of late though is because of the hacked email dump which I wish got more attention around here. One email showed him directly dictating policy to Hilary for her role in the State department in Albania, solidifying his shadow government role. Amongst other things we were able to get some perspective on a lot of the other issues America is facing as of late such as immigration and civil conflict. The emails highlight efforts to create refugee crisis and flood them into Europe and the States, increasing civil tension between the right and left, these immigrants also serve to increase the liberal voting base and theres a 3 step plan in the email to push policy easing vote restrictions on the up coming 2020 census. On top of other things we see Soros is funding with large amounts of money, black lives matter and other far left / fringe groups, he is also radicalizing these groups. He has used the large influence of his open societies NGOs to undermine foreign governments and was directly involved with the Clinton state department in seizing power in Ukraine with the help of the Neo-Nazi political party. When I first started lookong into stuff like this back before 9/11 and one of the major areas of interest was the illuminati NWO, and now with Soros this is the biggest most aggressive push towards new world order that Ive ever seen, including a lot more subtle things within this movement that are ultimately easing the way into this. When I started readig alot on Soros after the email leak I discovered this guy is the epitome of NWO, and I know attesting to the existence of the illuminati is controversial, most of us here will agree there is a small group of the elite lots of whom are involved in human trafficking  who pull the strings in the background and are pushing for this one world order. I would like to start more discussions on this topic and also what Id be very interested in is constructing a whose who of the shadow government globalist elite who are involved but not as notorious as Soros, but on top of him We've got the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and the Murdochs. Honestly Im not too sure where the Koch brothers fall with this, but of course there are players on both sides as this really transcends the left right paradigm. From everything out there I think it's fairly evident that Trump is outsider to the shadow government and has made efforts to clean up the deepstate and facilitate taking down high profile pedophile politicians. This is a DNC whitehouse still and Trump is playing against a stacked hand, not saying Trump's hands are completely clean and he is a little rough around the edges, but I do see him as an actual threat to the deepstate, and the state of the mainstream media desperately pushing these false narratives does in part substantiate that. Hell I was backing Bernie Sanders 100% but wasn't surprised at all when they stole the primary from him and the rest of America. Trump is a business man and I'm sure he does have some shady business, but as far as I know he isn't a part of this particular human trafficking deepstate with no qualms of killing people who speak against or testify against them and are actively pushing for NWO. Im always open to new information though friend so if you have anything you'd like to share with me on this topic, send it!

       100 percent NOT organic. Under Obama race relations fell apart, that wasn't enough since there is already some self segregation among races soduring the campaign Trump was used to divide people along gender lines (it was already happening because of unis). There were memes spreading and I saw a lot of girls on fb posting "if  you know someone who voted for Trump they aren't your friend. Unfriend them because they voted against you." and shit like that. Then the women's march as an obvious psyop. Get a bunch of women together and push the islam aspect and try to give these women the religious sensation because of all the energy (you get that feeling at a gnarly Flaming Lips show too). You can have kids leaving their homes because they think their parents are racists, you couples splitting up, etc etc.

       It's media driven. The news channels (propaganda) are purposely stirring the pot and making a concerted effort to push the buttons of opposing ideologies.

       One of the topics I'd like to spend more time focusing on at
       <a href="/r/ConspiracyHypothesis">
        /r/ConspiracyHypothesis
       </a>
       is this hugely influential Russian text on foreign policy called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">
        The Foundations of Geopolitics.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's required reading for all Russian military officers and foreign service agents. When it was published in 1997 some of it's goals that seemed crazy like "annex Ukraine into Russia" or "drive a wedge between the UK and rest of Europe" seemed crazy, but now seem either accomplished or well underway to success.
      </p>
      <p>
       It states the Russia's #1 goal when approaching the USA is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       With reference to the statues as of late, Reuters posted an article the other day stating that 59% of Americans thought they should stay 19% who don't care which leaves a small minority that has risen to cause a lot of violence protesting history.

       I think a bunch of younger people got access to secret data on how to brainwash, manipulate and do all kinds of shady shit for control and they are so excited they've been going overboard and accidentally revealing themselves. Like a new generation of a shadow government of sorts, still figuring out how to use all the knowledge and are like a kid in a candy store.

       Imagine a hippie-like liberal, having unrestricted access to CIA's mind control and social engineering stuff etc. They're so new to this it has made people snap out of it. Like a noob being given a set of professional tools. Except the noob is a teen with a naive unmatured world view and the tools are the ones used to control society.
