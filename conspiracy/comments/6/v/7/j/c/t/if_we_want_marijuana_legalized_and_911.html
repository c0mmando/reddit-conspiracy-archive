       Ron Paul is not very similar to Ross Perot at all lol. He didn't even have that massive a support. He was big on Reddit like 5-6 years ago, but more in a libertarian sense.

       all i really remember about Ross Perot was that SNL absolutely loved making fun of him...maybe it was mad tv... maybe even In Living Color.....I think All That from SNICK did too....

      <p>
       and basing what i know now about how the media and politics work.....makes me reevaluate the guy.  I grew up thinking he was a joke thanks to the media...gave him zero chance at all....i mean I was like 10 years old but i still recall him being a laughing stock.

       We each have private interests. And we have shared, public interests.

       Or, sure, you could eliminate the whole concept of public interests and just go with might makes right, law of the jungle. If some rich guy with a private army wants your liver, he gets your liver. (Tasty with onions, you know.)

       You can't just "get rid of government". People want to follow rulers. Even if you could magically eliminate the entire government at ever level, people would form new governments here. The only way to prevent this would be to form a  group to prevent governments from forming, but  even that is its own form of government.

       Good point. I feel that the best answer would be to ban lobbyists, limit campaign contributions or get rid of them altogether, and prevent elected officials from receiving any stipends, bribes, etc....

       Not sure about him.  Watched him use the rifle from the JFK assassination to see if he could get off 3 shots and he made it look impossible.  Then I saw it done several times.  I'm not saying JFK isn't a conspiracy; just that it's possible to get off 3 accurate shots in the allotted time.

       Love his stance on minimum wage... no minimum wage, but have a maximum wage established so CEOs aren't making all the money.

       Paul would be imploding the Federal Reserve slave sytem and Jesse would be putting every single classified conspiracy theory up on the internet.

       There are some countries with no minimum wage but still have even lowly fast food workers making a living wage. They achieve this feat by having potent workers unions that can fight for the workers' to get fair pay. Basically, the workers themselves force their employer to pay them fairly rather than relying on the government to compel the employer.

       Same here, voted for Stein, in Illinois, in order to avoid voting for Hilary Clinton. I knew my vote didn't matter. I wanted Bernie Sanders. I would vote for Jessie Ventura in a heartbeat. His show conspiracy theory is part of that resume. Few politicians dare question the orthodoxy and I want to see a lot more of it. It's too bad Trump is too loose with the facts to do that.

       I don't care about marijuana being legalized. Right now giving the growing/selling rights to mostly rich people &amp; the strength is so incredibly strong......I think it's being legalized in different locales to make people indifferent to a horrible working peoples economy.

       Marijuana legit makes people complacent with where they are. Like min wage workers spending their disposable (if that) on weed and not having any money to better their position. Or even causing others to spend their lives high and just subservient to the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at it like this, only reason it seems weed isn't legalized in more places is to give people a false goal to fight towards

       That would be unwise.   jessie has taken too many hits to the head in his career.

       Real hits and fake they rattled some marbles loose.

       Put him charge of the DEA or something.    That would work.

       I like Jessie Ventura. I'd vote for him so I could know the real truth to 9/11 and end cannabis prohibition. However, on the Joe rogan podcast he got into religion, and frankly I'm tired of people believing in some fucking fairy tale Bullshit. It amazes me how grown adults just accept some shit they were told as kids. Evolution pretty much blows religion out of the water.

       You might as well have voted for Jill in the last round if you wanted to send the middle finger to the elites.    Libertarianism is bs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hayek's plan: peddled as Libertarian, supporting "Liberty", but based on the inaccurate notion that "government" is evil and root of all corruption. A self serving lie. Government is the people, but the Monopolist's use "government" as a simple false target, a straw man, a distraction, a curtain to hide behind. In practice, government today, and for generations, is merely a puppet used as the force projector controlled by the money masters, pay to play, bought and sold to the highest bidders of the deep state.
Hayek's 4 Planks:
1) Deregulate global financial markets - DONE  2) Deregulate global trade - DONE  3) Bankrupt all sovereigns and nations with fiat (empty, unbacked, meaningless) paper "debt" (thereby neuter a nation's capability to enforce laws - eliminate the people's ability to defend against being consumed by these 1%) - DONE  4) Privatize Everything. create permanent rent payers of even the most basic necessities of life (Air, water, food, shelter). - Almost COMPLETE
