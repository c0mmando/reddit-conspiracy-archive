        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t stress this enough people, forget left and right. Don&#39;t partake in this divide and conquer nonsense from antifa and from the right, whatever that means. I don&#39;t know what to describe the other team at this moment. </p>

<p>They are useful tools for justifying the continuing police state and the increasing surveillance state. I cannot stress this enough folks. Its so obvious at how controlled antifa and the so called alt-right is, that I don&#39;t know what else there is to say. </p>

<p>This where it gets tricky for those, especially those are anarchists. We don&#39;t want to side with the antifa authoritarians but we don&#39;t want to side with the Orwellian police state either. How are we going to overcome this obstacle? How are we going to get people to resist the Orwellian surveillance state, protest and condemn the militarization of police, the continual erosion of our civil liberties, the increasing presence of the surveillance state when we have antifa taking up the message of &quot;fuck the police, fuck white people, fuck hate speech&quot;? Its such a toxic and odious mixture that my fear is that we will lose so much in the end.</p>

<p>People will beg for the government to keep them &quot;safe&quot; take more of our liberties as the so called &quot;War on Terror&quot; moves in domestically on our own soil. I&#39;m not comfortable with having Homeland Security telling us that Antifa is a terrorist organization because who is next? We all know that Homeland Security back in 2009 said that returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters etc. were possible domestic terrorists and we were rightfully concerned about that, well the time to be vigilant with the surveillance state issue and the Orwellian police state issue is still vital.</p>

<p>I will shout and shout to the roof tops, don&#39;t give up your freedoms and don&#39;t fall for the police state propaganda. Fuck antifa and fuck the so called &quot;alt-right&quot; they are controlled opposition and they will be used to take more of our rights. </p>

<p>Stay frosty out there folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the inherent call for critical thinking that is behind this post, but I am also uneasy with the equivocation of &quot;fuck everyone&quot; and &quot;both sides are bad&quot;. I think there is clearly a push by ethnonationalists/identarians/whatever to control the narrative and put language out there that seems to suggest left wing activists are solely responsible for chaotic protests -- you can go to /pol/ and voat and actually see users discussing and strategizing this. The counter protests are just that; in response to the alt-right stuff. The right wing wants violence because then they&#39;re able to try and spin sympathy for their disingenuous free speech victimhood and dog whistles.</p>

<p>I do agree the the government/deep state/whitehouse benefits from all of this. I think they&#39;re deeply fearful of more Occupy Wall Street/99% style movements and so of course the events of last week serve their purposes.</p>

despite months of cooperation to ensure a peaceful event, disobeyed a federal permit to forbid the alt right from speaking and push them into 8 blocks of screaming, heavily armed masked protestors and calling a state of emergency before the rally even began.

<p>Off the top of my head -- the US labor movement, especially from 1910-1940s, various student demonstrations from the 1960s until today (Columbia University 1968, student strike of 1970, Kent State, etc), ACT UP protests in the 1980s, Black Panthers, the WTO protests in 1999.</p>

Occupy was exposed as just another leftist, wealth redistribution mantra. Heard that bs before, ad nauseum.

<p>How are exactly are antifa &quot;authoritarians&quot; or PTB when they don&#39;t have any authority and aren&#39;t seizing any institutional/military/economic power?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t think they’re seizing any institutional/military/economic power?</p>

<p>The underlying principle behind resisting racism is 100% correct and agreed.  However, an organization like Antifa has been shown to be funded by nefarious groups like Soros and his minions.  The ultimate end to their actions is further division and stratification of the population in general, a weakening of the solidarity and unity of the masses, and a vilification of individuals that are indeed <em>truly</em> trying to honestly fight against racism and prejudice.  This thereby gives energy and fuel to the very racist Nazi/KKK groups that they’re supposedly designed to do away with.</p>

<p>In this manner and through this undermining and weakening of the “Antifa” supposed “racism fighters” they, again, actually give the very racist groups power they’re allegedly created to stop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only the alt-right occupies the whitehouse. antifa controls nothing. but I guess they shout a lot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes a lot deeper than you’re thinking.  What I said above, especially as it relates to the individuals behind the scenes that are <em>funding</em> the supposed antifa groups, gives you an idea of not only how both antifa and KKK/Nazi groups are in the wrong, why they <em>both</em> should be opposed, and why individuals interested in going against racism should in fact do so independent of any of these two organizations.</p>

This suggests to me that either Antifa is not centralized, is a generic name, the person was lying/shilling, or simply that Antifa got infiltrated with bankrolled thugs rather than being fully compromized from the start.

    <div class="md"><p>Well here&#39;s the thing. Antifa are some of the most angry Anarchists out there, and yes they get violent, against store windows, and anyone who tried to harm them. Also since they aren&#39;t you know, trained and paid soldiers, it is very possible some of them do things that the rest of them wouldn&#39;t have agreed with (this even happens with very trained soldiers). Those who break the law usually get pulled out of the crowd by the police, so I&#39;m not sure why anyone is so concerned, as if Antifa just get away with it every time. They don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Now the other thing is, that Antifa enjoy destroying the storefronts of companies that are part of the problem called Capitalism. These are the Communist Antifa, and there are also Social Democrats and progressive Christians in the group. So people might call it violent, to break store windows, but people have to pay attention to the details. The Antifa do this by principle, and not because they are solely chaotic.</p>

<p>Another thing the Antifa does is use Black Bloc Tactics, and I don&#39;t know too much, but basically they stick together and they use fireworks to create smoke, confusion and to break the ranks of police who attack them violently. I&#39;ve seen a video of a cop who shot a guy in the head with a gas canister and that guy nearly died. He wasn&#39;t even part of the Antifa or the problem. Cops are violent. It&#39;s literally their job to resolve disputes through selective violence. This world is not perfect so let&#39;s stop pretending.</p>

<p>Antifa type of violence, is very much easier to understand than say, the far right, which hates people based on the colour of their skin and goes out to harm people simply for being there.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t defend everything the Antifa does, but it&#39;s a drop in the bucket compared to other groups. Heck, in the 60s the government itself bombed, burned, and murdered protesters. Ever heard of the group called MOVE? They were murdered by the State.</p>

<p>Now the State prepared for war against all citizens, and they seek to disarm people and stop them from organizing effectively. The State will murder. The State does not deserve so much protection, to commit crimes and murder people. The State wants people to think it is unbiased and morally perfect, and the fact that people don&#39;t even question their government means we live in very scary times. Soon the State will Purge this country, and we will wish we had people to defend us against Tyranny then..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. I would prefer if people would protest about the political system (e.g. reform politicial campaign finance and reform congress instead of allowing it to be systematically corrupt)
and the economy (end the FED, implement democratic socialism or at least social democracy economics).
Not saying issues of race aren&#39;t a problem, but they tend
to be amplified, like they say, there&#39;s less racism when you stop talking about race itself. </p>

<p>Not to mention,
most racial issues and even crime rate would go hella down if the economy, education system, etc. improved
and if the war on drugs CIA scam + private prisons were shut down/reformed/nationalized.
And the elites tend to dominate and distract when we divide ourselves with
issues that don&#39;t change the country that much.
Economics hurt the elites, not peripheral issues that just cause division among brainwashed people.
The antifa vs nazi incident was a psyop.
It would really change things if the legit people in these protests changed
the subject to economic equality, e.g. no subsidies for corporations, give that tax money
instead to social programs for the people and safety nets for the poor. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tax money to social programs and safety nets for the poor.. Are you sure that you are a Libertarian??</p>

<p>I do agree that there are better things to focus on. Your argument is solid. It reminds me of what I used to think about quitting smoking. You cannot focus on quitting something, for that is like running forward while looking behind yourself. We must not fight over the problems in the world. We must work to establish a solution, which may not include fighting at all.</p>

<p>..funny how private prisons are soaring, with Trump&#39;s new attack on immigrants. It&#39;s very interesting how much Trump&#39;s policies seem to be leading in a very Fascist direction.</p>

<p>I speculate, that the Nazi party intended to win the war, but the fact that they lost does not mean they died. They spread themselves througout the globe, and achieved high positions. They laid in wait, and planned to rise again. I fear they are making their play, in our current times. Its more than just them, though. The power behind the Nazis is what I fear, and they come in many forms to snuff out the light.</p>

<p>Rome will rise again, just as assuredly as it will fall.</p>

<p>I myself, much prefer the Greeks, and they deserve a revival wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

I consider myself only moderately (left) libertarian and economically center left.</p>

<p>I think the NWO is globalist fascism with elite bankers and a few others being the ruling class,
(they may sprinkle aspects of other ideologies to make it look
like it isn&#39;t but essentially it would mostly be fascism on a global scale).</p>

<p>The graphs may have been constructed during the primaries so
not sure how outdated they are,
but either way, Trump is likely
as right wing and authoritarian as Obama if not more.</p>

<p>The DNC/GOP are almost completely compromized IMO,
they won&#39;t reform. Bernie got rigged against in the primaries and Trump
isn&#39;t fixing things like he implied he would.
As far as I&#39;m concerned, they&#39;re working on the same corporate team
and independent is the only way to go IMO.</p>

<p>The ruling class trying to take advantage of the working/middle/upper middle class.
It&#39;s been like this for a long long time.
NEOliberalism and NEOconservativism shifting into fascism.
The elites seem to be part of secret societies (e.g. freemasonry, Skull and Bones, illuminati)
with satanic elements inspired by cults from Babylonian and ancient Egyptian times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said except for the last part. I am unable to confirm or deny anything regarding the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Certainly there is fascism on the rise. I have been warning about the global take over for about 12 years on my blog (joshua-ray.livejournal.com). I used to be very religious, and believe I prophecied the coming Great War, although these days I just wonder if it was programmed into me.</p>

<p>The Freemasons are interesting. They may be a form of Deep State, because their structure is the same as the government. They have a local, State, and federal level. They hold secret meetings, and their members are largely all part of the military industrial complex. On that notion alone, it&#39;s possible they are a super spy ring, but I wouldn&#39;t surmise that is all that they are. I have called them before, the Lobby to a great Party. Beyond that I don&#39;t know much, and their religious views seem to be inconsistent between their many members. Some parts seem to worship Saturn, and some seem to have Hellenistic beliefs. Perhaps they are the remnant of the Greek Empire. Perhaps they were infiltrated by the Jesuits. Whatever they were, it seems they are controlled by the Catholics, which is ironic since they seemed to stand for the opposite at one time. There was a time I considered joining them, but I refused because I don&#39;t believe in God, or the eternal soul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I gather, the illuminati stemmed from the Bavarian illuminati.
If modern day illuminati are real, I just lump them in with the freemasons (I don&#39;t believe the narrative that they&#39;re opposing forces, that sounds sort of stupid IMO)
but if they&#39;re not involved, perhaps the elites mock the illuminati thing (and turned into a meme) in order to provide cover for the freemasons? I don&#39;t know but it&#39;s good you didn&#39;t join the freemasons.
Apparently it&#39;s compartmentalized
so the highest levels are aware of the satanic shit
while lower levels are led to believe innocent things about it.
If a group like the freemasons are meant to be benevolant, there&#39;s no reason for secrecy....therefore I don&#39;t trust them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have long felt that perhaps the Illuminati thing is meant as a red herring, and to yes, give cover to the very obvious, existent organizations such as the Freemasons.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust them either, but I am working on a theory, wherein the religious aspects of Freemasonry are not really important at all. It&#39;s my understanding that the references to old religions include hidden messages intended to subvert people&#39;s understanding of the meaning of what&#39;s really going on. It&#39;s a massive smoke screen, the way I see it. What lay underneath is something I can only just imagine. It just seems silly that a group which has taught the fundamentals of liberty, equality and freedom, would not include people ignorant enough to want to pick and choose some old religions. To even accept an old religion, one would have to see through the modern ones. If you don&#39;t believe in Christianity, then why would you believe in something older? If you believe in something older, then why stop there? Why not something even older than that? Like, why stop at the worship of Neptune and just stop there, believing you found the true truth? It doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. I feel like more is going on. The scary religious stuff makes people keep their distance, not investigate, and also to come up with ideas which can easily be called conspiracy theory. As long as we focus on the religious aspects, we won&#39;t see the physical nature of these organizations. Our efforts to understand, or to affect the aims of these organizations becomes immediately subverted. If such things were truly meant to be secret, we wouldn&#39;t know about them. It&#39;s just a theory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also completely possible that upper eschelon members use scrying mirrors to commune with one of about 80 different &quot;demons&quot;, all of which manifest themselves in the actions of such members. Is entrainment disguised as entertainment? These groups use ritualistic magick to affect massive groups of people, causing them to behave in ways that benefit the groups. Does that make sense? It&#39;s an abbreviated idea. I&#39;m sort of busy. It seems to me these groups have more influence over the world&#39;s people than most realize. What is their overall aim? It is of course, impossible for me to know. All is just a theory until I join a group and work my way up. The reason I don&#39;t want to do that, is because I am not sure that I would ever be taught the actual truth. It could take 20 years just to get through the red tape of information systems, just to find out none of it was relevant! I am not the sort of person to submit myself to others, or some supposed and unseen force. I manifest my own destiny, by not always choosing a premade path, but by forging my own path when necessary. I&#39;m curious, but I feel joining them would only be a trap for me.</p>

<p>The government wants you to believe it actually cares about you, and you fell for it. In truth the war on terrorism aims to silence political dissent and mark it as treason. That is not ok with me, and shouldnt be for anyone. I mean, we live in a time when journalists are getting murdered all over the world at an alarming rate! Serena Shimm is no exception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa only hate the haters. Thats not the same as being a hater (though it is really).</p>

<p>So by that metric though, everyone hating Antifa is just wanting to be Antifa. Kinda ironic hey?</p>

<p>The unfunny and problematic thing is that the alt-right is clearly propagating this smearing of the antifa to detract from their own obvious and horrid nature. </p>
