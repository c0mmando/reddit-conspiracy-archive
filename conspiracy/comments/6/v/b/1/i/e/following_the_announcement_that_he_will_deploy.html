       Go back 1 year and I would tell you 2 things I knew to be absolutely true:
      </p>
      <h2>
       Trump will never win the White House
      </h2>
      <h2>
       Whoever wins will continue the same one-party agenda that has ruled since JFK
      </h2>
      <p>
       Looks like I was half-right, and sobering realizations are good to have every once in awhile.

       Or maybe completely informed considering he is doing the exact opposite of what Obama did in Iraq. That was absolutely clear that a vacuum was created with the goal of arming ISIS....maybe your right as well but how about elaborating rather than making blanket statements.

       You guys need to pick an argument here. We've heard over and over and over that we need to stop meddling in other countries. We need to stop going to war. We need to spend that money at home. Then you guys yell about how we never should have gotten out of Iraq. It makes no sense at all. Should we just be in every middle eastern country until terrorism as a concept stops existing?

       I always think of it as Persia.  Anyway, while we're on the topic of the Wikipedia explanation for everything, let me mention that a lot of us think Wikipedia is the Zionist version of everything and we don't particularly like Wikipedia being the only explanation for this world we live in.  I will offer as proof of this the following text from the link you provided.  It's an alphabetical list of the peoples who live in Wikipedia's Middle East.  Note the first people in the alphabetical list, won't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Minorities of the Middle East include
       <strong>
        <em>
         Jews
        </em>
       </strong>

       You can't just pull out of a country and not expect tribal leaders to fill in the gaps. We have been there far too long. We will perpetually fight this war for 17 more years if w don't make a final push. Of course we want out and the way things are now that is impossible without cleaning up the mess of the past 2 administrations.

       Then why did Trump say we should do exactly that while Obama was in office? So I guess we should just stay in Afghanistan forever because no matter what day in the future we pull out, assholes will flood to fill the power gap when we leave.

       Obama told us the same thing and he had 8 years to do something yet he did nothing. 8 fucking years! Just left small numbers of troops over there to die. He wanted the illusion that he gave a crap because he is Muslim brotherhood plant. It's painfully obvious now as it was during the last 8 years to anybody that opened their eyes. This ain't my first rodeo. I've been involved with the theory about conspiracy since my freshmen year of college when the towers were knocked down an hour away from me. The real deep state was in power since Bush Sr and the only thing obvious now is that Trump is fighting them at every turn. They were all complicit in this perpetual war.

       Ahhh right Obama is a Kenyan muslim and Trump is fighting the deep state by filling his cabinet with war generals and Goldman Sachs. You guys have a nice boogie man there. Whenever Trump has a hard time doing anything it's the deep state! Or is it 4Dchess and he was playing everyone? Either way, he is incapable of wrong doing.

       I agree that he is not capable of wrong doing. I guess I can explain it like this. My entire adult life has consisted of distrust for our government and in that time I have witnessed a 17 year war that was obviously shrouded in corruption, a revamp of the health insurance system at the expense of the middle class, the destruction of our border laws and with it the identity of Americans, a year over year trillion dollar increase in national debt at the expense of our future generations, as well as an education system that teaches to the lowest common denominator now...its been a frustrating 2 decades.....now we have somebody come in and call out all of those things with the promise that our future will fix those wrongs. In his first months he has made moves to believe that all of those things are actually possible now. I'm choosing "faith" this time until he shows signs of any of his predecessors. And to this point I haven't been forced to lose it yet. You can stick with "were all fucked and nobody can be trusted again" routine. To each their own.

       Every president comes in calling out everything that's wrong with the country. That's how they get elected. People believe they can fix it. At least for a little while.

       Obamacare didn't fuck over the middle class. It insured millions of people in the middle class. I'm one of them. It doesn't work great everywhere right now. But what's the Republican plan? Give

       The identity of America is immigration. It always have been. Back in the day, people like you said the same thing about Irish people. It was huge when a katholic got elected as president. Older immigrants will always bitch about the new ones. It's happened for hundreds of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the debt. Trump plans to build a huge multi billion dollar wall, pump money into our military, pump money into infrastructure and cut taxes for everyone (including the mega rich). So good luck reducing the debt with all that. If he gets all that done, it will blow a nuclear hole in the deficit.

       How many troops do you exactly expect Trump to send over that would make Obama's numbers look small? Obama had a peak of 100,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan and it took until 2015 before we even went below 25,000.

       There is no 'final' push.   You can intensify bombing campaigns, but more civilians will be killed resulting in more people to view the US forces as enemies.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The MIC and its propaganda apparatus do not want out.  Afganistan is a pathway for pipelines, has oil and large cache of minerals.  But here is the most important part why the MIC does not want to pull out.  The prize has always been Iran.  The neocons are planning on a military confrontation in 5 years.  Iraq and Afganistan will allow the US forces to attack Iran from both sides.   That is how delusioned these people are.  They are not experts at foreign policy.  They are experts at war.  The US is like that bad dog owner, where the guard dog is running the house.  It dog does not respond to commands like: sit, stay and go back.

       Of course he's being controlled, just like every other president. I'm just as disappointed in his Afghanistan decision as anyone else, but if you know anything about what Afghanistan is really for, you'd know that the CIA would never allow our full departure from the country. A Trump decision to the contrary would not be good for him - best we can hope for is he negotiated something else for the decision.

       The point of electing Trump was that he'd be able to stand up to these people.

       Nobody is forcing Trump into anything, that's a false narrative that needs to end. Trump is the president, and this was his choice........ Not the left, not congress, not Hillary...... This was 100% on Trump.

       We can only speculate. Threats to him and his family? Would there be a "Trump Curse," like the "Kennedy Curse," that would threaten his children and grandchildren? Or maybe he really does want to end this war quickly, and we will be out before the next POTUS (one can hope)?

       It a cryptic speech. I think it was a good one for the people but read the translation below and you can decide for yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       This is speculation but this is what may be the message in Trump's speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       America has been funneling heroine from Afghanistan and selling it all over the world including in America. Pakistan has helped this process and acted as a middle man just like Mexico acts like a middle man to import Colombian cocaine into America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama and Bush were essentially allies with Pakistan who is a known supporter of terrorism. India is Pakistan's enemy. India is also Iran's ally. Iran is enemies with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel and Saudi Arabia are serious apartheid states who participate in terrorism and human rights violations worldwide including in their own land. The deep state regimes of Bush and Obama were friends with Israel and Saudi Arabia. The US, Saudis, amd Israelis ran the 9-11 false flag together to justify endless wars in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, Trump is moving the alliances of America from Pakistan (eta al) to India (eta al) as long as India is willing to help pay the bill on fixing Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what he has planned for Afghanistan but he is hinting at hitting the problem with full force instead of half-assed. (Note: The deep state took a half ass approach in places like Vietnam and Afghanistan in order to maximize profits from the Military Industrial Complex since the longer we stay in war, the more money they make. The 2 main problems in Afghanistan are the Heroine trade and instability. Bush and Obama wanted the instability and they heroine trade to last as long as possible to maximize profits. Trump wants to eliminate it quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has the most powerful and expansive military on the face of the Earth by far. This military has been used as cannon fodder for the worldwide cabal without any care if it bankrupts the US. Basically, the cabal gets what they want and the American taxpayer pays for it. If Trump is for the people, this should no longer be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure Trump is aligning America with not only India but also Russia, Iran, and some other countries against Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and some other countries. Europe seems split. German government looks comprised. The U.K. looks compromised too but Brexit was a good turning point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it looks like alliances are shifting fast. That speech was probably meant to be a warning to certain countries and an invitation to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Trump mentioned the invasion and democratization of countries is over. Every country Obama and Bush tried to help has been destroyed because liberation was never the intention. It was only a cover story to fool the Americans. Quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests."

       The bottom line is he's sending more troops into Afghanistan after saying that he wouldn't. And if bet that it's just a matter of time until Erik Prince gets his greedy paws into the action.

       Here's a non-conspiracy theory. Trump changed his mind. He realized if he wanted to stop terror from entering America it would be foolish to leave Afghanistan. Leaving there would create a vacuum into which ISIS could take over, just like they did when we left Iraq. This is also evidenced by the surge he was talking about. He didn't give any details like Obama did. This is smart for us tactically because it keeps the enemy guessing.

       The USA and allies created ISIS to justify a push into Syria to carve out space for the Kurds to take over and hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we stop arming the terrorists, because their job is done, and start arming the Kurds, because their vote is close at hand and we want to make sure they keep their stolen oil and land.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way, Saudi Arabia can bring a newly divided Iraq into its fold, as it has announced plans to do.

       Apparently it was either this or the Bannon-backed plan to hire a bunch of mercenaries (Blackwater, Dyncorp) to do the same thing. The Taliban is active there and they will topple the flimsy Afghan government if the US pulls out entirely. The situation is fucked no matter which way you turn it seems.

       The simple explanation is that he said what you wanted to hear to get elected. There is a ton of evidence that he has done this in business his whole life. He's a liar. No need to complicate it. He loves war. He loves generals. He has a hardon for it.

       We didn't start out with the intent of staying in Europe, Japan or South Korea for that many years, but we did. The same will happen to Afghanistan. We can only hope they turn into a democracy and an ally, but that is unlikely. If we haven't won in Afghanistan in 17 years, what is going to be different about the next 4 or 5 years?  Nothing, that's what. More money wasted and more lives lost for nothing.

       First of all, I'd like some sources on our intent regarding staying in said countries(not disagreeing, just curious as to what you're basing this on). Secondly, regardless of initial intent, we have stayed in those countries voluntarily because it benefits us. Thirdly, if you want to draw parallels between these cases and Afghanistan, our continued presence in said countries has been because we have either turned them into allies or because we were already allies. I personally can think of no downsides to a political climate in Afghanistan that makes a U.S.-Afghanistani alliance amenable to both parties. Fourthly,
       <em>
        many things
       </em>
       could change in the next four or five years. Please provide a source proving otherwise if you disagree.

       Of course I did, this is basically Obama's speech from 2009 where he announced the troop surge.
