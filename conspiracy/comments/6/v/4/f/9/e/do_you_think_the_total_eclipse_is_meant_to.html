    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Well, I suppose that people would be more involved in stopping government tyranny. But, if this is my utopia, there wouldn&#39;t be government corruption. Actually, there wouldn&#39;t be a government at all. Instead of having one big country, we would have many small tribes (small towns per say.) Each tribe would be like a big family and they would get along with other tribes. There would be a modified version of communism in place (removing all of the negative parts). How it would work is that every tribe would get a proportion of money. With it, they would buy food, water shelter for their tribe. After a month, all of the money will be turned back in and redistributed (to avoid inflation) During a solar eclipse, everyone would simply sit back and enjoy god&#39;s creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Centralized news wouldn&#39;t exist. Each tribe would receive the news from other tribes. Every day, each tribe would sit down for 1-3 hours listening to the news of each tribe, comparing them. If they find out a tribe is twisting the news, they will be tried in the court system (I have a lot of documentation written of how I&#39;d restructure the court system, but I won&#39;t go into that now). If they are found guilty, they would be dumped at sea for god to judge them. Those who survive were clearly picked by god and will be welcomed back into the community. </p>

<p>I will be anonymously self-publishing a book in the next coming years called &quot;Communistic Tribal Perfection For America And Europe&quot;. If the book is a success, I plan to write books on more systems tailored to other locations. There will be an encyclopedia version (complete guide) and a shorter version (Better for the layman and will have more of a chance to be an NYTimes best seller)</p>

I&#39;m considering offering decentralized shipments, but still need to figure out the logistics behind it - where I would split the book into 2-10 different segments to be shipped to different addresses.

<p>There&#39;s a lot you have to learn. The dark side of the government has stayed hidden for so long because they operate in the shadows, avoiding the public spotlight. They are not going to run a red light too causing attention to be drawed. I saw the SUV passing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question. Well, I suppose that people would be more involved in stopping government tyranny. But, if this is my utopia, there wouldn&#39;t be government corruption. Actually, there wouldn&#39;t be a government at all. Instead of having one big country, we would have many small tribes (small towns per say.) Each tribe would be like a big family and they would get along with other tribes. There would be a modified version of communism in place (removing all of the negative parts). How it would work is that every tribe would get a proportion of money. With it, they would buy food, water shelter for their tribe. After a month, all of the money will be turned back in and redistributed (to avoid inflation) During a solar eclipse, everyone would simply sit back and enjoy god&#39;s creation. </p>
