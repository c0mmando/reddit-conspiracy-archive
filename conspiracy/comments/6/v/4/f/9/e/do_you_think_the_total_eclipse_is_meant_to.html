       Good question. Well, I suppose that people would be more involved in stopping government tyranny. But, if this is my utopia, there wouldn't be government corruption. Actually, there wouldn't be a government at all. Instead of having one big country, we would have many small tribes (small towns per say.) Each tribe would be like a big family and they would get along with other tribes. There would be a modified version of communism in place (removing all of the negative parts). How it would work is that every tribe would get a proportion of money. With it, they would buy food, water shelter for their tribe. After a month, all of the money will be turned back in and redistributed (to avoid inflation) During a solar eclipse, everyone would simply sit back and enjoy god's creation.

       Centralized news wouldn't exist. Each tribe would receive the news from other tribes. Every day, each tribe would sit down for 1-3 hours listening to the news of each tribe, comparing them. If they find out a tribe is twisting the news, they will be tried in the court system (I have a lot of documentation written of how I'd restructure the court system, but I won't go into that now). If they are found guilty, they would be dumped at sea for god to judge them. Those who survive were clearly picked by god and will be welcomed back into the community.

       I will be anonymously self-publishing a book in the next coming years called "Communistic Tribal Perfection For America And Europe". If the book is a success, I plan to write books on more systems tailored to other locations. There will be an encyclopedia version (complete guide) and a shorter version (Better for the layman and will have more of a chance to be an NYTimes best seller)

       Just as a heads up, I ship the book with a blank cover so that it's impossible for any third party to censor the book or seize shipment. I'm considering offering decentralized shipments, but still need to figure out the logistics behind it - where I would split the book into 2-10 different segments to be shipped to different addresses. This way, you're not having to worry about losing the book (or more likely, having it stolen).

       Dude, I wouldn't stress about that. Shipping it to that many different addresses would introduce a greater risk of losing something than just emailing people a pdf or something. If you really wanted to be careful, you could compare send and receive times with the recipient to ensure there was no time for tampering- but- and I feel the need to say this again- no one in a position of power gives a shit about what you publish. Even if they would, they don't have the volume to monitor every conspiracy theorist out there.

       Jesus Christ, you're paranoid. If the government is anywhere near as capable and powerful as you say, there is no way in hell that running a red light would stop them. Either they're competent and you can't avoid them by running a red light, or they're incompetent and don't give a shit about you. Since there was no fallout from the red light, I think it's safe to conclude the latter.

       There's a lot you have to learn. The dark side of the government has stayed hidden for so long because they operate in the shadows, avoiding the public spotlight. They are not going to run a red light too causing attention to be drawed. I saw the SUV passing.

       Lol... I wasn't even referring to that. If they knew enough about you that they were tailing you, then they knew your license plate, etc. If they knew your license plate, they knew your name, your face, etc. Hiding in a motel wouldn't stop the seemingly semi-omnipotent government that you seem to think would give a flying fuck about a paranoid dude that wants tribal communism.

       As did I, my intention was to say that OP's response was as lacking as he thought yours was.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair though, a no is lacking substance but when OP doesn't give you any substance himself it's hard to actually be able to discuss something.

       Well why aren't the politicians talking about the eclipse right now. They aren't talking about it and a lot of politicians are in unknown locations right now.

       What shady stuff? Are you really asking that question? I thought this sub was suppose to be woke to government corruption.

       The moon is god's creation, so it isn't. Doesn't mean that cycle's can't be controlled for benefit.

       Good question. Well, I suppose that people would be more involved in stopping government tyranny. But, if this is my utopia, there wouldn't be government corruption. Actually, there wouldn't be a government at all. Instead of having one big country, we would have many small tribes (small towns per say.) Each tribe would be like a big family and they would get along with other tribes. There would be a modified version of communism in place (removing all of the negative parts). How it would work is that every tribe would get a proportion of money. With it, they would buy food, water shelter for their tribe. After a month, all of the money will be turned back in and redistributed (to avoid inflation) During a solar eclipse, everyone would simply sit back and enjoy god's creation.
