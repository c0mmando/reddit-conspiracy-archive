<p>Everything I&#39;ve seen from wikileaks indicates that political campaigns and groups have direct access to journalists and use that to their advantage.</p>

<p>Well yea, most of the GOP is Establishment</p>

<p>I would. Secretly giving debate questions isn&#39;t collusion? Come on...</p>

<p>Don&#39;t try to normalize the shit we have seen. Its not normal, not okay, and it hasn&#39;t always been this way. Its pretty clear that the media is now controlled by powerful group that pushes out propaganda in order to manipulate the public.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see that, then I can&#39;t image what sorts of conspiracy theories you could possibly believe. So this is sort of a tangent, but if you don&#39;t mind I would love to hear about what sorts of conspiracies you think are likely true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not normalizing it, because it IS normal. If you can&#39;t see that, you must have a terrible grasp of history.</p>

<p>Newsflash- governments have always been corrupt. News media has always been used for propaganda. the powerful elites have always been manipulating the public behind closed doors. None of this is new.</p>

<p>And simply pointing that out is by no means implying it&#39;s &quot;okay,&quot; that is a ridiculous jump of logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said this is all new, just that it hasn&#39;t always been this bad. In a way, it has actually been bad for a while now, its just that more people are waking up to how bad it really is. Trump is the first President that wasn&#39;t hand-picked by TPTB in some time now, and they are exposing themselves in their attempt to take him down.</p>

<p>But I would argue that political corruption in the US has gotten worse over time, as our founders expected it would.</p>

Or were you just taught about WWII by teachers in your school using a book published in the USA? Thought so.</p>

<p>Did the thought ever cross your mind that what we&#39;re taught in history books could possibly be less than the whole truth, or even outright lies? You should consider it a possibility that we have been deliberately lied to about the history of our world. </p>

<p>Did you learn about Operation Paperclip in high school? Didn&#39;t think so. That was a CIA operation that occurred after WWII in which top Nazi scientists were brought back to the USA to work in different intelligence agencies and NASA. These Nazi scientists went on to assist the CIA with creating projects such as MKULTRA, instead of being tried for their war crimes. </p>

<p>At the time of WWII Hitler was standing up against Jewish international bankers who were attempting to install central banks in every European country. While his racism towards the Jewish people was completely unacceptable, his views on the Jewish Bankers were spot on. </p>

<p>We are also not taught in school about how IBM (an American company) provided the numbering system for the concentration camps, or how Prescott Bush (grandfather of G.W.) did the Nazi&#39;s banking for them out of his U.S. offices before being caught.</p>

<p>So if you want to believe that everything we were taught about WWII is the <em>complete</em> truth, you are dead wrong. There is much more to the story and you have to look in uncommon places to find this information.</p>

These Nazi scientists went on to assist the CIA with creating projects such as MKULTRA, instead of being tried for their war crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, did you?  Of course every person wasn&#39;t tried for war crimes, but I don&#39;t see what this has to do with me calling OP an anti-semite or nazi sympathizer, because that&#39;s what he plainly said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the time of WWII Hitler was standing up against Jewish international bankers who were attempting to install central banks in every European country. While his racism towards the Jewish people was completely unacceptable, his views on the Jewish Bankers were spot on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now we see here that you&#39;re no better than OP, if not the same person.  His racism towards Jewish people was unacceptable, full stop.  Just like racism towards any people or person is bad.  You trying to justify saying that because they were bankers does not make you look any better or any more educated.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are also not taught in school about how IBM (an American company) provided the numbering system for the concentration camps, or how Prescott Bush (grandfather of G.W.) did the Nazi&#39;s banking for them out of his U.S. offices before being caught.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, has nothing to do with OP being an anti-semite.  Bad people have existed since the dawn of time.  These two would be interesting to read sources on, only to dismantle your argument more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if you want to believe that everything we were taught about WWII is the complete truth, you are dead wrong. There is much more to the story and you have to look in uncommon places to find this information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One more fucking time, you assume you know so much about me, which is annoying.  And do uncommon places include unsourced blog posts that also sell male enhancement drugs?</p>

<p>You know what it seems like to me; you and OP have to pin whatever bad is happening in the world or in your own lives on some third-party.  That way, when you lose your job, or someone is mean to you, or your wife cheats on you, you can raise your hand in the air and scream &quot;It&#39;s the jooooos fault.&quot;  You won&#39;t take personal responsibility in your own world&#39;s and its manifested in anti-Semitic posts like this, which have only been emboldened because our own president won&#39;t denounce violence as caused by anti-Semitic supremacies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know very little about me as well.</p>

<p>My point about IBM and Prescott Bush is that people consider Nazism to be the most evil ideology that exists in our world. If this is the case, then our own government and country men are not that different from Nazi&#39;s. That is my point. People want to cry &quot;Nazi!&quot; at any given opportunity but don&#39;t realize that there are people with ideology similar to Nazism that currently work in our government and intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>If I thought I could convince you, I would continue to type. But I&#39;m fortunately I need to get back to the real world. </p>

<p>I hope you continue to enjoy pretending your better than everyone else because you&#39;re sooo progressive and anti-Nazi. You will get a lot of pats on the back from society. It feels pretty good to be on the &quot;winning team&quot; doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my fault that 90% of the people who control world finance AND our media just happen to be Jewish/Zionist and have dual Israel citizenship. Open your fucking eyes man. </p>

<p>Honest question; Do African Americans have an organization dedicated to making sure nothing bad is EVER said about them?
Do Mexicans, have an organization like this? Does ANY race (other than Jewish/Zionist) have such an organization? The answer is &quot;no&quot;. Think about this for a minute. You might learn something.</p>

<p>And I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about for the last one, but I&#39;ll play ball: the NAACP for African Americans or black Americans, LULAC for Hispanic Americans.  Nearly all races have some sort of protection-advocacy group.  Maybe you&#39;re the one who needs to do some research.</p>
