<p>Here it is, I got it saved because they are going to rip it off the internet AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.</p>

<p>EDIT: This doesn&#39;t cover all variables obviously, but this talks about neurodegenerative disease prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated children. </p>

<p>This is a good first step, this research should not be hidden or ignored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It won&#39;t get buried. It would be foolish to hide something that doesn&#39;t really encompass the full situation with vaccines, this focuses on NDD&#39;s, neurodegenerative diseases, this is a good first step in the direction to understanding any underlying negative mechanisms vaccines may have. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t condemning vaccines, far from, it&#39;s more of a picture showing us: &quot;Hey, we can do better, we have figured out an issue that seems to be caused by vaccines, so we are going to figure out that mechanism and we will make changes and hopefully make vaccines even safer&quot;.</p>

<p>This should be played as a step in the direction of improving our understanding of all the mechanisms our vaccines are effecting upon development, the biggest two seems to be the immune system, and the CNS, and the CNS issues usually lead to the immune system issues, most of the disorders or problems with vaccines will stem from neurodegenerative diseases, but furthering our understanding and trying to correct mistakes is the right direction. </p>

<p>Hiding this type of research will just prove they have an agenda, or that they fear people will not understand the implications of this research, this is to further our understanding, not to condemn vaccines. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They <em>may</em> work. In a lot of instances they don&#39;t. Flu shots being the easiest example.</p>

<p>But yes, the main point is that they are, in fact, very dangerous, and unnecessary. All the major &#39;deadly&#39; illnesses are actually not fatal over 98% of the time (with modern health standards) and furthermore, were more or less eradicated before vaccines came along. It is modern sanitation that took them out, not vaccines.</p>

<p>Last question...has anyone looked at the modern schedule compared to your parents or our grandparents&#39; schedule? I guarantee you most of your family members don&#39;t have nearly as many shots that we will inject into kids whose systems are still just starting their development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true. For one thing, they are not totally eradicated. Prevalence of diseases like polio exponentially just happened to decline while vaccination became common. Modern sanitation standards are also not up to par in many parts of the world, where these diseases become much better controlled and much more quickly controlled with vaccination. Without herd immunity, there are still many ways outbreaks can happen again in places like North America. </p>

<p>Also, yes, these diseases are often not fatal. However, without vaccination they&#39;re often uncurable and only have symptomatic treatment. That is NOT a good solution, both in terms of general well being and healthcare costs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at all the recent outbreaks (measles, mumps, etc), you&#39;ll find that everyone that got ill had the vaccine. Not to say the unvaccinated don&#39;t get sick from shedding; they do, but as I stated in another comment these illnesses we are afraid of are pretty much equivalent to chicken pox nowadays, much less than &lt;2% fatality rate.</p>

<p>(On the chicken pox vaccine - those who got chicken pox naturally seem more resilient to shingles later on, whereas those who got the vaccine typically are getting shingles much worse, so the preliminary surveys/studies are showing)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re obsessing over the fatality rate like it&#39;s the only important part of this. You would be comfortable getting diseases that can have potentially serious complications, just because you have a low chance of dying? You&#39;re right in that modern medicine has significantly decreased the mortality rate in these diseases, but it was vaccines that significantly decreased the prevalence of them. You&#39;re looking at the wrong data. </p>

<p>Your argument about the recent outbreaks is also straight-up wrong. Look at the recent measles outbreak in Minnesota, where the disease spread primarily among the Somali community, a community that has seen vaccination rates plummet to &lt;50% in recent years. Outbreaks happen primarily among those who are not vaccinated. Sometimes, vaccinations aren&#39;t effective in certain people (immunity is never 100%, only close to it), or some aren&#39;t able to be vaccinated for various other reasons. They are protected by herd immunity, and then have the possibility of contracting the disease through these outbreaks that happen BECAUSE of unvaccinated people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots to pick apart here, I&#39;ll try to be succinct.</p>

<p>These diseases overwhelmingly do not have serious complications. Again, I&#39;ve witnessed around 15 kids over the last few years get these &#39;potentially serious&#39; diseases, and came out with no issues at all. Meanwhile, daily I see kids having extremely adverse reactions to vaccines, often with irreparable damage. </p>

<p><a href="https://childhealthsafety.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/us-deaths-1900-1965.gif">Chart showing vaccine use versus mortality rates</a></p>

<p>Some of the outbreaks did have unvaccinated people, yes (I was referring to the 2 or 3 most recent ones, where in fact it was all vaccinated people). Generally this is because of vaccine shedding, where the person vaccinated will be contagious for a bit of time, and makes it easier for others to pick up. In the same way the flu shot often doesn&#39;t work (because of different strains and other factors) we observe the same effect with other vaccines.</p>

<p>Finally, herd immunity does not exist, and was actually hypothesized for naturally-occurring immunization before the prevalence of vaccines. Even if you believe it to be true, the fact is, we&#39;re nowhere close to achieving it, as your parents and grandparents have roughly 5%, at best, of the shots you do if you&#39;re up to date. Just look at the vaccine schedules if you don&#39;t believe me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re straight up ignoring the data now. I specifically talked about mortality rates. Yes, with most diseases (even AIDS now) we&#39;ve been able to decrease mortality rates a lot with symptomatic treatment. That&#39;s ignoring the contraction rates, which sharply declined WITH the vaccines. Symptomatic treatment is far from the best solution.</p>

<p>Where are you daily seeing these kids with adverse reactions? Where are you witnessing this stuff? You&#39;re saying you&#39;ve seen 15 kids get these diseases, but you must not be paying attention. Here&#39;s just the most recent measles outbreak (quote from an article): &quot;Since the outbreak began in late March, Minnesota public health officials have confirmed 79 local measles cases. Most involved unvaccinated preschool children in the Somali American community.&quot;</p>

<p>As for adverse reactions, either in person, or on vaccine forums discussed in vivid detail (with pictures or videos) of kids having everything from localized rash with fever, to ending up dead a few days after their shots. I&#39;ve not witnessed any contractions in person, but everyone that reports their child has something has eventually reported back that their child was fine. Again, we can much more effectively treat stuff nowadays, so contracting isn&#39;t a big deal. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence from you showing otherwise, other than the normal speaking points that Merc and the CDC puts out (as of course they would, seeing as they own the patents to the vaccines).</p>

<p>You&#39;re sitting in a bubble giving you only the information you want to see and that supports what you believe</p>

<p>Some deaths have been claimed to be attributed to a vaccine. However, few if any have actually been substantiated. These are mostly self-reported theories of people and parents. </p>

<p>In most cases, children who contract these diseases will end up ok. But there will always be a percentage that will have serious complications, or die. For measles, I believe the number is less than 1% with modernized treatment. Putting that in perspective of a country with hundreds of millions of people, however, the sheer number of complications and deaths from that disease alone would soar without vaccination. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just taking America into account. Worldwide, we still have hundreds of thousands of deaths attributed to measles every year. Lack of vaccination in our country would only help spread more cases to countries with lower healthcare standards, once again creating a bigger issue. That&#39;s why eradicating the disease is so important. The measles vaccine alone has saved <em>millions</em> of lives worldwide. </p>

I&#39;ll be able to read more later but glancing through it I&#39;m concerned about selection bias. For example I do not find it surprising that vaccinated children use more prescription drugs, as parents who vaccinate their children are probably more likely to allow their children to take prescription drugs. As a scientist, seeing phrases like &quot;almost

<p>Conclusions
Assessment of the long-term effects of the vaccination schedule on
morbidity and mortality has been limited [71]. In this pilot study of
vaccinated and unvaccinated homeschool children, reduced odds of
chickenpox and whooping cough were found among the vaccinated,
as expected, but unexpectedly increased odds were found for many
other physician-diagnosed conditions. Although the cross-sectional
design of the study limits causal interpretation, the strength and
consistency of the findings, the apparent “dose-response” relationship
between vaccination status and several forms of chronic illness, and
the significant association between vaccination and NDDs all support
the possibility that some aspect of the current vaccination program
could be contributing to risks of childhood morbidity. Vaccination
also remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for
other factors, whereas preterm birth, long considered a major risk
factor for NDD, was not associated with NDD after controlling for
the interaction between preterm birth and vaccination. In addition,
preterm birth coupled with vaccination was associated with an apparent
synergistic increase in the odds of NDD above that of vaccination
alone. Nevertheless, the study findings should be interpreted with
caution. First, additional research is needed to replicate the findings
in studies with larger samples and stronger research designs. Second,
subject to replication, potentially detrimental factors associated with
the vaccination schedule should be identified and addressed and
underlying mechanisms better understood. Such studies are essential
in order to optimize the impact of vaccination of children’s health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mawson’s vaccine study was funded by two anti-vaccine groups: Generation Rescue, founded by anti-vaccine activist Jenny McCarthy, and the Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute, founded by vaccine skeptic Claire Dwoskin. Web sites such as Age of Autism ran ads calling for donations to Generation Rescue, containing an explicit statement that the money would go toward funding the study.</p>

<p>Mawson is also a vocal supporter of Andrew Wakefield signing petitions supporting his vaccine study.  </p>

<p>From authors:  The object of our pilot study was not to obtain a representative sample of homeschool children but a convenience sample of unvaccinated children of sufficient size to test for significant differences in outcomes between the groups. </p>

<p>The study is definitely and by admission not representative of the population and having been promoted almost exclusively, with respondents being almost totally homeschooled.</p>

<p>I am not unwilling to look at data. I am always willing to hear new evidence as we are always learning and science is about progress.  But if people are going to present statistics and evidence as fact they need to show as little bias as possible.  I don&#39;t find that to be the case with this study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am absolutely condemning this study. Author is a known anti vaxxer who stands behind the Wakefield report.  Report was funded by anti vaxxers. Report retracted by both journals it was published in.  These, I think, are enough reasons to dismiss.  Plus there were issues with some of the joint authors credentials, flawed methodology, report admitted the sample wasn&#39;t representative, and other problems.  I am all for research.  Although I personally believe that vaccines are safe and effective I am not a parent.  I would be willing to look at credible research in a heartbeat. A closed mind doesn&#39;t answer anything. But this is obviously not that study. </p>

<p>This is finding a link between NDD (neurodegenerative diseases) and vaccinated children vs unvacc&#39;d children. </p>

<p>It shows that there is still more to learn about vaccinations, and with this type of research being down, we can investigate further and find the mechanisms that are at play that are causing this increase in NDD&#39;s, but &quot;Mr Scientist&quot; knew that, right? </p>

Bill Posey (R-FL) to have a federal study comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated children. If the CDC and other agencies are so concerned that children get vaccines, why wouldn&#39;t they jump on an opportunity to prove that vaccinated children have better outcomes than not vaccinated? Why hasn&#39;t this study been done?</p>
