       I thought of the exact same thing but I realized we couldn't see the moon because the sun was behind the moon so there was no light to light up the moon.

       I totally get that, I just figured there would be some kind of visual at some point, though.

       But, yes, you are exactly right .. you need light to reflect off the surface to infact see the surface

       Can you explain how, if the moon is reflecting the sun's light, the moon's light at night has it's own measurable properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the moon's light the temperature is warmer in the shade, putrefaction and decomposition increases in speed, a fire will burn bright and strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas, in the sun's light it is cooler in the shade, things can be preserved longer such as carcasses/foods decompose much slower, a flame is much smaller and produces less heat.
      </p>

       Just curious your take on it?

       Honestly, I don't have much of a take on that stuff, as some of it is the first I've really heard about it. Wasn't overly aware that the moons light had different properties than the daylight, as I assumed the light being cast from the moon was just a reflection of the suns ... obviously cooler as so much energy is likely used in traveling to and from the moon.... didn't know moonlight sped up decomposition!
      </p>
      <p>
       What\s your take on this stuff? Why does it happen?

       I personally am not completely sure why it happens. My take on it is that it becomes hard to believe that the light from the moon is simply a reflection as I do not believe a reflection can change a light's physical properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like if I were to reflect the suns light onto a surface, I would assume it would be warm in direct light, cooler in the shade, etc. It's still the sun's light being reflected. Where with the moon we get an opposing force essentially. The warm, preserving light from the sun versus the cold, putrefying light from the moon gives the impression that they are in fact different light sources. What that means is up for debate.

       It is in my experience that when attempting to give sources to this kind of potentially "paradigm-shifting" information, if a title has certain phrases or if a person says certain things in their articles/videos, most will dismiss them because it goes against their personal belief(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       So my suggestion is instead, seek this out for yourself. I know what I have seen, what I have experimented with, and so on. The results are repeatable and observable, you can look up tests you can perform on your own, or tests others have done to see what I am referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd gladly discuss it with you from there if you'd like.

       Interesting username and attempt to provoke me and derail the conversation we were having.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I have my sources, and I have done my own research and experimentation. I recommend you do your own instead of attempting to troll an civil conversation. If you want to know you will seek it out, it's out there and is very easy to find. If you are not interested then remain oblivious to easily accessed information, your choice.

       Found a video on the topic ..... found this comment on the video.

      <p>
       Not sure if they're in the know or what... but sounds like it
      </p>
      <p>
       "Light", visible light, carries no warming ability. The part of the spectrum that does, infrared, is invisible. Moonlight is bluish. It is missing part of the red spectrum, including infrared.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a second fault in your assumptions:
The moon is a sphere, not a mirror, and its surface is rough and powdery ... light is being reflected in all directions. The moon's light only represents a tiny, tiny portion of the sun's total energy output. Even if the moon WERE a perfect mirror, only a tiny fraction of the sun's energy would be reflected ... its like looking at a bar heater in a mirror 100 metres away, and expecting to get a hot face. Do you see what I mean?

       I could totally see the decomposition thing being true, as mushrooms and other decomposers are more active at night. But the fire is hotter at night and being in the shade at night is warmer are two things I'm not quite grasping.

       Get a thermometer. Go stand in the moons light and measure the temperature. Then go stand in the shade, out of the moon's light and measure the temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light a fire in the day, measure the results. Light a fire at night, measure the results.

       If you are not grasping, test it yourself and see.

       FFS, it is hard to just find plain video of this thing. I don't want to hear wtf all these idiots have to say about the thing. But here is a decent video. I am sure there will be better ones after the entirety of the event is finished.

       Thanks for that - this video looks odd .... while the sun is coming back on the left, the right hand side looks like it isn't moving off it...

       I should clarify that i was looking for a video without that heavy of a filter

       Ya, I looked through like 20 vids and it is all shit. Going to have to wait for the really detailed videos, which of course have all the post processing and shit that will get rid of any of the interesting bits you are probably hoping for.

       But there are bound to be some decent amateur astronomer vids in the days to come.

       For sure ... seen one and it was nothing. Was hoping some whipper snappers on here had filmed it and uploaded 7000 frames of alien invasions...
