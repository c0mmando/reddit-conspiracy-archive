        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just as the title says, Is the United States too far gone? is their any way we the people actually stand a chance to attempt to fix whats going on here? or does the average American even care enough to do anything? i saw a post yesterday that spoke true, it says [use science to predict an eclipse and everyones happy, use it to predict global warming and everyone loses their mind.] yeah it&#39;s funny,  but its also true and its scary to think about, America is killing itself and it seems like all anyone cares about is the stupid shit Trump says, or who the next Jinner is that&#39;s gets a sex change. well heads up, all  of this is on the news simply to distract you from the real issues. </p>

<p>all great civilizations throughout history have risin to the top, got greedy and sent back to the bottom by either plague war and even simple ignorance, all of which is happening to America now.  i cannot think of any solution other than simply getting out while i still can. Is their a solution?</p>

<p>petitions seem to never get anywhere, the government controls the media so raising awareness becomes a lot harder,  if you ger large group of people to protest corporate greed you called communists and have people like Alex Jones picking fights to discredit everyone and everything thats actually going on. not only that but the average American cant simply stop what their daily lives to go protest, they would lose their job,  their home, their life, and sadly they may even end up in jail and it could very well all be for nothing.</p>

<p>Are we just caught in the largest checkmate possible, is it possible to stop the corruption in our government? how do we even begin to shed light on what it is they are doing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, don&#39;t stress out about it or worry too much. It leads to poor health.</p>

<p>Though it may seem hopeless, do what is best for you and your family first. If the current situation seems dire to you, then investigate your options, which may include leaving the USA if need be.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that most people don&#39;t care. I&#39;ve lived in UK, Spain and various other countries and human beings are human beings. The majority are content with a family, a smartphone, TV, car, holiday once a year etc, and love to complain. Though they don&#39;t want to hear about this ominous cloud which is above us all. They don&#39;t want to believe that our governments work against us in almost every aspect of our lives. Yet it has always been so.</p>

<p>We live in a time of a bit more freedom that yesteryear (Middle Ages, absolutely theocracies etc), in Western countries, at least. Enjoy the freedom that you have now. Do things that make you happy in life and never feel guilty about doing it, as you and everyone deserves it.</p>

<p>Maybe sometime in the future it will all go to shit, so better to enjoy what we have now. One analogy is fear of losing a loved one. I perpetually worry about my loved one, and know one day he won&#39;t be here with me or vice versa, but I force myself to enjoy the time between arguments to the max.</p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t give a shit about America or Europes decline at all, let it burn </p>

<p>Been in china 5 years now and I will be getting my permanent residency next year which grants me privileges from the communists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing being just out of America this long, you can truly just stop giving a fuck. I have my money spread over 10 different currencies and many properties in many countries, but cash is king and I am staying liquid.</p>

<p>America died under Obama, out gdp went to 1% for 8 years and all we did was argue about gender, currently we would need to get gdp up to 9% for 10 years to regain our wealth, that will never ever happen</p>

<p>America all ready collapsed, we all lived through it, now it&#39;s just a slow death spiral- this is post ww2 U.K.- a massive decline that can&#39;t be stoped by anyone and no one in government is going to even really try </p>

<p>Go to grad school in an emerging economy and learn to read and write their language, get a job and become a dual citizen, never worry about America again </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, buy a small plot of land. Something like 1-2 acre, near enough (within 1 hr) a town that you can sell food at a farmer&#39;s market or to a local grocer. Dig a well, put a mobile home up, get a solution for electricity. Grow food to feed yourself and then grow literally anything else you can make. You will be poor. Sell everything you can produce to pay the taxes and cut all other expenses to the best of your ability. Work your land with minimal help. Work your land in a way to make the Amish proud. If you can afford more, buy some ease of life solutions to make the maintenance better. Live proudly. </p>

<p>Get involved with the local governance (NOT the politics) and ignore the mess outside. The d&amp;c bull will exist but a strong community can stand aloof from it unless they literally put you against the wall for death, if that happens you were fucked anyway. Invite the death squad in for a last supper with open arms, and feast one last time. Enjoy your liberty till that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America was founded on small communities banding together. These still exist of you step out of the cities,  or even find your small groups in a city. So no, America is not dead. The point of my post and suggestion towards farming was, don&#39;t try to play the controlled game that they&#39;re pushing all Americans toward. It&#39;s an unfulfilling game that&#39;s not worth your time. Your suggestion of bailing on the country and getting a stem job in some other country is just trying to be a harbinger of that very same way of life elsewhere. You may have some fun in the process, but in the end you will likely find it unfulfilling. </p>

<p>Source: I have tried fully to buy into this &quot;new dream&quot; am a statistician at major bank who works and has worked internationally. My experience here has me working hard to get off the corporate tit and get back to being self made. </p>

<p>The problem is globalization, devaluing of the individual/community and jobs supporting that. Get away from that shit and you will find much more to life. Don&#39;t try to just be a part of the same shit in a different country.</p>

Like uou astutely pointed out it can be easy to be poor, and if you&#39;re able to find fulfillment in thag, this is a legitimate option no matter what others say. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am angry that the law firm I worked at in 2007 closed, I will always be angry about that till I am fucking dead!</p>

<p>It was a great job and I fucking loved it and the firm went god damn bankrupt in 2009 so I had to roam the earth with all the other 5 year associates in the waste lands for the next three years till I said fuck it and moved to china- that shit was horrible, I did not like solo practice and I did not like watching everyone I know lose all their fucking jobs, but unlike you people I put on my big boy pants and moved instead of just spending all my savings trying to get  jobs that no longer existed </p>

<p>There are 3 million less law jobs in America today then where in 2007- 3 million less lawyers work at law firms today then in law firms 10 years ago and probably 3 million less 10 years from now. Lawyers are becoming fucking redundant and you guys talk about manufacturing and farming jobs- it&#39;s over, America is done with most jobs, America just does not have the growth or the economic desire to support jobs anymore.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like it, but I accept the things I can not change, and I like aspects of living in the east most notably having tons of money like I did in 2007.</p>

<p>Life is hard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope you find a way past the anger. Last suggestion of the night (morning?), if you&#39;re finding yourself saying &quot;unlike you people&quot; in a derogatory sense, you are probably hanging out in the wrong community, and one that will only continue the anger for you, maybe try spending time in places that make you happy/content instead of just feeling superior. Good luck, and I wish you all the best.</p>

<p>Regardless, when I first discovered conspiracy I wanted to talk about aliens and Bigfoot and shit- I very quickly found out all the conspiracists just hate Jews, so yes I don&#39;t like it, but I also found out, no one here has ever spoken to a fucking Jew or knows anything about Jews</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I moved to china, learned to read and write mandarin and got a job at a finance law firm </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t give a shit about America or Europes decline at all, let it burn </p>

<p>Been in china 5 years now and I will be getting my permanent residency next year which grants me privileges from the communists.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing being just out of America this long, you can truly just stop giving a fuck. I have my money spread over 10 different currencies and many properties in many countries, but cash is king and I am staying liquid.</p>

<p>America died under Obama, out gdp went to 1% for 8 years and all we did was argue about gender, currently we would need to get gdp up to 9% for 10 years to regain our wealth, that will never ever happen</p>

<p>America all ready collapsed, we all lived through it, now it&#39;s just a slow death spiral- this is post ww2 U.K.- a massive decline that can&#39;t be stoped by anyone and no one in government is going to even really try </p>

<p>Go to grad school in an emerging economy and learn to read and write their language, get a job and become a dual citizen, never worry about America again </p>
