<p>You have no right really to tell someone they are stupid for sharing their idea on a conspiracy board were almost 80% of the stuff that gets posted here is hyperbolic nonsense anyway. it&#39;s fine if they are misguided and you point out your rebuttal and you openly discuss it.  That&#39;s what this is for, but if your only solution is to tell them to &quot;seek professional help&quot; then just stop and check yourself.</p>

<p>How many times have we seen dumb schoolyard insults here lately, everyone is spouting off &#39;retard&#39; and &#39;stupid&#39; like a bad 80&#39;s villain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that people confuse their opinions and beliefs for evidence and facts.  They want to believe things with no semblance of critical thought.  And then they share their opinions with the world and expect that everyone should have their same opinions and beliefs.  </p>

<p>Is George Soros the devil, I dunno, maybe.  Should I believe he&#39;s the devil just because you say so?  Absolutely fucking not.  Blindly following others leads down a rabbithole to catastrophe.</p>

<p>The other part it, there are so many intentionally misleading posts and half-truths that get submitted here by people who are trying to shape a narrative, and they <em>hope</em> that no one will call them on their bullshit.  They&#39;re the worst.  They try to deceive, they try to lie, and they hope you (and I) stay blind</p>

<p>If you have thoughts and ideas that can never be challenged, then you are an authoritarian whether you want to admit it or not.  Be open to criticism of your theories, and be open to dialogue.  We all can learn something more</p>

<p>Also it is possible someone sees a conspiracy and someone else doesn&#39;t.  Just because you don&#39;t think theres a conspiracy shouldn&#39;t give you the right to dictate if what the poster posted is a conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s odd that, in a sub that is supposed to be for open sharing of ideas, people are so resistant to articulating their ideas about what they&#39;re supposed to be sharing. &quot;What&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; shouldn&#39;t be a bad question to ask, it should be included in the bare minimum of the original post. </p>

<p>Sharing things without context or frame of reference doesn&#39;t promote discussion, spread any idea at all, and is just overall lazy. If there were requirements for actually explaining your post&#39;s conspiracy, there would be far less shitposting and forum sliding. </p>
