       My son's boy scout troop went to the flight 93 memorial site on Sunday. After 10 minutes of looking at pictures he came up to me and asked "mom, where is the plane parts..why are there no bodies....wouldnt it have big scars in the ground from the wings....it does not look like any plane crash ever" I just smiled and told him how good it was that he question these things and to never just believe something because someone told you it's true...
He spent the 2 hour drive home asking me questions and wanting answers.. .He is one of us now.

       Good for him. Now it's your job to keep him level-headed and in the right direction. Because getting into conspiracies and asking questions could lead you into a never-ending rabbit hole. But the kid is definitely on the right path. And I do think it could be genetics and he got that from you. My dad's way of thinking is very similar to mine and I think that's where I got it from.

       I wouldn't assume genetics has anything to do with it, it most likely has nothing to do with genes or DNA in general. I'm not a biologist, but I do know that our understanding of genes is so limited that your belief that it has something to do with the way you make choices is equivalent of a person who believes 19 terrorist alone planned and executed the events of 9/11. They're both beliefs based purely on non-factual or biased information.

       I mean someone being skeptical, questioning an agenda, a motivation behind something, looking below the surface of events. Ok, maybe it's not genes but I do think it has to do with how you are brought up.

       Hell bent?  Certainly not.  But that's not how a kid talks, and it's kinda unrealistic to wonder why there is no damage almost 20 years later.  Do you expect craters if you go to London?

       If it comes down to "unrealistically inquisitive 11 year old" or "fake story" on this sub, I'll guess that anyone claiming their pre-puberty kid is "red pilled" is making shit up.

       Considering their parent is posting on this forum, I think you're full of shit. The kid is taking on the same thinking as his father, which makes perfect sense. Either you parrot the narrative being shoved down your throat, or you question what you are being told and inquire further. You have no reason to be so skeptical, and the message is not heavy-handed... its just an anecdotal story.

       You're the one that keeps claiming that I have some kind of anterior motive here.  I've given a couple strong examples why this sounds like bullshit.  You're the one that seems to want to push the narrative.

        That's logical.

      <p>
       It's not logical.  Ita not logical for a 13 year old boy scout to ask why there are no bodies at a 20 year old site, and it's not logical for someone to put that forward as an example of critical thinking.

       One page.  One.  You realize there's a high risk of posts here to be made by fakes and trolls?  You're not capable of doing an ounce of investigation before amusing someone of having something to sell multiple times?

       He's asking where the bodies are in the pictures of the aftermath of the crash - not the site in it's current state.

       Who is lacking in critical thinking here? why would you assume he was asking why there weren't body parts strewn after decades? you're being purposefully daft.

       It doesn't lose me sleep, but yes - i'm aware. It doesn't mean I have to cross-examine every person I have a disagreement with. They can be here for work for all I care - I'm not doing this to try to change the world's opinion. I'm just sharing my 2 cents.

       He probably knows the earth is flat too. If he doesnt I wouldn't let him get indoctrinated on that huge lie from NASA. The 20 and older crowd almost have a meltdown when you tell them.

      <p>
       And my 12 yr old nephew already knows dinosaurs are fake. He told me that. Right now we are working on gravity.  You seriously have to teach them the opposite of what they pick up in school. But since they are all addicted to the internet their range of info is exponetially larger than even ten years ago. That's why its paramount to inform children of pseudoscience and government control over what they learn ,and how to think critically of their education instead of just passing tests.

       You guys have a big surprise in the future when these kids grow up and basically will be laughing in your faces about how little you actually know about this world. Having such a closed mind and then trying to pass that onto the next generation is utterly detrimental to them.  Not that it matters to you so much , sarcasm or not your comment is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

       What about gravity? The leading physicists in the world still can't fully explain what it is or how it fully works, but you seem to know? All we know are the end result of the force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critical thinking is not about telling people about what you think you know - it is about exploring what you don't know. You can guffaw at others all you want, but at least they are testing mystery and challenging themselves. Your nephew is 12; we were all impressionable at 12. It doesn't mean he will think dinosaurs are fake forever.

       so take these things as an opportunity to present some evidence that might jog his thinking and stretch his reasoning. That's always the goal - 'the only thing I know is that I do not know'. Celebrate that. Don't get caught up about getting it 'right' - it doesn't really matter to anybody but yourself. Nobody is going to really change their life because you are clever - try to be constructive with your knowledge. sorry for any offense or grief caused - not my intent. have a good one.

       Thanks, Always, I have better conversations with him than most the people here. I am very constructive, actually. When you pose something to another in a constructive way you see the automatic denial people usually express. And they stop there. Just deny it. Deny deny deny. Nothing constructive in that. Nothing expansive about holding absolutes, either, as they are self imposed limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice no one even asked how that could be fake or looked into it? First thing they do is deny. They have already lost their will to expand their worldview.

       This is a actually a good exercise. Pretend you have a 12 year old nephew and he says to you dinosaurs are fake and then you say what? Rip nephew?  That's your critical thinking response?  Understand my point now?

       Ok, let me clarify where we are at. You just had said having an alternative belief carries no critical thought, so i asked you to actually prove dinosaurs are real. And  Not just some fabricated stuff from a time when attractions like those were inventions of creative people to make a few bucks. By Using bones and molds and anything they could think of to create them, and also creating a story to support their existence.

       My nephew calls it a circus attraction. Can you prove him wrong?

       That's not critical thinking and you don't seem to understand that. So you think my nephew is somehow worst off than you, when you can't even give one reason why you believe in dinosaurs? Not even one?

       " He told me that. Right now we are working on gravity. You seriously have to teach them the opposite of what they pick up in school. But since they are all addicted to the internet their range of info is exponetially larger than even ten years ago. That's why its paramount to inform children of pseudoscience and government control over what they learn ,and how to think critically of their education instead of just passing tests."
