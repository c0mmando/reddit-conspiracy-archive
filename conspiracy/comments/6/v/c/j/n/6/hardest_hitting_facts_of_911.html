        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>DEMOLITION</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Thermite, a military grade incendiary that&#39;s heavily quantity controlled by the US govt, was found in dust samples at ground zero. <a href="https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOCPJ/TOCPJ-2-7.pdf">[pdf]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d5iIoCiI8g">[The Great Thermite Debate]</a></li>
<li>Many testimonies of molten steel. This is important because neither jet fuel nor regular fires could melt steel to the point of appearing lava-like. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTzBbhShJQo">[1]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQrpLp-X0ws&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3m48s">[2]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/OmuzyWC60eE?t=4s">[video]</a></li>
<li>NIST officially states &quot;The jet fuel, which ignited the fires, was mostly consumed within the first few minutes after impact. The fires that burned for almost the entire time that the buildings remained standing were due mainly to burning building contents and, to a lesser extent, aircraft contents, not jet fuel.&quot; <a href="https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/NFPA_Presentation_on_WTC.pdf">[pg. 25]</a></li>
<li>Squibs of smoke can be seen shooting out of the windows from many stories below the avalanche (also above), usually seen in controlled demolitions as charges are blown to weaken support. The squibs can be seen even before collapse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF6DZmdZjEQ">[1]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/8W3y3Qh8R1s?t=4m26s">[2]</a></li>
<li>Many testify to explosions underneath the lobby both before and after the initial crash. <a href="https://youtu.be/RWoMCQPTd9A?t=11m32s">[1]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/2W1HlV9O65w?t=30s">[2]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/gp9YmTnYP90?t=1m22s">[3]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/XvUIQZ7t7Ak?t=22s">[Video evidence]</a> </li>
<li>World Trade Center 7 was the third building to collapse on 9/11. WTC7 was not hit by a plane, yet came down symmetrically and at free fall acceleration, supposedly due to regular office fires alone. While observing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqbUkThGlCo">WTC7 collapse,</a> note that fire does not seem to be a problem. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/other_fires/other_fires.htm">list</a> of other buildings that survived much worse and longer lasting fires. WTC7 would be the only building in history to come down from fire alone. Also consider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clEvOW6ABFE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=4m52s">this video</a> of a failed controlled demolition.</li>
<li>Explosions heard at WTC7 site before collapse <a href="https://youtu.be/jKtU01qcZBM?t=1m34s">[video]</a></li>
<li>Barry Jennings, the last WTC7 survivor, reports that a &quot;big explosion&quot; trapped him inside the building. In a later interview, he describes hearing multiple explosions while being trapped. He mentions that when he made it down to the lobby, &quot;there was no lobby.&quot; <a href="https://youtu.be/5LO5V2CJpzI?t=14s">[9/11 testimony]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/1o0PTsP1_AE?t=1m4s">[Full testimony, later]</a></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>GROUND ZERO</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fires burning at ground zero can not be put out weeks after 9/11 <a href="http://georgewashington.blogspot.com/2005/12/why-was-there-molten-metal-under.html">[link site]</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/-0bEu7THvAQ?t=3m29s">[video]</a></li>
<li>Thermite is used for underground welding. </li>
<li>The cooling duct of the engine found on Murray St could not have belonged to either Flight 11 nor Flight 175.
<a href="https://youtu.be/YGHg1bQk9-o?t=1m38s">[video]</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE PENTAGON</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>13 witnesses that were near the Pentagon all give accounts that corroborate each other and describe a plane flight path that&#39;s irreconcilable with the official story. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HlUmmPBoLg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=29m58s">[video]</a> <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/pics/flight-path-composite-full-res.jpg">[photo]</a></li>
<li>Flight 77 supposedly bent and uprooted 5 light poles before making impact with the pentagon. <a href="http://www.cover-up-newsmagazine-archiv.de/x918.jpg">[pic]</a></li>
<li>Airliner wings can be severed by telephone poles.<a href="https://youtu.be/2zt1oTYhcgo?t=3m51s">[video]</a></li>
<li>A cab driver&#39;s cab was supposedly hit by one of these light poles. This cab driver later admits he was part of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/_HlUmmPBoLg?t=1h11m23s">[video]</a></li>
<li>There were no marks around the hole where the wings or turbines should have hit, with the columns still intact, yet no wing, tail, turbine, fuselage, or otherwise large debris was found at the site, implying the whole plane was vaporized. <a href="http://911review.com/attack/pentagon/imgs/impact.jpg">[diagram]</a> </li>
<li>85 surveillance tapes were collected by the FBI on 9/11. A year later, five inconclusive frames were released to the public. More frames were released at a later date from another camera. In the second release, the front end of a smoke trail seen by the first camera is missing. The back end of the smoke trail remains, only peeking into the frame, and has been claimed to be the nose of the plane. Both cameras were in perfect synchronization, with the “nose of the plane” and the back of the smoke trail <em>sharing the same pixel pattern.</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/8DOnAn_PX6M?t=2h17m3s">[video]</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FLIGHT 93</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>According to the official story, flight 93 <em>completely submerged itself in the earth.</em> <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HpBeF5scrtA/maxresdefault.jpg">[photo]</a></li>
<li>Unlike every other crash investigation, flight 93 was never reconstructed after it was supposedly unearthed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHISTLEBLOWERS</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Mike Springman, US consulate member, reports that 15 of the 19 alleged hijackers were given passports and visas [by the CIA] at the US consulate building in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ut2vKqnCpE">[video]</a></li>
<li>Susan Lindauer, US-Iraqi translator for the CIA, confirms the US govt had pre-knowledge of the attack, while the Iraqis deny knowledge and fully comply with US demands. <a href="https://youtu.be/G43zl4fzDQg?t=13m10s">[video]</a></li>
<li>Cab driver (above) admits conspiracy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvyQ0vVwjqc">[video]</a></li>
<li>Bob Kerrey, 9/11 commissioner and member of the Skull &amp; Bones society, claims 9/11 to be a &quot;thiry year old conspiracy&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDfm3NroVG8">[video]</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>INCOMPETENCE THEORY</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_MASCAL">Pentagon MASCAL</a>, taking place in October of 2000, was a contingency exercise that required emergency response teams, members of the defense protective services, and U.S. government officials to conduct emergency simulations in preparation for a possible plane crash into the Pentagon.</p></li>
<li><p>October 16-23, 2000: NORAD Exercise Includes Scenarios of Attempted Suicide Plane Crashes into UN Headquarters in New York. <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=continental_us_norad_region_1">[link]</a></p></li>
<li><p>Planes as weapons: &quot;Louis Freeh, director of the FBI for much of the 1990s until June 2001, will later tell the 9/11 Commission that in the years 2000 and 2001, the subject of &#39;planes as weapons&#39; was always one of the considerations in the planning of security for &#39;a series of these, as we call them, special events...&#39;&quot; <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a00planesasweapons#a00planesasweapons">[link]</a></p></li>
<li><p>However, on 9/11, nearly all the US&#39; jets were on the opposite side of the country, allowing the alleged hijacked planes to fly around for an hour and a half without being intercepted, and six officials in the chain of command were either unavailable or it was their first day in the position. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M&amp;amp;t=14m55s">[jets]</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/8DOnAn_PX6M?t=33m8s">[chain of command]</a></p></li>
<li><p>George Bush: &quot;Nobody in our government at least, and I don&#39;t think the previous government could have envisioned flying planes into buildings.&quot; <a href="https://youtu.be/Su3tYyjaFDQ?t=6s">[video]</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PRE-KNOWLEDGE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin McPadden, 9/11, heard a countdown and was warned to run for his life seconds before explosions and WTC7’s collapse. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4z-Wrp1pY8">[video]</a></li>
<li>WTC7’s collapse was reported on BBC news 20 minutes before it actually happened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677i43QfYpQ&amp;amp;t=48s">[video]</a></li>
<li>Rick Rescorla, security guard who “saw it coming” for 6 years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9jUEp_l7cE">[video]</a></li>
<li>More pre-knowledge of WTC7 collapse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxXAC3m1eQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=6m17s">in this video</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6v0jxg/list_of_suspicious_events_on_september_10th_2001/">Here&#39;s a great post</a> about suspicious events that took place on 9/10/01.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>About the thermite dust found - </p>

<p>It was openly used to demolish the remaining facade and partially damaged WTC complex buildings in the weeks after the collapse. </p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t that account for why there was thermite dust found in later samples? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the linked paper (pdf):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the morning of 9/12/2001, Mr. Stephen White of New
York City entered a room in his apartment on the 8th floor of
1 Hudson Street, about five blocks from the WTC. He found
a layer of dust about an inch thick on a stack of folded laundry
near a window which was open about 4 inches (10 cm).
Evidently the open window had allowed a significant amount
of dust from the WTC destruction the day before to enter the
room and cover the laundry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was one of five samples.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I can&#39;t find a time for that picture.</p>
