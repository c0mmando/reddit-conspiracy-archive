       I felt i had to use a burner account for this text post because of my recent experiences on this sub. I've been getting threats for taking part in open discussions regarding ANTIFA and all the drama surrounding free speech lately and a lot of the threats originate from this sub. Either a group of people or someone under different usernames have been going through my posts and comments and even managed to pinpoint my town of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't really take the threats too serious since i have not posted anything identifiable about myself and don't fear any harm in real life, but being followed online and getting weird long messages in my inbox is kind of disturbing and especially when the person(s) come off as being total schizoids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not being paranoid, but rather fed up after almost 3 weeks of this stupid shit. I'm not in a nazi, fascist or any other ideological group. I'm just observing what's going on and taking part in a discussion everybody SHOULD take part in without feeling they are getting silenced or attacked for not choosing a side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody else have a similar experiences or is it just me? I'm open for a total civil and open discussion if this sub wants to address the real issues.

       3 weeks is a pretty good run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been dealing with the exact same thing on a variety of different controversial issues for longer than 6 years because of this subreddit.  And it's not the subreddit that is the problem, it's the people who are afraid of free speech.  They are so terrified that their MSM narrative will be exposed as wrong that they lash out at us for discussing these things.

       They aren't necessarily shills (a stupid accusation) they are just invested in their own perception of reality.  It's hard to absorb the shock of learning "I fell for it".

       I think self worth does it for some of them, guilt does it for others etc etc.

       I think there are a multitude of reasons people have strong beliefs that they resist parting from.  Think about the racist 12 year old, it's most likely a generational indoctrination.  Versus the guy who only became racist at 30 years old, he probably had some personal experience that he attributed to race.

       I wish it were a simple question with a simple answer because it would be easy to deal with if that were the case.  Unfortunately it's a complex series of questions, none of which have simple clear answers.

       I've got some pretty nasty messages about how I'm helping usher in fascism after expressing the notion that violence won't help, and that the current goal is to divide and conquer. I literally had someone accuse me of not taking a side, call me nasty names, and in the next breath, speak of the false dichotomy being pushed by the media. Some days, this place is just bananas.

       It's all been dealt with. Not trying to make a bigger deal than necessary, just wanted to give people the heads up that if they receive hate and don't understand why, it could very well be for voicing peaceful conflict resolution since that opposes the current paradigm of fomenting civil war.

       I can't speak for u/ThisIsMyFifthAccount motive for asking for proof but this is r/conspiracy is it not? My first reaction to op's post was, where's the screenshots of the messages? Idk man, you do what you feel necessary but in a sub like this, proof to back up your claims is crucial to giving legitimacy to your claims. This whole place is founded on research and facts; your dismissiveness of the other redditor asking for proof and "TopMind" remark is unnecessary; in my opinion after reading your exchange, you're full of shit until you prove otherwise.

       That's fair. He asked for proof, I gave a reason why I don't wish to provide it. Yes, it's because he participates in TopMinds. It's a virulent hate sub full of snarky, sarcastic users who cross post to places like r/conspiracy for the purposes of mocking users. I don't agree with it and I'm not going to feed it.

       I'd rather be thought of as a liar than to offer them more ammunition. If you find fault with that, then so be it. Life goes on.

       What reason did you give besides you just didnt want to? I dont get it dude, all your posts are conspiracy related but you would rather be seen as a liar? If you feel that posting a screenshot to backup your claims is offering more ammunition for someone to call you out, then you probably didnt have much of a leg to stand on in the first place.

       Poor wittle guy

       You responded in the negative for screenshots before my recent comment on TopMinds** (where I was scolding the sub for ostracizing the crazy geostorm earthquake guy, which I thought was hilariously out there but showed positive qualities on behalf of the poster and harked back to the good ol' days on this sub before the dumb dumbs started showing up, making claims without providing easy evidence etc), and I doubt I've had any there previously for at least several comments page scrolls if ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also didn't explain why you had no screenshots in your first response, you said "it had been taken care of" in reference to whether you reported him, and then gave some limpwristed rationale that you're just spreading the word (still without proof of your messages or an explanation for why you had no screenshots of messages that are still accessible on your account). Now you're trying to cover by saying you're choosing not to provide evidence for your claims because you disagree with a subreddit I've visited, but that came after your first denial/obfuscation!  What's the story morning glory!  Post hoc ergo propter hoc!
      </p>
      <p>
       **caveat: I may have more comments there that could be found with a bunch of scrolling or one of those Reddit stalker sites, if you were so inclined...I don't make any particular effort to censor myself out of fear of having underemployed mouth breathers getting scared off from engaging in critical thinking (in this instance, I am calling you an underemployed mouth breather)

       You equate a refusal to comply with your request with deliberate obfuscation. I've explained everything I need to and have been entirely truthful. If it doesn't satisfy your needs, go make a post about it. I don't care about your opinion of me, think what you will. You know nothing of who I am, where I work, or how I breathe, so even bringing that up is strange. I wish you the best man, seriously.

       Still think you're a wanker but kudos to you for not rising to the bait, perhaps you're not part of the angst-y teenaged TD crowd after all. I stand by my recollection of the timeline of events, however, which says to me that you cannot produce said screenshots (rather than simply you will not...and yes I know you don't care, we've been through it).

       It was bait to try to get me to post it so he could report it for stalking/harassing the other user. It goes against site wide rules. Even if I had redacted the user names, I'm pretty sure he would have claimed I must have typed it myself.

       The room is getting a little crowded with elephants.    Look,  when we get close to the point where the deep state and all the corporate money supporting it,  and the fact that the elite is so corrupt at this point that they are pretty much going to have to be put in prison to get the power away from them,   pretty much everything else,  especially identity politics and right and left and democrat and republican and Trump and Hillary etc.  etc.  is a
       <strong>
        FUCKING DISTRACTION
       </strong>
       .    And most of the bozos around here would just as soon as make their number one priority pedophilia or old statues or whatever the bs of the day is.    Once the main problem is addressed,  then the obvious criminality of pedophilia and crimes against the people can end,  but till we find a way to stop Citizens United and all that buying off of the top,  the control by the elite,  the rest of it is meant to distract,  and to keep us flitting about on details that are not going to change the basic problem.

       Okay, this is probably a very unpopular opinion, but the answer is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't discuss it, don't read about, don't watch it on TV, don't click links about it.

       I think it's a good idea to compartmentalize your different Reddit interests under different alts to avoid the very real threat of doxxing and seed your account that you use for conspiracy with misinformation about things like where you live, what you do for work, family details, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use a different alt for sports, parenting and gardening because they tend to reveal geographic and personal information that you don't want everyone here to know. They can harrass this account all day- which they do.

       It sure is annoying, but from what i'm hearing from friends who also visits this sub it sounds widespread. It's just all so sad that your opinions should be a reason for threats or ridicule in some idiotic attempt to make you not speak your mind no matter if you are right, left, liberal or moderate and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most of the heated arguments are from left leaning people bringing up past events from a hundred years and back in time to prove how justified their cause is. You don't move forward as a society by dwelling on bullshit from the past and trying to dictate the future. Thats straight up propaganda and indoctrination.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the issues need to be talked about even though i myself won't even make a significant impact i still welcome a proper discussion without the shouting and finger pointing.

       You are perfectly on point. The rift in both sides is pretty immense and the way of thinking of both groups is entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as you invite discussion and civility, I fear it is not reciprocal with the other group. The rare few that do usually start spouting bs and screaming lalalalala when faced with facts :(
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think we'll keep moving in the direction of truth and as we do, those one the other side will autoconvert because of their tribalism.

       I dunno if you say that guy that "looked like" a "neo-nazi" in boston that got sucker punched, he was there to protest against "neo-nazis" (there were not any lol) and after he got up people asked him what he was gonna do and he looked really unsure if he wanted to stay at that point lol

       Linda Sarsour calling Jake Tapper a white supremacist was funny as fuck too. So yeah, by the nature of their movement of intolerance disguised as one of inclusion, they will out do each other in political correctness until they all perish

       I don't know a single person that identifies as anything other than a person.  No one claims to be part of these so called groups.  I think it is all bullshit propaganda to make people think a certain way about other people.    Problem is the general public doesn't believe they are seeing propaganda on TV every night.

       A lot of people get death threats from some anti conspiracy group who monitors this sub. I was getting them from like 10 different accounts until they finally managed to (probably) move into the next user they wanted to scare. It's just an intimidation tactic and I don't think they are serious. Nothing ever happened to me, so you are probably fine. Just send the usernames to the admins. This group probably uses proxies though, so all that will happen is their accounts will be banned.

       The elephant is communism and it is supposedly superior to nazism. What people don't get is that both are wrong.

       Damn this thread is being downvoted hard.  He makes a good point.  We used to discuss things here rather civil.  Now there is so much name calling and labeling users as this or that.

       Well i look at the downvotes as proving myself right and i was totally expecting it. That people wish to take part in the discussion means more to me than my thread getting downvoted.

       Thank you all for contributing. It means a whole lot to me

       Don't ever let someone try to make you feel bad because of the age of your account.  Burn your accounts and burn often.  There are some crazy ass people out there.  Ask stonetear how it feels to be found...

       I've had a few random messages but never anything concerted. I assume if they sound like they're mentally unstable they probably are...

       Ignore them. Like most children, the lack of attention is too much and they'll move on to something else.

       It's not just you, and it's on both sides. It's frightening. Burner accounts are the way to go.
