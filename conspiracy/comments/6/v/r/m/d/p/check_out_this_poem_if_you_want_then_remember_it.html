<p><strong>The Blind Men and the Elephant</strong>
John Godfrey Saxe (1816-1887)</p>

<pre><code>It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
&quot;God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a WALL!&quot;

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, &quot;Ho, what have we here,
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me &#39;tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a SPEAR!&quot;

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
&quot;I see,&quot; quoth he, &quot;the Elephant
Is very like a SNAKE!&quot;

The Fourth reached out an eager hand, 
And felt about the knee
&quot;What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,&quot; quoth he:
&#39;Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a TREE!&quot;

The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: &quot;E&#39;en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a FAN!&quot;

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
&quot;I see,&quot; quoth he, &quot;the Elephant
Is very like a ROPE!&quot;

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!
</code></pre>

<p>If that last verse doesn&#39;t describe this sub (and reddit in general, I don&#39;t know what does.</p>

<p>tldr; when we each attempt to describe something complex, something we don&#39;t have full knowledge of, we tend to come up with different ways of (partially) describing the same thing. </p>

<p>The wisest thing to do is to attempt to integrate what you know (your findings) with what others know, instead of arguing about who&#39;s wrong and who&#39;s right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, as you note with your last sentence,  the trick is to collate all the sayings of the wise men, figure out where the commonalities lie, build a matrix of info-dots to connect to other info-dots, and let the incoming information sort itself naturally into the matrix of info-dots.</p>

<p>Some posts in r/con are new dots to add to the matrix.  Some posts are dot connectors.</p>

<p>Thanks. I just wanted to promote a little unity and try something different.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the puzzle is or how many pieces there are. Sometimes I think I can see the picture but later learn that was just a part. Occasionally I find out pieces don&#39;t even belong.</p>

<p>Great post. </p>
