    <div class="md"><p>From what i have read, the original goal was invisibility; surrounding a ship with devices that emitted electro magnetic pulses. The ship was rendered invisible, but it also was spotted at another port miles away before it rematerialized. Crew members who wore metallic devices (watches) suffered worse effects, with the metal burning and sticking to them. Some people were stuck halfway into floors/walls, had mental issues, and sometimes would spontaneously burst into flames at a later date. Some theorize tesla&#39;s work was involved, others say Einstein was in on it... could be both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I think most of them are. The Philadelphia experiment proves it in a way. So does many of other phenomenons science can&#39;t explain. It must be that the core scientific principles about the creation of reality are wrong, and so that prevents us from understanding these events with our current models.  </p>

<p>The only explanation I can think of for the Philadelphia experiment is that two dimensions overlapped.  But I dont think I could scientifically explain a dimension of reality, and how more than one could overlap.</p>

<p>I could do it metaphysically Somewhat. With a touch of science fictio.. Somehow they initiated some sort of portal through the veil. Entered it briefly, went to a somewhat parallel Earth even into another time frame of the Earth they were in.  But do to lack of understanding they didn&#39;t return properly.  They returned off center. They should have returned and be overlayed directly over the exact same space they had left.</p>

<p>But there was something that interfered. They were in state similar to how we think a rainbow is. A reflection off water.  In that type of state, and the people watching started freaking out and pushing buttons and actually interrupted it, and that caused the refocus to not be a seamless one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, this seems a good enough place to drop this word picture:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a somewhat parallel Earth, or even into another time frame of the Earth they were in</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we consider time in itself as a true dimension such as the 3-d of space, we can think of &quot;sideways&quot; time, when &quot;straight&quot; time, which aligns unidirectionally from past to future, is seen as a layer of simultaneous times separated from each other by contingency (that is, the many possible actions that could have been taken in this world but were not).</p>

<p>We actually use this expanded time dimensionality quite commonly in ordinary speech and thought. We say &quot;The British might have defeated the Colonists and the USA would not now exist.&quot; If that contingency (the American Revolution was stopped) had both been a real possibility, and then had actually happened, then there would at present be a &quot;parallel world&quot; in which we would have a very different political history (assuming &quot;we&quot; is meaningful, since perhaps &quot;we&quot; would never have been born). However, if we think only of the contingency of the most recent presidential election (had Clinton not Trump won), then the alternative &quot;time frame&quot; would be very similar to the present reality, just with us talking about different political events than the ones we actually are.</p>

<p>Science since the Greeks has been pretty strong on the unreality of contingencies. Our linguistic structures are well-adapted to orient conversations as to whether what we are saying has happened, could have happened, is happening, will happen, or might happen. The very definition of science is based on throwing the statements about &quot;could have happened&quot; or &quot;might happen&quot; out the window.</p>

<p>The exception of course is the science of statistics and probability, which deals with contingency directly. Like the weather, a flipped coin, a rolled dice, or any other randomly generated number cannot be predicted, because we cannot measure the multitude of influences that will cause the result. Like an atom discharging a subatomic particle to kill a Schroedenger&#39;s Cat, only the ability to measure any contingent result is sufficient for science to admit its reality. </p>

<p>Hugh Everett&#39;s multi-universe interpretation of quantum-scale randomness is the suggestion that two parallel universes are created when the cat either dies or lives. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia Experiment somehow transported into such a parallel universe, and barely made it back.</p>

<p>One more comment: most people miss the implications of living inside an infinitely infinite swarm of possible universes, both at the largest (infinity of universes), the smallest (infinity of particulate structures) and personal (infinity of life-stories).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantum entanglement moves faster than light.  Negative matter. The most credible way of sending signals faster than light is via negative matter. It has been proven, mathematically.  The way of breaking the light barrier may be through GR, General Relativity and the moving/bending of space time. Though only in theory and one can not prove that NM, or negative matter exists, this is one of the ways matter can exceed the speed of light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It possibly did, or at least the concept.  The problem with calling it aether by Nikola&#39;s time is it was a word already associated with mumbo-jumbo and any talks of such a thing had scientists laughed out of the community.</p>

<p>In current times, dark energy is a proven thing which is being once again widely studied.  Except we no longer call it aether even though it has superfluid like properties.  While technically right, I think it is a problem in translation as the classical definition refers to aether as a medium.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the linked quora thread in all of its greatness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tesla opposed relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and was arguing for the aether theory. He made several unsupported claims that he discovered effects which violate SR. But then, he didn&#39;t even accept the fact that atoms are mutable and consist of smaller particles and believed electrons are physically impossible...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From The New York Sun (July 10, 1935):
He found time while surveying his own past to express his sharp disagreement with the theories of Prof. Albert Einstein. He announced that the theory of relativity is &quot;a mass of error and deceptive ideas and opposed to common sense,&quot; and that &quot;not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved.&quot;</p>

<p>From The New York Times (July 11, 1935):
He described relativity as &quot;a beggar, wrapped in purple, whom ignorant people took for a king.&quot; In support of his statement he cited a number of experiments he had conducted, he said, as far back as 1896 on the cosmic ray. He has measured cosmic ray velocities from Antarus, he said, which he found to be fifty times greater than the speed of light, thus demolishing, he contended, one of the basic pillars of the structure of relativity, according to which there can be no speed greater than that of light.</p>

<p>From New York Herald Tribune (September 11, 1932)
I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.</p>

<p>Some quite bizarre thoughts from Popular Science (November 1928), on electrons and radioactivity, showing remarkable misunderstanding of some already widely accepted at that time theories:
&quot;To account for its apparently small mass, science conceives the electron as a hollow sphere, a sort of bubble,&quot; Tesla says. &quot;Now, a bubble can exist in such a medium as a gas or liquid because its internal pressure is not altered by deformation. But if, as supposed, the internal pressure of an electron is due to the repulsion of electric masses, the slightest conceivable deformation must result in the destruction of the bubble!
&quot;Just to mention another improbability, the force tending to tear an electron apart is, in pounds per square inch, represented by the staggering figure of 256,899 followed by twenty-one zeros - and this is 513,798,000,000,000,000,000 times greater than the tension that tungsten wire can withstand? And yet it does not burst! Not even when it is hurled against an obstacle with a speed hundreds of thousands times greater than that of a bullet!</p>

<p>And – more widely interesting in this day of radio – this strange, many-sided man clings to the opinion he expressed in his scientific investigations published from 1896-1898, that the source of all rays we know is always a stream of tangible particles or ‘corpuscles,’ rather than waves or vibrations. Even before the discovery of radium, Tesla expressed his belief that radioactive rays were of this sort, a view ridiculed at that time. When radium was discovered it was found actually to emit particles of matter – flying nuclei of helium atoms, called ‘alpha’ rays. Tesla has maintained ever since that radium is not a generator but a transformer of energy, the emanations being caused by cosmic rays of immense power capable of penetrating all obstacles however thick.</p>

<p>And more strange thoughts from Galveston Daily News (March 13, 1932):
&quot;As I revolve in my mind the thoughts in answer to your question I find the most wonderful thing is the utter aberration of the scientific mind during the last twenty-five years. In that time the relativity theory, the electron theory, the quantum theory, the theory of radioactivity and others have been worked out and developed to an amazing degree. And yet probably not less than 90 per cent of what is thought today to be demonstrable scientific truth is nothing but unrealizable dreams.</p>

<p>&quot;What is &#39;thought&#39; in relativity, for example, is not science, but some kind of metaphysics based on abstract mathematical principles and conceptions which will be forever incomprehensible to beings like ourselves whose whole knowledge is derived from a three-dimensional world.&quot;</p>

<p>The idea of the atom being formed of electrons and protons which go whirling round each other like a miniature sun and planets is an invention of the imagination, he said, and has no relation to the real nature of matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps no other has given rise to so many erroneous ideas and chimerical hopes. Everybody speaks of electrons as something entirely definite and real. Still, the fact is that nobody has isolated it and nobody has measured its charge. Nor does anybody know what it really is.</p>

<p>&quot;In order to explain the observed phenomena, atomic structures have been imagined, none of which can possibly exist. But the worst illusion to which modern thought has led is the idea of &#39;indeterminacy.&#39; To make this clear, I may remark that heretofore we have in positive science assumed that every effect is the result of a preceding cause.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as I am concerned, I can say that after years of concentrated thought and investigation there is no truth in nature of which I would be more fully convinced. But the new theories of &#39;indeterminacy&#39; state this is not true, then an effect cannot be predicted in advance.</p>

<p>&quot;If two planets collide at certain time and certain place, this is to the student of positive science an inevitable result of preceding interactions between the bodies; and if our knowledge would be adequate, we would be able to foretell the event accurately.</p>

<p>&quot;But in the spirit of the new theories this would simply be an accident. &#39;Indeterminacy&#39; introduces into the world of inert matter a principle which might virtually be compared with the universal illusion of free will.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, there is no such thing. In years of experimenting I have found that every thought I conceive, every act I perform, is the result of external impressions on my senses.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes,  a magnetic field. In 1925 physicists began talking about the spin of the electron. Shortly afterward the started looking at the spin of the 
Components of the nucleus itself. The spin isn&#39;t the orbital motion of an electron around a nucleus, but  actually more of a measurement of the electrons magnetic field.</p>

<p>Probability field might be a betterway to describe it. Because within this field is what I think is The Impression we pattern into it. So this field would be linked to our thoughts and emotions and basically the blueprint of our perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course.  </p>

<p>Instead of looking to science I researched channeled materials for info about how reality is created. In the 60&#39;s Jane Roberts started channeling Seth.  Seth explained many aspects of creation, and dictated many books. In them he touches upon what he termed CU&#39;s,or Consciousness Units.  So I will take an excerpt from the web to show you the angle he approaches it from:</p>

<p>&quot;Now: there are electromagnetic structures, so to speak, that are presently beyond your (scientific) instruments, units that are the basic carriers of perception. They have a very brief “life” in your terms. Their size varies.</p>

<p>Several units may combine, for example; many units may combine. To put this as simply as possible, it is not so much that they move through space, as that they use space to move through. There is a difference.</p>

<p>[Note: This may seem complicated at first, but once we see that what Seth calls “space” is in fact the aetheric energy, it makes sense. Since the units are made of aetheric energy, they must use aetheric energy to travel. They are not self-contained “particles” that move through an empty vacuum.]</p>

<p>&quot;In a manner of speaking, thermal qualities are involved, and also laws of attraction and repulsion. The units charge the air through which they pass, and draw to them other units.</p>

<p>The units are not stationary in the way that, say, a cell is stationary within the body. Even a cell only appears stationary. These units have no “home.” They are built up in response to emotional intensity.</p>

<p>They are one form that emotional energy takes. They follow their own rules of attraction and repulsion. As a magnet, you see, will attract with its filaments, so these units attract their own kind and form patterns, which then appear to you as perception.</p>

<p>[Note: This is easy to miss. Seth is saying that everything we perceive is some form of pattern built up from consciousness units. Since they do form all of physical matter, this is a very accurate statement indeed.]</p>

<p>&quot;Now: the fetus utilizes these units. [Note: Seth had been discussing the fetus earlier in the discussion.] So does any consciousness, including that of a plant.</p>

<p>Cells are not just responsive to light because this is the order of things, but because an emotional desire to perceive light is present.</p>

<p>[Note: This idea of an “emotional desire to perceive light” conforms with cutting-edge research cited by Gregg Braden in his various books. The work of Garaiev and Poponin entitled the “DNA Phantom Effect” has found that a DNA molecule can be inserted in a cylinder with light passing through it, and the DNA will actually attract the light and cause it to spiral through the molecule!</p>

<p>Furthermore, when the DNA is removed, the light continues to spiral as if the DNA were still there. (We will have a lot more to say about this in Volume III, as it relates to evolution and how the torsion wave forms the DNA molecule.)</p>

<p>This is obviously a very strange finding, but we can see that Seth helps us to understand it; the DNA has an “emotional desire to perceive light,” as it naturally attracts light into itself. This might not seem possible until we realize that all life and matter has some degree of consciousness, since it is made of “intelligent energy.”]</p>

<p>&quot;The desire appears on this other level in the form of these electromagnetic units, which then cause a light sensitivity.</p>

<p>These units are freewheeling. They can be used in normal perception or what you call extrasensory perception. I will discuss their basic nature at a later session, and I would like to tie this in with the fetus, since the fetus is highly involved with perceptive mechanisms.</p>

<p>(&quot;Next session will be fine.&quot;)</p>

<p>It is not that you cannot devise instruments to perceive these units.</p>

<p>Your scientists are simply asking the wrong questions, and do not think in terms of such freewheeling structures.</p>

<p>[Note: Seth implies that we can indeed design instruments that would be able to perceive these units.</p>

<p>We will have a lot to say about this in Volume III, as there are several Russian scientists who have designed very effective torsion-field detectors. Also, this work has been replicated by Lt. Col. Tom Bearden (ret.) among others in the US.</p>

<p>The pyramid work of Joe Parr, also covered in Volume III, clearly shows these fields as well. So, the latest research shows that since the time when Seth gave these readings in 1969, some scientists are now asking the &quot;right questions.&quot;]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pleasure, I personally love the ideas. And I do view reality as created by myself in this way. Through emotional intensity and pattern. Exploring the mechanical aspect of it is all conceptual, meaning you are using an inner sense to actually form the understanding in consciousness so that you can then sense it. Every thing every moment of our lives is this process. We send an energy outward from ourselves and consciousness forms around it.</p>

<p>Our interaction in this way was brought on by your emotional intensity and mine together. It had never existed before,  We brought it into creation through this process that Seth describes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You pointed out a potential flaw in my open mindedness, yes. There&#39;s many benefits and alot less stress to the world when you hold most ideas in a &quot;quantum&quot; state in your brain. Things can be true and not true and both (silver lining, kernels of truth). When discussing metaphysical concepts this is especially necessary because when it comes down to it there&#39;s very little that can be &quot;proven&quot; scientifically when it comes to the metaphysical. </p>

<p>Though if you delve into the CIA FOIA docs you&#39;d be surprised what previously metaphysical concepts that stewed in old books for hundreds of years  were proven scientifically </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While similar to double think,  it is not. Wikipedia puts it like this...&quot; Although Nineteen Eighty-Four is most famous for the Party&#39;s pervasive surveillance of everyday life, this control means that the population of Oceania—all of it and including the ruling elite—could be controlled and manipulated merely through the alteration of everyday thought and language. Newspeak is the method for controlling thought through language; doublethink is the method of directly controlling thought.</p>

<p>Earlier in the book, doublethink is explained as being able to control your memories, to be able to manually forget something, then to forget about forgetting. This is demonstrated by O&#39;Brien, during the time when Winston Smith is being tortured toward the end of the book.</p>

<p>Newspeak incorporates doublethink, as it contains many words that create assumed associations between contradictory meanings, especially true of fundamentally important words such as good and evil, right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and justice and injustice.</p>

<p>In the case of workers at the Records Department in the Ministry of Truth, doublethink means being able to falsify public records, and then believe in the new history that they themselves have just rewritten. As revealed in Goldstein&#39;s Book, the Ministry&#39;s name is itself an example of doublethink: the Ministry of Truth is really concerned with lies. The other ministries of Airstrip One are similarly named: the Ministry of Peace is concerned with war, the Ministry of Love is concerned with torture, and the Ministry of Plenty is concerned with starvation. The three slogans of the Party—War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength—are also examples.[1]&quot;</p>

<p>So yes there is a similarity, but this is a state imposed method of mind control, where as mine is a self imposed,only regarding metaphysical concepts. Though the history lessons we received in school have put some double think , new speak , in ALL of our minds. Who decides what&#39;s true? I know I don&#39;t go around &quot;forgetting about forgetting a facts&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Proven&quot; What?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with quantum <em>statistics</em> (mechanics is a bit too far.)  Just because the math helps us with predictions doesn&#39;t mean the philosophy behind it is right.  </p>

<p>The way I see it, statistics is the admittance that we <em>dont</em> have all the of information about nature.</p>

<p>Continuing with special relativity, it&#39;s about the furthest thing from proven.  We have no clue whether time is actually slowing or the idea that matter moving through aether affects it.  If aether has some weight to it (it can, depending on the model chosen to analyze) than I would expect matter moving through it to perhaps affect it.  </p>

<p>When I first learned about <em>c</em>, my first question was &quot;How do we really know, besides through math, that an object nearing the speed of light will have &#39;near infinite&#39; math,&quot; and it seems like one of those questions man invented that cannot be answered through any known means and may take a long time to resolve a more thorough and definitive answer. It seems like the mass claim may be more of a distortion based on the amount of energy it would take to move a body at that speed destabilizing the structure of the object itself, like an explosion without combustion.</p>

The interpretation of the increasing difficulty in adding momentum to objects as their velocity increases can be interpreted in a few ways.  Religious prone human scientists, many whom reverse Einstein have chosen a model and ran with it, yelling within the confines of their echo chamber that nonsensical things are happening, and that we juts have to accept the unintuitive nature of these nonsensical thing.s</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually kind of funny when you think about.  It&#39;s plausible, unlikely, and in the face of other models that also similar predict the behavior, we should be quite critical of the zealots who (incorrectly) profess they <strong>know</strong> what&#39;s happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tellinger did a couple vids about the ancient structures in Africa that emanate a different reading in electro magnetism. Ideas from this type of research would relate to Where the ancients placed their structures. He and quite a few others call these areas points on a World Grid. At these points energy constantly enters our system:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/coordinatepoints.html">http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/coordinatepoints.html</a></p>

<p>So like the elephant in the zero point room is &#39;How did ancient man use these areas?&#39; </p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/user12206452/videos">Ancient Structures</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GkTj-NwLG0Y">Tellinger on Ancient Africa</a></p>

<p>What I think is going on is we are missing a piece. If we could ascertain all of the points in the world energy enters the system, then we just need a proper mechanism to harness, transmit, amplify, etc, that energy.  </p>

<p>The pyramids for instance would be what this device was placed in. It&#39;s probably really simple to.</p>

<p>But something like this, it&#39;s called a zero point antenna. Or a beginning of its concept:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This &quot;world grid&quot; I&#39;ve heard it referred to as the Christ Consciousness Grid. It is a series of lay lines around the planet with vital intersections at different critical points (Stonehenge, Giza pyramids, Mayan pyramids, and other historical locations that have remained hidden in obscurity). The Grid purportedly enables us to connect to other living creatures through an alternative sense. I&#39;ve heard it referred to as the reason Multiple Discovery exists. Multiple discovery is when two scientists unknown to each other make a discovery at the same time.  The concept is that they feed off of each other&#39;s thoughts and ideas that are just &quot;out there&quot; on this grid. They are attuned to the same concept and therefore pick up on each other&#39;s thoughts, emotions, and ideas. Incidentally, there is a conspiracy theory that destroying this grid is part of the elites goals. It was part of the reason nuclear &quot;tests&quot; were done for so long in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s. It was also stated that was the true reason they are hell bent on controlling Afghanistan. All of this was shared with me personally from a very credible source. I&#39;ve dug and cannot find anything regarding this theory on the internet. To be sure there is plenty out there on this grid, but no conversation/sources regarding a conspiracy theory to destroy it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A desire to communicate may be a common tie to tap into each others thoughts?  It could actually be this. It would be the simplest response. Possibly without the disruptions to the grid I outlined the ability to &quot;communicate&quot; may be greater than what we could imagine. Maybe the reason for this fucking device I&#39;m typing on is to further suppress this innate ability, as there is less of a need for biological long term communication. Instead of literally blowing up the grid, they replaced it with a physical communication device versus ethereal. Personally I have a different opinion on why the pyramids evolved all over the world at roughly the same time. I love your idea, and will have to give it more thought. </p>

<p>Another simple answer is a similar culture that interacted with both with the intention, possibly, of increasing the effect of the grid. This culture would have either been very mobile, relatively mobile and highly displaced, or an unknown ancient sophisticated culture.  So obviously ET for very mobile. I think however we have vastly underestimated the ability of these ancient cultures to navigate the globe. They had a very keen understanding of astronomy and were obviously industrious. Displaced would be Atlantians or the like. Ancient sophisticated culture is least probable. If our &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; culture collapsed overnight we would be hunter/gatherers in less than a generation with little desire to construct monoliths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. I view our technology to be a reflection of what we do as a consciousness. More akin to what we do subjectively, or with our latent psychic abilities and subjective senses.  </p>

<p>And yes the reason they are latent is because Materialists have basically ruled the world for a while. They have made everything about materialism, even our spirituality. But The web itself is just a reflection of the interconnection in the collective consciousness, right? When you drop it&#39;s materialism what is it?</p>

<p>We could as a whole drop all the devices we use and then turn our perception inside out. By using our inner senses to do the same thing we use the web for. Or the phones... Phones are telepathy. The t.v. is a thought coupled with imagination. All things that send and receive data show how consciousness is a web of interlinked energy across a worldwide energy grid.</p>

<p>So you could say Technology is showing us the nature of our own consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say I&#39;m skeptical of a lot of the claims about Tesla made here, but I&#39;m willing to have my mind changed. So a couple questions for those who think he discovered/invented things that have been suppressed: </p>

<ul>
<li>What are the specific Tesla technologies you think have been suppressed?</li>
<li>What evidence do you have that these technologies are feasible (other than the fact that the government confiscated his research)?</li>
<li>Why has no one (outside of government) been able to reproduce any of these technologies in the 75 years since his death, or have they?</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific sources would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible. Would like to hear what others have to say about this -- I&#39;m not too learned myself.</p>

<p>People also claim that the wing of a beetle has levitation properties and I&#39;m reminded of the [Egyptians] seeming obsession with scarabs. &quot;Beetle levetation&quot; yields some good results on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scarab is also generally associated with the Moon.</p>

<p>&#39;For the Egyptians, Cancer was represented not by a crab, but by a scarab (or dung) beetle, sacred to the Egyptians as a creature of immortality.  The beetle is clearly linked to the moon’s twenty-eight day cycle. It deposits its ball of eggs, rolled in dung in the earth, for the space of twenty-eight days, which is the time it takes for the moon to complete a full revolution through the twelve zodiacal signs.  The Egyptians considered the twenty-ninth day to be a day of resurrection, and according to lunar markings, there occurs the baptism of the beetle, when the scarabeus casts his ball into the water, opening to give birth to the young beetle.  This immersion and baptism became naturally associated with renewal and regeneration.  In this way, the lunar god was always declared to be self-created, never born.  This symbolism seems to fit very aptly for the sign of Cancer, so seemingly introverted and self-contained.&#39;</p>

<ul>
<li>Egyptian cosmology is much different obviously. They weren&#39;t ball earthers. So they probably did see many similarities of &#39;levitation&#39; in the Moon. They didn&#39;t believe in relativity or gravity Theories.</li>

<p>It seems to me that anybody who sees <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0i-fWRjQeM">this short video</a>, and is truly open-minded i.e. willing to challenge their own beliefs, will feel inclined to begin looking for evidence to support those beliefs. This is real skepticism.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s a broader problem than just Tesla. Among conspiracy theorists in general, there&#39;s a certain tendency toward dogmatic thinking, usually of the form &quot;Authority A makes claim X, therefore ~X must be true and anyone who believes X is either duped or paid by A.&quot; It&#39;s just lazy thinking, IMO, and completely contrary to the type of critical thinking and skepticism necessary to understand our world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, and the feeling is mutual. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;d be interesting to poll this community to see how they got into conspiracy theories in the first place. I imagine for many, it was 9/11. The thing with that is, a lot of the early 9/11 conspiracy videos (I&#39;m thinking Loose Change, specifically) made a lot of leaps in logic and tried to pin the event on certain players rather than make a thorough accounting of what we actually know. </p>

<p>From &quot;there are glaring inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission Report,&quot; it does not necessarily follow that &quot;Bush did it,&quot; or &quot;Mossad did it,&quot; or &quot;CIA did it.&quot; The official narrative is not our story, and we don&#39;t need to prove what really happened. We just need to point to official story and say &quot;this, this, and this make no sense.&quot; The burden of proof is on them, and they have failed to meet it. That is a much stronger indictment of the official narrative than any of the various alternative theories. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say we should not try to piece together what might have happened and who might have been involved, but I don&#39;t think we gain anything or persuade the fence-sitters by saying &quot;this is what happened and this is who did it,&quot; if we don&#39;t have a rock solid case to back it up. </p>

<p>Not sure how I got on the 9/11 tangent, but my more general point is that we&#39;re unlikely to arrive at truth by selectively picking the facts and patterns that fit a narrative that <em>we want to be true</em>. Even if we accidentally stumble on the truth in this manner, we won&#39;t be able to demonstrate it to others, and certainly not to critical thinkers. </p>

<p>I think I was getting at the idea that many people&#39;s introduction to conspiracy was through the idea of learning a new &quot;truth&quot; to replace an old &quot;truth&quot; they used to believe. They never went through that often tedious process of looking at the arguments for a position, trying to find any inconsistencies or fallacies in the logic, and then doing the same for the alternate positions. They just accepted an answer that for one reason or another appealed to them more than their old answer. It was more emotional than rational. And if they never developed the skill of skeptical analysis afterwards, all they want to do is <em>be given</em> more answers that they like better. </p>

<p>I&#39;m reminded of the Gore Vidal quote: &quot;I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist — I&#39;m a conspiracy analyst.&quot; The difference might seem minute to some, yet I think it captures exactly what we&#39;re trying to get at here. We should be striving to analyze all the facts and data we can get our hands on rather than try to project on them a theory that in some way makes us feel better about ourselves or our world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, too was wondering about the John Quincy St. Clair patents. </p>

<p>Looking through historical St. Clairs I found some significant names on the list:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Clair">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Clair</a></p>

<p>Notice especially Jean de Saint-Clair, alleged sixth Grand Master of the Priory of Sion</p>

<p>Wikipedia claims the Priory of Sion was a hoax fraternal society... that it was allegedly founded on Mt. Zion in the kingdom of Jerusalem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_Sion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_Sion</a> and all sorts of obviously made up legends about it. I wonder what the truth of it is?</p>

<p>This site discusses how he claims to have communicated with pleiadians <a href="http://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200604284330.st_clair_hyperinventor">http://zapatopi.net/blog/?post=200604284330.st_clair_hyperinventor</a> . Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. </p>

<p>Certainly seems like an intelligence operation. However, it could be a way of seeding concepts into society. I&#39;m not sure if any of them are viable though. Its interesting because these types of patents are typically banned by the patent office ( which was brought out in some recent FOIA documents which I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6t8y5g/sensitive_application_warning_system_saws_foia/">a post about</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the hell, who is this guy? One dude vs the NSA. I wonder what happened with the lawsuit?</p>

<p>&quot;NSA operatives can use
this to covertly debilitate subjects by simulating auditory hallucinations, characteristic of paranoid schizophrenia.&quot;</p>

<p>This is quite interesting to me given that I kept getting these my senior year of college; at the time I suspected I was getting harassed by intelligence operatives but I had no proof. People I told this to thought I was being paranoid. I think its likely that I was getting gangstalked for a few main reasons: </p>

<p>1) I was attending a decently large school; these colleges are known to have agents monitoring and subverting students who go &quot;against the establishment&quot; </p>

<p>2) It didn&#39;t start until after I had glimmers of unity consciousness and I awakened to the fact that other&#39;s wellbeing is my own. This was after several months of meditating regularly.  This of course accompanied a deeper understanding of the power structures that control our society and so I became more vocal about this; posting wikileaks stuff on facebook (which i later realized was being censored). </p>

<p>3) The auditory hallucinations went away after I moved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I just was reading though <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20060144035?dq=%22John%20Quincy%20St.%20Clair%22">this  patent</a> on the spacecraft. I have an issue with this line: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, in our dimension, the speed of light is 299792458 meters per second. Hyperspace energy has a speed of light equal to one meter per second</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find this very unlikely that the hyperspace speed of light is one meter per second. The meter and second are arbitrary measures created by humans. I suppose it could be on the order of 1 m/s but that is still a pretty huge coincidence. Maybe this guys is just &quot;blowing smoke&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From experiments with the magnetic vortex wormhole generator, it is known that the proper combination of electromagnetic fields, together with this negative energy, can create a wormhole through which smoke can be blown into hyperspace. </p>

Is that shape meant to be part of a DNA helix type shape?
And basic sample of consciousness or the universe?
Is it anything to do with the Plankton length?
I know they show animations but it still is confusing without enough context
to visualize what exactly that shape is representing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I profoundly disagree. I guess Copernicus, Newton and even relatively advanced early civilisations like the Mayans were all just distractions and misleads? Science is a learning progress, not an absolute truth (even though truth is its ultimate, unreachable goal). Einstein did a mighty fine job of advancing human kind a significant amount on this scientific journey, especially when it comes to practical application of his theory (good luck posting on Reddit/using a computer without hundreds if not thousands of different applications of his theories). After a while, as humankind&#39;s pooled knowledge grows and new discoveries are made, his theories too will be refined, retuned and perhaps even completely rethought. This is, as I explained, the nature of science. I just wish he would have been alive to experience modern quantum mechanics, no doubt in my mind he would&#39;ve had some pretty rad insights :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but these were used for covert harassment, that&#39;s the big difference. These weapons you are talking about, that were used in Iraq, operate in a frequency that it&#39;s expected to heat the skin, not the insides, but that&#39;s not the limit of the directed energy attacks, as the same principle (with different wavelength) can be used to cause actual internal- organ damage. </p>

<p>If you are a strong dissenter or political dissident and suddenly you are remotely harassed in your own home, how are you going to prove this? Are your health issues enough to state that you are being remotely harassed with directed energy weapons? We know this case because the targets were diplomats, but we might be ignoring how countries that aren&#39;t very human rights friendly can use them. </p>

<p>Maybe the suicide by bullet in the back of the head or suicide by polonium and other techniques not limited to hostile countries (who knows if the US do them too), might get a lot easier to perpetrate against enemies or annoyances. We need to bring this vulnerability to the table and push for regulations, shielding and detectors.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon an excerpt which was rather alarming to me:</p>

<p>Firstly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OPERATORS, ELECTRONICS TECHNICIANS, MILITARY PERSONNEL
AND THE LIKE.  THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SOVIET AND U.S. OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS.  BOTH
COUNTRIES CONTINUOUSLY REEXAMINE THEIR SCIENTIFIC
BASIS.  THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY STANDARD IS 10
MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER (10,000 MICROWATTS).
IT IS BASED ON MINIMIZING THE HEAT STRESS PLACED ON THE
BODY BY EXPOSURE LEVELS ABOVE 10 MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE
CENTIMETER.</p>

<p>THE SOVIET OCCUPATIONAL STANDARD IS 1,000 TIMES LOWER,
10 MICROWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER FOR A WORKING DAY.
IN SETTING STANDARDS THE SOVIETS HAVE TAKEN AN APPROACH
WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH SCIENTISTS OF
THE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN EUROPE BELIEVE IS JUSTIFIED
BY EITHER SCIENTIFIC DATA OR <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interpretation of this, is that US Scientists have the freedom to set the level of <em>acceptable exposure</em> to anything they wish, based on experience? Would that be a possible explanation for such a discrepancy detailed between the varying levels of US and Soviet acceptable exposure?</p>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate; Can anyone think of possible (TPTB) motivation for the US acceptable exposure to be so much higher?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting interpretation, acceptable exposure discrepancy. However we have to dismiss symptoms/temporal illnesses and harassment stories (with testimonies extremely similar to Cuban diplomats), the issue that it was the only embassy with abnormal exposure levels (after dept. of state sent detectors to other embassies) and the use of aluminium shielding in the embassy.</p>

<p>Discrepancy about safety levels are one thing, but I&#39;m not sure what could be the alternative to the symptoms and harassment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking at Electro Magnetic theory recently and there is at least one massive hole in it.  Everywhere says to ignore magnetism in calculations for simplicity and it still works.</p>

<p>Furthermore the lack of interaction between a so called electro<em>magnetic</em> field and magnetic fields doesn&#39;t appear to exist.<br/>
The closest anyone has got to affecting light with magnetism was to change the circular polarization slightly, and that requires a medium, it doesn&#39;t work in air and wouldn&#39;t work in a vacuum suggesting it&#39;s the medium causing the effect and not the magnetic field. </p>

A moving magnetic field produces an electric current which produces a magnetic field.  And that magnetic field can interact wih the electric current again.

The experimenter was demonstrating how certain kinds of geometry can be used to minimize the electromagnetic resistance and vastly increase the efficiency of generators.</p>

<p>A generator that runs off of moving magnets will create an electric current that generates a magentic field that - IF the design is not careful - will oppose the motion of the magnets (field of the magnet interacts with magnetic field of the electric current), thereby reducing the efficiency of the generator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has to do with multiplication. Weird scalar stuff (from what explanations I&#39;ve seen) generally has a lot to do with waveform properties. And in electronics it&#39;s possible to do waveform multiplication.</p>

<p>Basically the square root of a negative produces an &quot;imaginary&quot; value. Mostly seen in some math applications with <em>i</em>, but there are things to do with electronics or physics where it&#39;s also noted with <em>j</em>. Theoretically if you do the right interference pattern for the multiplication to take place, and you somehow have an imaginary value input on both - then you can have the product as a negative result. If this applies to something like energy or power output, then there are some hypothesis for some weird results. Things like circuits that show energy loss as cold instead of heat, etc. And those things may break or not be in-line with most accepted physics models.</p>

The taxcattle weren&#39;t too keen on RFID chip implantation, so the PTB released some horded tech to the cell phone market to produce devices the taxcattle would <em>want</em> to bring with them <em>everywhere</em> just like a chip.  Even better though, because these chips have GPS tracking, microphones, cameras and long-distance voice &amp; data transmission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess I&#39;ll start:<br/>
For those who weren&#39;t into computers much in years past:<br/>
A few years back we PC users were all in the middle of fighting a battle to cool relatively large open-air desktop components just enough to be able to play HD YouTube videos without lag. Heat pipes &amp; water cooling were fairly recent weapons in the battle. The battle was even tougher in the laptop world where the parts are smaller and packed tightly into a small case.<br/>
Anyway, while this battle was still raging (especially in the laptop world), these smartphones suddenly came out of nowhere that packed essentially an entire computer with comparable computing power in an ultra-tiny thin handheld device <em>with</em> a built in touch screen, camera, microphone, speaker, cell phone tech, ports &amp; more.<br/>
The devices also had a heat generating battery and were meant to be held in hot human hands or put in hot human pockets, yet they had <em>no active cooling system</em> whatsoever.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long at all before you could play a 720p MP4 video on one of these phones for long periods of time, in your hot hand, in hot weather, and it would still play perfectly smooth.<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this is amazing technology. I think it&#39;s primitive tech compared to what we would have if the PTB hadn&#39;t been hording tech for the past half-century or so. What I am saying is that based on everything else that was available to the public at the time, and the rate of progress (the artificial, imposed rate of progress) a device like these smart phones shouldn&#39;t have come along for another two decades or more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If apple and other cell phone manufacturers now have &quot;permission&quot; from the &quot;PTB&quot; to release the hidden smartphone tech, why do they still make large desktops and laptops that require active cooling, rather than implement this tech into those devices as well? It&#39;s because the cell phone tech isn&#39;t all that special when you look at the component hardware.</p>

<p>For starters, the resolution of modern phones is significantly lower than the resolution of a desktop, so right off the bat less processing power is going to be required to display images. This was even more true when the first smartphones were being released - the first ones had abysmal resolutions. Next you have to consider how smartphones are used. Even today, as far as I know, &quot;true&quot; multitasking isn&#39;t available on most smartphones, meaning you can&#39;t have even just two apps open side by side at the same time. The marketing for multitasking is deceiving - sure the phone can cache app data so that you can open it more quickly next time you use that app, and they make the app easier to reopen using some nice menus - but it&#39;s still not multitasking in the desktop sense of the word. Having only one program open and using processing power at a time makes for much less strain on the CPU. Add in some serious slimming down of the OS because phones don&#39;t need all the bells and whistles that windows and mac do, and you start to see how it&#39;s all possible. Additionally some manufacturers (Apple) control both the hardware and software of their phones, allowing them to optimize their software for their specific hardware. It&#39;s the same reason game consoles have comparable graphics (PCMR don&#39;t shoot me pls) to PC&#39;s - when you can optimize your software for the hardware it&#39;s running on, you can make much better use of the hardware. </p>

<p>The explosion of smartphones in the late 2000s was not due to some crazy technological revolution, in reality it was just progress as usual. The <em>adoption</em> by consumers was the real revolution. Smartphones for power-users such as PDA&#39;s, Blackberries, etc had existed since the late 90s, nearly a decade before they were being adopted by normal consumers. And those smartphones that started to get really popular in the late 2000s? They <em>sucked</em>. Have you tried using one recently? I had an iPhone 3G up until 3-4 years ago (so until about 4 years after its initial release), and it was incredibly slow. Multiple seconds to even open apps after clicking them, stuttering when typing, slow to load webpages, etc. Those early phones  didn&#39;t &quot;come out of nowhere&quot;, they just sucked slightly less than previous iterations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I was going to write this last night, but you did what was likely a more thorough job. It should also be noted that the ARM processors used in smartphones are running on a much more limited instruction set, meaning there&#39;s a lot less silicon per core, meaning a lot less energy usage, and therefore less heat generated. </p>

<p>Also, you might have a quad- (or even octo-) core processor running at 1.8 GHz in your phone, but you can&#39;t really compare that to a modern quad-core i7 running at 2.5 GHz. The larger instruction set of the Intel cores means that it can perform orders of magnitude more FLOPS than the ARM processors, at the cost of orders of magnitude more energy usage and heat output. And in most (all?) quad-core mobile processors, the cores aren&#39;t the same. Some are clocked slower (or even different types altogether) to conserve battery life during low-intensity applications, and some are more performance-oriented for high intensity applications like HD video and 3D games. Most phones aren&#39;t doing true multitasking either. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing fundamentally different about mobile processors vs. desktop processors; they&#39;ve just been optimized for different things. There&#39;s nothing in their development that can&#39;t be explained by incremental progress in transistor size, fab techniques, circuit design, and software improvements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is a lackluster rebuttal. The original iPhone had nowhere near the processing power of even budget laptops of the day, in terms of FLOPS or any other benchmark. They didn&#39;t even have 640p screens until the iPhone 4 in 2010, and didn&#39;t have full 1080 until the iPhone 6+. </p>

<p>I still have an old 2009 iMac with 3 GHz Core 2 Duo which runs 1080p flawlessly. No phone from that time even had a 1080 screen, let alone the processing power to run it. The latest Snapdragon 835s are certainly catching up with the i7s at this point, but it&#39;s been incremental progress the whole way. The 835 can even run Windows 10 at this point, and I suspect we&#39;ll see a move toward ARM processors into low and midrange laptops in the coming years. </p>

<p>If your theory is correct and you have more than anecdotal evidence, show us where the government-released tech was injected into the market. Show us when ARM processors somehow got a huge jump in performance or reduction in energy usage that can&#39;t be explained by incremental progress. </p>

I worked doing apple tech support during the release of their first iphone... they were a verrry significant jump compared to everyone in the market, competition at the time was flip phones, brick phones, keyboard phones like the RAZR they were only capable of playing simply games like tic tac toe, maybe solitaire... the first iphones were using a full version of OS X that was slimmed down for the phone. I didn&#39;t see it as being incredibly advanced or out of range for our tech at the time though, we had touch screens years before, flash drives were just getting popular with the ipod nano, all this tech was just getting small enough at the same time.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea for sure, I have no doubt there is some of that going on, but it has always been pretty slow. Like I said in another comment, the most objective proof against the argument above is the FLOPS of different devices, which never lie. Check that comment for a comparison of a newish phone to old game consoles; new phones still get blown out of the water when looking at raw processing speed. There was never some secret injection of technology to make a rapid advance in smartphones, just incremental upgrades.</p>

The fact they have made so much advancement in NVRAM technology is mostly to do with this.  Also you have to remember you mobile processor and laptop/desktop processor are very different, the mobile produces much less heat than the desktop, but has some limitations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a little off-topic here but I&#39;ve thought for a long time now that smart phones were brought about for the demise of the internet, or to put it more bluntly, the dumbing down of content on the internet. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a computer/internet guy for decades, before it was everywhere. For those of you who were plugged in during the early days you&#39;ll probably agree that in order to be a part of the web community, you needed a) to be reasonably smart with computers, modems, ISP&#39;s, and internet navigation in general, and b) have a fair bit of financial dedication to it. Not everyone could, or knew how to access and use the net so it was <em>generally</em> a place of <em>reasonable</em> intellect once you arrived there. Even the stupid shit online had a element of wit about it. </p>

<p>Then came the smartphone, timed perfectly with Facebook, and suddenly any dickhead with a $0 upfront contract had immediate access to the internet in their pocket with the press of a single button. Suddenly the internet became a place of true stupidity.</p>

<p>Most of what I read now on the net isn&#39;t sourced, isn&#39;t fact, and has 3000 comments from complete morons who all think they all know shit. No one is correcting anyone anymore (like the old days when unforgiving, vicious fact-checkers would verbally bash you until you plug-pulled and cried yourself to sleep), and the great, retarded circlejerk has begun. Look at any news post on Facebook now and scroll the comments. It&#39;s just 1000 toothless dickheads spewing unchecked retardation with 1000 more applauding them. The same happens for any news site that all encourage user comments now. This is the internet now. </p>

<p>So why? Maybe the original internet community was getting a little too smart, or had too much potential? Maybe we were splitting from the pack becoming too innovative? I don&#39;t know, but it wouldn&#39;t be the first time in history where pockets of collective intellect were attacked, infiltrated, and/or disbanded. But by flooding the net with the entire population I think it dumbed us all right down and trivialised the entire space. Spelling in general is appalling, grammar is fucked, content is dribble, and ideas... well, what ideas? </p>

<p>No longer is the net a place of <em>reasonable</em> sense and intellect, but it&#39;s truly owned by fucking morons now, breeding more morons with each additional comment and each additional user. </p>

<p>Just a thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mum, a then forty-something housewife, was active on he internet in the late 90s. She&#39;s not <em>particularly</em> tech savvy. She wasn&#39;t then, she isn&#39;t now.

<p>Anyway, point I&#39;m trying to get to: people who weren&#39;t super intelligent and/or super focused on tech were on the internet <em>decades</em> before smartphones became ubiquitous. I think your who idea doesn&#39;t really make sense at all. </p>

<p>Meh, sorta. Even if you weren&#39;t tech savvy, by &#39;93 or so anyone at a school computer lab was able to connect in. Libraries followed soon after; I remember when I was poor and traveling I could always just go to the library to surf(although then it was alt.binaries.pictures.stuff and message boards.</p>

<p>And the smartphone was inevitable with the current technology. You had all these people with pagers, then cell phones, then motorola and blackberry were competing to combine the two, and you had verizon&#39;s little flip phones with a GUI. Once you had a phone/camera/radio/texting pager the addition of more and more features was bound to be an arms race.</p>

<p>People who get their news from social media sites(here included) don&#39;t deserve to be called morons, as long as that&#39;s not their only source of news. I used Fark for aeons before Reddit, Yahoo news before Fark, Netscape news before Yahoo, and dial-in BBS sites back in the day. It&#39;s easy to just live in a bubble and reinforce your own cognitive bias, but it leads to outcomes like the 2016 election. Once it gets thrown in your face hard enough how insulated you are from the facts, you have to wake up a little. Spend a little time on r/facepalm to see people posting BS on Facebook get theirs. Subscribe to r/askhistorians or other strongly curated spaces for as close to unbiased truth as you can get.</p>

<p>I think this is a great time to be informed. You can research who owns the site you&#39;re reading, find out everyone&#39;s research methodology and the politics of their board of directors at the click of a mouse. I think most of the people yo&#39;re upset at are just kids. They&#39;ll figure it out eventually. We did.</p>

<p>Russia has claimed to have used such a device against the destroyer USS David Cook in the Black Sea, as well. Official US sources and most US media have denied these claims, but it&#39;s still worth investigating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just about every technology developed by humans has a weaponized branch, and this goes back to pre-history. (Rock can be used to crack nuts, or rock can be just as good at cracking skulls.)</p>

<p>I&#39;d think that if there&#39;s some type of technology that does mass-energy conversion better than anything the public is currently aware of, there&#39;s going to be some effort to keep wraps on it. It was bad enough that nukes proliferated back in the 1950&#39;s, and I suspect the PTB in charge of western countries don&#39;t want a repeat.</p>

<p>So even though it&#39;d be great for most of us if we had electric cars with indefinite range using a new power source, if the same tech could be used to make a &quot;pocket nuke&quot; and not need the usual hard to get or traceable materials, then we&#39;re unlikely to ever see it.</p>

<p>So if it&#39;s possible for stuff like this to exist, then I&#39;d say there likely is some effort to keep it hidden or painting it as so fringe that it&#39;d dissuade most scientists from going near it, lest they get blacklisted or lose credibility among peers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scarab is also generally associated with the Moon.</p>

<p>&#39;For the Egyptians, Cancer was represented not by a crab, but by a scarab (or dung) beetle, sacred to the Egyptians as a creature of immortality.  The beetle is clearly linked to the moon’s twenty-eight day cycle. It deposits its ball of eggs, rolled in dung in the earth, for the space of twenty-eight days, which is the time it takes for the moon to complete a full revolution through the twelve zodiacal signs.  The Egyptians considered the twenty-ninth day to be a day of resurrection, and according to lunar markings, there occurs the baptism of the beetle, when the scarabeus casts his ball into the water, opening to give birth to the young beetle.  This immersion and baptism became naturally associated with renewal and regeneration.  In this way, the lunar god was always declared to be self-created, never born.  This symbolism seems to fit very aptly for the sign of Cancer, so seemingly introverted and self-contained.&#39;</p>

<ul>
<li>Egyptian cosmology is much different obviously. They weren&#39;t ball earthers. So they probably did see many similarities of &#39;levitation&#39; in the Moon. They didn&#39;t believe in relativity or gravity Theories.</li>

It has been proven, mathematically.  The way of breaking the light barrier may be through GR, General Relativity and the moving/bending of space time.

<p>I stumbled upon an excerpt which was rather alarming to me:</p>

<p>Firstly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OPERATORS, ELECTRONICS TECHNICIANS, MILITARY PERSONNEL
AND THE LIKE.  THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SOVIET AND U.S. OCCUPATIONAL STANDARDS.  BOTH
COUNTRIES CONTINUOUSLY REEXAMINE THEIR SCIENTIFIC
BASIS.  THE U.S. OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY STANDARD IS 10
MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER (10,000 MICROWATTS).
IT IS BASED ON MINIMIZING THE HEAT STRESS PLACED ON THE
BODY BY EXPOSURE LEVELS ABOVE 10 MILLIWATTS PER SQUARE
CENTIMETER.</p>

<p>THE SOVIET OCCUPATIONAL STANDARD IS 1,000 TIMES LOWER,
10 MICROWATTS PER SQUARE CENTIMETER FOR A WORKING DAY.
IN SETTING STANDARDS THE SOVIETS HAVE TAKEN AN APPROACH
WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH SCIENTISTS OF
THE UNITED STATES OR WESTERN EUROPE BELIEVE IS JUSTIFIED
BY EITHER SCIENTIFIC DATA OR <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interpretation of this, is that US Scientists have the freedom to set the level of <em>acceptable exposure</em> to anything they wish, based on experience? Would that be a possible explanation for such a discrepancy detailed between the varying levels of US and Soviet acceptable exposure?</p>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate; Can anyone think of possible (TPTB) motivation for the US acceptable exposure to be so much higher?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Proven&quot; What?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with quantum <em>statistics</em> (mechanics is a bit too far.)  Just because the math helps us with predictions doesn&#39;t mean the philosophy behind it is right.  </p>

<p>The way I see it, statistics is the admittance that we <em>dont</em> have all the of information about nature.</p>

<p>Continuing with special relativity, it&#39;s about the furthest thing from proven.  We have no clue whether time is actually slowing or the idea that matter moving through aether affects it.  If aether has some weight to it (it can, depending on the model chosen to analyze) than I would expect matter moving through it to perhaps affect it.  </p>

<p>As for length contraction, and mass increase as velocity approaches the speed of light.  I actually think this is really just enforced through book keeping, not observed.  What did your research show?</p>

I read what I had to of dianetics,  it&#39;s not for me, but if you can&#39;t entertain an idea you can&#39;t get kernels of truth or silver linings. Something worth thinking about philosophically my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your an quite the interesting character. Do you always spend this much time discouraging people from reading different types of information? Or is it just a 9-5 thing? Just to put your angry spirits to rest, channeled information rates only just above a fortune cookie. It is hardly my goto source of information. I sincerely hope that you find some peace random Internet stranger, no need to be so angry at a thought, and perhaps it might be worth thinking about why this particular peice bothers you so much. To me? His post was just brain candy, to you, this is an affront to your personal reality worth lashing out about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As we learn more about our solar system, galaxy, and universe, we begin to realize that an Einstein universe is less and less a true and COMPLETE understanding.</p>

<p>What’s more, I am starting to believe that Tesla’s theories were proved correct,  most likely in his lifetime, and covered up by the government hence the reason for the FBI classifying his “harmless” research. There’s more to that, but I’m still working on it.</p>

<p>Just been looking at the facts compared to the propaganda we’ve been subjected to and the lies become obvious.</p>

<p>I’ve looked at “alternative” theories out there. I’ve even looked at present day aether theories....they aren’t quite a complete picture either, so I’m still looking for answers. </p>
