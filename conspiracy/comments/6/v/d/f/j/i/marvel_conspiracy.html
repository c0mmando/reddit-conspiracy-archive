DC movies are constantly bombing either financially or critically but has the same imaginative universe as Marvel while Universal Monster pictures l, like the Mummy reboot for starters, fail and more than likely there will not be anymore monster films which could have been real competition for Disney/Marvel</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a creative team, Marvel Studios, that manages everything in the MCU, that&#39;s why there&#39;s a consistency throughout all the movies and shows.  Disney doesn&#39;t really mess with them and because they&#39;ve been so successful, they can retain the talented writers and over-arching storyline creators.  DC doesn&#39;t have that.  Silly monster movies don&#39;t have that.  Star Wars does, and the new Star Wars movies have been box office and critical successes</p>

<p>You would think that people would learn from these examples......in the case of DC, I&#39;m hopeful they will</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Star Wars and Marvel have one thing in common, Disney. It&#39;s a monopoly on Hollywood and fanboys that keep the same movies being made while something new is immediately discredited. We need new sagas in Hollywood, not the same.

    <div class="md"><p>Frankly star wars would have done well no matter what. Yes episode 7 didn&#39;t take risks particularly but they wanted to show that they were more in tune with the OT not the prequels. Rogue one took more risks (but had numerous issues as a film)</p>

<p>Why then did you complain about universal failing? They are just trying lazy reboots/ remakes.</p>

<p>And I disagree, new films aren&#39;t  &#39;discredited&#39;. Look at the Oscars, I notice star wars and marvel weren&#39;t headlining them... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Better a lazy reboot than the same movie time and time again. Discredited by the media and ticket buyers is my  point.

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t be serious surely? The marketing depends on the budget given to the studio, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll do well if the film is trash (see alien covenant). Ticket buyers can do whatever the hell they want. What do you mean discredited by the media?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re drifting off topic. I&#39;m claiming Hollywood focus most resources on Marvel because it&#39;s the hot thing today. Ticket buyers are mindless sheep that drift to the big explosions and want to be like everyone else. A monopoly is illegal but you can not deny most of Hollywood is controlled by Disney, it&#39;s just the nature of the beast. The Mummy had Tom Cruise who is still arguably one of the biggest stars in the world but still didn&#39;t get exposure because he didn&#39;t wear a iron suit or fly. I have no respect for any award show, if winning a Oscar is the basis of success, then the craft of being a filmmaker is dead. Point is this, Hollywood only cares about money and has a history of sabotaging any competition </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point about the oscars is that disney doesn&#39;t dominate </p>

<p>The mummy flopped because no one wanted a remake and it was a poorly made film. Tom cruise made it much more successful than it otherwise would have been. It had plenty of advertising, I don&#39;t believe you understand that you have to pay for marketing campaigns </p>

<p>You haven&#39;t provided any evidence of &quot;sabotage&quot;, while ignoring my point of alien covenant. </p>

<p>Also you know what I can basically guarantee? That Saw legacy will open at number 1 because it is a well established franchise </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Mummy flopped because it wasn&#39;t Marvel and the Tom Cruise hate bandwagon has been played out, he&#39;s still Tom Cruise, a usual box office guarantee. When you called them &#39;silly&#39; you made a case for my point. By you calling them silly, implies you don&#39;t care so you won&#39;t watch also its ironic to call monsters silly but praising Marvel. The evidence is all around you if you look past the rose colored glasses. Whatever Saw comes out will probably be successful financially because it&#39;s a safe movie, nothing new but the same formula that keeps the sheep in line </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a conspiracy post, not word of law but if you want to go serious then that&#39;s fine. People want superheroes and studios want money and no competition. Who owns most superheroes? Disney. Dunkirk is one movie, not a saga and if you remember I stated that a competing saga for Disney is bad for business. Disney has the money to have the best people/gear, it&#39;s buying the best and keeping them from other studios</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But DC is trying.  Yes they&#39;ve had a rough start (though still take the cake with the dark knight) but if wonder woman is anything to go by then they should be competing properly soon enough.

<p>If you&#39;ve got absolutely no evidence then it shouldn&#39;t be on here. There is some good stuff here but hard to filter through the trash such as this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But DC is trying.  Yes they&#39;ve had a rough start (though still take the cake with the dark knight) but if wonder woman is anything to go by then they should be competing properly soon enough. Also marvel does deserve the success. Their movies are pretty much all of a good standard. </p>

<p>And give it a couple of years and superhero movies will fade just as westerns did </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, the numerous ones that undermine your claim there is a conspiracy to keep all disney films successful and no other can be.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand advertising clearly as well</p>

<p>DC, the quality of their recent films has let them down, I&#39;m sure they will improve and then rival marvel</p>
