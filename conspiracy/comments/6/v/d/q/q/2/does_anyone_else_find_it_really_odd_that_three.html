       I think it was more of a point of pride. They were probably told to stay the course, playing chicken. I'd compare it to the Rock &amp; Samuel L Jackson in 'The Other Guys'

       This is interesting, but I feel like we'd hear more reports of crewman saying the ship was inoperable. The high ranking crew aboard these naval vessels, particularly the ones controlling it, tend to actually lack proper training. Due to the damage I saw from the collision that happened with the Japanese container ship was likely the fault of the U.S naval ship. It seemed pretty clear the container ship fully had right of way, and on top of that, the naval vessel is tremendously more maneuverable than even the average container ship by a very, very large margin.

       IMHO the hole in the hull doesn't tell us anything; it could have been a merchant vessel indeed (the strait is very busy and the US warboat was probably a sitting duck with no radar); it could be a torpedo; a suicide attack using a zodiac; or even self-inflicted to cover for the deep humiliation endured.

       It was actually noted in news reports that in the first of the two recent crashes the US ship had lost steering a bit before the accident. But it also said that it wouldnt be a reason for the accident because there are other ways to steer the ship in emergency. Interesting nonetheless.

       Exactly, in a situation that had developed for as long as it did, to get into a collision course even, there are virtually unlimited ways to get out of an actual collision. Collisions are almost always caused by miscommunications and/or human errors. It is very rare for an electrical/systems failure to cause an open ocean crash. Unless both vessels report failures, it's most likely the first of the two possibilities.

       Maybe someone knows the answer to this: Why are the Navy ships all fucked up, but the ships that collided with them show hardly any damage?  Are cargo ships really stronger than destroyers?  I would think that Navy ships are pretty damn tough, seeing as they are built for war and all.

       Those cargo ships weigh around ten times as much as the destroyers. It's a bit like a truck hitting a dune buggy. They're also a lot sturdier by necessity, since they've gotta take on a bunch of cargo and make it across the ocean without strong waves breaking their backs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destroyers like this aren't really built with any sort of armor. They'll stand up to small arms and light armor piercing weapons like RPGs, but little beyond that. They rely on active measures to defend themselves and their group from stuff like anti-ship missiles. This is because weapons technology is pretty far beyond armor technology when it comes to the navy. One or two current-gen anti-ship missiles connecting would be enough to sink an Iowa, which was pretty heavily armored, so a destroyer wouldn't stand much chance if one connected. They're built to be fast, punchy, not too expensive, relatively easy to repair/maintain.

       Destroyers are usually smaller, lighter and more nimble for faster defensive/offensive maneuvers. As someone around ships often, cargo ships and oil tankers typically vastly out size naval destroyers.

       Yeah, I heard that it's actually 3 destroyers right and there's only 11 destroyers in the southeast Asian /Pacific theatre , we are down to 70% of operating capacity from before, and those ships will take years to get fixed , if they even do get fixed. 4 billion down the toilet and dozens of Americans killed, more than dozens wounded , this shit should be the thing we goto war about. I think, china and Russia and others are essentially starting to fuck with America, and are literally chopping away at our forces and moral at home. We are divided and will take whatever side our fickle emotions take us and then fight the other side. We hate each other. This is all together, we need to realize we are hating each other and being attacked and there's a lot of fucking propganda going on to keep us blind and misguided . We think the enemy is something, but really it's ourselves . I wish all the people clashing and fighting and chanting white lives matter and black lives matter and all lives matter and whatever else we are chanting :: take it back to occupy Wall Street status. Arnt there enough intelligent people that can work out a better way to manage ourselves and to govern ourselves more efficiently And live better and more efficiently . Where the fuck are the intellectuals, the engineers and scientist and professors to make a new start, they must see that we need it, that we have been divided and truly need a change. Not war not patriotism , love, compassion , sustainability, and working together rather then all the opposites. Please people spread the message that even tho we don't like each other , the common enemy is worse. Just like game of thrones, if we all fight each other and don't fight the army of the dead together, we will fail and lose everything for all of humanity past, present and future. Stop thinking this is just online babble, and conspiracy and wake up.

       It's because everyone knows it's a shit show. We're not the World Police. Shut down bases, reduce the number of ships. Stand down from World War 2, as we should have. They started the first Cold War so their funding wouldn't be cut. Today we spend 21 times the amount as our next "rival". Yesterday's speech was more of the same. Who will stand up to these tax farmers?

       Honestly as a former lookout on a big coast guard boat this makes no sense at all. I was lookout, boatswains mate of the watch and a few other titles I can't recall and this makes absolutely no sense. We went all of over the place east coast and Carib plus more and had less sophisticated equipments and we never got within a .5 miles of another boat. These incidents blow my mind and I will read to the reports on them. 
What's really fucking sucks is that lots of people are dead now on board.

       Some folks are saying that it was an equipment malfunction or hack, but you can't tell me that no one on those Navy ships didn't see a problem.  "Uh, sir, uh, we are way too fucking close to that ship.  You might want to, uh, turn or something."

       Depends on what you would call a source of news. I would call it a hypothesis supported by the testimonies of individuals such as Thomas Williams, Corey Goode, and other alternative community folks that have mentioned the potential of these seemingly idiotic "accidents" on Navy ships. I also would like to point out that the media was heavy on pushing the narrative of these "accidents". Usually there is a psyop intention by most Mainstream Misinformation and why they are focusing on these events is suspect.

       You are right about the MSM pushing these accidents.  What type of alien contact is theorized by the names you mentioned?  Are we talking with direct battle with aliens in the seas?  Or something in Antarctica?  Or is it some weird side effect of an experiment?

       Well both those folks discuss a wide variety of non-terrestrials, but in regards to the Navy SSP it is coporate entities that are causing the accidents to threaten the Navy to stand down from moving forward with any public disclosure. Corey Goode does specificly talk about Blue Avians though.

       Not to mention they issued a "stand down" to the whole fleet after this most recent incident.. Supposedly due to "low morale" (yeah,  right, OK).

       This is feasible but what about all the others whose duty it was to stand watch. Equipment can fail and be hacked but that doesn't excuse the negligence this commander is responsible for. There are sailors whose job is to overlook portions of the ship for visual obstacles. What happened there? That's what I want to know.

       oddly enough it could be them employing their jamming but the locations make no sense unless they are deploying it from submarines in the vicinity, which is pretty unlikely considering the exposure it would bring.

       Honestly, it's due to the military culture of doing more with less, and how the navy does 'watch'. Continual shifts, after working a 12-15 hour days has people getting 3-5 hours of sleep a night. Compound it with shitty leadership who fails to make their rounds to make sure people stay awake, and you have sailors sleeping. Make no mistake, both the officers and senior enlisted were also asleep, but the fault will fall on the lowest ranking.

       The whole appeared consistent with a collision with the bow of a larger ship. The fact the damage sustained was on its starboard side, I'm talking in the case of the collision of the Japanese vessel, was huge.
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea">
        Here's a good source to get acquainted with.
       </a>
       . Port gives way to starboard and the fact the merchant vessel was significantly larger and far less maneuverable means the naval ship should not have been near a collision. In the case of a head on collision, both vessels steer clear by way of starboard as well. My dad was a captain for much of his life and has been a harbor pilot for 19 years. I've worked part time with his company and consider myself fairly well versed in maritime conduct at the least. He has also told me his impressions naval captains have been far below par, more often than not, inexperienced
