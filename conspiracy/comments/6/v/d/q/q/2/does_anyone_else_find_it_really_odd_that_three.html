    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting, but I feel like we&#39;d hear more reports of crewman saying the ship was inoperable. The high ranking crew aboard these naval vessels, particularly the ones controlling it, tend to actually lack proper training. Due to the damage I saw from the collision that happened with the Japanese container ship was likely the fault of the U.S naval ship. It seemed pretty clear the container ship fully had right of way, and on top of that, the naval vessel is tremendously more maneuverable than even the average container ship by a very, very large margin. </p>

<p>IMHO the hole in the hull doesn&#39;t tell us anything; it could have been a merchant vessel indeed (the strait is very busy and the US warboat was probably a sitting duck with no radar); it could be a torpedo; a suicide attack using a zodiac; or even self-inflicted to cover for the deep humiliation endured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, in a situation that had developed for as long as it did, to get into a collision course even, there are virtually unlimited ways to get out of an actual collision. Collisions are almost always caused by miscommunications and/or human errors. It is very rare for an electrical/systems failure to cause an open ocean crash. Unless both vessels report failures, it&#39;s most likely the first of the two possibilities. </p>

Are cargo ships really stronger than destroyers?  I would think that Navy ships are pretty damn tough, seeing as they are built for war and all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those cargo ships weigh around ten times as much as the destroyers. It&#39;s a bit like a truck hitting a dune buggy. They&#39;re also a lot sturdier by necessity, since they&#39;ve gotta take on a bunch of cargo and make it across the ocean without strong waves breaking their backs.</p>

<p>Destroyers like this aren&#39;t really built with any sort of armor. They&#39;ll stand up to small arms and light armor piercing weapons like RPGs, but little beyond that. They rely on active measures to defend themselves and their group from stuff like anti-ship missiles. This is because weapons technology is pretty far beyond armor technology when it comes to the navy. One or two current-gen anti-ship missiles connecting would be enough to sink an Iowa, which was pretty heavily armored, so a destroyer wouldn&#39;t stand much chance if one connected. They&#39;re built to be fast, punchy, not too expensive, relatively easy to repair/maintain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I heard that it&#39;s actually 3 destroyers right and there&#39;s only 11 destroyers in the southeast Asian /Pacific theatre , we are down to 70% of operating capacity from before, and those ships will take years to get fixed , if they even do get fixed. 4 billion down the toilet and dozens of Americans killed, more than dozens wounded , this shit should be the thing we goto war about. I think, china and Russia and others are essentially starting to fuck with America, and are literally chopping away at our forces and moral at home. We are divided and will take whatever side our fickle emotions take us and then fight the other side. We hate each other. This is all together, we need to realize we are hating each other and being attacked and there&#39;s a lot of fucking propganda going on to keep us blind and misguided . We think the enemy is something, but really it&#39;s ourselves . I wish all the people clashing and fighting and chanting white lives matter and black lives matter and all lives matter and whatever else we are chanting :: take it back to occupy Wall Street status. Arnt there enough intelligent people that can work out a better way to manage ourselves and to govern ourselves more efficiently And live better and more efficiently . Where the fuck are the intellectuals, the engineers and scientist and professors to make a new start, they must see that we need it, that we have been divided and truly need a change. Not war not patriotism , love, compassion , sustainability, and working together rather then all the opposites. Please people spread the message that even tho we don&#39;t like each other , the common enemy is worse. Just like game of thrones, if we all fight each other and don&#39;t fight the army of the dead together, we will fail and lose everything for all of humanity past, present and future. Stop thinking this is just online babble, and conspiracy and wake up.</p>

<p>Please.</p>

<p>oddly enough it could be them employing their jamming but the locations make no sense unless they are deploying it from submarines in the vicinity, which is pretty unlikely considering the exposure it would bring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, it&#39;s due to the military culture of doing more with less, and how the navy does &#39;watch&#39;. Continual shifts, after working a 12-15 hour days has people getting 3-5 hours of sleep a night. Compound it with shitty leadership who fails to make their rounds to make sure people stay awake, and you have sailors sleeping. Make no mistake, both the officers and senior enlisted were also asleep, but the fault will fall on the lowest ranking.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole appeared consistent with a collision with the bow of a larger ship. The fact the damage sustained was on its starboard side, I&#39;m talking in the case of the collision of the Japanese vessel, was huge. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Regulations_for_Preventing_Collisions_at_Sea">Here&#39;s a good source to get acquainted with.</a>. Port gives way to starboard and the fact the merchant vessel was significantly larger and far less maneuverable means the naval ship should not have been near a collision. In the case of a head on collision, both vessels steer clear by way of starboard as well. My dad was a captain for much of his life and has been a harbor pilot for 19 years. I&#39;ve worked part time with his company and consider myself fairly well versed in maritime conduct at the least. He has also told me his impressions naval captains have been far below par, more often than not, inexperienced</p>
