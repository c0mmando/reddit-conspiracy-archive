<p>Many of Obama&#39;s policies were not so different than Bush. I&#39;d argue that he might have been even more hawkish in regards to foreign policy, and that politics in the United States has shifted hard to the right over the previous 30 years.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen many metrics that actually put Obama centre right on the political spectrum, but things have shifted so far to the right that he was criticized as being a socialist. </p>

<p>Business International was found to have employed journalists who were also working for the CIA + &quot;provided cover for four C.I.A. employees in various countries between 1955 and 1960&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the extent of their relationship with the CIA. They were not a CIA front. They acted as a front for 4 agents between 1955 - 1960 so they could say they worked for BI instead of the CIA while working abroad. It started as a very legitimate international news service which has now morphed into The Economist. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually a pretty sound argument. You qualify the Dallas shooter as not a BLM member because he was on the extreme end of BLM. So u/wondercept counter argument is that what if the Charlottesville killer was on the extreme end of the ALT right, would Trump still have to apologize for him?

<p>Also the Dallas shooter said he is not part of BLM, the Charlottesville driver claimed he was alt right. Why are you blatantly obscuring the truth.</p>

<p>These are pertinent when people try to justify Obama&#39;s actions.  Why not just say they were both wrong (more on this later).  I have no doubt that Reddit understands what these logical fallacies are, I just think there is a lot of confusion on how to apply them.</p>

<p>But that does not prove he wasn&#39;t part of BLM.  It is possible to be upset with something you are a part of.  A black guy killed police at a BLM rally in the name of police brutality.  You remove a few of those words, and you define BLM.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only argument at hand here is this:</p>

<p>If Micah Johnson would have shot those police in Dallas and never made a comment about being upset with BLM, people would have assumed that he was a member of BLM. And rightfully so because he was a black man..shooting police...at a BLM rally.   </p>

<p>However, the argument here is that Obama is somehow vindicated from speaking out about this because Micah said &quot;he was upset with BLM&quot; and therefore couldn&#39;t possibly be involved in this movement.  </p>

<p>Hopefully, I don&#39;t have paint a picture of the similarities between this incident and the Charlottesville incident.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a &quot;who&#39;s fault is it&quot; argument, simply that it seems a different set of rules are being applied to Trump than were Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a sound argument, except for a flaw.</p>

<p>No one asked Trump to apologise for the killer -  they asked him to denounce Nazis. Trump, in fairness, did denounce violence &quot;on both sides&quot;, but somehow failed to denounce Nazis and had to try again the next day. Obviously, the day afterwards he was un-denouncing them a bit... I mean, have people forgotten Nazi Germany? How hard is it to denounce Nazis? I can&#39;t believe there are people who still go around supporting them.</p>

<p>But I do agree that you should not denounce a movement because of something done by someone who wasn&#39;t even in that movement (which is different from being on the edge of the movement). I think the reason it&#39;s being downvoted is that, well, the Charlottesville killer was a supporter. No one is going to &quot;be good&quot; if a video now came out of him saying &quot;they&#39;re not violent enough&quot;.</p>

<p>Obviously, if it turns out that any evidence of him being associated is bogus, then there&#39;s no reason to denounce the Nazis. Except of course for the previous actions of the Nazis, particularly the Holocaust. That&#39;s still a reason to denounce Nazis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just feel that everyone is passing this incident off as a Nazi/white supremacist vs liberals rally.  I just don&#39;t think that was the case.  I think there were a bunch of ill-informed Southerners who honestly believed that taking down the statue was an offense to their heritage.  Yes, there were a concerningly high number of Nazis and white supremacists there, too.  But there were probably people on the left with some crazy murderous ideas, too.  How far is a president expected to condemn everyone involved?  I kind of saw it his way in his first press conference, violence on both sides.  </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t BLM at all, just because he&#39;s black doesn&#39;t make him part of BLM (btw all white people are nazis /s). He was a member of 2 very radical black separatist organizations though that advocated the use of violence.  Maybe don&#39;t comment on things when you don&#39;t know shit about them. </p>

<p>BLM and Dallas shooting are clearly connected. More then Trump and KKK/nazis are. He has disavowed them for atleast 20 years</p>

<p>Working for the CIA would worry me a bit, because that should have been disclosed and open before being elected. Him bring satanic would be a area for concern, because that feels like being in a cult, but at least it&#39;s not the westboro Baptist church!</p>

<p>Making things happen requires careful negotiation, and balancing the various forces against eachother. Getting Obamacare passed was a textbook example. If you don&#39;t remember, it was a huge fight. The left hated it. The right hated it. Big Pharma and the insurance industry ran ads to get people riled up. Death panels and socialism. </p>

<p>All the political capital he had going into office went to getting that done. But he got it done.  </p>

<p>Fast forward eight years, and the Republicans hold the executive and both legislative branches of government, but they won&#39;t fuck with it, because it&#39;s working really well for millions of people.  </p>

<p>He also inherited two major wars and the biggest economic crisis since the great depression. He left his successor a growing economy, and a tiny fraction of the war he inherited from Bush.    </p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget how he restored the global image of the US after Bush totally fucked it up. </p>

<p>And you want to point the finger, and say that he&#39;s the problem. </p>

<p>Imagine this - what would you have done in his place? Are you so arrogant that you believe that those quantifiable achievements did not require great skill and nuance?   </p>

<p>Do you think getting all that shit done was easy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His stewartship has resulted in the Democratic party being decimated, having lost 900+ state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats. The Republicans are now more powerful than they have been in over 80 years. Come the 2018 midterms they could win enough seats to have enough power to starting changing the Constitution.</p>

<p>He ran on being &quot;the most transparent administration in history&quot; and went after whistleblowers who had to flee the country to escape him.</p>

<p>He was immediately handed a Nobel Peace Prize after his election for no reason, then proceeded to kill hundreds of innocents with drones while in power.</p>

<p>He spent all the political capital he had on a health care reform law now in the death spiral that critics always said would happen.</p>

<p>He entrusted his foreign policy to Hillary Clinton and it lead to disaster after disaster in the Middle East and the rise of ISIS under his watch.</p>

<p>His Wall Street reforms froze lending and slowed the recovery.</p>

<p>The Russian reset ended with the rise of Vladimir Putin&#39;s influence.</p>

<p>His promise of closing Gitmo remains unfulfilled.</p>

<p>His campaigning against Brexit last year failed miserably to make any dent.</p>

<p>His reign lead to the inflammation of racial tensions as he supported BLM, with racial relations sinking to lows we haven&#39;t seen in decades as whole cities from Baltimore to Ferguson burned.</p>

<p>The TPP he tried to ram down America&#39;s throat awakened a sleeping giant in the working class vote.</p>

<p>...you could go on and on.</p>

<p>What has this actually lead to?</p>

<p>The country gave him the ultimate rebuke by electing not just any Republican as his successor, but his very arch nemesis.</p>

<p>All his legacy that he has worked for, he now has to hand over to the one man who said he would tear it all down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as the Republicans were decimated after Bush........ And the Republicans will be again in the wake of Trump. Such is the nature of democracy, the pendulum swings.</p>

<p>You&#39;re acting as if these were all things that were his initiatives....... They were not. </p>

<p>Take a long, hard look at Trump&#39;s first six months in office..... After promising for the previous eight years to eliminate Obamacare, they couldn&#39;t even get that done. Now imagine Trump taking over in 2008, with the economy collapsing and potentially experiencing another economic depression including the collapse of the banking system....... Imagine Trump dealing with two wars.</p>

<p>Was he perfect? Far from it. But he left things generally better than what he inherited in many respects, he didn&#39;t go into wars with no exit strategy, and the economy is almost at peak employment. </p>

He said all the right things while doing the opposite. People were so sick of it now they voted for trump and say what u will about the guy but I ll take the devil you know vs the devil you thought you did. He at least will tell you how he&#39;s gonna duck you then make fun of you I think he is horrible but so many people are getting woke because of him. Still better than Clinton though. </p>

<p>I see no one getting woke because of him. Just people mumbling he is &quot;still better than Clinton though.&quot; Seriously? Reinvigorating white supremacy and making a fool of America on the international stage. All while trying to single handedly destroy any government institution which is not directly involved in making old white rich men richer.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned Trump is the most dangerous kind of politician because he panders to irrational bigots who otherwise would be less motivated into the electorate. Textbook definition of a demagogue. Combine that with a dark desire for wealth and a bad habit of blowing said wealth, and you have the perfect storm of a politician.</p>

<p>I am not attempting to restrict anyone&#39;s speech, they can post whatever they wish, but the name, when it appears on the front page of the sub, is just not a good look for the sub IMO.</p>

<p>How am I assassinating their character? I just think the username sucks. I think the user would be more credible to others if they had a name that was not designed to be intentionally offensive.</p>

<p>Anyway, I put the username on a hard ignore, so I suppose the point is moot.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t really say those are fair examples of &quot;criticism&quot;, particularly since both of those incidents were pretty universally condemned. If you want to play the cherry picking game though, off the top of my head there was that time Ted Nugent threatened to kill Obama and Hillary. Of course, burning or hanging Obama effigies was also something that happened. I get that those weren&#39;t really done by high profile people, but you get the idea... </p>

<p>But the point is that Obama was heavily criticized throughout his entire presidency. For example, Trump acts as if he is unfairly targeted in a &quot;witch hunt&quot; due to his campaigns ties to foreign governments... yet he was the face of the &quot;birther&quot;/&quot;Obama is a secret Muslim&quot; movement...the entire premise of which was based upon criticizing and questioning BO&#39;s loyalties.</p>

<p>Anyone who was alive and paid attention to anything political knew Obama was criticized a lot. There was plenty of support for impeaching Obama back then too. </p>

<p>I mean, I don&#39;t disagree, but your example was Kathy Griffin, who is no stranger to controversy and is not exactly a well-respected celebrity either. Seems more like you are shifting the goal posts now that I have provided a pretty similar example of celebrity endorsement of violence towards the sitting president. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I&#39;m not defending &quot;my side&quot; or trying to give moral superiority here. I&#39;m not a democrat or an Obama supporter (Full disclosure, I was a Ron Paul and Gary Johnson supporter). Second, I agree, they probably were not honestly sorry. That&#39;s beside the point though, since I am not making an &quot;excuse&quot; for them.... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that the best excuse you got? They were sorry? Lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you had actually read my comment, you&#39;d notice that their apologies were one of many &quot;excuses&quot; I gave. The &quot;best excuse&quot; that I gave imo is that those controversies were universally condemned, and were not rewarded by a trip to the white house. The point being that violent political rhetoric against Obama was not only present, but has not been condemned to the same degree which violent rhetoric against Trump has been (at least with these examples--though I am willing to listen to any counterexamples if you have any). </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m probably wasting time arguing with you, but have I given any info that was false? No. Is it relevant to the point? Yes. So maybe you need to be asking yourself why you are reacting the way that you are, because it seems like you aren&#39;t willing to confront facts that challenge your current worldview, and that kind of mindset is bad for everyone, but especially you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, considering we were both Paul supporters, I&#39;d say we agree on more than disagree.</p>

<p>Can you honestly look at the way the media portrayed Ron Paul as a racist, and tell me that the media is keeping an even keel towards Trump? I think we can both agree they are rabid.</p>

<p>It was a poor choice for me to conflate policy criticisms and character assassination/violent rhetoric. I did that in part because of how easily the media turns a policy stance into a moral one, which they are wont to do. That&#39;s my bad for not being specific. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll rephrase, a good portion of self-professed objective news stations are much more prone to engage in baseless character assassinations and whacky conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>A good example from the other side is those who were going nuts about Obama being a Kenyan and a secret Muslim. There is enough to criticize both or them for, without engaging in innuendo that the president holds foreign allegiances.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s the problem! They focus on the most unimportant nonsense, so when something big actually happens, people don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>It&#39;s carnival sideshows and medieval court gossip, while the actual structural problems get ignored and trivialized. Trillions in debt? Who cares! This hunk of stone is more important than the financial stability of your progeny! The environment? Fuck that! Unending global wars? Nah, we&#39;re just killing terrorists now! /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s the perfect tactic to divide people further. The anti-Trumpers think, &quot;Trump supporters are idiots! Even the entire media is against their guy and they still support him!&quot; while the Trump supporters feel that the MSM vilification is proof that their guy is &quot;anti-establishment&quot; and unfairly persecuted, inciting them to hate the other side even more. Unfortunately the MSM&#39;s attacks on Trump make him more credible in the eyes of a lot of people here, too.</p>

<p>But anyway, I&#39;d guess it&#39;s because this post is just the Trump one with &quot;Trump&quot; changed to &quot;Obama&quot;, so not only is it clearly posted by someone upset that Trump was criticised who wanted to engage in some whataboutism, it&#39;s also just a shitty post.</p>

<p>Which brings us back to my original comment, which is that I don&#39;t think it was posted because someone is upset about Trump. It&#39;s to illustrate the fact that no one wants to level criticism at both &quot;parties&quot;, they&#39;d rather that it be one sided, which you agreed with.</p>

<p>Not really sure how you make the jump to, &quot;this must be from someone butthurt about the Trump post&quot; . I guess it makes sense if you believe the Donald 2.0 narrative. But then the relative successes of each post proves that narrative is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few things, if it was supposed to be a criticism then they should have actually made criticisms instead of just copying the Trump post because that does absolutely reek of angry Trumper. You&#39;re also conflating the parties with the wings of the spectrum, leftists hate the Dems, liberals are their supporters. I said lefitsts hate the Dems, moderates don&#39;t and are the ones who will defend Obama.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t prove anything, if they were equal criticisms then maybe, but in this case one is just a copy of the other which would naturally attract downvotes for being a lazy shitpost.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t conflate the parties. The voters do that.</p>

<p>I put the quotes on parties because they are fake. But if you want to argue that leftists don&#39;t support the dems, you might work on some theoretical, no true Scotsman level, but the numbers disagree with you. </p>

<p>People who identify as leftist vote for the party associated with the left wing, regardless of whether or not you&#39;d classify them as truly leftist or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean... yeah.  I don&#39;t think that there are many Democrats that would disagree.  Obama was a pretty boring middle of the road leader.  Other than healthcare, I think Obama&#39;s legacy will in large part be seen as 8 years of relative stability.  The country made steady economic recovery, pulled troops out of most of combat, repaired much of the US&#39;s image, but didn&#39;t do anything to really rock the geopolitical world.  Obama was just a competent technocratic neoliberal.</p>

<p>I think Obama&#39;s legacy will be that he didn&#39;t crash the ship and kept it pointed roughly in the right direction.  Trump&#39;s legacy?  It is far too early to say, but I&#39;m pretty skeptical it is going to be as a boring and stabilizing technocratic policy guy.</p>

<p>And you still can&#39;t mention the Clean Power Plan or anything the EPA did while you rant about oil trains. </p>

<p>So your point is that because Obama didn&#39;t Ok the Keystone Pipeline suddenly he was helping &quot;big oil&quot; and Buffet?  Nah, Buffet is just smart at making money and the pipeline went through an aquifer. </p>

<p>So, we&#39;re still on 1.5/7. How in the hell did you just try to count one single failed argument as 4?</p>

<p>Want to try another one?</p>

<p>committing a logical fallacy (appealing to hipocricy) and arguing a straw man</p>

<p>These are pertinent when people try to justify Obama&#39;s actions.  Why not just say they were both wrong (more on this later).  I have no doubt that Reddit understands what these logical fallacies are, I just think there is a lot of confusion on how to apply them.</p>

<p>You show me a source and I will concede my entire point.  If he didn&#39;t say this, then people defending Obama on this issue is baseless.  </p>
