<p>Critical thinkers apparently get super pissed when you ask for complicated things like &quot;evidence&quot; lol</p>

<p>I asked you a question and now you avoid it</p>

<p>What do you hope to accomplish with your negativity? </p>

<p>Why are you here sometimes 8 hours or more a day with ALL negative comments? </p>

<p>Miss grace asked you a question as well an yet you ignore it. </p>

<p>Culturally toxic?  I had to make a guess of your character based on post history and content. An I do not think you actually understand yet what culturally toxic is. Antifa is culturally toxic, nazis are culturally toxic the msm is culturally toxic. Blog posts by people saying milk is racist is culturally toxic. Groups like Statler &amp; Mitchell who used to claim on their website they were dumbing down America through the airwaves. They changed that afetr my daily emails and phone calls to all 3 offices trying to get an answer to what they meant by that. That is culturally toxic. </p>

<p>Your country has some massive problems you&#39;re far too complacent about. You should be deeply ashamed of yourselves every day.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry.  That was directed at Trump supporters rather than at all Americans (if that&#39;s what you meant by &quot;us&quot;).  I say &quot;America is an international embarrassment&quot; in full awareness that the majority of your voters didn&#39;t choose this and can&#39;t be blamed for it at all - and I actually feel incredibly sorry for those people for what they have to put up with from their political opponents.  As an outsider, it&#39;s plain to see it&#39;s gone far beyond unreasonable and unacceptable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while the majority(/plurarity) didn&#39;t pick Trump, simply too many Americans did make that horrible choice: and as a result, it reflects incredibly poorly on your country.  Not just the red states.  Your weird trump cult is causing this embarrassment, but it&#39;s an embarrassment your entire country is burdened with unfortunately.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you manage to uproot this toxic plague of trumpism from your country and remove that moron - while not all <em>Americans</em> should technically get credit for it, it will still reflect positively on <em>America</em>.  Unfortunately, it&#39;ll be only step 1 in repairing the incredible shame the right has burdened America with.</p>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry. That was directed at racist white people, not all white people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the real problem right here. This is why you see more white people protesting hate groups than black people. Because of a few racist assholes, all whites are getting a bad rap. These antiracist whites are just trying to save face. Let&#39;s be fair, when you said &quot;Your country is totally not racist&quot;, you meant white people.</p>

<p>Yes. There are racists in America. Yeah, Trump and his cabinet are racists. There aren&#39;t that many racists in America. Maybe 10 or 20 thousand out of 300 million people. The cameras just make it look a lot worse than it is. Now, we&#39;re talking publicly advertised racists here, not Bob at the car wash who doesn&#39;t hire brown people. Of course, that kind of racism, the systemic racism, has been on the decline for decades. All of this antifa vs. kkk bullshit is just stirring up drama and having the exact opposite effect of what it&#39;s supposed to.</p>

<p>Your Trumpitis, on the other hand, only goes to show how little you actually know about the government, and the process of removing a president. Trump is not the cause, Trump is the symptom. American cronnie capitalist politicians are the issue. Rampant corruption and ineptitude are the issue. People just voted for trump because they are tired of that. Wanting a border wall does not make you racist, it just means you are under/unemployed and stupid. Let me say this again. Immigration is not why you (Americans) can&#39;t make enough money working 40 hours a week to feed yourself. Obamacare is not why an appendectomy cots 20,000USD. You&#39;re all fucking brainwashed idiots who keep falling for the same tricks over and over again.</p>

<p>So you say America is an International Embarassment?! I say you don&#39;t know the half of it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what they want you to think. That&#39;s how they stay in power. They&#39;ve got you all falling for the false dichotomy logical fallacy. There were, in fact, 4 choices. The only reason anyone felt like the choice was between trump and clinton is because that&#39;s what the media told you to think. It&#39;s only hard to get 67 million people to vote outside of party lines because the ones who profit most control said media.</p>

<p>If offensive speech is not protected, freedom of expression does not exist. </p>

<p>ANTIFA would be so many times more effective if, instead of advocating for the violent suppression of expression they showed up at these protests, faced away from the white supremacists while holding signs and banners that said things to the effect of &quot;These peoples&#39; beliefs are antithetical to my own, but I would fight to protect their right to express themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>The cultural reality is that this is untrue, &#39;whites&#39; today is far more inclusive than &#39;whites&#39; 2 generations ago. It is also recognized that genocide is an active language as opposed to the passive language of dying out so the two are clearly different things and trying to equate the two is just racist nonsense. Not to mention the statistical reality is so miniscule (especially in the context of the refugee crisis that has popularized it) that its statistical significance is still up for question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point. Finally a cohesive argument instead of pure insults. Not a statistician yet it seems very disproportionate compared to the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. Everyone knows this is being built up by the media as some sort of &quot;race&quot; thing. Just making a relevant point as relayed to me from a buddy who still has a scar on his head from fighting real racism. Even though some have a hard time believing I have a black friend.

Fake news all around, so then Reddit and twitter started focusing on the littering of protest signs and they were downvoting everything in new about the peacefulness and record-breaking attendance numbers. </p>

<p>Obviously there&#39;s been violence at these rallies/protests, but Im not not surprised people are making shit up about them. Same tactics as back during civil rights era. I highly recommend people read primary sources from that time to see how bizarrely closely history is repeating itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all it is not &quot;mostly white kids with clubs&quot; Thats just blatantly false. That might be what the news likes to show you but it&#39;s not reality. The prodominatley black marches of the 60s were met with brutal violence from police and white supremacists. It kind of makes sense that 50 years later the methods would&#39;ve changed. Maybe if the Goverment hadn&#39;t killed of so many of the 60s era civil rights leaders there would be some moderating influences on the chosen tactics of young activists. I think the phenomenon your friend is bemoaning is called solidarity. But maybe some people aren&#39;t actually fighting for marginalized groups as much as themselves and future of their country. Someone could want to destroy the war machine and the carceral state for purely fiscal and not humanitarian reasons. Same goes for universal healthcare and education.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if the statues were built by the Democrats,  then why all the fuss when Democrats want to take them down?  They made them, they can take them down, right?  No reason for the Alt-Right to even care about what happens to them, since they were supposedly against them from the start, right?</p>

<p>If what you say means anything,  then all the white supremacists,  Nazis, KKK and Alt-Right people should have absolutely no cares in the world about any and all Confederate statues!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because white supremacists shifted their tactics.  They used to be able to use black people as a scapegoat for all of societies ills because they were a marginalized minority with no civil rights protections.  Now they have all kinds of civil protections.  Maybe more than any other racial group.  </p>

<p>So the white supremacists in realizing this shifted their focus to white pride and a more generalized hate for any group that isn&#39;t a white protestant Christian. Funnily enough they&#39;ve adopted a lot of political correctness style tactics in their rhetoric in order to survive.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not just about race it&#39;s about class and poverty. White privilege is going away and in its place everyone is being treated like minorities used to be. Not talking about physical or hate, but economically. This generation of young people are raised to be financial slaves to the 1%. They will pay rent all their lives and work low paid meaningless jobs to pay off mountains of student loan debt. And the older ones realize they will likely never be able to retire or afford the care in old age that their parents had. The environment is being destroyed. Antibiotics have stopped working.</p>

<p>Race is part of the issue, but it&#39;s also a proxy. The alt right sees all the same problems as the left, but they have been sold a line that it&#39;s blacks, or other minorities, or immigrants, or jews, or liberals and sjws and intellectuals, that are the problem. The right sees this country&#39;s failings as a moral dilemma based on the erosion of the cultural and religious norms of their parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; generations. The left sees them as a moral dilemma stemming from crony capitalism, authoritatrianism, and nationalsm. The right is looking to the past for solutions. The left, deluded though they often are, is looking to the future.</p>

<p>just look at what happened when those two white girls walked into an HBCU with maga hats on</p>

<p>we stole your hats, and told you to fuck yourself</p>

<p>and it was unanimous....not fringe....we really dont like you</p>

<p>like REALLY DONT LIKE YOU</p>

<p>and thats not gonna change....no matter how many &quot;black friends&quot; you conjure up to fit your narrative that black people arent taking a side</p>

<p>trust me we are.....trust me you are on the opposite side....if you voted trump </p>

<p>us black people dont really have an opinion on Antifa because most of us dont really know what it is and just became aware of its existence ....but if you tell any black person &quot;oh yea ...those the guys that go beat up the Right Wing Militias at the rallies&quot;</p>
