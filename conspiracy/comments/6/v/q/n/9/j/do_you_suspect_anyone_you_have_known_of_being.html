    <div class="md"><p>Based on every complaint made these days, on every article that blames this one for that and that one for this, I&#39;d be surprised if anyone had a mind for themselves. Seems these days folks would rather blame everyone else for current situations and not be held accountable themselves. </p>

<p>There is about 750,000 to one ratio between public and TPTB .... and seemingly everything is Trumps fault. </p>

<p>Newsflash, your grandfather, your uncles, you dad, and you have let it get to this. Its the peoples fault as much as any politician. </p>

<p>So ..... based on that evidence ... the handler concept could be real, but, I would imagine for the most part, it&#39;s just another excuse as to why someone sucks at times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet again, you have deviated from your definition.  You said they are searching for victims.  You are using intelligence specific terminology but applying new definitions to the words.  You also said they don&#39;t have specific targets but implied they search randomly or without guidelines.  You&#39;ve also said this is a well known phenomenon.  Could you please address some of these conflicts?  I&#39;m not trying to be argumentative, so please excuse me if I am coming across that way.

In my case, the managing handlers never show themselves. Instead, the managers &quot;lasso&quot; itinerant dropouts, and run them thru dime-store manchurian candidate protocols.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, so you&#39;re asking the uninitiated people if they are aware of the low-level programming that they might have been subjected to by second or third-tier &quot;intelligence&quot; operatives.  Well, by the quality of the supposed top-rate intelligence agents in this country (US,) I am surprised if their subordinates know who is in charge or how to run a proper op.  It appears to me that even the &quot;professionals&quot; are LARPing their way through life. The chain-of-command (and I use that term loosely) is cluttered with people that don&#39;t have the patience or humbleness to manage a long term op without it going off the rails.

    <div class="md"><p>if you mean random strangers who approach you in public out of the blue and try to appeal to something you do not wear on your sleeve then yes. </p>

<p>I have always been vocal about my distrust in the government,police,an the likes. I also had just moved to a new place and knew no one. So no one knew my views when i went to the bar that night. Bar was pretty empty so there were plenty of seats for the guy who approached me to not have to sit right next to me. Yet he did, football was on the TV, he sees I am watching it, then says..&quot;fucking government right?!!&quot; I immediately got up and walked out an never went back to that place again. </p>

<p>An then during the election season I was very vocal about my distrust in that cunt (distrusted the trumpet too but the msm had no problem sharing his flaws with the public.) I would randomly post things on fb..an one day I decided to tag a post with hillary for the guillotine. 5 minutes later a former coworker who I had not spoken too or seen in over a year calls me to ask when the last time i went shooting, an started talking about the looming civil war an did I have enough weapons. I kept trying to change the subject an he kept trying to bring it back to civil war an asking if I saw recent Alex jones stories (not an AJ reader).  </p>

<p>It could be my paranoia from my earlier days as a pharmacist but my gut told me something was off.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are out there. An it is indeed strange. I guess my benefit has been my immediate distrust of anyone I do not know an my skepticism with people I do and have not seen in awhile.   Always watch you back. An trust no one. </p>
