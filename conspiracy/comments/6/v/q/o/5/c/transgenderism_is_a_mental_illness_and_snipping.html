       40% commits suicide. Not influenced by bullying because suicide rates are the same amongst those who were not being questioned about being transgender.

       The reason I post this under 'conspiracy' is that it may get me banned less quickly. For 'hate speech'. I do not hate anyone, I am just tired of playing this game.

       its because of the feeling of still not being accepted in community. and posts like these, alienating, and nontrans people speaking over them. simple math. imagine feeling like an outsider your entire life. not everyone has depression and struggles as much after stuff like surgeries or hormones, but more importantly that shouldnt mean anything. theyre the gender they are even if theyve had surgery or not and thats not for cis people to talk against. im cis myself and im not saying ive said bad things before, but i listen when minorities like trans people tell me about whats ok and whats not for them. its not for us to decide. dont get why people get so hung up on having to be selfless, just take care of yourself and dont be an ass

       I think that's a cop out. There about 8 trillion things you can be insecure about and use to fall into depression. Too short, bald, ugly, fat, crippled, stupid, etc. No other group is committing suicide at this rate, even people that have far more reason to like those with chronic deadly diseases. There's some real discussion to be had here, and OP is right to want to have it. It's not about being hateful, it's about understanding and reality.

       People who have Body dysmorphic disorder issues that wind up anorexic... we don't say they should be able to express themselves however they want. We try to get them mental help. Why do we not treat transgender issues this way? It seems like a gender dysmorphic issue that should be treated in some manner for mental health.

       Yeah but since we as humans are more evolved and aware than other animals, we can choose not to do things that hurt others, even if it's in our nature. Being gay, however, does not hurt anyone so who gives a fuck?

       There's a lot to this. I don't hate, dislike, or feel any negative feelings towards anyone who is in this predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I am extremely wary of the predatory nature of the psycho-medical establishment in this whole thing, and of the puppet masters behind them pushing the agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have first hand witnessed a young, middle school child who was depressed and self-injurious be admitted involuntarily to a psych ward for a week, coming out the other side saying it was gender related. The family was immediately put in touch with specialists that
       <br/>
       were talking on the phone - before ever seeing or talking with the child - about the urgency of medication options to stop puberty, and about surgical options after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was like, hmm, whatever happened to working with people to help them learn how to love and accept themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearest sign to me that something serious is going on. This is a straight up used car sales technique - "act now, before it's too late".

       I've seen articles that highlight some of the brave souls in the mental health field who seem to be finally speaking out on it too.

       Did you feel there was 'one big thing' in your life that was wrong and that if you could figure out what it was you would just be 'right'? Or did you feel that there were a lot of things 'wrong' that made you not comfortable with who you were and eventually came to realize that the foreground of that wrong feeling was that you were the wrong sex?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm getting at what point did you realize you were trans? and did you think that you were like 'incomplete' being the sex you were born as?

      <p>
       I guess whenever I think about it, I kind of just assume the person must be depressed beforehand, or have some kind of dissociative feeling that they aren't totally themselves

       This shit's gonna be long, guys.  TL;DR at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a preschool age living in Memphis, Tennessee at the time, with the only exposure to "difference" being black people. I am white.  I was alone in my room playing with some Toy Story toys (I had the whole crew), when all of a sudden, my conscious comes through, pretty commanding actually, saying, "you know you're a boy, right?" I responded internally with just a child-like "yeah."
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to know that my father was a marine aviator at the time, so moving occurred often.  I've lived in several southern states.  Once I had began preschool, probably after half a year, we moved to Massachusetts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole early childhood revolved around trying to befriend other boys, but getting rejected because I was a girl.  It brought on a lot of anger as I got older. I'd often ask my mother why the neighborhood boys didn't like me, and she just responded simply with, "well, you're a little girl, and little boys don't like little girls yet." Inner me is screaming, "but I am a boy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       When doing things like watching Disney movies or playing video games I would always identify with the male characters.  As soon as I was old enough to start dictating my attire, I'd always beg my mom to let me shop in the boys section.  At first she wouldn't, but gave in quickly when she realized that I found no comfort or identity when trying on girls clothing.  The cut of the shirts, the cut of the pants... wearing them was embarrassing.  And the color pallet! It was disgusting! 50 shades of pastel pink is what the girls section is!
      </p>
      <p>
       Halloween was fun for me.  One year she made me an excellent Link costume from the Legend of Zelda. However, I was not allowed to wear costumes for boys that involved fake muscles.  Wouldn't let me be a Marine with a fake muscular chest and abs for my military themed birthday one year.  I was probably 10ish at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout elementary school, my best friend was a boy.  We loved to take our video games into reality and role play.  Again, always a male character.  During recess soccer games, the boys would pick me for boys vs. girls.  It wasn't up until about 5th grade when sex education began, that the anger and depression began to rear its ugly head.  Of course, I had to be placed with all the females for this.  I remember sitting there furiously angry that, out of a 50/50 chance, I got put on the wrong team, so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was under the impression that this was not something I could fix, that I was stuck having to deal with being female and being a woman.  Now entering middle school in a white, wealthy town, I figured that I was just a lesbian.  About halfway through 6th grade I began to get bullied for my gender neutral appearance by some basic bitches.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is when I decided to do a little experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hopped into my mom's '03 VW turbo S beetle, said, "Mom, we're going to Hollister, I'm doing a thing."  At the time, my mom was fully aware that I had come out as a lesbian, and neither her nor my father had any qualms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went to Hollister, where I acquired a bounty of tank tops, girl cut jeans, and even... jean mini skirts.  I played that basic bitch mold like a fiddle.  The next day, those girls kissed my ass and batted an eye as if they had never had a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were the dark days of depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I toughed out three years of middle school playing the woman game until it was time for high school.  A couple of the oddball friends I had made along the way assured me that high school would be better, that no one would care if I cut my hair off and went back to dressing like a guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what? They were exactly right.
      </p>
      <p>
       About halfway through freshman year I had a massive awakening.  The conversation I had with myself in Tennessee had rushed back to me one night before falling asleep! I was swelling with joy that I could now begin the steps toward inner peace!  That next day I walked into a local, generic hair-cuttery and requested that they "cut it all off."  The female stylist was a little confused, for I had long, straight, thick brown hair. She attempted, even tried to feminize it, but eventually she cut it all off, and it felt great.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until my junior year that I told my parents what was happening.  They had a bit of a "wait and see" attitude towards it, but they knew my intelligence and they could sense that this was very real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to pick a name, right?  I had a peer in high school that took it upon herself to make a list of 1002 names.  For a few days during lunch I would narrow it down until I had a small handful to work with.  When I went home, I'd look myself in the mirror and say the names until one sparked a fire inside me.  That was it.  That would be my name.  I guess there's no harm in telling; I went from Charlotte to Brian.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was very open in high school.  I was even allowed to educate my sex ed class on the subject.  The teacher thought it would be wrong for him to teach something he knew nothing about.  My class was quiet and respectful, and I hope it made them better people when responding to difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       I left the school's gay-straight alliance after coming out though.  They put me on a pedestal and gushed over how brave and courageous I was.  I didn't like that, after all, I was just being myself and I didn't think of it like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time I've felt like I was trying to be something I wasn't were those three years of middle school when I acted as a basic bitch.  I call it acting because that's what it was, just an act to get by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come time for graduation, I was approached by my Vice Principle and asked which name I would prefer to be announced by.  I confidently requested Brian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until I started hormone treatment I was horribly depressed.  This body, in its estrogen filled state, was not able to meet my demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I started testosterone, most of my problems had diminished.  I've been taking testosterone for over four years and it is fascinating how powerful this is with shaping bodies. My fat has been redistributed to other parts of my hairy body, my voice is undeniably masculine, and I even have a solid chinstrap beard right now.  Literally a second puberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a couple of months I'll be going in for chest reconstruction to get rid of these fucking tits.  What about bottom surgery you say?  Too crass, hasn't progressed enough yet to be worth while.  I'm okay with prosthetics for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something you folks need to realize is, in order to do any of this stuff, you have to be cleared by a doctor, a therapist, or both before you can begin hormones or have surgery.  They want to be sure that you are who you say you are.  They don't want any regrets, as it usually results in suicide.  That's fair right? So why are we getting all up in a tizzy about people waking up, putting on wigs and dresses and using the women's room?  If the media could educate the masses when topics are hot, the bathroom issue wouldn't have gotten very far.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Local man stuck in woman's body does something about it and achieves inner peace.

       You decided you were a boy in preschool? It seems really young to be making such a huge decision. I can't remember thinking anything at that age. My sister was like you, never wanted to wear dresses, wore boy clothes (still does actually), and was basically the biggest Tom boy you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, she started playing softball and found a lot of girls just like her, Tom boys who like sports and hate"girly" stuff and that helped her to get through the identity crisis she was experiencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       She does roller derby now, lives with her best friend/partner. The problem isn't you, the problem is our societies strict definition on what boys are supposed to be like and what girls are supposed to be like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know you can be macho and masculine and also be feminine? We all have the capacity for both and one isn't exclusively male or female. Liking the color pink and wearing dresses doesn't make you a woman and being macho and masculine doesn't make you a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be yourself.

       Our bodies, these vessels, as I like to call, are temporary.  But the soul?  This is why I'm intrigued at my own "just knowing."  And don't get confused, this wasn't a "do you want to be" moment. This was a

       For sure, not trying to disappear dispute the veracity of your story, I'm just surprised that you were so self aware at such a young age. Do you have any comments on societies construct of what is considered masculine and feminine? Did you ever think that maybe societies constructs don't match reality?

       Exactly, and just because you don't fit the mold of what a woman is supposed to be doesn't mean your not every bit a woman as any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I also believe that every human being should be in control of their own destiny and if being transgender makes you happy, more power to you. As long as your comfortable with your decision then by all means do whatever you feel would bring the most happiness.

       Alright I've seen and heard this thousands of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a female to male transexual. I am fully aware I have XX Chromosomes.  I am also fully aware I will never have XY Chromosomes.  This does not mean I did not have severe dysphoria. And the only treatment for said dysphoria was transition. Trans people are not delusional we are fully aware an actual sex change is impossible.  That's why that term is falling out of favour and moving towards gender reassignment or gender affirming surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read this study to cite on a number of occasions and it has some issues. It compares trans suicide rates to cis suicide rates which is apples and oranges. It doesn't categorize pre or post transition. Many other studies show and drastic drop in suicide rates post transition, and they become average with transition and acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if we want trans people to stop offing themselves in record numbers, it's really simple.... Don't be an asshole.

       Having a female body(in my case) I equate to having a third ear on your for head.  Does it cause any physical debilitating injury or illness? No. Can it cause a severe amount of distress and dysphoria? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently there is no reliable treatment for severe, persistent gender dysphoria, aside from physical transition. In the future there may be. I personally doubt it as it calls into all sorts of medical ethics, but that is neither here nor there.

       But the amount this is being pushed has gone beyond hysteria.  The real conspiracy is why they're pushing this so hard, for such a small percentage of the populace.

       It shifts the focus from labor exploitation, rising economic inequality and the rise of authoritarianism to individual pseudo problems like 5000 different assumed genders. It's basically keeping up the system of exploitation while holding up the illusion that there is something to fight for.

       What I find most striking is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       I go to church. No need right now for discussing the crusades, but I don't impose my belief on others. I go to church on Sunday. The thing that confuses me most is that whenever I tell the general public that I'm a churchgoer, I'm considered a lunatic that believes in fairytales and unicorns. But simultaneously I HAVE to believe that people that cut their dicks into vaginas (to quote Norm MacDonald) are completely healthy and should widely be accepted by everyone and it should even be taught in school to 4 year old children, and if I'd even start questioning this I'm a transphobe and hate-speecher. This is the scariest part of it all.

       Not only is your claim directly contradicted by the study, but you also completely misconstrue the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trans people are fighting the same fight that gay people have been fighting for the past 50 years (arbitrarily choosing the Stonewall riots as a major turning point in the fight for gay rights). Prior to that, christians like yourself were saying that homosexuality was a disease and you'd be damned if you accepted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So congratulations, you and your fellow christians are once again on the front lines fighting for religious hatred of a minority you don't like.

Guess what, there's people who believe they were supposed to be a cat. Or a tree. This is the delusion of millennials.  People who have everything one could ask for so start questioning whether they're male or female.

       So if you don't disclose, and others can't tell, suicide attempts are less elevated?

       People keep talking about trans people as a conspiracy. Now I understand what I am about to say is a fetish to some.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about forcedfem and sissyhypno? These are both subs on reddit. An there is a larger presence on the web, with many similar things on snap and tumblr.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could argue that these are adult fetish sites. But i wonder what role it plays on a young boy who just hit puberty and is exposed to this. I want to research this angle more but not really wanna watch these videos. I did with one last yr an it throughout the flashing pictures and soothing voice that was trying to condition the viewer to become a sex slave for men, had a swastika flashing on the screen throughout. I had saved the video to start an investigation in to who is behind them. ( My mindset was that I have heard of the nazis wanting to feminize men to destabilize countries.)

       THAT'S where you're wrong. We shouldn't 'shut the fuck up' about people with bipolar disorder or anorexic people either. Plainly ignoring it, avoiding conflict, being afraid of offending them and  and trying to accept it as 'normal' (that's how the gay establishment wants us to see it) is not going to solve anything in the slightest.

       so you believe that as someone who doesn't have bipolar disorder or anorexia that you're best equipped to recommend how those issues should be handled? you don't know, you have to refer to experts unless you embrace ignorance. and the experts have a drastically different opinion on the matter than you do.

       I think thats a rather simplistic view, and a potentially dangerous blanket statement. Sure, it is probably true for some unknown fraction of the demographic, but the rest of them suffer form something thats more akin to a birth defect. The brain chemistry and structure is different between the genders, and the brain structure of some trans people are more similar to their experienced gender than what their default genetalia would suggest.
So what I'm saying is that you are arguing from a place of ignorance, you've reached the peak of

       You people have a point that gender reassignment surgery is perhaps being pushed too hard, but have you actually seen people who have physical sexual attributes that are a blend of both sexes? Those people have a good case to make about gender reassignment surgery. There is actually a person at my job that I could have sworn was a woman, but still has a penis. It happens. Be thankful for what you have. Even if that person gets their surgery, most of us won't want to make love with them anyway. What a crappy deal
