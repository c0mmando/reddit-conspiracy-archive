       The truthfulness of this meme may vary on a case-by-case basis, but ultimately given how language and culture propagate it's a
       <strong>
        pretty fucking good heuristic
       </strong>
       , huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bot activates on a hair-trigger (so while it acknowledges bias being complex, it's annoying, so the evident goal is to prevent people using the expression at all) and by way of refutation deploys some specious anecdotes that
       <strong>
        don't even undermine the saying
       </strong>
       . I've never heard
       <em>
        anybody
       </em>
       object to the expression (a clear generalisation) before, why would anybody aggressively want people to stop saying it... unless this has a lot less to do with ancient history than it does with stopping people applying the comb to modern history.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit: several commenters claim that it's to prevent the expression being used as a lazy argument. I have never seen this. The bar for comments on
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history
       </a>
       is fairly high, and every post that I've seen the bot reply to was either simply mentioning the expression or stating that the adage is applicable in a case
       <em>
        and then reasoning out why
       </em>
       . I don't remember ever seeing it being used as the basis of an argument. This is what I mean by hair-trigger, and part of why it appears to be directed at simply surpressing the phrase entirely.

       Oh just how they were systematically decimated and removed from the lands that are more rightfully theirs than anyone elses. We love to study their cultures but then we turn around and glorify the cultures that genocided them. Idk. I know diseases played a big role but it's still pretty fucked up what they are today vs. what they were.

       Meanwhile the lands they have left are systematically poisoned. My overall argument isn't very well sourced and is pretty emotional I will admit. I have zero Native American blood AFAIK I just can't help but feel bad for what they have lost as a race.

       This is a good point. I guess the problem is that the culture of their ancestors relied so much in a healthy environment that is essentially impossible for their old lessons or methods to have any relavance  in today's society. I don't claim to have a solution in mind it's just a tragedy of historic proportions that has gone on for so long that is a way of life

       Their way of life was obsolete too. It's very very sad, I think extermination of them was horrible, but we need to think how to make people more productive not wallow and give away free things. Teach a man to fish, not giving him one is the path to a productive society

       Really? Coz I grew up in Florida and from the second the native americans were introduced the textbooks were hammering home the fact that they got fucked from the second the western world stepped foot on the new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, wasn't even only the textbooks, but the movies they showed throughout my years in school also drove home that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that not every state/district gets the same books, but I'm going to ASSume your own history classes weren't saying that native americans deserved it or that it wasn't the noble westerners that wiped them out or that most of the native killing happened in the southern countries.

       The jews were only a small portion of the victims and their numbers were greatly exeggerated in order to bring forth more excuses for Israel. Hitler killed more germans than jews and is probably a jew himself, also he supported Israel and helped build the united nations, a global supremacist organization based on controlling the world's countries.

       I don't know where and when you went to school. This was early 90's in Norway. And we did learn about the other groups as victims as well.

       Same in America. LGBT, blacks, etc were all rounded up; but only the Jews were the ones that were mass killed. What you won't hear is that when the Allies moved int o save them, LGBT members were still treated like crap, blacks were treated like second class by American Forces.

       I agree; and yet there were folks in Texas (where most of our textbooks are made) a year or two ago trying to say that they were Indentured Servants rather than Slaves.

       No, they were slaves. They were not paid for their work pre-American Civil War. But there were indentured slaves, though mostly Irish and treated worst than the slaves.

       Sorry, I may not be being clear, but I agree they were slaves. My stance on it is that the people trying to rewrite history (the arseholes in Texas) are full of shit, but they almost got away with it. I'm pretty sure the indentured servant this is getting off topic and I also strongly disagree that they were treated worse, but, again, off-topic.

       Oh, I agree with you. Winners write history. But also, IIRC, it takes time for the truth to takes it place in history as well. The truth to WWII, the American Civil War, etc; they were all being exposed till recently. Now you cannot even stated the correct record without being called a racist or a Nazi.

       Oh i messed up the first part as it's the other way around but the point is that if you control what people know about history in the present then history becomes entirely subjective, subject to manipulation such that it can provide a precedent to future action.
If you disagree with that point then please explain why.

       I took issue with your butchering of the quote. Both parts are wrong. It's a quote from 1984 and it read "He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past."
      </p>
      <p>
       I also disagree with your using it in this context. Fake history is a stupid concept and could really only be believed by someone who doesn't actually research history. There isn't some massive conspiracy among all modern historians to obscure the truth about the past. It would be impossible to contain and anyone who's spent any time in academic circles would understand why. There are deep divisions amongst historians about almost every aspect of their research and none can agree 100% on anything. A lot of them even hold personal animus toward one another because of their beliefs. This system works because it's democratic. The totality of the modern historical research field is pretty good at discovering a mostly accurate portrait of reality from a bird's eye view.
      </p>
      <p>
       This quote may certainly have rang true in the past, but with how interconnected society has been since the industrial revolution, there really aren't many ways to completely obfuscate the truth about the world. The world is no longer groups of massive hegemonies ruling over vast swaths of people that are completely disconnected from their neighbors. In the same way that we know, basically, what's happening inside of North Korea and Iran, even though we have no direct connection to them, the recent past can't be effectively hidden by the victors on a long-term scale. In the short-term, of course things will be obfuscated, but given a long enough period of time, the truth will expose itself.

       I always facepalm at those who care more for the wording of a sentence than the content of it. It's almost as bad as those facebook arguments you see where a single typo gives reason for the other to completely disregard the point. Considering how intermingled cause and effect are does it really matter what order the words were in, read the sentence and judge what the words say; it does you no service to concern yourself over the particular way another person said much the same thing in the past unless you believe a person can truly own words.
      </p>

       I do not believe that censorship of history and state sponsered revisions of history are a thing of fantasy. I understand the picture that you paint of how the collective concept of history works, in my response i will use science as a a comparison since i feel that they are both fields that attempt to be objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The progress of science has been regularly waylaid by restrictions placed on the area of research and the selective allocation of funding throughout history. The version of science that reaches the masses does not avoid distortion from private parties with vested interests.

       When a heliocentric model of the galaxy was proposed it did not recieve acceptance by the vatican as it conflicted with their perfect rendition of the heavens, likewise Professor Nutt did not keep his job long once he started talking about cannabis. 
The world accepted heliocentricity over time and i have hope that Britains legal stance towards drugs will change but if they don't his voice won't be the opinion being recorded and reviewed in 50/500 years time since it was completely denied a platform and any of his written material that lasts that long will most likely undergo countless revisions until it has lost all content of worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the internet, i can't help but feel that as it has increased our interconnectivity it has also increased the capabilities for these private parties to subvert the way we think (cultural identity, national history, societal norms, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are some people who are capable of discerning a form of truth regarding the events of the world but i very much doubt that this truth is being recorded in a fashion intended to be freely accessible to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not making an attack on the idea of history, i'm making an attack on the specific form of history that our regimes have pushed on us; a very biased and one sided form of history that can be constantly fitted up to suit whichever narrative appeals today.

       Yep, just recently the claim that Europeans deliberately gave the natives smallpox laced drapes has been debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just SJW propaganda by Wind Churchill in attempt to get more victim points. In reality propagating diseases was inevitable, Europeans came in with vaccines, guns and a boat that could cross an ocean, resisting was just a stupid idea.

       For example, the Ohio River valley being completely empty when the English settlers arrived wasnt some grand plan.  Its because the dominant tribe traded furs with Europeans to get muskets, ball, and powder, then went on a spree of conquest against other tribes.

       The good test of SJWism: They make an argument and the conclusion requires that a group they belong to get some kind of compensation in money, power, or advantage.

       That link just debunks the allegation that one epidemic in 1837 was caused by the U.S. Army distributing small pox blankets.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not dispute claims of Europeans doing it when they were first exploring the continent or the more substantiated claim that they were used during the French and Indian War (1754–63).
      </p>
      <p>
       The small pox vaccine wasn't invented until 1796 a long time after European settlers would have introduced it to Native Americans so they didn't bring vaccines with them at all.  The "SJW propaganda" was about the U.S. Army not Europeans.

       is actually one of the best subreddits for information, its perfectly fine to have conflicting ideas of what happened there as long as they are backed up by research papers and study.

       I think this is them trying to not overload the mods with deletions and being more transparent but honestly they just deleted non-sourced stuff. I saw plenty of controversial things studied including a few they definitely would not want you to know in America(destabilization of South America is one that constantly pops up).

       It's a heavily moderated subreddit that often requires top level comments to include references. If you make a logical misstep or cite a poor source, it will be evident by reviewing your comment. If people want to refute a claim in a comment, they should do so by refuting your source or refuting your conclusion based on it. Replying that winners write history doesn't add anything to the conversation. Also, historians already know that "winners write history" so they tend to do their research with that in mind anyway.

       And that is because the winners, the Northern European barbarians were illiterate, and stayed illiterate for centuries, Charlemagne, the first  Northern European Emperor of Northern Europe was himself illiterate.

       I didn't mean to imply that he wasn't intelligent. It is written that he was gifted with the ability to learn other languages and he did manage to unify a large part of Europe for the first time following the fall of the Romans, then reinstalled Rome as a power by having the Pope bless himself and the Empire he assembled. He also promoted literacy and sparked the Carolingian Renaissance.

       i was half joking- i have a pretty large gap in my history knowledge between 500 and 1200 and took a moment to read about him once for an hour and remembered he had a literate friend and enjoyed court life. i should take some time with it someday, particularly the pope part.

       It is an era we don't know much about because there isn't much written history of those times and what is written is by people who were literate because of their associations with old Rome and of course the Christians so there is only a limited perspective available.

       According to certain prominent conspiracy researchers the major hubs of power are the city states technically not part of a country" DC, London, and Vatican City. The world empire as I see it moved its base of power from Egypt / Sumeria to Rome, then to Britain, then to the US. Look up stuff on the Vatican and their suborders like Knights of Malta, Knights Templar, and the Jesuits who were Rome's intelligence agency that later founded the CIA.

       Not only that. Once both sides of most conflicts started writing we had plenty of records kept on both sides to show aspects of events. Much of history chose to ignore those aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence current historical work is about trying to rebalance the bias of the past historians by providing external context from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the biggest issue is "history is written by the winners" doesn't accomplish the goal it's used for. People use it to explain discrepancies with reality when in fact it does nothing of the sort and instead just completely discredits all history.

       Yes, I agree the losing side is keeps their own record and credible historians read accounts from both sides, recognizing the need of the actual warriors and leaders to record not only events but often very politically directed versions.

       The victors often die out and the books get updated?  The Mongol Horde took over China, but we don't still view Ghengis Khan as a god.  The Vietnamese expelled the U.S. forces, but they aren't writing their own story on what happened.

       Yes but most history books are sourced from material that can only be gathered from a successful civilization that was able to protect their knowledge. Those that are burned to the ground are an archaeological footnote.

       Maybe it's not so much that the victors write history, but that the losers don't have a chance to make a mark on it when they are wiped from it.

       The south lost and in doing so surrendered the right to secede that there was no legitimate Constitutional basis to prohibit or deny in the first place. That's what the war settled or rather forced into existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover the war certainly didn't start and wasn't fought over slavery. That only entered into it much later in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read your history. The Fugitive Slave Act was in full force in all but a few states in the north that refused to comply with it prior to the Civil War whether they allowed slavery or not and there were still "slaves" in many wealthy homes and on large farms even in New York State right up until the Proclamation of Emancipation 1863, a full two years *after" the Civil War had started.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Confederate States weren't the only ones with slaves, there were many States on the Union side that did as well and despite a mish-mash of efforts to curtail the practice in any number of them there were actually no hard and fast rules to completely prevent it until the XIII  Amendment was finally and officially passed in 1865.
      </p>
      <p>
       All wars are basically fought over property, wealth, and resources and the Civil War was certainly no exception.

       You're looking at this via Western/USA centric glasses based on what you learned in YOUR textbooks or what you think Asia is doing. Do you know anything about Asian politics? This isn't accurate at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan has been in hot water several times as recent as 2014/2015 for portraying events nicer than they actually were in their textbooks. It wasn't until international outcry they are slowly trying to fix it since early 2000s and the issue persists today because Japan changes things extremely slow. They depicted the events of their "wins" in Asia (especially in Korea) by downplaying how bad it was or outright omitted things. Sure, a Western textbook will point out every wrong thing Japan did during a time period of war, but their own books don't reflect that. I'm sure there's other Asian countries that have done this. I know South Korea has controversies about their books as well, though, I'll admit I don't study SK politics much.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Asia hides and misconstrues recent political or war related events in their books because each country disagrees and recounts them differently. That's why something as "stupid" as a few sea rocks can ruin relations between countries. See
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/07/160745930/little-islands-are-big-trouble-in-the-south-china-sea">
        here
       </a>
       . Even both Koreas refuse to call the Sea of Japan by that name. It's a big deal there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan outright denied the "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#History_of_the_issue">
        comfort women rapes
       </a>
       " issue TWICE in the past decade despite admitting to the atrocity in the 90's. It wasn't until 2015 Japan finally did something about it via money, but money isn't what Korean women want - they want
       <strong>
        fixed textbooks
       </strong>
       and an apology. Something they still do not have as of TODAY. SK and Japan hold a lot of hate to one another and you won't see all those issues in your American textbooks. Most mentions of their conflict stops at the end of WW2 despite it existing today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan is very much 'written by the winners' in which, and as you may or may not know, Japan "won" often for a long time in Asia. Sorry your limited worldview prevents you from seeing this. Your version of Asian history was written by Westerners. Pick up two text books from different Asian countries involved in a conflict with one another. The events are not depicted the same. Look at recent past 100 year history to see biased narratives being taught.

       When people ask questions and find out that say for instance, Christopher Columbus never discovered the world was a globe as that was already know or that he ever set foot in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while an attempt may be made, in the end, the truth comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people didn't know that Stalin and Hitler made a deal to attack Poland together and did. But because the Soviets became western allies, that was left out of the story. However, many people know it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on. But as stated, an attempt is usually made, then what really happened is found out by actual study.

       Or that Poland seized parts of Czechoslovakia when Germany did, or that the Allies were telling Poland not to negotiate with Germany over Danzig even though they knew about the German-Soviet plan, and then they never actually came to help Poland like they promised.

       Or that it was literally French policy before WWI to get Alsace and Lorraine back, that getting Germany into a two-front war starting in the Balkans would give France the best chance to win a war, and that France loaned their allies Russia and Serbia huge amounts of money to improve their armies and infrastructure (like railroads to the German border), and encouraged Serbia not to accept the Austrian ultimatum...and Germany gets all the blame for that war. Jerks.

       Hey now, the Japanese can take some blame too. In fact...they could take a lot of blame. But I guess because many of us here are of European descent, that part of the war is even more veiled to us? The Japanese inflicted their imperial aggression on China a few years before the Nazis started getting violent with other countries. For the first few years, the Nazis were mostly beating on their own. Sicko weirdos that they were and all. But the Japanese were running cruel and inhumane experiments on hapless Chinese in 1937 via their Unit 731 . That stuff is just downright scary too when you look it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at things these two countries did, you really have to wonder at the underlying psychology. Just utterly sick minded things and the men put in charge of doing these things...how? How does it come to psychopaths having the keys to all cities? What the hell is wrong with us as a species anyway? That's the big question to me.

       The Soviets won World War 2 but we know that they raped and pillaged their way across East Germany. In fact, we know this partially because we cross reference German propaganda pieces referencing rapes, with official reports from both governments, and with personal writings from the victims and attackers both.

       History is written by the victors, time and time again. Sure, those who study history may know this, but that is going to be less than 20% of the population. Therefore this phrase is quite important in educating those folks who don't quite understand the concept.

       It isn't profound though. History is history. And while battles are spun as being won etc, history itself is not written by victors. If that were true we wouldn't know anything about the crimes against humanity that took place in order for Europeans to take the Americas. Just as a for instance and as many veils as "victors" want to place on their deeds and as many flowers they wish to have to disguise the dreadful stench of their actions, that all falls away in the end and the truth emerges. History is in that sense written by time and knowing more than anything else.

       Chinese have destroyed their histories on several occasions(the ones people knew about anyway...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently there is a strong push to add the biblical history to school books in some places. And/or showing creationism next to evolution, and the big bang, as equally valid theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in an obvious age of disinformation, to the point I wonder how often this kind of disinformation is subjected on people? The public learns too much and becomes harder to control, so the strategic reason is obvious.
      </p>

       tl;dr   I wonder what our history would look like without all the "edits" later cultures added.

       Christianity is a perfect example of "history written by the victors." It's notable that the New Testament, covering a historical period replete with writers, historians, and commentators, so distorts and inverts ACTUAL history for its own theological/ religious intentions.

       What was ACTUALLY happening in first century Palestine was a revolutionary, anti-Roman, hyper-Messianic form of Judaism that was causing headache after headache for the Romans and their puppet Kings in the area, the Herodians.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what happens? They're annihilated, these "zealots" all massacred, crucified by the thousands by barbaric Roman governors, and their leaders are hunted down, their families hunted down, and executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISN"T IT QUITE STRANGE, that during all these revolutionary uprisings throughout Palestine, and the Jewish Messianic leaders all hunted down, along with their families, you have Paul, and his Greek/Roman consorts, writing letter after letter throughout the Mediterranean, to people OUTSIDE OF PALESTINE, who wouldn't know any better about Jewish Messianism, and they could freely distort, twist, write their own version of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it was all over, the enemies of Rome are dead. You're only left with this peaceful, PRO-ROMAN, spiritualized version of "messianism", which became Christianity, instead of the HYPER ANTI-ROMAN, earthly Messianism the Jews were fighting for in the first century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really activates the almonds, doesn't it? The Vatican has records dating back from before "The Church" was solidified. It knows the true history, and they do not want it out there. Because if it was ou there for everyone to see, it would be clear as day that "Christianity" as we know it, is a fucking lie told by a single dude, Paul the Roman, on behalf of the Romans.

       Unfortunately, most of what Jesus is said to have said has the flavor of retrospective additions, rather than accurate sayings. What is more likely is that the Pauline "spiritualized Jesus Christ" where "Faith" rather than Righteous works are emphasized was thought up by Paul, and then put into the mouth of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual historical Jesus, if one investigates the situation of first century Palestine, and Jesus' family, which the New Testament very artistically glosses over and writes out of the narrative, what is more likely is that the historical Jesus, whoever he was, was a militant, uncompromising, unyielding Jewish Zealot that had mass support, as his family members had immediately following when Jesus is said to have been killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really creates a conundrum. Because Jesus really does have beautiful, amazing ideas, and sometimes even Paul does in his letters - but then you realize that that was all part of the trick... they created this Superhuman, Perfect Redeemer Figure that spreads nothing but love and forgiveness and meek and mildness...
      </p>
      <p>
       All to calm down a hyperviolent, hyperrevolutionary Jewish population that was not about to submit to Roman rule. It's very, VERY telling that in Paul's letters, he's very anxious to tell his readers that you should pay your taxes to the Romans, because if they are in charge it's because God wants them to be in charge, and the Gospel writers even have Jesus echo this exact sentiment, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's," the implication being, you should be okay with Roman rule, just be a good person. The Jews at the time, if the Jesus WE KNOW actually said this, would have stoned him on the spot and thrown him out of the city for being so clearly a Roman agent. [And wouldn't you look at that, Paul even admits he was beaten and attacked by mobs for this exact reason, being lenient about Jewish laws and trying to tell everyone that circumcision isn't that big a deal]

       What you said seems to resonate with the writing of Ralph Ellis and others who decribe the cover-up and cover-up of a cover-up, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://edfu-books.uk/">
        Ralph Ellis
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why are so many of the famous biblical characters missing from the historical record? Thirty years ago, the intrepid and dogged researcher Ralph Ellis decided to find out.  Does this biblical lacuna mean that both the Old and New Testaments are fictional, as many people have claimed? Or are we simply looking in the wrong locations or perhaps even the wrong eras?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
       <strong>
        the historical Jesus-character was a king, just as the gospels claim, a valiant king with a large treasury and lofty ambitions to take over the Roman Empire.
       </strong>
       Which is why Jesus (Izas) was jailed alongside revolutionaries who had committed murder in the revolution. (Mk 15:7)
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps readers can now see why the gospels were written in the manner they were. Rome did not appreciate revolts in its eastern realms, and sought to quell all thoughts of further unrest.  So the martial monarch called King Jesus (Izas) of Edessa became known to the wider world as a pauper prince of peace, who happily paid his Roman taxes and turned the other cheek. The industrious Roman propaganda machine that Josephus Flavius had created, had worked like a charm. "
      </p>

        here
       </a>
       , emphasis mine.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In particular,
        <em>
         those who put together and edited the Gospels
        </em>
        may have wanted to remove Jesus from the political setting in which he, according to this hypothesis, was active: the beginning uprising of ”robbers”, of Zealot rebels, often with a messianic leader at the helm. It was
        <em>
         a violent uprising
        </em>
        targeted primarily against the Romans, but also against the established Jewish leadership, the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whatever its roots,
        <em>
         by the time Christianity spread around the Mediterranean, it was a religion that advocated non-violence,
        </em>
        a view that permeated its approach to the demands and decisions of human existence. Likely, this attitude to life was present also during the formative years. But perhaps the persistent strain put upon the masses living under on - again - off - again foreign occupation in Judea and Galilee, and
        <em>
         the recurring disappointments when periods of hope invariably ended in despair, ultimately led to violent rebellion.
        </em>
        As Josephus laments, “God ... brought the Romans upon us, and threw a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us, our wives, and children, slavery, as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities”. ( A.J. 20.166)
       </p>
       <p>
        The scattered sprinkling of references to ”robbers” and uprisings still found in the Gospels could perhaps be
        <em>
         the remnants of a story that could not be told, at least not overtly.
        </em>

       Herod was dead for 100 years before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in AD70- there are very detailed records on both the roman and Jewish side of the event
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul showed up nearly 200 years AFTER if you follow Josephus the best roman history of the period
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty long con by the romans
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely Paul was just any other messianic cult, it just took hold in room so we remember it unlike all the ones that did not.

       This is a great and actually fairly well known example.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i wonder about the unknown examples. The lost histories and libraries of europe, and what was not chared from the Irish sanctuaries where we get 90% of what was left of Rome's intellectual might, after the dark ages.

      <p>
       Then as I mentioned before there's China...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Russia, which I know little to nothing about, other than when the Royalty was overthrown, I imagine many old documents and literature got "misplaced"
      </p>
      <p>
       I also imagine what South America had available, is likely very similar to what we find in Egypt. It's just harder to find in a jungle vs a desert.

       Having talked to Germans this is absolutely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the impression I got. I kind of thought the Germans were the stark opposite of the Japanese in this respect.

       Loads of atrocities were committed by the Allies for sure, especially in the pacific. But let's not even pretend for a second that it's comparable to the cold, methodical and mechanical assassination of millions of
       <em>
        human beings
       </em>
       carried out by the Axis as if they were no more than cattle. World War 2 was as close as our species is going to get to a fight between good and evil, which is to say ambiguously good against actual, genocidal Evil with a capital E.

       Or it could be the wealthy backed both sides of the war then when the history was written made sure to exclude themselves from any involvement.

       You always hear about war with the big bad team vs the good guys but unless you dive deep you don't see which families, corporations and large interest supported which side. You never see the reports on who benefitted the most financially and geopolitically.

       Everyone thinks they're doing the right thing. Ideologues get swept up in that and tend to be the most likely to cause the biggest changes and becoming leaders ultimately defining the good and bad of an era. Hitler and Stalin both saw themselves as saints who had to work in the real world, but the nazi who executes the degenerate and the communist who starves the Ukrainian knows that that is not reality, and is kept there by forces that would kill him for doing otherwise, justified by the same detached leadership.

       The Soviets won World War 2 but we know that they raped and pillaged their way across East Germany. In fact, we know this partially because we cross reference German propaganda pieces referencing rapes, with official reports from both governments, and with personal writings from the victims and attackers both.

       Look at the "causes of the civil war" debate, the daughters of the confederacy basically rewrote history to insist the war was based on states rights and not slavery. That lie still persists today.

       You do know that abolitionists were essentially made up of social reformers, not economic libertarians, that most northerners were NOT abolitionists, that 5 northern states held slaves during the civil war, that ALL northern states as well as the District of Columbia enforced the fugitive slave act DURING the Civil War, and that the Emancipation Proclamation wasn't even issued until halfway through the war, right?

       You do realize that the SC declaration of secession, the Cornerstone speech, multiple state constitutions in the confederacy, the Confederate constitution, and multiple other documents specifically state that slavery was the cause of secession or specifically enshrine slavery above states rights?

       Most southerners didn't own slaves, but the elites did and they were very explicit in why they were seceding.

       I'm not sure what you mean by "enshrine slavery above states rights," but it seems like a subjective emotional judgment on the importance of the institution of slavery. The right to hold slaves was one of the motivating factors in the secession movement, but it certainly was not the only one, and the cure for the ills of slavery was certainly not best fulfilled by a war in which up to 800,000 Americans, Northerners, Southerners, blacks, and whites, soldiers and civilians alike came to unceremonious premature ends. The war happened because Lincoln wanted economic control over the South. The issue of slavery was at the time a secondary or tertiary issue, and served as nothing but a post-war justification for the atrocities sanctioned by the tyrant Lincoln against his own people in the Southern states like burning down entire cities, looting homes, raping women and killing Innocents. And I'm not talking about "plantation owning elites" here, I'm taking about the 97% of white Southerners with no sin to their name other than being born in the "wrong" state.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, tell yourself it was all worth it despite every other nation on Earth completing the same virtuous objective of ending slavery without shedding a single drop of blood. As long as it helps you sleep.

       You're saying "Lincoln primarily fought to keep the country unified, abolishing slavery wasn't the main point of the war," in a very strange, angry way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point about avoiding bloodshed makes no sense considering the fact that the Confederacy formed an army, then fired the first shots of the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The north fought to stop the south from seceding, the south seceded primarily because they opposed the abolishment of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was worth it to keep the country together, and it was worth it to end slavery even one day sooner if it did.

       You're right. Lincoln fought to keep the country unified under the economic oppression of the northern states and against the will of the Southern people. In other words, not in order to free the slaves, although admittedly that was an outcome of the war among other outcomes.

       Lincoln sent warships to Fort Sumter and goaded the South into firing against them. The South formed an army for the same reason any country would. To protect their citizens and their interests. I've no idea how anyone would consider that objective malign.

      <p>
       Well, again, you're taking the one wedge issue and trying to insist the war was justified by it. It wasn't about slavery, it was about dollars and cents. Slavery was part of the economy, and thus part of the dialogue. The North fought for economic hegemony over the South, and later made slavery a grounds for conquest to prevent the British from aiding the South during the war.

       So you're pretty happy with the state of the country right now? And you're saying 800,000 lives was worth black slaves working for one extra day?

       The cost in lives would only increase over time. If the war had waited until the early 1900s then millions could have died in trenches like in WW1. 800k would seem like a bargain then.

       Also...they're literally cheering for the extremely centralized federal government for which Lincoln laid the foundation...and which is why we have hundreds of military bases in dozens of countries, and wars that kill untold numbers of brown people. But they voted Democrat so that means they're geniuses and paragons of moral virtue...even though democrats support said murder of brown people.

       Lincoln notified the South that they would be resupplying the fort.  He sent armed vessels because Buchannon had previously sent an unarmed vessel which was fired upon.  On recieving Lincoln's notification the Southern general commanding the siege was given orders to take the fort before the resupply arrived.  Southern forces fired upon the fort at 4:30 am on April 12th.  The resupply ships wouldn't arrive until later that evening

       No. Slavery was becoming economically unviable, the trend was toward its end, as it has ended in literally every other nation on the planet, peacefully, without mass bloodshed.

       Your viewpoint of the world is sickening, small, and incorrect. You really need to explore more than just one person's recount of history and maybe one day you'll be able to discuss it.

       You probably think you're really intimidating. Keep it up if that's what motivates you. But know this. I'm not the only member of the straight, white, Christian majority in America that couldn't give two fucks about your virtue signaling bullshit. That's right. Call me a racist. Call me a religious bigot. Call me a homophobe. I'll wear the hatred and vitriol of you and all your cohorts as a badge of honor and it won't put a dent in the principles I stand for, the values I advocate, the way of life that I'll defend to the death. If the last American election did not alert you to the fact that there are more of me than there are of you, I won't be able to open your eyes now. But look forward to living a life of obscurity, becoming a whiny, petulant ember in an ashtray of political correctness that Americans wish they could grind under heel into the concrete like a smoldering cigarette butt. The days of cowering in the face of empty rhetoric and faceless accusation are over. And you are on the losing end. You ARE the losing end.

       Instead of attempting to prove your point you decided to go on a overdrawn rant about how you are defending your rights, and etc, and etc. Right now your comment is meme-tastic to the point where it can even become a copypasta. The whole point of any constructive discussion is to focus on the argument the other person is making, instead of becoming pissed off by an off-handed comment they make (such as 'Why do you guys hate the color brown so much'). Come on, you're better than this.

       Read the south Caroline declaration of secession. They explicitly state that they are upset about the abolitionists and the lack of enforcement of slave laws, so they're seceding.

       Yes, there was no impending abolition of slavery, and in fact Congress passed in 1861 a constitutional amendment that would have forbidden the federal government from interfering with slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you read the whole thing? South Carolina said
       <em>
        they never would have joined the union in the first place
       </em>
       without the constitutional guarantee that slaves would be returned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slavery is abhorrent. However, the states were supposed to be sovereign. That slavery influenced their decision to secede is irrelevant to the question of whether or not the states had the right to govern themselves as they liked.

       The first section of the document simply lays out the history and establishes that states have the right to secede if the compact is broken or the government becomes unjust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the document goes into how the compact is being broken:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the present case, that fact is established with certainty. We assert that fourteen of the States have deliberately refused, for years past, to fulfill their constitutional obligations, and we refer to their own Statutes for the proof.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: "No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."
       </p>
       <p>
        This stipulation was so material to the compact, that without it that compact would not have been made. The greater number of the contracting parties held slaves, and they had previously evinced their estimate of the value of such a stipulation by making it a condition in the Ordinance for the government of the territory ceded by Virginia, which now composes the States north of the Ohio River.
       </p>
       <p>
        The same article of the Constitution stipulates also for rendition by the several States of fugitives from justice from the other States.
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The document spells it out as clearly as can be: South Carolina believes the compact has been broken and secession is justified because the non-slaveholding states are not upholding the laws with regards to slavery, specifically calling out aspects of the Fugitive Slave Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is what caused the Civil War. The south clearly seceded because they felt slavery was under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're welcome to argue that the Civil War was wrong, but that's a separate issue.

       South Carolina stated that it had the right to secede if the compact was broken, and that the compact was broken because the rest of the country was failing to honor laws on slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       It always comes back to slavery. You are making a tangential point about whether SC had a right to secede, which is covered extensively in the first half of the Declaration of Secession, and their own document ties the right to secede to slavery.

       I don't know why this is so hard for you. Just because their decision was influenced by slavery issues does not mean that they had no right to secede. It does not mean that the northern states had the right to intervene militarily to keep them in the union. And it certainly doesn't mean that the North entered the war to stop slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Abraham Lincoln endorse a proposed constitutional amendment that would prevent the federal government from interfering with slavery if the war was entirely about ending slavery?!

       And I just showed how the south cared about sovereignty only with regards to slavery. Furthermore, the Confederate constitution explicitly forbade any states from abolishing slavery, which again points to slavery as more fundamental than states'sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have not in fact provided any primary source documentation that points out any issue other than slavery. The Cornerstone Speech, the SC declaration of secession, and the Confederate constitution all place slavery above states rights or sovereignty or any other issue.

       The sovereignty was only important with regards to slavery, which I very clearly pointed out. Your response fails to address anything I actually said.

       Youre phrasing the question improperly, your lack of knowledge in this area is obviously a little lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know no states owned slaves prior to 1800? It was outlawed after the revolution, for monetary purposes initially, all slaves came from English backed ships and traders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was GA and SC that were the first to basically say "Nah, under states rights we can have slaves" and Congress responded "Well... We technically cant stop you from doing that but we can certainly hurt your bottom line by levying high taxes, penalties and fees for doing so"
      </p>
      <p>
       This was followed by the first attempt to end slavery, the Act of 1807. Part of the bill
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "not be lawful to import or bring into the United States or the territories thereof from any foreign kingdom, place, or country, any negro, mulatto, or person of colour, with intent to hold, sell, or dispose of such [person] ... as a slave, to be held to service or labour."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The big catch was what about slaves that were brought here illegally and found in states where slavery was legal? Well they couldnt be set free and no one wanted to foot the bill to send them back to Africa so they were kept as slaves even if they were brought here illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were constant amendments to this law over the next few decades but the straw that broke the camels back was when America started expanding west. The southern states were like "Cool we can setup shop here and start bringing our slaves westward!" the US gov was basically like "No you cant..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well southerners wanted to capitalize on the bounty of the west in the only way they knew how, with slave labor.

       While abolitionists were gaining power, especially at the state and local level, many northern politicians still wanted to preserve the union at all cost. They knew that slavery was the fundamental issue that led to secession, so they hoped to bring the country back together by more forcefully protecting slavery in the southern states.

       This did not work, the slave states seceded anyways, and the Civil War ensued.

       A state in the confederacy was forbidden from abolishing slavery. Clearly, it was more important to ensure that slavery was never abolished than it was to allow states the right to determine for themselves whether to allow slavery.

      <p>
       You seem to be arguing that abolitionists should not have fought to end slavery, or that the north should have let America split. Those are separate issues from the causes of secession.

       I don't believe you are being as clear as you think you are. This doesn't have to be a disagreement because I wasn't trying to take sides either because I do not know enough about the subject. But I can recognize the flaw in the rebuttal. What do you think about it?

       That's why they pursued control of nearly wealth less nations and persecuted those of counter ideals with inprisonment. All about sensible seeking of resources. Its not like it was illegal to be a communist simply on ideological grounds at any time.

       Saying it becomes redundant and makes a cop out of debating the history, because it can be said about any piece of history.   It's like refuting any argument ever with "Well we could be living a simulation and nothing we know is real."  Yes that's true, but pointless in any other discussion unless you can prove it.

       No they just didn't win. As in didn't complete their objectives. They however didn't lose anything but the resources they put into trying to accomplish these objectives. That's not really the same thing as actually losing a war. Nazi Germany actually lost WW2, don't see them writing many history books do you?

       I suspect the point is that just saying that the 'winners write the history books' doesn't actually do a proper job of describing historical circumstances.  In other words, even if the winners
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       write the history books, that doesn't mean that these books accurately portray history.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we rely on platitudes then we willingly allow ourselves to be swayed by dominant narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I'm having trouble understanding why this is in this sub. One would think a view of history that challenges the books and the winners is exactly the attitude that conspiracy folks would champion.

       Is that "meme" ever used as a way to say "the history is right"? I've only ever heard it used, and it used it myself, as a means of saying that history is biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       A relevant example: Robert E. Lee is only a traitor because the south lost. If history was written by the south, or the south has won, we'd have a different history of Lee in the books.

       Sure, I guess my point is that the 'winners write the books' thing is just an ineffective and pointless thing to say. r/history is big on well-researched and deeply sourced arguments. Most academic historians I know are also very much committed to confronting their biases as best as possible and weighing really diverse sources of information. I don't really think their aim is to silence opposition, but to maintain a certain standard regarding the level of discourse.

       I agree, it's pointless if that's the only thing you say. However, using it in a larger point is valuable. I think saying "remember, the winners usually write the history" in some larger comment is not a problem.

       Winners may not completely write history but the justification for their acts becomes the official narrative. There are exceptions throughout history to this "rule" but by and large winners do write history. Is this a conspiracy that bots in r/history don't allow this term?  NO!  It's perfectly logical. How would you have an intelligent discussion about history if someone threw that out there every time something was disagreed on?

       It's banned because it's a simplistic, ultimately idiotic cliche that is trotted out in history classrooms or subs at an alarming rate. It does not contain an argument or anything intelligent, and is typically used to "win" a debate. The problem here is that the saying ignores historical contex and the complexity of issues, two things which historians tend to care a great deal about. In general, while talking about history cliches and wide generalizations  should be avoided if at all possible.

       The Soviets won World War 2 but we know that they raped and pillaged their way across East Germany. In fact, we know this partially because we cross reference German propaganda pieces referencing rapes, with official reports from both governments, and with personal writings from the victims and attackers both.

       you can see it real life when watch Hollywood Movies bout ww2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviets did beat the germans and was going to overrun europe. That was only reason why SA did join the war - to save interests/territoy. Because USA did sell until than weapons to all sides and all sides made big debts. USA would have lost all this war profits when soviets did take europe.
      </p>

       But in Hollywood movies its always USA who saves the world and did beat the germans ...

       That's not really the full truth of the matter...I mean I 100% agree that most Hollywood movies over drew American heroism, but to say it was just the Soviets are the reasons the US came in is rediculous. Not to mention it wasn't the Soviets attacking the US that started the engagement. Hell there was more than enough pressure being put on from Germany that it's the only excuse even needed. (
       <em>
        See Mexico and sinking ship in the Atlantic
       </em>
       ), not to mention Japan and China, or hell even the war of idiology (
       <em>
        Democracy vs Fascism vs Communism
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       But also to be fair, the US was the tipping point in why the Allies were so successful. Without the help of the US we would live in a completely different world and probably not under a democratic regime.

       The soviets won WW2 but we know that they raped their way across East Germany because Historians have cross referenced journals from soldiers on both sides, victims of the soviets, propaganda reports given by the German government, and the official reports compiled by both governments.

       Not only do winners determine the "true" story of history, it's happening right now before our eyes concerning the Civil War.  It's not even shrouded in secrecy if you just pay attention a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Civil War is being completely and totally made out to be about nothing but slavery.  This is all a massive majority of people come out of our schools are taught to believe.  Nothing about states rights, at all, unless it's completely steeped in the discussion of slavery.

       It's not that I don't see how closely related the slavery debate and the states rights were AT THE TIME, but a discussion about one does not automatically need to include a discussion about the other in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul, for example, was very much in favor of states deciding far more for themselves than the federal government.  Nowhere, however, did his platform include putting anyone in chains.

       Of course.  I'm not arguing against that.  What I'm saying is that we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water.  There is a strong case that can be made in favor of states rights as opposed to federal power.  However, in 2017, that case does not need to involve, promote, or excuse any racist behavior or slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is that States Rights were part and parcel with slavery at the time, but what everyone misses beating the drums of anti-slavery is that, perhaps, they had a point about states rights, it was just marred in a horrible thing like slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, in terms of the Civil War, it's difficult to differentiate the two (which is why we're having this discussion), but in modern times I tend to think we should be mature enough to have a conversation about states vs federal level politics without drudging up accusations of wanting to bring slavery back.

       I understand it is a hot and triggers on a phrase. The OP says that they never see people using the phrase as a lazy argument, but as part of a well-thought-out one, making the bot useless to harmful. To you have personal experience with that sub that contradicts the OP?

       But most societies that lose a war or two do not get completely wiped off the face of the Earth.  And even then, it just takes one sympathetic writer, who may not even be part of either the winning or losing side.  Also, Americans wrote about Vietnam.

       It depends on when in history you are talking about. Pre-Gutenberg, supporting a scholar class was a luxury and a given society's hold on literacy was tenuous. Losers can't afford to support their scholars because of subjection. A few maybe, but when all books are copied by hand the winners can afford to massively outcompete, the loser's tomes aren't copied and get lost to the sands of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the modern era(especially the mass media era) the winner has the dominant culture and can repeats and spread its memes much more effectively. Human psychology has a wide open glaring vulnerability: we believe what is repeated to us enough times.

       Did the users implement it? Was there ever a call for it, or even a period of public comment beforehand? I very much doubt it. These things tend to come from on high, it's only after the fact the historical revisionists invent the narrative that the masses were clamouring for a solution.

       History isn't written by the victors. It's written by those who write, and who's books survived. There's a reason that all we have to go on for pre-roman Europe, most of Russia and the Eurasian steppe till ~1000 and nearly the  entire history of the people of the Americas is only able to be known through archeology and oral tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise there were many carvings and written records of ancient Babylon, Assyria and Persia, but a huge part of how they've been perceived historically has been colored through a lens informed from the Jewish Torah. The Israelites were absolutely roflstomped by all three of them, but because they kept a well organized written account and it was propagated widely through the Christian Bible, we've had their account 'write history' up until the 19th century when archeologists started to seriously investigate those areas.

       The angriest I've ever seen a person get in real life (or damn near close to it) was a history major being told that quote. Holy crap, he full on lost it. Historians really really hate being told that everything they've studied could be a lie. It would basically make their life's work meaningless.

       The Soviets won World War 2 but we know that they raped and pillaged their way across East Germany. In fact, we know this partially because we cross reference German propaganda pieces referencing rapes, with official reports from both governments, and with personal writings from the victims and attackers both.

       History is nothing more than a pack of lies we all agree on. Further the history books are mostly propaganda written by the victorious in war to make the defeated look like villains. War does not determine who is right, but who is left. If only victorious LIARS write history why bother reading their lies? To keep track of which victorious liars wrote the most recent version of lies? History stretching back thousands of years is more than lies piles on top of more lies. It is not logical to believe liars.

       If history is written by the winners then the question has to be why the losers can't write it. I mean, there are historians in Germany, Japan, and every other nation that the US has fought. Did Vietnam write the history on the Vietnam war?

       There are two sides to every story. I believe the term '..written by victors' makes it easy to disregard the other viewpoint just because they are 'losers'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, even if they are the minority, and dismissing somebody's experiences or feeling because they are 'losers' is dangerously closed minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to be skeptical of both sides, as they will both be inherently biased.

       Imperial France: The Revolutionaries are controlled by the illuminati and all of their enablers had already been occupying the French Government before the revolution. In other words, people in the royal government simply are not what they say they are and are basically co-opted by the barvarian illuminati.  At the end even the king isn't what he says he is.

       Yes but most history books are sourced from material that can only be gathered from a successful civilization that was able to protect their knowledge. Those that are burned to the ground are an archaeological footnote.

       Maybe it's not so much that the victors write history, but that the losers don't have a chance to make a mark on it when they are wiped from it.

       Also...they're literally cheering for the extremely centralized federal government for which Lincoln laid the foundation...and which is why we have hundreds of military bases in dozens of countries, and wars that kill untold numbers of brown people. But they voted Democrat so that means they're geniuses and paragons of moral virtue...even though democrats support said murder of brown people.

       You're looking at this via Western/USA centric glasses based on what you learned in YOUR textbooks or what you think Asia is doing. Do you know anything about Asian politics? This isn't accurate at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan has been in hot water several times as recent as 2014/2015 for portraying events nicer than they actually were in their textbooks. It wasn't until international outcry they are slowly trying to fix it since early 2000s and the issue persists today because Japan changes things extremely slow. They depicted the events of their "wins" in Asia (especially in Korea) by downplaying how bad it was or outright omitted things. Sure, a Western textbook will point out every wrong thing Japan did during a time period of war, but their own books don't reflect that. I'm sure there's other Asian countries that have done this. I know South Korea has controversies about their books as well, though, I'll admit I don't study SK politics much.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of Asia hides and misconstrues recent political or war related events in their books because each country disagrees and recounts them differently. That's why something as "stupid" as a few sea rocks can ruin relations between countries. See
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/09/07/160745930/little-islands-are-big-trouble-in-the-south-china-sea">
        here
       </a>
       . Even both Koreas refuse to call the Sea of Japan by that name. It's a big deal there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan outright denied the "
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women#History_of_the_issue">
        comfort women rapes
       </a>
       " issue TWICE in the past decade despite admitting to the atrocity in the 90's. It wasn't until 2015 Japan finally did something about it via money, but money isn't what Korean women want - they want
       <strong>
        fixed textbooks
       </strong>
       and an apology. Something they still do not have as of TODAY. SK and Japan hold a lot of hate to one another and you won't see all those issues in your American textbooks. Most mentions of their conflict stops at the end of WW2 despite it existing today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan is very much 'written by the winners' in which, and as you may or may not know, Japan "won" often for a long time in Asia. Sorry your limited worldview prevents you from seeing this. Your version of Asian history was written by Westerners. Pick up two text books from different Asian countries involved in a conflict with one another. The events are not depicted the same. Look at recent past 100 year history to see biased narratives being taught.

       It's not that I don't see how closely related the slavery debate and the states rights were AT THE TIME, but a discussion about one does not automatically need to include a discussion about the other in 2017.

       Ron Paul, for example, was very much in favor of states deciding far more for themselves than the federal government.  Nowhere, however, did his platform include putting anyone in chains.

       That's not really the full truth of the matter...I mean I 100% agree that most Hollywood movies over drew American heroism, but to say it was just the Soviets are the reasons the US came in is rediculous. Not to mention it wasn't the Soviets attacking the US that started the engagement. Hell there was more than enough pressure being put on from Germany that it's the only excuse even needed. (
       <em>
        See Mexico and sinking ship in the Atlantic
       </em>
       ), not to mention Japan and China, or hell even the war of idiology (
       <em>
        Democracy vs Fascism vs Communism
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       But also to be fair, the US was the tipping point in why the Allies were so successful. Without the help of the US we would live in a completely different world and probably not under a democratic regime.

       You were wrong, clearly. Is it really that hard for you to admit that with some small amount of grace? It would reflect upon you so much better than your childish attack, and be better for everyone else.

       Hollywood isn't writing history you turd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who actually bothered to do even basic reading into how the history field works, would know that history is actually "written" by the people who do extensive research on every piece of information available and use it to form a complete picture of what we know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The soviets won WW2 but we know that they raped their way across East Germany because Historians have cross referenced journals from soldiers on both sides, victims of the soviets, propaganda reports given by the German government, and the official reports compiled by both governments.

       Everyone thinks they're doing the right thing. Ideologues get swept up in that and tend to be the most likely to cause the biggest changes and becoming leaders ultimately defining the good and bad of an era. Hitler and Stalin both saw themselves as saints who had to work in the real world, but the nazi who executes the degenerate and the communist who starves the Ukrainian knows that that is not reality, and is kept there by forces that would kill him for doing otherwise, justified by the same detached leadership.

       Unfortunately, most of what Jesus is said to have said has the flavor of retrospective additions, rather than accurate sayings. What is more likely is that the Pauline "spiritualized Jesus Christ" where "Faith" rather than Righteous works are emphasized was thought up by Paul, and then put into the mouth of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual historical Jesus, if one investigates the situation of first century Palestine, and Jesus' family, which the New Testament very artistically glosses over and writes out of the narrative, what is more likely is that the historical Jesus, whoever he was, was a militant, uncompromising, unyielding Jewish Zealot that had mass support, as his family members had immediately following when Jesus is said to have been killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really creates a conundrum. Because Jesus really does have beautiful, amazing ideas, and sometimes even Paul does in his letters - but then you realize that that was all part of the trick... they created this Superhuman, Perfect Redeemer Figure that spreads nothing but love and forgiveness and meek and mildness...
      </p>
      <p>
       All to calm down a hyperviolent, hyperrevolutionary Jewish population that was not about to submit to Roman rule. It's very, VERY telling that in Paul's letters, he's very anxious to tell his readers that you should pay your taxes to the Romans, because if they are in charge it's because God wants them to be in charge, and the Gospel writers even have Jesus echo this exact sentiment, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's," the implication being, you should be okay with Roman rule, just be a good person. The Jews at the time, if the Jesus WE KNOW actually said this, would have stoned him on the spot and thrown him out of the city for being so clearly a Roman agent. [And wouldn't you look at that, Paul even admits he was beaten and attacked by mobs for this exact reason, being lenient about Jewish laws and trying to tell everyone that circumcision isn't that big a deal]

       You could go further and suggest that the two bombs on Japan were to stop Russia from beating Japan and getting mad skrilla. Russia joined the fight against Japan and three weeks later the U.S. used the nukes.
