        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Particle accelerators are nuclear weapons increasing gravity or magnetic pressure in the atmosphere. This is similar to the concept of taking a positively charged magnet and a negatively charged magnet and then binding them together in place to create a condensed force in the middle while using nuclear power to fuel the magnetic charges. They are using the particle accelerators to increase gravitational pressure in the lower atmosphere. The word gravity derives from the Latin word &quot;gravis&quot; which means weight or heavy. An increase in gravity speeds up the rate of time and the ware on matter. Gravity also has effects on time known as gravitational time dilation. The more you ware on something the faster it will break down. Matter is subject to decay and therefore is subject to time. Through HAARP they can ionize parts of the atmosphere and move around the magnetism released from the particle accelerators through what is called the vector or magnetic moment and target specific locations or regions used for oppressing individuals and society. </p>

<p>Pressure doesn&#39;t affect time dilation. You can easily test this by getting two waterproof watches. Set them to identical times, then throw one watch at the bottom of a pool. Come back in some time and they will be the exact same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to test whether magnetic fields affect time dilation, that is easily tested as well. Take two watches set at the same time. Place one at an empty space on your lawn, take another and place it by electricity lines such as your fuse box or cars engine. Then take the reading at some later moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately what my point is that gravity is a form of pressure and increase in pressure wares more on something. The perception of time may be slowed under an increase in pressure but actual time is a constant however the decay is increased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about biology then, not physics. Gravity in physics is very interesting once you really get into it. You&#39;ve got the Higgs Field which gives mass to force carriers such as the weak force, breaking electroweak symetry. Meanwhile while other particles get some mass from the Higgs Field too, much of it comes from Gluon Yukawa interaction between Quarks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same forces you described are also described in physics. Electromagnetic forces that bind electrons to protons, the Strong Nucleonic force which binds Netrons and Protons. The weak force which performs quark flavor hanging, and gravity a long range force.</p>

<p>The reason I specify terminology as a problem is because they have a lot in common, as you are implying by condensing them all to magnetic forces. For instance, the electromagnetic and weak forces at higher energies are identical(All 4 force carrying particles act like photons).This is called Electroweak theory. Under a certain temperature, 3 force carrying particles interact with the Higgs mechanism and acquire mass. We call this the weak force, and the main difference is the mass makes them more potent but much shorter lives(They lifespan is less then a protons width). Under even hotter temperatures, the electroweak force becomes identical to the strong force. At extremely almost plank temperatures gravity is predicted to be identical to the strong and weak forces. </p>

<p>It seems to me you are describing these same forces just putting magnetic in front of them. Only time dosen&#39;t combine with the others, frankly it&#39;s mostly used as a fourt dimension sometimes for math purposes. It really isn&#39;t the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is more like a pressure. Magnetic pressure is gravity. I will say it again that the word Gravis means weight or heavy. Gravity is magnetic pressure or weight inside the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. The magnetic field around the Earth is generated by the mass and density of the Earth. That magnetic field is then ionized. This is the pressure inside the atmosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the whole point of &quot;alternative physics&quot; is, that it &quot;does not agree with accepted physics&quot;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time is measured in distance as it is defined and for a reason. A clock that is slowed under gravity would have to be corrected and then the time it was off would have to be added on after that correction under normal gravity to equate for distance or time lost. This means it is moving forward. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The reason this matters is because gravity and its increase in pressure causes an increase in decay. Time is measured in distance. For matter that distance is its mean life time and the rate of decay determines its mean life time.</p>
