<p>WTC 7 Study and Bobby McIlvaine Act to Propel Next Phase of AE911Truth Activism</p>

<p>Dr. Hulsey Presents from Fairbanks, Alaska, on Sept. 6th
Bob McIlvaine, Peter Ketcham, Richard Gage Speak in DC Sept. 11th
The fall of 2017 is set to become a “before-and-after” moment in the ongoing efforts of AE911Truth to educate the world and bring about a new World Trade Center investigation.</p>

<p>That’s because, over the course of the next two months, Dr. Leroy Hulsey will be releasing the findings of his two-year computer modeling study on the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7. At the same time, we will use his report as a vehicle both to intensify our pressure on Congress to open a new investigation and to finally hold NIST accountable for its fraudulent account of the WTC destruction.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the Plan:</p>

<p>On September 6, 2017, at 8:00 PM Eastern, Dr. Hulsey will present from the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Schaibel Auditorium on the findings and conclusions detailed in his team’s September 2017 Progress Report, which will be issued the same day. The presentation will be livestreamed so that viewers across the country and around the world can watch.</p>

<p>Though originally scheduled for release in August, a draft report of the study is now on course to be issued in mid-October. A six-week public comment period will follow the release of the draft report, allowing for input from the public and the engineering community. The final report, which will incorporate constructive comments and will be vetted by peer reviewers, will then be published in early 2018.</p>

<p>Following on the heels of Dr. Hulsey’s presentation, Bob McIlvaine, Peter Ketcham, and Richard Gage will unveil the “Bobby McIlvaine World Trade Center Investigation Act” at 1:00 PM Eastern on September 11, 2017, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. (This press conference will not be livestreamed, but a number of journalists will be there to record the event.) Later that day and over the next two days, we will hand-deliver the Bobby McIlvaine package to all 535 members of Congress.</p>

<p>The Bobby McIlvaine Act, named after Bob McIlvaine’s son, who was tragically killed on 9/11 while entering the North Tower, would empanel a select committee in either chamber of Congress to reinvestigate the WTC destruction. Our goal over the next year — and beyond, if necessary — will be to find one or more members of Congress to introduce the bill. To be successful in this effort, we will need your help, so stay tuned for info on congressional outreach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it is already basically is a fact that 9/11 was an inside job, why should people care now? Those who believe it is a crazy conspiracy will be told these researchers are crazy, maybe even working for the Kremlin. </p>

<p>But it certainly is still a small step forward for the 9/11 Truth movement. </p>

<p>They originally stated they would release all their models and data sets so why are they only talking about a report?  Reports don&#39;t typically come with models and data sets.</p>
