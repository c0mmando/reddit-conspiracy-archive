        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It’s said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyEE6Vgx5XE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=18m21s">here</a> that the Rothschild family was apparently given a type of “managerial” position over humanity from as far back as the days of Amen-Ra.  This has given them an untold amount of Earthly power and wealth over the entirety of the human species.  This separated them from all other &quot;non-Rothschilds&quot; (seems to give a whole new perspective on why non-Rothschilds are called &quot;the goyim&quot;, the &quot;unwashed masses&quot;, and so many other unsavory epithets throughout history, no?).</p>

<p>If the human population on this planet become aware of the truth of ET existence on and around this cosmos, galaxy, solar system, and on the Earth itself, then it would be no time before technologies would also be disclosed and discovered that would allow the humans here to A) be more powerful, B) not have to rely on the fiat currency paradigm of slavery that has almost everyone on this planet shackled, and B) the people would eventually venture outside of the planet and into the solar system and galaxy around us.</p>

<p>Once that happens, then the grip of power the Rothschild family has had over the whole population would dissipate entirely.</p>

<p>And they don’t want to let go of that power…so the last thing they want everybody here to find out about is that we are part of a massive, limitless, cosmic, interstellar family; a universe (indeed a galaxy and solar system) absolutely teeming with all kinds of other intelligent beings.</p>

<p>There are MANY of us out there - and by “us” I mean intelligent beings of <em>all</em> kinds and species <em>all</em> over space.</p>

<p>Shit is real, people.  We are not alone in the universe - not by a long shot.  We&#39;re not even alone in this solar system.</p>

<p>We’re just sequestered and imprisoned here - quarantined if you will.</p>

<p>This is prison planet for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is hard to argue against other life existing (just imagine the sheer size of the universe), it is hinted that disclosure (false or real) will be used as a trump card of when the elites want to unify all nations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be sure, unity is a <em>good</em> thing.  The unifying of all nations and peoples as one would be a very good thing indeed.  Why?  Because we <em>are</em> one.  We are definitely one human people.  Additionally, there is strength in unity, and weakness in stratification and division.  Currently, we are <em>very</em> stratified and consequently weak as a people.  This is no accident, as TPTB find it easier to control us when we’re split into a bunch of different warring, antagonistic little cliques.  We don&#39;t see who&#39;s <em>really</em> pulling the strings because we&#39;re too busy fighting amongst ourselves (in battles and wars the secretive elite covertly created and manipulated).</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6v4q1x/antifas_website_tells_its_supporters_2_stab_trump/dlxn51e/">the bold portion of this comment</a> states, however, don’t misinterpret what I just said here and think I’m advocating any sort of “mandatory race mixing!” or anything like that.  Here.  Read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6v4q1x/antifas_website_tells_its_supporters_2_stab_trump/dly1vvh/?context=3">this comment right here</a> to get a better idea about what I mean when I advocate for global unity.</p>

<p>Now, the type of global unity TPTB are likely pushing for - i.e. keeping themselves uber wealthy and keeping the rest of humanity generally poor and enslaved - I, of course, do <em>not</em> advocate.</p>

<p>Just because I don’t advocate the type of “unifying of all nations” that they will likely push for, however, doesn’t mean that I don’t think it’s a good idea for all of humanity to come together as the one people we indeed all are.</p>

<p>All this said, disclosure doesn’t in any way have to necessarily mean falling for some “alien false flag attack”.  Fuck that.  We can be a lot smarter than that as a people.  Yeah.  I know.  A lot of people <em>will</em> fall for the “alien attack!” bullshit - but, again, it doesn’t have to be a foregone conclusion that humanity can’t handle the truth of ET existence on and around this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Logically, a planetary society will have to unify before it is mature enough to take its seat within the galactic confederation. That is because seats are available to planets who have shown enough maturity that they will not war with themselves nor with other societies in the galaxy. Additionally, they must not interfere with developing planets unless it is to offset the negative influence of a manipulative marauding race. In this way, our unification is a prerequisite to becoming an interstellar species. However, that does not mean we should unify around the current power structure. The current power structure has proven themselves to be self serving and destructive to all forms of life around them. If this is used as their trump card we will have to reject it. </p>

<p>IMO unifying the world under a common set of guidelines and shared goals in relation to other planets is a good thing; unifying under the current UN - style government could very easily turn into global enslavement. We should welcome the opportunity to unify with our fellow man but we should also be wary of entering into any binding agreements or contracts. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say the disconnect exist and occurs because of simple lack of proper research on your part - which is ultimately no big surprise, as many people are very not clued in to the influence of the Rothschild family.  They own the MSM, so they make sure they&#39;re not reported on too much if at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, man.  I&#39;ll let it go.  It&#39;s just sad that you think you&#39;re using logic, when it&#39;s pretty blatantly obvious to anyone who actually knows what&#39;s going on that you&#39;re just being hubristic.  Why the hell even do that, man?  Why try to pump yourself up and try to make yourself look &quot;good&quot; when what you&#39;re doing is undermining your own further growth and benefit by <em>thinking</em> you know what&#39;s going on when you really don&#39;t?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not cool (not cool for <em>you</em> - not so much not cool for me or anyone else).</p>

<p>And please don&#39;t come back with some sort of an attempt to &quot;be cool&quot; and say some sort of stupid &quot;Sorry bud. Logic.&quot; inanity, because that&#39;s simply not productive to your own help and higher learning.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Bottom line: we have no reason to conclude what you conclude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you see that’s the thing.  That actually <em>isn’t</em> the “bottom line”.  There’s quite a bit of solid data and not-easy-to-refute information (if you’re intelligent and intellectually honest) from many different sources strongly indicating that we have an absolutely <em>massive</em> reason to conclude what I’ve concluded.</p>

<p>And what exactly <em>have</em> I concluded?  Do you even know?  I bet you don’t.  Here though, I’ll go ahead and wrap it up for you:</p>

<p>There are extraterrestrials all around this cosmos, galaxy, solar system, and on this very planet.  Some of them wouldn’t mind humanity moving forward and evolving, and also wouldn’t mind helping them as much as possible.  Others very much <em>don’t</em> seem to want that one bit.  The latter seem to be the ones in control on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why should I provide evidence for saying that we shouldn&#39;t draw a conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t even understand this comment.  No one’s saying that a conclusion shouldn’t be drawn.  No one ever said that here.  Why would you even make such a statement?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prove yours is correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not about “proving” shit, man.  Grow up.</p>

<p>It’s about providing information; sharing data with others and hoping to help everyone by simply learning and teaching.</p>

<p>You’re way too stuck on this “I have to be right”/“Prove that you’re right and I’m not!” way of thinking.</p>

<p>That’s just…not good, man.  Not good.</p>

<p>You’re doing yourself a great disservice.</p>

Humans on planet Earth - although apparently very subjugated, enslaved, and genetically crippled/societally programmed/psychologically manipulated to an absolutely massive degree - apparently has a great deal of potential that if effectively tapped into can indeed transform the members into a powerful, space-faring species.</p>

<p>We just have to take advantage of this ability in ourselves - and many of us are not doing so...yet...</p>
