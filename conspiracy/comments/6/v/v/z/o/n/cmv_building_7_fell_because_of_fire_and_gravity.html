       There was no:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         evidence of primer cord, blasting caps, explosions, etc. on the site. There was
         <em>
          one
         </em>
         investigator who claims he found evidence of thermite, but this hasn't been independently verified by anyone. It also doesn't explain the
         <em>
          amount
         </em>
         of thermite that would've been necessary to take down a building. Lastly, thermite can be made of
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano-thermite">
          many different materials
         </a>
         that would've likely been in combination in an office building like that, which could be found after it collapsed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There was no evidence of clean sheering on the columns (signifying that they indeed fell due to fire/gravity)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As can be seen/heard in the above video, there were no loud explosions on Building 7 (or the other twin towers). That means that there was no demolition; the sounds were pops from compressed air, and they came
         <em>
          after
         </em>
         the floor above them was pancaking downwards during the collapse.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         companies involved with wiring an occupied building with explosives. It's a rare specialty and there's only a few companies in the entire would who are qualified. "Government insiders" planting explosives doesn't make any sense and there's no evidence to support that either.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that World Trade Center 7 was on fire for about 7 hours, so the "planned demolition" would have required it to be timed
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was on fire for several hours and after debris from the other towers fell on it without messing up any of the demolition wiring/explosives. If you're going to "demolition a building" anyways, why wait seven hours? Answer: because it
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       a controlled demolition. It fell because it was on fire so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to respond, please provide evidence/expertise. This has been pretty thoroughly debunked as far as I'm concerned, yet I still see posts on this sub about it.

       Thanks!

       Earlier today, someone posted a video of the controlled demolition of WTC7.  Now the shills have come out to try to make us disbelieve our own eyes.   I hope that clears things up.

       Its a lot like going to the zoo. I come here to marvel at all the strange things that some people believe, contrary to all of the evidence, such as this thread where people will ignore anything logical about WTC 7's collapse and bend over backwards to justify the conclusion they've already formed in their heads.

       False. NIST is very clear they did not find evidence because they did not look for evidence because they knew they would find none. That does not mean there was none.

       False. Jones found it. Harrit verified it.

      <p>
       False. If office fires can bring down a steel skyscraper at free fall rate, as you assert, miniscule amounts of thermite certainly can.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lastly, thermite can be made of many different materials that would've likely been in combination in an office building like that, which could be found after it collapsed.
       </p>

       False. You don't get a box of matches by throwing the ingredients together, lighting them aflame and throwing them out of the window.

      <p>
       False. Demolitions don't have to be accompanied by loud explosions; a very obvious non sequitur.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the sounds were pops from compressed air, and they came after the floor above them was pancaking downwards during the collapse.

       False. A building is not a bunch of plastic balloons.

       Other skyscrapers burned for longer and did not, or only partially and gradually, collapse.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        so the "planned demolition" would have required it to be timed after it was on fire for several hours and after debris from the other towers fell on it without messing up any of the demolition wiring/explosives.

      <p>
       So?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you're going to "demolition a building" anyways, why wait seven hours? Answer: because it wasn't a controlled demolition. It fell because it was on fire so long.

       Another obvious, far-fetched non sequitur.

       False. "Debunkings" consist of appeals to ignorance, personal incredulity, and the whole pandemonium of other logical fallacies, not on the scientific method, the key to which is

       WTC7 was the first to be "cleaned up", in a hurry. The evidence was shipped off to Asia at v[max]. If you care that much about evidence, the question a real skeptic should really ask is "why was it destroyed?"

        False. NIST is very clear they did not find evidence because they did not look for evidence because they knew they would find none. That does not mean there was none.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And no one else found any evidence? None of the rescue workers? None of the cleanup crew? No one?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. Jones found it. Harrit verified it.
       </p>

      <p>
       Who are you talking about here?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. If office fires can bring down a steel skyscraper at free fall rate, as you assert, miniscule amounts of thermite certainly can.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fires burning for 7 hours are different than thermite. And again, there hasn't been any evidence of thermite. Or even how it would be placed throughout the building to make it collapse the way it did.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. You don't get a box of matches by throwing the ingredients together, lighting them aflame and throwing them out of the window.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess I'd have to see what evidence he has and the pictures/videos of it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. There is clear evidence of eutectic melting and sulfurization, signifying that other factors than mere office fires were at play.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where? Also, this can absolutely happen from fires.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. Demolitions don't have to be accompanied by loud explosions; a very obvious non sequitur.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A quiet demolition? I've never seen one.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. A building is not a bunch of plastic balloons.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Addressed in the video. There's lot's of air in buildings and when it's being compressed, it has to go somewhere.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Other skyscrapers burned for longer and did not, or only partially and gradually, collapse.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Addressed in the video. Other buildings were not on fire for as long, and/or didn't have their sprinkler system stop working.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False. "Debunkings" consist of appeals to ignorance, personal incredulity, and the whole pandemonium of other logical fallacies, not on the scientific method, the key to which is experiment. No adequate model or experiment has been forwarded to support the official story.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nothing you've said follows the scientific method either. You didn't even address any of the evidence in the videos/links that I posted.
