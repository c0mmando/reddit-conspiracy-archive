       Another thread on here got me all misty eyed thinking about the people I love who have died from cancer. The ones close to me, we did every damn thing we could find and a few we felt so SO SURE they would work. The thing is, they have worked sometimes, but mostly, they don't. I've seen it work on breast tumors and skin cancer. I have never seen alternative treatment work on lung or liver cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone close to me is again dying from cancer and I'd love to know what have you seen that actually worked?

       My friend did something about 8 years ago that sounds a lot like this, but it was experimental and done by a doctor who had trained and practiced in the US but was Brazilian, I think. Can't recall his name at the moment but it started with an M. He said he was on the run after trying to reveal his studies showing the cancer cure. I know my friend did a lot of research on him and it all checked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       He ran a secret cancer clinic in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend had extremely aggressive skin cancer. Huge swellings and open wounds all over, and this actually worked for him and cured it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sending you all the healing vibes.

       That's actually exactly how it works. A causation starts out as a correlation 100% of the time. The only difference is more trials to further prove the connection. Anyone with a basic understanding of the scientific method should know this. I believe it's taught to freshman in the United States.

       I can tell you they didnt believe in it. A friend told them they had nothing to lose and it began working. So my 2 cents is it worked more than placebo but idk.

       There really are alot. I will say more people say weed helps with cancer side effects than cures it but there are still hundreds of people who say they are in remission. I bet that scares big pharma.

       I made a comment about alternative treatment recently and I'm sorry if you had read my comment and felt offended by it. I didn't mean to and had even said that in my comment. I know it's a touchy subject. 
however there are lots of documentaries out there you can look for. and podcasts and stuff like that about information about this topic. you guys did your best, you did everything you knew of and what you believed was best. someone else may choose to do something different based on their beliefs and knowledge and that's totally okay. everyone has a different way of doing something and sometimes both ways can have the same or different results. also, I do believe it is certain cancers alternative treatments that have been successful with and not all.

       My FIL takes care of an elderly lady that didn't want to fight the cancer because her husband had died the year before he diagnosis. FIL fed her copious amounts of garlic and broccoli (blended and mixed into everything) plus alkaline water. I guess it worked. That was 7 years ago and they had lunch just yesterday. Please for the love of God don't take this and pull a Steve Jobs.

       I think the key to beating it is changing your underlying habits - including your daily thoughts and actions. Cancer is often caused by anger and other emotional issues which create energetic blockages in the organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to regular exercise and healthy eating, one can try internal energetic practices to help clear the blockages.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLRScJ8ZaAo&amp;amp;t=683s">
        Here is an example
       </a>
       . I would recommend finding a local teacher of tai chi or chi-gong (chi-kung, qi-gong are alternate spellings) and attending weekly classes, practicing daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the cancer has progressed to the point where one doesn't have the energy to heal oneself perhaps some of the other remedies that people have mentioned would have to be relied on. It is difficult to change lifestyle habits, but knowing that one can die if they do not can be a huge catalyst for change. These changes should include a healthier diet, increase their daily activity, and utilize techniques such as qi-gong to increase their healing potential. I would imagine this in combination with alternative cancer remedies would be the most effective.

       Its a possible cause. Although it might be better described as a correlate, because the primary cause is the energetic blockage. Its just that these blockages are often accompanied by anger or other strong emotions.

        The effect on calcium influx into the mitochondria may be extremely important for cancer treatment given that an energetic imbalance between excessive cytosolic aerobic glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (the Warburg effect)  was recently suggested as the seventh hallmark of cancer.

       Close family member of mine diagnosed with mid-stage prostate cancer.  Passed up traditional treatment (chemo, radiation, surgery) in favor of zero-sugar diet (essentially nothing but juiced vegetables and fish with salad once per day) and some weird supplements drugs from Europe (sorry I don't know which).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuck to this regimen religously for about two years.  Lost a ton of weight (wasn't overweight to begin with) but the cancer stopped growing.  He had regular blood work done which showed no 'bad' numbers and periodic scans showed no growth. Eventually had surgery to remove the remaining cancer and has been cancer-free ever since (going on 6-7 years now).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thought he was nuts going into it but I can't dispute the results.  In my completely unqualified opinion I believe the complete elimination of sugar was the likely cause of the success of the treatment.

       See not all cancer will kill a person, and sometimes the body will fight back against the cancer and contain it, so the fact that he didn't die and took supplements dosent mean that the supplements worked, just that something lead to the cancers decline, which may have been aided by the supplements. When detecting cancer they can't tell what exactly the cancer will be like so all prostate cancer is treated the same, where it may in fact be a harmless form that would not kill a person unless extremely weak.

       Sounds a lot like the Gerson therapy. The body has everything it needs to heal. Proper nourishment and cleansing is the real game changer that most people don't take seriously enough. Gerson's main supplement was potassium if I remember correctly. Coffee enemas were the cleansing part of the therapy.

       Yes. You put in a gelatin capsule an amount the size of a pea and ingest it with a small amount of food. But, make sure that it is the kind of Compound X, or Black Salve you can ingest. Some salves are made for ranchers to put on skin cancers of white face cows with eye cancer. It has all natural ingredients; "bloodroot" being the most important ingredient.

       So my aunt and uncle both got liver cancer from Hep C when they got matching stick and pokes in the early 80s.  She does no treatment other than marlboros, Busch Light and meth. She's fine 8 years later.  He did cannabis oil and radiation and died after 4 years.  I think it might just fucking be random.

       My uncle who died last year for lung cancer, we did every treatment we could possibly find including cannabis oil, raw vegan diet and radiation. It improved for a couple years but in the end didn't work for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He regretted the radiation and was convinced its what killed him in the end.

       I had a great aunt and uncle die a few years ago due to cancer. Both really surprising as one got lung cancer despite never smoking or working anywhere that could put her at risk, and the other of stomach cancer. They died about 1 year apart, at the same time another great aunt had lung cancer as well, although I think the two people are unrelated and the second one survived no problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       My grandpa died of stomach cancer as well, diffrent family, had his esopigoous removed the first time and spent 4 years only eating soup due to the replacement not being able to hold down solid foods, came back when I was 9 and he was 58. He was a simple baker who was very unlucky threw out his life. What is sad and heartwarming is my uncle died the month later, he was my grandpa's son in law, his final request was to be baried next to grandpa as he was closer to him than his own parents, they spent a lot of time together while alive. I believe that originally that plot was supposed to be for my grandma, but they chose to give it to my uncle as it was agreed that they would both have been happy with the arrangement.

       A shaman from the rain forest told me that long ago in the rare case of xertain diseases or cancer they used to use an enzyme that was extracted from the liver (and possibly other organs) of a specific rare type of Ratfish (chimera family). And that it can be found only in 2 places, the Indian Ocean and the other he specified not to repeat.

       I've seen breast cancer disappear from raw vegan diet + something similar to CRISPr. Unfortunately I've also seen a strict raw vegan diet not make any impact at all in liver and lung cancer. Think maybe the cancer had already progressed too far.

       After my father retired he became kind of obsessed with helping people with cancer. I think he just lost too many family and friends for one man to deal with. While both of his brothers were sick it really did become an obsession. They ate strictly raw vegan. My dad prepared or had prepared, all their meals. He juiced for them daily with best quality produce and prepared all the vitamins and anti inflammatory foods and teas and herbs from China and CBD oil. They did at least a few different alternative treatment therapies. One did chemo and one didn't. And they both died.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who get sick call my him and he travels with them to clinics in other countries and helps them with everything he can which always includes a raw vegan diet... and this is like 30+ people so far, but still, at least half end up dying (honestly more than half).
      </p>
      <p>
       My family has ditched plant based/vegan diet for now and we're trying ketogenic diet after a lot of thought and research. Hope it's a good choice.

       I manufacture and sell kombucha. I heard plenty of stories at the farmers market I originally sold at in FL. one that stood out the most was the organic and farmer next to me had organic soursop and people were lining up in the morning to get the leafs to make soursop tea. One family bought a whole tree/bush because that was how they had been fighting their cancer (as well as being vegan) successfully.

       First, a disclaimer - I'm very sorry for your situation but really, really, really think it's important that you aren't instilled with false hope here. I am a believer in thorough, rigorous science and as much as I want to believe too, know that any personal anecdote should be taken with a grain of salt. There is a personal anecdote for just about anything.
BUTTTT that being said (and it should be noted I am NOT a doctor), I have high regard for a few natural ingredients out there insofar as their anti-cancer properties, namely reishi mushroom powder, pokeweed root and the nut meats found in the pits of cherries, apricots and most stone fruits. With the latter two, it is extremely important to take care about dosage as they are mild poisons.

       Father of my ex girlfriend was given a six month prognosis from cancer that had metastasized (forget what kind/to where, will check and edit later). He started chemo immediately. His wife began home brewing cannabis oil, spending thousands of dollars on weed. Eventually the word got out and professional growers reached out too.
      </p>
      <p>
       He outlived his prognosis by almost a year. I talked to a lot of other doctors about his cancer, and they all thought the original prognosis was extremely generous for what what he had. While he was going through chemo, he kept his hair, hell I even saw him out walking his dog. He wasn't in constant agony like most chemo patients.

       Everyone close to him, and the community that helped treat him, genuinely believe that the cannabis oil was what gave him that extra year and incredible relief while going through chemo.

       His story and vehement activism, along with many others, helped pass my state's first medical marijuana bill.

       This sub is fucking rediculous sometimes. Cancer isn't when your body loses the fight against a tumor, it's when your body fails to recognize a tumor and doesn't fight it at all. Hence, natural medicine don't help fight cancer since, again, there is no fucking fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only REAL remedy against cancer is having an agent fight the tumor instead of your body: designer medicine. Basicly, they try to fit an antidote to your cancer like an Italian shoemaker makes you a shoe. It's tricky though since most cancer mutate faster than my dick when sighting Taylor Swifts.

       I never witnessed it. I know fpur who tried alternative treatments and all died. However, it is heartening to know that research shows post-cancer lifestyle changes such as exercise and healthy eating can reduce the chances of it coming back.

       Royal Raymond Rife was a brilliant scientist who was active in the decades before WWII. Among his many achievements, he devised microscopes that could magnify objects by 30 thousand times, and also discovered methods of illuminating specific species of micro-organisms by tuning into their resonant frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the course of his research, he also found that he could destroy any of these organisms using the same technique.

       The fact that crystalline structures can be shattered with sound waves is more or less common knowledge. The fact that the same process can be used to cure diseases, however, has been suppressed for decades.

       The amount of power and influence possessed by the pharmaceutical cartels is self-explanatory to those of us who frequent this subreddit. Just imagine the wealth of game-changing knowledge still out there, undiscovered; buried by vested interests who profit from keeping their subjects ignorant, numb, sick and tired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rife's name has come up on this subreddit a few times over the years. I'm not surprised you haven't heard of him, because I hadn't either until yesterday.
