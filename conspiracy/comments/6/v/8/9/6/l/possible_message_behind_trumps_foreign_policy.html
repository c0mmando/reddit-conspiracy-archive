        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is speculation but this is what may be the message in Trump&#39;s speech. </p>

<p>America has been funneling heroine from Afghanistan and selling it all over the world including in America. Pakistan has helped this process and acted as a middle man just like Mexico acts like a middle man to import Colombian cocaine into America. </p>

<p>Obama and Bush were essentially allies with Pakistan who is a known supporter of terrorism. India is Pakistan&#39;s enemy. India is also Iran&#39;s ally. Iran is enemies with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel and Saudi Arabia are serious apartheid states who participate in terrorism and human rights violations worldwide including in their own land. The deep state regimes of Bush and Obama were friends with Israel and Saudi Arabia. The US, Saudis, amd Israelis ran the 9-11 false flag together to justify endless wars in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Basically, Trump is moving the alliances of America from Pakistan (eta al) to India (eta al) as long as India is willing to help pay the bill on fixing Afghanistan. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what he has planned for Afghanistan but he is hinting at hitting the problem with full force instead of half-assed. (Note: The deep state took a half ass approach in places like Vietnam and Afghanistan in order to maximize profits from the Military Industrial Complex since the longer we stay in war, the more money they make. The 2 main problems in Afghanistan are the Heroine trade and instability. Bush and Obama wanted the instability and they heroine trade to last as long as possible to maximize profits. Trump wants to eliminate it quickly. </p>

<p>The US has the most powerful and expansive military on the face of the Earth by far. This military has been used as cannon fodder for the worldwide cabal without any care if it bankrupts the US. Basically, the cabal gets what they want and the American taxpayer pays for it. If Trump is for the people, this should no longer be the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Trump is aligning America with not only India but also Russia, Iran, and some other countries against Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and some other countries. Europe seems split. German government looks comprised. The U.K. looks compromised too but Brexit was a good turning point. </p>

<p>Basically, it looks like alliances are shifting fast. That speech was probably meant to be a warning to certain countries and an invitation to others. </p>

<p>Edit: Also, Trump mentioned the invasion and democratization of countries is over. Every country Obama and Bush tried to help has been destroyed because liberation was never the intention. It was only a cover story to fool the Americans. Quote:</p>

<p>&quot;But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands or try to rebuild other countries in our own image. Those days are now over. Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests.&quot;</p>

<p>Mexico is the biggest producer of American opium. Transporting heroin to the US from Europe is far too costly to compete with Mexican and South American production.</p>

<p>Pakistan is definitely a significant transit area for Afghan drugs, through which they are bound for Iran, Gulf states, Africa, Asia. Corruption is of course widespread -- there&#39;s really no need for the US to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>ISIS/Taliban/terrorist orgs are the biggest beneficiary of opium, the production of which is at its highest ever (thanks to the US occupation).</p>
