        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is an admittedly out there theory, and I doubt I will be capable of constraining it to under nine thousand words. </p>

<p>The theory goes that an unknown man or men are responsible for a multitude of murders in this country by means of brainwashing young, impressionable idiots who will practically do anything. </p>

<p>The idea comes from a book called The Ultimate Evil, by the late Maury Terry. It highlights a massive problem with the official story behind the Son of Sam murders. It quickly goes down a rabbit hole of linkage between individuals, suspicious deaths related to people mentioned in the Son of Sam letters, Satanic parties for the super rich... The rabbit hole goes very deep yet unfortunately the book suffers from tunnel vision. </p>

<p>The ultimate blame falls on a church called the Process, which, upon real scrutiny, seems to be linked by weird people doing weird things. That doesn&#39;t necessarily equate guilt. </p>

<p>Some interesting things touched in the book are as follows: 
1. witnesses reported seeing completely different looking individuals during some of the murders, radically different than the distinct David Berkowitz.
2. People connected to Berkowitz that were named in the letter, the Carrs, died suspicious deaths. One shot himself in the head in a seemingly impossible way. He also wrote on the wall in his own blood, after shooting himself in the head.
3. There were supposedly parties held by a rich person which included selling tapes of all sorts, including CP. This was driven by bikers across the country from somewhere in New Jersey. 
What isn&#39;t noted in the book is this is not the only case where this happens. The OCCK case, going on at the exact same time as Son of Sam, had an equally suspicious and similar suicide to its big evil &quot;killer&quot; suspect Chris Busch, though that killer hasn&#39;t been identified. Chris Busch had connections to Fox Island, which was run by the heir of a once governor of Michigan. In other words, old money scum. Also connected to him were two individuals, one of which was a man named Dyer Grossman. Dyer Grossman resided in New York. </p>

<p>The pedophile network connected to an individual by the name of &quot;Adam Starchild&quot; not his real name. He ran a business that stretched CP from New Jersey to Michigan under the guise of a church, called the Church of New Revelation. This wasn&#39;t a church at all but a tax front (man was an evil genius, as was Dyer and Frank Torey, don&#39;t believe me? None ever faced a judge. But that is a different rabbit hole)</p>

<p>Other similarities and connections between cases include letters given to police at a nearly identical time referenced being slaves to an individual forcing them to do his will. Some subscribe this to a devil or demon of sorts, which would seem a rational response.</p>

<p>But these two cases aren&#39;t the only ones with criminals trying to attribute the crime to another far more wicked group. The Atlanta Child Killings come to mind. The convicted murderer in that case blamed a secret mission he was directed and groomed for. </p>

<p>And the first two cases aren&#39;t the only ones with suspicious suicides, either. Michael Helgoth died in circumstances eerily similar to the other two suicides mentioned. </p>

<p>So here is the nuts theory. My theory is that there is a single individual with a cult like following that isn&#39;t Manson, who is likely connected to Manson, who has an active interest in killing young children and happy couples. </p>

<p>He is responsible for training Berkowitz, the Atlanta Child Killer, Chris Busch, Allen of Zodiac, and more. </p>

<p>I dunno though lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol my jokes are terrible. I run a reddit on the OCCK case, r/occk. When you look at child death and sick scum getting away with it, with serious evidence suggesting intentional neglect by police (evidence far stronger than this weak thrown together theory) it can put you in a psychological mode of darkness and despair. Obviously this has effected my humor but ultimately is a defense mechanism of sorts, to protect a semblance of a better World view.</p>

<p>However OCCK research led me in a multitude of directions, thus this poor man&#39;s theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id say it is similar in nature but more of a means of distraction from other activity. I find it remarkably coincidental the two areas connected to an old money pedophile club burst out with serial killers diverting local and federal police away from them right when a federal manhunt aims for their heads. </p>

<p>Especially considering both the OCCK and Son of Sam cases featured perhap the most absurd stories ever put on paper. Maybe only topped by the Jonbenet Ransom. John Ramsey, father of Jonbenet, had a summer home in Charlevoix, Frank &#39;Torey&#39; Sheldons old town of operations. The operation connected to numerous other disgusting operations including involving boy scout clubs. Some of Fox Island can be found directly in the Boy Scouts Perversion files. His father John Dudley Ramsey ran the aeronautics division in Michigan during a time where little boys were being flown to an elite pedophile island for intercourse. These coincidences are likely just that, or somethimg sinister has been at work for a multitude of years.  </p>

Do you know if the Michigan Aeronautics Commission played any part in protecting Shelden&#39;s network?

    <div class="md"><p>I have zero evidence of anything, but the MAC would have had direct authority over all landing strips at the time. I imagine that would have included private flight paths to islands as well. </p>

<p>The Omaha thing is odd. Also there is the whole Atlanta Child Killings thing too, but now we are talking deep conspiracy drivel. I like to focus on one thing. I personally would love to see if Dudley had any impact on the Fox Island thing. It would most certainly give motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same writer wrote Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.  In that book, the Process Church is mentioned a few times.  He linked Charles Manson to them.  </p>

<p>Well worth the read. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.conspirazzi.com/e-books/inside-the-lc.pdf">http://www.conspirazzi.com/e-books/inside-the-lc.pdf</a>    </p>

<p>Some choice quotes:</p>

<p>“Around March 10, 1968, a convoy of
seven Process automobiles containing thirty people and fourteen Alsatian dogs journeyed toward
Los Angeles.” Vincent Bugliosi added, in his best-selling Helter Skelter, that in “1968 and 1969,
The Process launched a major recruiting drive in the United States. They were in Los Angeles in
May and June of 1968 and for at least several months in the fall of 1969.” The Processians, it
should be noted, were instantly recognizable on the streets of LA due to the fact that they had a
curious habit of donning black capes wherever they went.  </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>New York City once had a large estate known as Greystone as well. That
Greystone was donated to the city as parkland, and it thereafter became known as Untermyer
Park – the same Untermyer Park identified by Maury Terry as one of the two principal ritual
sites used by the Process Church faction behind the ‘Son of Sam’ murders. The other site used by
the cult was Van Cortlandt Park, named for Jacobus Van Cortlandt, a former Mayor of New
York and one of David Van Cortlandt Crosby’s forefathers. Another of Crosby’s forefathers lent
his name to Schuyler Road, which happens to run along the western boundary of the Greystone
Park in the Hollywood Hills.  </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Also a regular at Cass’s place, by some reports, was Charlie Manson himself. According to Ed
Sanders, it was at Cass’s home that Charlie first met her neighbor, coffee heiress Abigail Folger
(who helped finance Kenneth Anger’s films, like the one that was supposed to star Godo
Paulekas but instead starred Mansonite Bobby Beausoleil). According to Terry, the rather
notorious group known as The Process: Church of the Final Judgment – which evidence suggests
had deep ties to the Manson, Son of Sam, and Cotton Club murders – actively sought to recruit
Mama Cass, as well as John Phillips and Terry Melcher.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice I am a huge fan of Maury Terry&#39;s work and was quite saddened he died before releasing the fourth edition. I will have to give that a read. Something tells me that the links to a pedophile ring in New Jersey mentioned by an informant in the case of Son of Sam is the actual purpose. Lots of evil in this world and all of it needs funding. If you haven&#39;t looked into Adam Starchild do so, he is perhaps the evilest genius to ever step foot on American soil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am I mistaken, or did Berkowitz say there were multiple sons of Sam? He doesn&#39;t have any motive to lie. He became a born again Christian in prison, believes he deserves to stay there for the rest of his life, and wants to serve in prison ministry. So if he&#39;s saying this, I think it&#39;s worth considering. </p>
