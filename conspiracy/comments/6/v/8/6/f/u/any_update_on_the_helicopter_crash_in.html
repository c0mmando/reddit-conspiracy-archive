    <div class="md"><p>There is still nothing resembling visual proof of a helicopter crash. The Liveleak video we see is apparently the Double Rainbow guy looking at a brush fire or a place where someone lit some Ronson lighter fluid on the ground, but not a helicopter crash. We also see some smoke from far away, kind of like at the Pentagon on 9/11..... but no helicopter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they were the only helicopter during the protest and therefore the only ones that would have had full aerial footage of the protest including when the vehicle ran over those people. Well now there&#39;s conviently no evidence of that except for some people&#39;s crappy phone footage/pictures and eye witnesses. That&#39;s really all I can gather that would be reason for them faking it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Faking a helicopter crash would be the least practical solution for that. Just say the helicopter was looking somewhere else at the time, or the camera malfunctioned, or a protestor with a lazer pointer blinded the camera. There are a million possibilities that would be easier to fake and harder to dispute than a helicopter crashing and killing two officers. </p>

<p>I am still trying to find the article posted in r/news the day it happened. In this article it stated that &quot;neighbors reported a helicopter hopvering low then landing in the woods&quot;  I was at work at the time of reading it an did not think to screen shot it. In my ducking for said news report I came across the wapo story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An you are?   Lemme tell you something young buck, I have been coming to reddit since 2011., Have had an deleted several accounts. you account only be a year old would not know that I used to only need 1 dollar, goddamn economy had me up that too 2 dollars last year. An 81 or 82 days ago a chantix induced mental episode caused me to delete that account.</p>

<p>Any update on the Helicopter crash in Charlottesville? The media went silent &lt;-------- is the title of this thread is it not? </p>

<p>I shared a wapo article because of their cia affiliation and how they are claiming the helo had problems in 2010. As far as I am concerned that is wapo doing what they do best and putting disinfo out there. </p>

<p>The second article I shared I originally saw here on reddit Aug 12,2017 an found the part of the article where is says &quot;Neighbors say the helicopter hovered low before landing in the woods.&quot; to be interesting. I decided to add it to my post to add context. Make of it what you will. </p>

<p>But 1 thing for sure and 2 things for certain.. I am not your trifecta..try again </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak for myself and say I believe the news report about what happened to the helicopter. It doesn&#39;t have room to play into any conspiracy. There may still be an update later on but investigators have very little to work with since the helicopter was not equpped with a voice recorder or flight data recorder.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4807300/Emotional-funeral-cop-died-Charlottesville.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4807300/Emotional-funeral-cop-died-Charlottesville.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The helicopter was also heavily damaged in 2010 when it lost engine power and was forced to make a hard landing. </p>

<p>The helicopter had left Charlottesville airport at 3.54pm and was &#39;engaged in mission-related activities&#39; above the city&#39;s downtown until 4.42pm on August 13. It was sent away from the Unite the Right rally - which descended into violence and left one woman dead - to provide support for McAuliffe&#39;s motorcade.  The first 911 calls reporting the crash came in about two minutes later.</p>

<p>The aircraft went down into woods - with the tail becoming stuck in a tree while the rest of the wreckage was found 300 feet away. </p>

<p>But there was no distress call made by the pilot, the report says, but what went on in the cockpit may never be known. That is because the helicopter was not - and was not required to be - equipped with a voice recorder or flight data recorder.</p>
