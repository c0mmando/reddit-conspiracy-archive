<p>Brother Earnest and I talked Flat Earth with MIT students and passers-by just outside of their astronomy build at 77 Massachusetts Avenue today during the eclipse.  Brother Earnest owns <a href="http://www.jesuswasnotajew.org/yahwehs-flat-earth.html">nasalies.org</a> and is responsible for a nation-wide effort to bring flat earth debates to college campuses and the flat earth to public school curriculums.  If you&#39;d like to know how it went, check out the summary video above.</p>

<p>The whole 4 hours will be up soon.</p>

<p>Wait... Cooling moonlight has been thoroughly debunked. I&#39;ll explain it to you when I have more time. </p>

<p>Line of sight tests? Even Rowbotham believed in refraction... Most are debunked. </p>

<p>And yes, I find that long line of sight tests are an effective piece of proof for the flat earth.  Why wouldn&#39;t measuring a straight segment over long distances not prove a flat earth?  Why is it that all amateur footage taken shows that all lakes and segments of ocean are totally flat?  How can periscopes see around the curve of the earth?  How can railguns shoot along a curve?

<p>Information that you appear to be extremely resistant to.  Sorry but I genuinely feel like my time is being wasted here.</p>

<p>I am extremely interested in why you think the moonlight experiment has been debunked - PLEASE DO explain why you think the properties of moonlight being different than that of the sun is false or not important whenever you DO have time.  PLEASE PM ME or REPLY HERE!  I WOULD LOVE TO READ IT</p>

<p>Theres like 5 posts there... Most from months ago. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lets approach it from a different angle? Is it the moonlight itself or is it something else?</p>

<p>Lets say I make 2 hot pockets and put both into their own styrofoam box I cover one and leave the other uncovered. </p>

<p>Which one cools quicker? Probably the one without a cover, right?</p>

<p>Same phenomena here. If there is moonlight we know that cloud cover is minimal. AKA there is no cover to the box, this is meteorology 101 objects cool quicker if the clouds arent trapping the heat from escaping into the upper atmosphere. </p>

<p>So is it the moonlight or is it because on a clear night heat is more able to dissipate? </p>

<p>Did you test both in a vacuum? For example put two objects in a sealed clear box and see which one cools quicker? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moonlight is cooling and has different properties than sunlight.  An experiment that I have done repeatedly is to place thermometers in various locations on or near a full moon.  One thermometer is exposed to moonlight, one is in shade.  Even when various locations have been used (enclosed porch, roof, open field, pavement, shoebox, etc) the thermometer that is exposed to moonlight reads cooler by ~2-3 degrees F.</p>

<p>One control I have introduced to control for other environmental factors is a magnifying glass.  You can take a magnifying glass to focus the rays of the moon and the effect intensifies to be closer to 5 degrees or more.  Additionally I&#39;ve added randomized human components to the test - I focus the rays of the moon on someone&#39;s arm or fingers and after some time they can always feel the cold.  It&#39;s not a strong effect but it appears to be present with every full moon.</p>

<p>You said you knew this was bunk - if I could execute this experiment as I&#39;ve described it here would that be adequate for you?</p>

<p>Thanks for the ideas about cooling a body of water or sealed boxes too, that would be interesting to test.</p>

<p>Radiative cooling, a well known phenomena that explains why objects exposed to open air (No cloud cover) cool faster. </p>

<p>If I run a test 100 times and one of those times gets a dramatically different result why should I assume that one result is more accurate than the 99 times that agreed?</p>

<p>Most of those tests are broken as fuck and you only see the ones where the desired result is produced. Confirmation bias combined with poor science is the result of these tests. </p>

<p>You see the problem here right? I am unable to reproduce these tests, there is ample info that its bullshit and bad science and yet you claim the opposite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moonlight is cooling and has different properties than sunlight. An experiment that I have done repeatedly is to place thermometers in various locations on or near a full moon. One thermometer is exposed to moonlight, one is in shade. Even when various locations have been used (enclosed porch, roof, open field, pavement, shoebox, etc) the thermometer that is exposed to moonlight reads cooler by ~2-3 degrees F.
One control I have introduced to control for other environmental factors is a magnifying glass. You can take a magnifying glass to focus the rays of the moon and the effect intensifies to be closer to 5 degrees or more. Additionally I&#39;ve added randomized human components to the test - I focus the rays of the moon on someone&#39;s arm or fingers and after some time they can always feel the cold and even point to when blindfolded. It&#39;s not a strong effect but it appears to be present with every full moon.
You said you knew this was bunk - if I could execute this experiment as I&#39;ve described it here would that be adequate for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re not the first person to link that, thanks.</p>

<p>Again though, if I can show you that this effect is only present during the fuller phases of the moon AND that it can be intensified by a magnifying glass then what else could it be?  A magnifying glass would not amplify radiative cooling, and it would also be present during all phases of the moon.</p>

<p>I am extremely interested in why you think the moonlight experiment has been debunked</p>

<p>Lets approach it from a different angle? Is it the moonlight itself or is it something else?</p>

<p>Lets say I make 2 hot pockets and put both into their own styrofoam box I cover one and leave the other uncovered. </p>

<p>Which one cools quicker? Probably the one without a cover, right?</p>

<p>Same phenomena here. If there is moonlight we know that cloud cover is minimal. AKA there is no cover to the box, this is meteorology 101 objects cool quicker if the clouds arent trapping the heat from escaping into the upper atmosphere. </p>

<p>So is it the moonlight or is it because on a clear night heat is more able to dissipate? </p>

<p>Did you test both in a vacuum? For example put two objects in a sealed clear box and see which one cools quicker? </p>
