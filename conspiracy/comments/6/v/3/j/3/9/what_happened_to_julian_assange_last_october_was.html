    <div class="md"><p>From the linked thread on <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The London City Airport was shut down for a &quot;terrorist exercise&quot; and a dodgy plane was tracked leaving and landing in a notorious rendition facility in N.C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is disinfo.</strong> The dodgy plane and the airport evacuation (chem spill, not a terrorist-related event) occurred on entirely different days. Also, Luton and London City Airports are two entirely different airports. These events have been intentionally conflated since the week they happened.</p>

<p>17 Oct - flight N379P (&quot;Gitmo Express&quot;) flies from Luton Airport in London to Raleigh-Durham, NC</p>

<p>18 Oct - unusual activity at the Embassy, see WL retweet below</p>

<p>21 Oct - WL retweets PHOTO: Heavily armed &#39;police&#39; appear outside Ecuadorian Embassy in London where Julian Assange has political asylum (photo, Tuesday morning - Oct 18th)</p>

<p>21 Oct - London City airport evacuated for chemical scare, DDOS attacks</p>

<p>Note that the &quot;Gitmo Express&quot; (which in itself was a supposition and never actually proven to be so) N379P flew from Luton Airport. London City Airport was evacuated later that week. N379P landed at Raleigh-Durham.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to Assange in October, there is apparently still efforts being made to weave a narrative around the events. Much disinfo still being communicated. Here&#39;s a link to a Disinfo Mega Thread on <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a>:

<p>Not only DisInfo, but these corrections were posted and discussed on the sub-reddit very shortly after the conspiracy nuts started running with it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a game to many of them. They are immune to corrective posts, wait until the activity dies down, then post the same debunked shit all over again. Oh, and they love to post that there&#39;s been no proof of life since October. (Apart from, you know, ALL of the proof that&#39;s been thoroughly documented since October.)</p>

<p>The timeline in my comment was a copy-paste from a comment I made months ago. That I mentioned the DDOS attacks was incidental (the original comment came from a timeline I was building around all of the Assange/WL October events at the time).</p>

<p>You&#39;re suggesting that the DDOS was cover for the key dump? I don&#39;t doubt it, but I don&#39;t have any evidence to support that theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timing is the only evidence we have.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that your timeline actually clears some things up. For instance the Luton flight leaves the country a few days before the &quot;precommitment keys&quot; are tweeted his dead man&#39;s switch triggers. And then Pam Anderson an actress by trade &quot;visits Assange&quot;.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m thinking is that they renditioned him on that Luton flight, his DMS goes off on the Friday with the tweeting of those keys. Wikileaks key holders uphold their end of the rubber hose deal and get that pastebin up. Meanwhile Pam Anderson and City airport are mere distractions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As goofy as this sounds, I think there&#39;s more to Anderson&#39;s visits than distraction. She was there just hours before his internet got cut on October 15, tweeting a pic of her walking into the Embassy carrying Westwood&#39;s <em>Get a Life</em>. Super suspicious timing of her <em>first</em> visit. Plus, her Russian business connections at least raise eyebrows.</p>

<p>The pre-commitment hashes (Kerry, Ecuador, UK FCO) were tweeted on Sunday, October 16, after his internet was cut. It was speculated that the hashes were a form of threat in response to the internet being cut. In his AMA, iirc, Assange himself explained that these hashes aren&#39;t the same as his DMS.</p>

<p>John Kerry <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/appt/2016/10/263181.htm">was in London</a> on Sunday, October 16, incidentally.</p>

<p>The Luton flight was Monday, October 17, the day after the pre-commits were tweeted. For what it&#39;s worth, I was on the thread tracking the Luton flight as it was happening. In retrospect, I do not believe he was on that flight. I believe we were jumping at shadows - the idea that he was on the flight originated from the theory that <em>if</em> the were going to rendition him, cutting his comm lines would absolutely be the first step. And then, someone matched up the plane numbers with the Gitmo Express (I don&#39;t think that has ever been officially confirmed though), and it snowballed from there.</p>

<p>When did the pastebin get put up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, like, how are we meant to believe in the veracity of when assanges internet was cut off?</p>

<p>Anyway no, its pretty clear to me that the keys were a part of the DMS. You must not have read the part about converting them into vanity Bitcoin addresses containing a clear message and some further information.
Also you can&#39;t trust that the person in the AMA was him because the real Assange stated if there was any doubt about his wellbeing he would sign the key but this man did not.</p>

<p>Well, like, how are we meant to believe in the veracity of when assanges &quot;internet was cut off&quot; (he was neutralised)? </p>

<p>I&#39;m going by the tweet from wikileaks that said &quot;We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange&#39;s internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton&#39;s Goldman Sachs speeches&quot;. I can&#39;t find the original tweet, here&#39;s a news article that refers to it: <a href="http://www.wionews.com/world/ecuador-cut-off-julian-assanges-net-connection-wikileaks-claims-7603">http://www.wionews.com/world/ecuador-cut-off-julian-assanges-net-connection-wikileaks-claims-7603</a></p>

<p>vanity Bitcoin addresses containing a clear message and some further information</p>

<p>What was the message?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you can&#39;t trust that the person in the AMA was him </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He addressed this question in the AMA. No, the AMA didn&#39;t prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was him, but his explanation of the keys and WL concerns over future proof of freedom from duress rang true to me. Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5n58sm/i_am_julian_assange_founder_of_wikileaks_ask_me/">AMA</a> in case you&#39;ve not seen it. He answered in video format, and read blockchain entries in real time. No, not 100% proof of life, identity or lack of duress, but pretty convincing.</p>

<p>The message was like &quot;Keys&quot; Fata1&quot; &quot;he11&quot; and some password or something &quot;is&quot; something. It&#39;s addressed in the OP link</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know which happened first. I&#39;m only calling out the airport events conflation as disinfo. </p>

<p>The timeline in my comment was a copy-paste from a comment I made months ago. That I mentioned the DDOS attacks was incidental (the original comment came from a timeline I was building around all of the Assange/WL October events at the time).</p>

<p>You&#39;re suggesting that the DDOS was cover for the key dump? I don&#39;t doubt it, but I don&#39;t have any evidence to support that theory. </p>
