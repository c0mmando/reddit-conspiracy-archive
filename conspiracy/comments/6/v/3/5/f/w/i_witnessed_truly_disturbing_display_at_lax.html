        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was returning the the country at the Bradley terminal yesterday, I am a US citizen. After being subjected to the biometric scan,   I was in line for the immigration and border police checkpoint, where they collect the receipt of your scan.  I witnessed an officer put on a disgusting display.  I just caught the last part of it. Apparent a young man, early twenties, did not remove his headphones for the picture. I saw the officer hold up over his head the mans passport and receipt and address the crowd waiting in line. &quot;Let this be a lesson to you all .. You need to remove any glasses hats AND headphones for your picture&quot;. The tone was what really struck me, it was threatening, demeaning and a public humiliation. I think someone tried to record it because there was another threat about no cell phones allowed in this area, that too was extremely threatning. Like I said I was in the back and just caught the tail end of it. I wish I had it recorded.  It thoroughly disgusted me that this was my country treats its returning citizens.</p>

It&#39;s nice knowing my plane that is extremely heavy won&#39;t have crazies with weapons hopefully. I just got a bag with clothes and a backpack.</p>

<p>My most telling situation of the state of America is one time I had a guy at a gas station look for watermarks in a $5 bill while I was trying to buy a few iced teas. Now that&#39;s fucking rude.</p>
