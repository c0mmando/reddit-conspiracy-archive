<ul>
<li><p>private property, which allows people to own tangible assets such as land and houses and intangible assets such as stocks and bonds;</p></li>
<li><p>self-interest, through which people act in pursuit of their own good, without regard for sociopolitical pressure. Nonetheless, these uncoordinated individuals end up benefiting society as if, in the words of Smith’s 1776 Wealth of Nations, they were guided by an invisible hand;</p></li>
<li><p>competition, through firms’ freedom to enter and exit markets, maximizes social welfare, that is, the joint welfare of both producers and consumers;</p></li>
<li><p>a market mechanism that determines prices in a decentralized manner through interactions between buyers and sellers—prices, in return, allocate resources, which naturally seek the highest reward, not only for goods and services but for wages as well;</p></li>
<li><p>freedom to choose with respect to consumption, production, and investment—dissatisfied customers can buy different products, investors can pursue more lucrative ventures, workers can leave their jobs for better pay;</p></li>
<li><p>limited role of government, to protect the rights of private citizens and maintain an orderly environment that facilitates proper functioning of markets. (just enough to allow capitalism to function)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>No where in there does it say America must be world police (remember limited government), nor does it say the point of capitalism is to amass wealth, and divide the classes. These are misconceptions. Anything which works against capitalism, such as amassing billions of dollars of wealth or constantly starting international wars, abject poverty, class struggle, etc, <strong>are anti-capitalism</strong>.</p>

<p>Capitalism is a always a system composed of and from class struggle.   That is the Marxist point.   The argument that Marx made was that the categories of political economy, like money, wage labor, etc, are categories that are real and they structure our social world.  However, the very categories are really different way that relations between people, which are ANTAGONISTIC, are expressed.   So much so that the very creation of capitalism, which is characterized by a set of people that sell their time in exchange for a wage and a set of people that buys that time was bloody and violent.   </p>

<p>People had to first be disposed of  personal or communal property, like the enclosures in England or what happened to Native Americans here.  Then people were forced into becoming laborers.  </p>

<p>So to summarize, capitalism was created through violence and class struggle (people resisted becoming wage laborers), and is characterized by class struggle.  </p>

<p>That is the Marxist position. Marxism is the term for this type of analysis.   That is what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is a always a system composed of and from class struggle. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>No, it isn&#39;t</li>
</ul>

<p>Capitalism is a class based society. If it suffers from cultural hegemony- it&#39;s a Marxist society descending into socialism. You see, things which exacerbate and exemplify class struggle are based on injustices. Injustices like the Drug War. It&#39;s as if you&#39;re suggesting that the core of capitalism is racist. As if you&#39;re suggesting it&#39;s more than a mere piece of paper. As if you&#39;re suggesting it thinks for the bourgeois.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any injustices in capitalism, its very easy for us to get rid of them, if we can just get the right people in office. It&#39;s certainly much easier than a violent revolution, like what happened in Russia during the Bolshevik &quot;Revolution&quot; (really a coup).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they haven&#39;t re-written certain aspects of it to favor themselves, I&#39;m saying they have! I&#39;m saying we have never, ever lived in the true spirit of capitalism- because it was never in the elite classes best interest to do so. So they altered and perverted it, and that created class struggle.</p>

<p>This is where Marx was wrong. Take it from me, I&#39;m literally his proletariat. If we want America to be a great place to live, we need to get rid of the Drug War first. That&#39;s the main thing making police profile them. The main reason they&#39;re constantly getting shot. It&#39;s what takes fathers away from their children in low income neighborhoods, and it&#39;s what gets their mothers addicted to drugs, as it it experiences exponential growth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how you just sidestep what he says about communal property and the evolution of wage labor from the preceding system. Capitalism has seen to the privatization of everything. There are no enclosures, no commons, there are no tools for you to work or land for you to till without first purchasing it as capital. This pretty directly predicates the division of society into two classes: capitalists, those who own capital, and the working class, those who own no capital and must rent themselves in labor in order to survive. </p>

<p>The survival aspect of this is part of what makes wage labor under capitalism inherently exploitative. If you&#39;re going to say that the laborer is engaging in fair contract when his alternative is starvation and death... then I just gotta say &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; is a descriptor more befitting your own thoughts than mine. </p>

<p>P.s. you might want to read Marx before saying &quot;this is where he went wrong.&quot; But I&#39;ve seen you refer to socialist works as &quot;socialist propaganda&quot; so I guess you&#39;ll never actually know what Marx himself even said...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if you understood what marxism is you&#39;d understand that the entire concept you&#39;re talking about is flat out retarded. Who attends Bilderberg? Capitalists. Who pours money into lobbying? Capitalists. Who owns the overwhelming majority of our media? Hmmm. Also capitalists. I guess if you define all these words to mean whatever you want them to then you can make literally anything make sense. But in the real world, words have actual meanings. You can&#39;t just say &quot;capitalism is freedom and rainbows and puppies&quot; and it be true as a result. You&#39;re making up a bunch of nonsensical assertions about capitalism and backing them up with even more absurd allegations regarding socialism, all the while ignoring anything and everything contrary to your worldview. </p>

<p>The main difference between you and I isn&#39;t belief or disbelief in &quot;the illuminati.&quot; I can totally believe in the illuminati. However, it&#39;s infinitely more logical- should &quot;the illuminati&quot; exist- that they be comprised of the capitalist elite. If you want to talk generational plans for dominance, maybe you should be looking at the class which <em>actually inherits meaningful wealth</em>? Maybe these billionaires are engaged in a multi generational conspiracy? </p>

<p>However, the real difference between you and I is that I actually read things. I think about things. I consider arguments being made. You scoff at reading Marx, Lenin, et al., and then you pretend to know anything about what they&#39;ve said. You wouldn&#39;t even touch non-Marxist socialist literature i.e. Kropotkin&#39;s <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> with a ten foot pole. &quot;Propaganda!&quot; you&#39;d say. </p>

<p>I was born in a capitalist society, currently live in a capitalist society, and came to agree with libertarian socialism of my own volition. You call me brainwashed when my views are the culmination if a lifetime cultivating and exercising critical thinking. You just unthinkingly repeat memes like &quot;I like having phones so capitalism is good&quot; and flat out incorrect definitions and pretend to have knowledge of your own. Maybe someday you&#39;ll actually read contrasting opinions. Maybe you&#39;ll still be a capitalist at that point, but at least then you&#39;d actually know what you&#39;re fucking talking about. </p>

<p>They can be, but they don&#39;t have to.

<p>It is actually difficult to correct injustice in capitalism because of asymmetry of power that exists between those that have and those that do not, but this is a non-sequitur. </p>

<p>It is not a question of injustice, it is a question of alienation.  It is a question of what human beings are and how they relate to one another, nature, and their own activity.  </p>

<p>Read the Philosophical and Economic Manuscripts of 1844.</p>

<p>Capitalism does not have spirit.  Capitalism is a concrete system with a history.  Let me put it a different way. Capitalism is a collection of facts that can be ordered chronologically.   Your insistence on some kind of spirit or whatever is ideology. </p>

<ul>
<li>Capitalism has given you everything you have. Even if we did institute socialism in America, it would be based on a lie, as it would be using the property created by a capitalist system. Class struggle is the single most defining characteristic of Marxism.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;No, it has nothing to do with a Marxist society nor descending into anything. This is you making things up.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>This hangup of your is a result of you seeing Marxism for what it really is, a theory. Theories aren&#39;t merely analyses. They are something more- you just fail to see the reality of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;They can be, but they don&#39;t have to. &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>If you can explain to me why JFK started his secret society speech with Karl Marx, and finished it with secret societies. I will admit you are right.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;To give you a banal examples, workers who choose to use the time that they are working for self-valorization are not doing that out of a sense of injustice&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>They are doing these things under the right of self perseverance, which is integral to capitalism. It&#39;s not on the workers to place restrictions on themselves, nor the business owners, that&#39;s capitalism&#39;s job. If class struggle still emerges, capitalism failed. This isn&#39;t to say it always will fail, just that people in government made the wrong choices by allowing the very delicate system of checks and balances that made this this most prosperous country on the globe to erode away. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;You keep up bringing this up, but you realize that the Drug War was started in order to be able to pacify a population that was getting a little too uppity.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>The Dug War was the real institution of cultural hegemony. Created to bring struggle of minorities to the forefront of our minds. Just look around you. Watch ten minutes of CNN. Cultural Marxism is in full effect. <a href="https://www.academia.org/the-origins-of-political-correctness/">https://www.academia.org/the-origins-of-political-correctness/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, I have just as much proof it&#39;s a result of consciously instituted Marxism, as you have it isn&#39;t, but I&#39;m working on it. There&#39;s several paywalls that have the information I&#39;m looking for behind them, and I will get access to them. They examine the so-called positive effects of the Drug War.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about? Capitalism is a concrete social system with a history.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>My bad, more than one piece of paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;No, it provides economic structures and roles that we undertake.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Agreed. It necessitates class based society because it is a necessity if you want things like electricity. The only way you can get people to take more risk for more reward is in a class based society.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;It is actually difficult to correct injustice in capitalism&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>This is the core misconception that gave birth to Marxism and socialist theory, and it was born during the industrial revolution, a very different time in the world, a time in which middle-class wasn&#39;t a thing.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll respond to the rest later.</p>

<p>&quot;However, the very categories are really different ways that relations between people, which are ANTAGONISTIC, are expressed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So much so that the very creation of capitalism, which is characterized by a set of people that sell their time in exchange for a wage and a set of people that buys that time was bloody and violent.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>So what? It doesn&#39;t dictate throwing the baby out with the bath water.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;People had to first be disposed of personal or communal property, like the enclosures in England or what happened to Native Americans here. &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not arguing on behalf of of Native Americans- what was done to them was beyond wrong, but it has benefited this nation to such an extent we&#39;ve become the single most powerful in the world.

<p>We spend a trillion dollars a year on war. It drains our capital- it&#39;s literally a negative force on capitalism. It drains its life blood, and that&#39;s what is was intended to do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the most incredibly stretch of the imagination to look at the fundemental principles of capitalism and somehow think it means we should be bombing Libya to smithereens. How are you getting this?</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already stated, if it doesn&#39;t work towards capitalisms best interests, it&#39;s anti-capitalism. This is so incredibly true, that it should have immediately shut this argument down. </p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to argue capitalism is a system which is constantly trying to become something else. That&#39;s it&#39;s very nature is self destructive. This is ridiculous!</p>

<p>Because it is, however, it is different in a sense that regular economics attempts to fix capitalism (decrease the frequency and severity of crises) Marxism has as its goal the transcendence of capitalist society all together. </p>

<p>Capital firm owners see wages as a cost to be minimized, in order to maximize profits.  Wages constitute effective demand for the very products firms produce.   By pursuing a policy of minimizing costs which is rational for each individual firm, the result is an aggregate in decrease of effective demand.   We see this contradiction taking an even more dangerous form with increases in automation.  I pointed out to you a simple problem yesterday.  If each individual agent pursues what is rational on the individual level, the collective result can be very undesirable. I made this point to you using cars and resulting in a traffic jam, which you deflected by coming up with an ad hoc solution. </p>

<p>It is not. Very few universities actually offer a class on the subject. Usually they are confined to a few economics departments and are thought as &#39;Marxian economics&#39;.   However, Marx is widely read in the social sciences and philosophy because he is historically important, and a powerful thinker. </p>

<p>Here we have something that approaches coherency.  On the claim that they teach Marxist economics, this is just factually wrong.  What dominates is neo-classical economics all the broader framework of a commitment to neo-liberalism. In fact anyone that strays from this orthodoxy faces negative pressures. </p>

<p>Here is an interview Richard Wolff does ( a Marxist following Sweeny) with an economist who dared to teach heterodox economics, and was retaliated against from his economics department. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqupu36hlus">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqupu36hlus</a></p>

<p>Concerning where cultural Marxism came from.  It comes from paleoconservative writters which appropriated writings the Nazi&#39;s did  concerning cultural Bolshevism.  It has nothing to do with culture, Marxists or Marxists writing about culture. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marxism is the Hegelian Dialectic applied to Western capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have this backwards.  The &#39;hegelian dialectic&#39; is an account that is provided of how a capitalist society is a product of rational development historically.  Hegel claimed that a market economy with a set of institutions is rational endpoint of development that provides rational to antagonism.  Marx  criticized Hegel on the point that social antagonism are solved, rather he accused hegel and political economists of obscuring it, but praised hegel for capturing the historical development towards this society in the abstract. </p>

<p>Let me make it clear. Marx was a critic of the dialectic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it could be summed up, it would be: from chaos, assimilation, from assimilation, &quot;harmony&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well this is a sting of words that are not connected to each other.  What Hegel and his milieu argued was that there was a form of society where individuals did not see themselves are standing against their political institutions.   Too use your words there was harmony.  This did not last and was fragmented, and people started to see themselves as separate from nature and from their political institutions.  Perhaps this would be characterized by chaos, although it is very inaccurate.   What Hegel wanted to do is provide an account that this separation was overcome both in modern institutions and in his philosophy.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Projection bias, who&#39;s more likely to see something, the person unwittingly instituting it&#39;s policies, misconceptions and norms, or the person railing against it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have to know something about what you are analyzing.  You don&#39;t. You make basic reasoning errors, and refuse to actually engage in what is offered.   The best advice would be is go to a good university library, and read some introductory texts.  </p>

<p>So far I think it&#39;s a moot point. As this is the model with which we are governed, even if it has been misonctrued:</p>

<p>solution: the pacification and conquest of the Middle East</p>

<p>Socialism describes a range of economic and political ideologies, which I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re totally ignorant to. Marxism-Leninism is <em>a form of socialism</em> that advocates a single party vanguard and collectivization of the means of production under a central state due to specific reasons. There are <em>other forms of socialism</em> that are directly in opposition to Marxism-Leninism <em>because of this</em>. I.e. anarcho-syndicalism. I&#39;m expecting you to just close your eyes and pretend left-libertarianism isn&#39;t a thing though, since your core ideology seems based on the idea that socialism = &quot;the government does stuff and it&#39;s authoritarian.&quot;</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s what it was designed to do. They had to instutute things like the Drug War in order to create class conflict.

<li>Capitalism began to alleviate class conflict. It wasn&#39;t until it started going in the opposite direction that we began to fail.</li>

<p>I can even point to what went wrong: the introduction of property taxes, the introduction of fiat currency, the Drug War (the mother of modern racism) the renewed charters for The Fed. </p>

<p>Really serves to underline how little you actually know about socialism. I&#39;ve mentioned Kropotkin before to you, today, as one whose works you should read. Kropotkin was critical of capitalism. He advocated for socialism via an anarcho-communist perspective. You could consider him to be a socialist. </p>

<p>Yet <strong><em>he despised Marxism</em></strong>. He was a vocal critic of Marxism. He was a true radical, however, and returned to Russia from his exile shortly after the October Revolution, where he died. He was allowed a public funeral, which would be the last time the anarchists were allowed to demonstrate in the USSR. </p>

<p>Does this not serve to illustrate that not all socialism is Marxism? That not all socialists are Marxists? That not all criticisms for capitalism come from Marxism? That, perhaps, you shouldn&#39;t assert that you&#39;ll &quot;prove&quot; that one &quot;learned from Marxists&quot; simply for maligning the Holy Capitalism? </p>

<ul>
<li>I disagree- these are the &#39;houseless&#39;, poor, middle-class, wealthy and elite. With sub-classes in between. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot; These are the working class and capitalist classes. In a capitalist system you either own productive materials/resources/tools/land (which is capital), or you do not and survive by renting your labor to another for their profit.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re talking to someone who is inspired by small businesses on a regular basis- I see people break through their class, and into another, on a regular basis. Even in this horrible economy which the elite have literally consciously ruined, whether you agree with their intent, or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m a do it yourself kind of guy- I fix things when they&#39;re broke, even disposable shit, and I see a million opportunities for good ideas, especially in the computer sciences. I see a million opportunities to make money. However, it won&#39;t happen through wage labor, but that can be a stepping stone. I told this same thing to another fellow like yourself.</p>

<p>He thought I delusional, and I still don&#39;t understand his position. I laid in bed thinking about it last night, and I can not relate.</p>

<p>Are you seriously someone who doesn&#39;t have the American dream?</p>

<p>I&#39;m 39 years old. Perhaps all you younger people think it&#39;s dead, hey? That&#39;s a scary thought for us old folks.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard you address the many Constitutional issues this matter produces, though others have offered sarcasm- &quot;long live the king&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m more of a rebel that you guys will ever be.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, you don&#39;t know what it means any more- the idea has literally been turned on it&#39;s head.</p>

<p>&quot;So. My question to you is, what happens to the working class if and when this sale of labor is no longer necessary?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>This doesn&#39;t happen overnight, it&#39;s been happening, it&#39;s one of the root causes of class struggle. We&#39;re told it&#39;s because of shipping jobs overseas (to inflame class struggle and a division), but what about the millions of jobs <em>we</em> take form other countries? Furthermore, as I&#39;ve already stated, socialism will happen naturally, AND we&#39;ll get to keep our Constitution if we don&#39;t do anything drastic- but I see no possible way to build general consensus. Doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t try.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#39;t you realize &#39;They&#39;re&#39; going to get rid of the Constitution BEFORE this magical socialism is introduced? This is what they have to do to force everyone to works towards a common goal, which in all likelihood will be incredibly menial tasks. </p>

<p>&quot;Why do you think that this has absolutely nothing to do with the conspiracies you see? Why do you not acknowledge the possibility of a capitalist conspiracy (especially in light of all these other capitalist conspiracies i.e. what I&#39;ve mentioned regarding the CIA), or its potential influence on these events you perceive? &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The CIA killed JFK for breaking his oath to whatever the name of the secret society is that he belonged to. Whoever they are, they are connected to Karl Marx, the Russians, The French Illuminati, Masons...</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, why don&#39;t you think secret societies have the potential to alter world events?</strong></p>

<p>I will not live in a world in which some fake Jewish people, who are actually the ancient Khazarian Mafia, not only have more than me, but get to rule over me in some sort of socialist dictatorship without the basic lawful protections of the Constitution. They are literally attempting to take us back to 1700&#39;s Europe. I have more disdain for this group of people than any other on the planet. And no, they are not &quot;semites&quot;.</p>

<p>Look, if they want to make this a workable process, they need to tell everyone about it, and not institute it behind our backs through the disgusting manipulation of the negative sciences. You&#39;re a joke if you think they don&#39;t know about this process. You&#39;re a joke if you don&#39;t think they spend their days trying to accelerate the process. It&#39;s quite literally their hobby. They have a million think tanks that doing nothing but sit around dreaming about Marxism.</p>

<p>Not only have these elite families seen this coming, and prepared for it, they have allowed their twisted sense of logic to make it happen.</p>

<p>Tell them I said- get cancer, and die. I will not live under them, ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just imagine Startrek, yet, with constitutional protection. Do you not see that if we keep the Constitution alive, we will all one day be gods?</p>

<p>We are naturally moving into a socialist system- I&#39;m sure you can agree with this?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we allow the process to happen naturally? If we move into socialism naturally, and at a natural pace, with automation, we will eventually have a lot of free time, and all the lawful protections provided by the Constitution. This is what &#39;They&#39;re&#39; trying to prevent. The idea of the masses having nothing but free time AND having Bill of Rights protections literally scares the elite to death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure that&#39;s where <em>some</em> of my understanding has come from. That is not however the limit of my education. I read. Non-fiction books. Articles. Encyclopedias. Your efforts to portray me as some blabbering fool are not very constructive. I&#39;m not trying to attack you, am I? I never completed my higher education <em>because I saw how in large part the university system has always been nothing more than a tool the market uses to prepare the workforce for employment</em>. I majored in Biochemistry, and then changed to Philosophy for several semesters. My education in Liberal Arts actually turned me away from pursuing an education in Liberal Arts. Some of my understanding about socio-economic theory has been informed by my most recent education in Economics, which I&#39;ve been learning in my free time through distance learning programs, reading books (reading a few on negotiation presently, but before that some stuff on business law, great stuff everyone should learn although I understand this is tangential), and online lectures (Jordan B. Peterson has some good stuff I&#39;ve been digesting). I read lots of philosophy, I&#39;ve read Martin Heidegger&#39;s <em>Being in Time</em> pretty closely, all of the classics, and a few continental philosophers as well as Analytic Metaphysics.</p>

<p>Never learned anything about Marxism, though. I&#39;m not anti-capitalism, by the way, I just acknowledge its short comings and believe we ought to design our society around those short comings instead of ignoring them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, sorry if that came off wrong. It&#39;s not my intent to bully or belittle, I&#39;m just attempting to prove we adopt other peoples view of reality, and not necessary what <strong>is</strong>. Humans have a very hard time thinking independently, and so it is much easier to listen and adopt than to think and understand. I&#39;m a 9th grade dropout- I literally believe it gives me an edge towards having a better understanding of our current political climate than a college graduate. Now, that may seem counterintuitive, and it may even give you a chuckle at first glance, but consider the rigidity of education verses the roundness of knowledge, and consider this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR8hfUkmk6Q">Chomsky lecture:</a>. Then consider where cultural Marxism got its roots: American universities.</p>

<p>Sorry to toot my own horn, but I scored in the 99th percentile on my GED with just a 9th grade education. And while it was just the GED test, it still translates into the average American median, even after accounting for socioeconomic conditions. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s far harder for the brightest students to make it through school. It&#39;s just too oppressive and compartmentalized when knowledge is exactly the opposite. It&#39;s my belief that it&#39;s all intentional. I spent 6 years in prison, I met so many brilliant minds in there- it really allowed me to see how convoluted our society is.</p>

<p>Anyhow:</p>

<p>The Frankfurt School was literally housed at Columbia University, and this is where Critical Theory was born. Critical Theory examines negativity, and it&#39;s effects and outcomes (especially how it can form desirable outcomes with regard to cultural hegemony). A good example of this would be the Drug War: Critical Theory would examine what good has come of it. &#39;Good&#39; not in the sense of meaningless propaganda like, &#39;drugs r bad, mm kay&#39;, but the genuine, real good that comes from negativity. For example, Critical Theory might come to the conclusion that the Drug War has helped create more awareness of cultural hegemony, class structure, bigotry, etc. You don&#39;t need to think on it very long or hard to see how it could be one of the most dangerous fields of study ever created. It comes up with stupid theories like: from chaos, assimilation, from assimilation, harmony.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also some of the most exhausting stuff in the world to study, so no one is doing it, except for the people who have figured out how to use it to their advantage. It&#39;s essentially the study of manipulation of societies- though I&#39;m certain people would disagree with my assertion. One mans theory, might just be someone elses framework. Take the following:</p>

<p>&quot;Note that critical is not meant to indicate a theory that
examines only the negative. Critical theories seek to reveal
the contradictions, social inequalities, and dominances; to
this extent they can be called negative. However, it might be
more accurate to say that because critical theories run contrary
to that which oppresses people, the theories usually are
positive and hopeful.&quot; <a href="https://www.aect.org/edtech/ed1/pdf/09.pdf">source</a></p>

<p>This is the exact theory that birthed the Drug War. The whole problem with it? <strong>What if they&#39;re wrong?</strong></p>

<p>Now, trust me, I realize this is incredibly hard to swallow, and that, frankly, you won&#39;t be able to swallow it, but please, at least keep what I&#39;m telling you at the forefront of your mind as you go about your daily business, and you will eventually have the awareness to see it being practiced right in front of you. Once you understand that this is all true, it&#39;s both the most liberating yet horrible realization you can possibly come to. It&#39;s like being born again. It&#39;s like being Neo in The Matrix and swallowing the red pill (I hate the similarities this shares with the alt right, because they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on either). Lastly, never stop studying, but pay little attention to that which you want to hear, and listen to everything which you don&#39;t want to hear, therein lies the truth and why people seldom arrive at it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a human being that judges ideas individually on their merits, on a case by case basis, as I&#39;d hope more people would aim to be. Self labeling with isms and ists is inherently dogmatic.</p>

<p>If I believe in anything I believe in the power of good will and genuine acts of selfless love to heal the wounds and scars of hatred and violence. I believe in good thoughts, good words, and good acts-in a balance between the needs of the individual and the collective, between chaos and order, freedom and duty. I believe in genuinely considering all things and listening to each other with open minds and hearts as we playfully wander through life in pursuit of truth.</p>

<p>In my eyes, on a socioeconomic level, that means pragmatically finding a place between ideal capitalism and our presently mixed economy that checks the market and the state off each other, and from there we may have the freedom to decide how we will prepare humanity culturally and economically for the unprecedented advances that are as likely to destroy us as save us. It&#39;s a monumental task before us, and I don&#39;t see how we can avoid things like collectivizing parts of our economy. I don&#39;t see how we will possibly justify or even survive in the future without at least guaranteeing to all people the bare necessities of life such as clean food, water, and air-shelter, and basic utilities like running water and electricity the world over. At some point we will be so technologically advanced that there would not only be no reason to not guarantee these things-it may be necessary in order to continue evolving. We&#39;re faced with technological innovations in the near future that will reshape humanity forever. We are completely unprepared, and as far as I see it, achieving the ideals of communism through the state is an impossibility. Some form of communism/collectivization is inevitable-to some varying degree. We should be preparing to arrive there in a balanced way that checks and balances the power of our existing institutions and power structures.</p>

<p>Here we have something that approaches coherency.  On the claim that they teach Marxist economics, this is just factually wrong.  What dominates is neo-classical economics all the broader framework of a commitment to neo-liberalism. In fact anyone that strays from this orthodoxy faces negative pressures. </p>

<p>Here is an interview Richard Wolff does ( a Marxist following Sweeny) with an economist who dared to teach heterodox economics, and was retaliated against from his economics department. </p>

<p>Concerning where cultural Marxism came from.  It comes from paleoconservative writters which appropriated writings the Nazi&#39;s did  concerning cultural Bolshevism.  It has nothing to do with culture, Marxists or Marxists writing about culture. </p>

<p>Marxism is the Hegelian Dialectic applied to Western capitalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have this backwards.  The &#39;hegelian dialectic&#39; is an account that is provided of how a capitalist society is a product of rational development historically.  Hegel claimed that a market economy with a set of institutions is rational endpoint of development that provides rational to antagonism.  Marx  criticized Hegel on the point that social antagonism are solved, rather he accused hegel and political economists of obscuring it, but praised hegel for capturing the historical development towards this society in the abstract. </p>

<p>Let me make it clear. Marx was a critic of the dialectic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it could be summed up, it would be: from chaos, assimilation, from assimilation, &quot;harmony&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well this is a sting of words that are not connected to each other.  What Hegel and his milieu argued was that there was a form of society where individuals did not see themselves are standing against their political institutions.   Too use your words there was harmony.  This did not last and was fragmented, and people started to see themselves as separate from nature and from their political institutions.  Perhaps this would be characterized by chaos, although it is very inaccurate.   What Hegel wanted to do is provide an account that this separation was overcome both in modern institutions and in his philosophy.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Projection bias, who&#39;s more likely to see something, the person unwittingly instituting it&#39;s policies, misconceptions and norms, or the person railing against it?</p>

<p>You have to know something about what you are analyzing.  You don&#39;t. You make basic reasoning errors, and refuse to actually engage in what is offered.   The best advice would be is go to a good university library, and read some introductory texts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What are these classes? These are the working class and capitalist classes. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I disagree- these are the &#39;houseless&#39;, poor, middle-class, wealthy and elite. With sub-classes in between. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot; These are the working class and capitalist classes. In a capitalist system you either own productive materials/resources/tools/land (which is capital), or you do not and survive by renting your labor to another for their profit.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re talking to someone who is inspired by small businesses on a regular basis- I see people break through their class, and into another, on a regular basis. Even in this horrible economy which the elite have literally consciously ruined, whether you agree with their intent, or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m a do it yourself kind of guy- I fix things when they&#39;re broke, even disposable shit, and I see a million opportunities for good ideas, especially in the computer sciences. I see a million opportunities to make money. However, it won&#39;t happen through wage labor, but that can be a stepping stone. I told this same thing to another fellow like yourself.</p>

<p>He thought I delusional, and I still don&#39;t understand his position. I laid in bed thinking about it last night, and I can not relate.</p>

<p>Are you seriously someone who doesn&#39;t have the American dream?</p>

<p>I&#39;m 39 years old. Perhaps all you younger people think it&#39;s dead, hey? That&#39;s a scary thought for us old folks.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard you address the many Constitutional issues this matter produces, though others have offered sarcasm- &quot;long live the king&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m more of a rebel that you guys will ever be.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, you don&#39;t know what it means any more- the idea has literally been turned on it&#39;s head.</p>

<p>&quot;So. My question to you is, what happens to the working class if and when this sale of labor is no longer necessary?&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>This doesn&#39;t happen overnight, it&#39;s been happening, it&#39;s one of the root causes of class struggle. We&#39;re told it&#39;s because of shipping jobs overseas (to inflame class struggle and a division), but what about the millions of jobs <em>we</em> take form other countries? Furthermore, as I&#39;ve already stated, socialism will happen naturally, AND we&#39;ll get to keep our Constitution if we don&#39;t do anything drastic- but I see no possible way to build general consensus. Doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t try.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don&#39;t you realize &#39;They&#39;re&#39; going to get rid of the Constitution BEFORE this magical socialism is introduced? This is what they have to do to force everyone to works towards a common goal, which in all likelihood will be incredibly menial tasks. </p>

<p>&quot;Why do you think that this has absolutely nothing to do with the conspiracies you see? Why do you not acknowledge the possibility of a capitalist conspiracy (especially in light of all these other capitalist conspiracies i.e. what I&#39;ve mentioned regarding the CIA), or its potential influence on these events you perceive? &quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The CIA killed JFK for breaking his oath to whatever the name of the secret society is that he belonged to. Whoever they are, they are connected to Karl Marx, the Russians, The French Illuminati, Masons...</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, why don&#39;t you think secret societies have the potential to alter world events?</strong></p>

<p>I will not live in a world in which some fake Jewish people, who are actually the ancient Khazarian Mafia, not only have more than me, but get to rule over me in some sort of socialist dictatorship without the basic lawful protections of the Constitution. They are literally attempting to take us back to 1700&#39;s Europe. I have more disdain for this group of people than any other on the planet. And no, they are not &quot;semites&quot;.</p>

<p>Look, if they want to make this a workable process, they need to tell everyone about it, and not institute it behind our backs through the disgusting manipulation of the negative sciences. You&#39;re a joke if you think they don&#39;t know about this process. You&#39;re a joke if you don&#39;t think they spend their days trying to accelerate the process. It&#39;s quite literally their hobby. They have a million think tanks that doing nothing but sit around dreaming about Marxism.</p>

<p>Not only have these elite families seen this coming, and prepared for it, they have allowed their twisted sense of logic to make it happen.</p>

<p>Tell them I said- get cancer, and die. I will not live under them, ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just imagine Startrek, yet, with constitutional protection. Do you not see that if we keep the Constitution alive, we will all one day be gods?</p>

<p>We are naturally moving into a socialist system- I&#39;m sure you can agree with this?</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t we allow the process to happen naturally? If we move into socialism naturally, and at a natural pace, with automation, we will eventually have a lot of free time, and all the lawful protections provided by the Constitution. This is what &#39;They&#39;re&#39; trying to prevent. The idea of the masses having nothing but free time AND having Bill of Rights protections literally scares the elite to death.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how we will possibly justify or even survive in the future without at least guaranteeing to all people the bare necessities of life such as clean food, water, and air-shelter, and basic utilities like running water and electricity the world over.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Agreed. I&#39;m just worried that people are more interested in change than a solid framework. The reason this worries me is because they can change the goal posts right before we score. It&#39;s kind of like an open ended argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would also say that a capitalist works against capitalism. I like the term capitalism-ist :)</p>
