       Do you think the recent violence at marches and the sudden more urgent need to remove historical statues is an agenda being pushed by the govt or a powerful group or is it legit grassroots movement? I ask because as a Jew i do NOT want Hitler erased at all. I get we dont have Hitler statues up here but i guess my sentiment is about not erasing history or it helps it repeat itself. Opinions?

       Basically the confederacy should have never been allowed to put up those statues. They lost and are part of the country who defeated them. No participation trophies in war. We can all read about how they got their white supremacist asses kicked in the civil war and don't need monuments to their leaders.

       It wasn't the "Confederacy" that put up those statues. The Confederacy no longer existed when the statues and monuments were put up. The majority of them were put up by state governments, local governments, and private citizens during the Jim Crow era.

       Many of the Confederate soldiers who died were not "white supremacists"; nor were they slave owners. They were foreigners who were forced to join the Confederacy after they immigrated to the South to work on Southern farms before the war began. Some of them spoke little, or no English. This is also true of the North. Many Union soldiers were foreigners who were grabbed off of the ships as soon as they came into dock with the newly arrived immigrants. Can you imagine, moving to a new land with hopes and dreams for you and your family, only to end up six weeks later on a battlefield with a bullet in your head, and you had no clue as to why you were involved in this war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, take down the monuments of the Confederate leaders who wanted a war with the North. But, take down the leaders of the North, who also wanted a war, and that includes Abraham Lincoln. There should be no monuments to any warmongers.

       They were also poor ass white ppl who were being shafted economically and agriculturally  by the glutinous north..oh what's that ? You mean there were other reasons more important to the south for going to war other than their slaves.. ? Tell me... When was the last time you saw a CEO join the army after the fact ?

       Plantation OWNERS never fought. Much like today they had to rely on uneducated  poor ppl who in their mind were fighting for justice.

       Its a major part of history, and many of those poor farmers who never  owned a slave in their life were not fighting for slavery, but for states' rights. As much as people want to make the Civil War only about slavery, it definitely wasn't.

       Easy bro, economic and agriculturally  were made the norths bitch. Amongst other things. Slavery wasn't even on the table of discussion both NORTH and SOUTH until the north decided to free the southern slaves to create internal turmoil years into the actual fucking war.

       You need so study the history of Federalism. You're clearly ignorant and relying on talking points you've heard, which causes you to believe in a vast oversimplification of the Civil War.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the fact that Hamilton, Jefferson, and Washington were already arguing over the scope and ruling authority of the US government in the 1790s when the issue of a national bank came up.  When the Civil War began to break out at the end of 1860 (and then began as an actual conflict in 1861), you have to remember that it wasn't because Lincoln had made a proclamation to free the slaves. Quite the opposite: Lincoln was aware of Southern discontent and their fear of forced emancipation, and he promised that he would do no such thing (again, this was in late-1860...things changed after secession, of course). The reason the Southern states broke off in 1860/61 was as a result of their expectation that Lincoln represented a strong Federal presence in the White House, and that he would use that Executive power to enact policies and laws that ran counter to the cultural climate south of the Mason Dixon. There was a definite perception that Lincoln was pro-abolition, and this certainly contributed to the secession sentiment, yet at the time (and primary sources of the day back this up) the states that broke off from the Union, and their representatives, claimed that they were doing it to protect their rights as autonomous states under no obligation to follow federal law they disagreed with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, states' rights was and still is a huge issue. And it has way more to do than with just slavery. Oversimplifications like yours are the product of a simple mind.

       Exactly. So for many people (and even for many within the government), the Civil War was not about slavery, but about a domineering and tyranical central government that they did not want to cede power to. Many people think this concept is worth fighting and dying for, and I for one respect those who did fight for that concept, and not for slavery.

       As someone from the South (NC) who had multiple ancestors on both sides, so do I. I have a lot of conflicted feelings about this issue.
I tear up when Levon Helm sings "The night they drove old Dixie down", I love The Lion of Atlanta statue in the confederate section of the cemetery. Cut me and I bleed sweet tea.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't change the fact that most of the statues were erected as message to 'uppity' blacks and people who sympathized with them. They were erected with the same mindset that revived the confederate flag in the 50s. Even Robert E. Lee spoke against putting up monuments to the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, it seems like a lot of effort and expense that might be better spent elsewhere.

       The point of the statues isn't to look at them and think "what an asshole, better not do slavery again." The point of the statues is to honor a person. That's why lots of these confederate statues were erected during the segregation era. It's stupid that there are still so many of them. If you want to read up on our history then we have museums and books for that stuff.

       Honestly i see no reason why some in congress and some deep state folks want war with them at all.. there not one reason to still hate russia. We should be an ally to them. Iran was an ally to we gave the shah asylum. That was none of our business. We arent the fucking world police but we have been since the fucking 40's.

       As a contrarian view, I actually appreciate the US being world police. Before the 40s, the world was a very warring place. Countries continuously fought throughout the world. After the US became a superpower after WW2, borders practically froze. There are still wars, but not nearly as many since territory isn't acquired as easily. The US enforces this while itself being light on the territory grabbing, a sentiment not shared by other countries.

       Man i see some points on that but we seem to arm people then fight them. Then re-arm them. Then fight them again. Like yemen. Thats basically iran and saudi fighting a proxy war to test what would happen if they really fought. Syria is ALL about oil.

       I think Syria is about much more then oil. Especially from the Russian perspective, this is also a very diplomatic sensitive point. Besides having its Mediterranean fleet base in Tartus, Syria, it's also one of the few countries with good relations. They share a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation which includes military activities. Syria is very important strategically for location to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Syria is important to Europe and the US. For Europe, it borders turkey which has an application to the EU and is a major road of immigration. For the US, Syria borders Iraq and the Levant, which the US has deep interests in stabilizing to protect democratic principles in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly with oil remaining in the hands of locals and warlords and the US being the worlds #1 oil producer, I do not subscribe to oil being all important in the conflict.

       i think the idea is that if trump is impeached obama style globalism can resume and we will all get along. i don't think people realize the borrowed time was not sustainable (how long really can you run trillion dollar deficits and give free money to those with access to zirp?) anyhow, there seems to be a false assumption that the next war will be nuclear or cyber and this IRL 'facing' doesn't apply

       It makes no sense though. Antifa doesnt like Trump or the first amendment. So without a 1st amendment that means govt decides what is free speech. And that means since repubs hold the WH,senate,house,supreme court, they literally want Trump to decide whats free speech. Its bass ackwards. Berkeley the so called birthplace of free speech now wants govt regulated speech.

       It makes sense if you are psychopath and want to stage all this "ack!! Pending Civil War!! Mean BLM!! Nazis everywhere!!!" bs to get a 2/3 population to say, "you know what, fuck it. I don't want war. Go ahead and erode my rights a little" as a good faith compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB can't afford to have us in a civil war- they need as work running the machine. They want us to
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       a civil war so that we will
       <em>
        voluntarily
       </em>
       give up our rights to avoid a civil war.

         Anti-Defamation League Asks For Help From Social Media to Combat Cyberhate
        </strong>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       ADL calls on newer social media channels to join effort with industry leaders to combat cyberhate.Three tech companies endorse ADL Best Practices for Countering Hate Speech Online.
      </p>
      <p>
       New York, NY (March 10, 2016) - Three growing social media platforms used by more than 150 million people worldwide are the latest to join forces with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in encouraging greater efforts to curb online hate speech and harassment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The social media companies ASK.fm, Quizlet and Whisper and have each endorsed ADL's Best Practices for Responding to Cyberhate, which guides the best known Internet companies' response to online hate speech and serves as a foundational piece for collaboration between industry and non-industry experts like ADL. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SoundCloud, Twitter, Yahoo and YouTube previously endorsed ADL's Best Practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       [...]
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fighting cyberhate has never been more critical, but we cannot go it alone," said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.
       <strong>
        "It takes a community to stand together to counter online harassment. Only with an all-hands-on-deck approach will we be able to confront cyberhate and protect the free flow of ideas which lies at the core of the Internet.
       </strong>
       We applaud ASK.fm, Quizlet and Whisper for their leadership in standing up against hate."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ADL's Best Practices provide guidance to companies when their platforms are used to transmit anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic, misogynist, xenophobic or other forms of hate, prejudice and bigotry.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The major social media companies have made substantial progress in their response to cyberhate over the past several years," said Deborah M. Lauter, ADL Senior Vice President of Policy and Programs. "But there are new battlefronts opening up constantly that we need to address, particularly newer, smaller social media platforms.
       <strong>
        We need to stop the bullies, extremists and haters from exploiting those platforms as well."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Said Nona Farahnik, Director, Trust &amp; Safety at Whisper: "Whisper believes that all digital platforms maintain a fundamental responsibility to proactively mitigate online hate and bullying. We take every effort to combat cyberhate on our platform, with a hybrid community safety operation that includes both robust human and advanced technical moderation systems.
       <strong>
        We are grateful that the ADL is leading the charge against cyberhate by developing and articulating best practices in the space."

       Just as not having Hitler statues up everywhere doesn't erase Hitler, not having statues up of racists doesn't erase racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not erasing racism and the history of it by making sure and taking down statues that commemorate and glorify the racism.  It's
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       that's being taken down - its commemoration and glorification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism can be acknowledged without, again, being commemorated and glorified.

       TPTB make it a point to foment dissent.  The masses, unfortunately, appear to be significantly impressionable.  TPTB exploit this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been racist.  The statues of those figures didn't somehow suddenly "turn racist".  They've always
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       racist.  It's just that, again, TPTB (whoever/whatever they may be at this point) are fomenting dissent and finding ways to pit "this" idiot group against "that" idiot group.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, racism and prejudice of any kind should not exist and take place.  As such, I feel it's a good thing to fight against racists.  However, the manner that that fight is being exploited and taken advantage of by certain groups lends itself more toward the masses simply fighting against each other rather than fighting against hatred, bigotry, ignorance, and racism - which is what the fight
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be against.

       They were also poor ass white ppl who were being shafted economically and agriculturally  by the glutinous north..oh what's that ? You mean there were other reasons more important to the south for going to war other than their slaves.. ? Tell me... When was the last time you saw a CEO join the army after the fact ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Plantation OWNERS never fought. Much like today they had to rely on uneducated  poor ppl who in their mind were fighting for justice.

       It makes sense if you are psychopath and want to stage all this "ack!! Pending Civil War!! Mean BLM!! Nazis everywhere!!!" bs to get a 2/3 population to say, "you know what, fuck it. I don't want war. Go ahead and erode my rights a little" as a good faith compromise.

       TPTB can't afford to have us in a civil war- they need as work running the machine. They want us to
       <em>
        fear
       </em>
       a civil war so that we will
       <em>
        voluntarily
       </em>
       give up our rights to avoid a civil war.
