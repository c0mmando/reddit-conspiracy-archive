<p>It wasn&#39;t the &quot;Confederacy&quot; that put up those statues. The Confederacy no longer existed when the statues and monuments were put up. The majority of them were put up by state governments, local governments, and private citizens during the Jim Crow era. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can all read about how they got their white supremacist asses kicked in the civil war </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of the Confederate soldiers who died were not &quot;white supremacists&quot;; nor were they slave owners. They were foreigners who were forced to join the Confederacy after they immigrated to the South to work on Southern farms before the war began. Some of them spoke little, or no English. This is also true of the North. Many Union soldiers were foreigners who were grabbed off of the ships as soon as they came into dock with the newly arrived immigrants. Can you imagine, moving to a new land with hopes and dreams for you and your family, only to end up six weeks later on a battlefield with a bullet in your head, and you had no clue as to why you were involved in this war?</p>

<p>Yes, take down the monuments of the Confederate leaders who wanted a war with the North. But, take down the leaders of the North, who also wanted a war, and that includes Abraham Lincoln. There should be no monuments to any warmongers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need so study the history of Federalism. You&#39;re clearly ignorant and relying on talking points you&#39;ve heard, which causes you to believe in a vast oversimplification of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Consider the fact that Hamilton, Jefferson, and Washington were already arguing over the scope and ruling authority of the US government in the 1790s when the issue of a national bank came up.  When the Civil War began to break out at the end of 1860 (and then began as an actual conflict in 1861), you have to remember that it wasn&#39;t because Lincoln had made a proclamation to free the slaves. Quite the opposite: Lincoln was aware of Southern discontent and their fear of forced emancipation, and he promised that he would do no such thing (again, this was in late-1860...things changed after secession, of course). The reason the Southern states broke off in 1860/61 was as a result of their expectation that Lincoln represented a strong Federal presence in the White House, and that he would use that Executive power to enact policies and laws that ran counter to the cultural climate south of the Mason Dixon. There was a definite perception that Lincoln was pro-abolition, and this certainly contributed to the secession sentiment, yet at the time (and primary sources of the day back this up) the states that broke off from the Union, and their representatives, claimed that they were doing it to protect their rights as autonomous states under no obligation to follow federal law they disagreed with.</p>

<p>So basically, states&#39; rights was and still is a huge issue. And it has way more to do than with just slavery. Oversimplifications like yours are the product of a simple mind.</p>

<p>Exactly. So for many people (and even for many within the government), the Civil War was not about slavery, but about a domineering and tyranical central government that they did not want to cede power to. Many people think this concept is worth fighting and dying for, and I for one respect those who did fight for that concept, and not for slavery.</p>

<p>As someone from the South (NC) who had multiple ancestors on both sides, so do I. I have a lot of conflicted feelings about this issue.
I tear up when Levon Helm sings &quot;The night they drove old Dixie down&quot;, I love The Lion of Atlanta statue in the confederate section of the cemetery. Cut me and I bleed sweet tea.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t change the fact that most of the statues were erected as message to &#39;uppity&#39; blacks and people who sympathized with them. They were erected with the same mindset that revived the confederate flag in the 50s. Even Robert E. Lee spoke against putting up monuments to the war.</p>

<p>At the same time, it seems like a lot of effort and expense that might be better spent elsewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a contrarian view, I actually appreciate the US being world police. Before the 40s, the world was a very warring place. Countries continuously fought throughout the world. After the US became a superpower after WW2, borders practically froze. There are still wars, but not nearly as many since territory isn&#39;t acquired as easily. The US enforces this while itself being light on the territory grabbing, a sentiment not shared by other countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Syria is about much more then oil. Especially from the Russian perspective, this is also a very diplomatic sensitive point. Besides having its Mediterranean fleet base in Tartus, Syria, it&#39;s also one of the few countries with good relations. They share a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation which includes military activities. Syria is very important strategically for location to Russia.</p>

<p>Similarly, Syria is important to Europe and the US. For Europe, it borders turkey which has an application to the EU and is a major road of immigration. For the US, Syria borders Iraq and the Levant, which the US has deep interests in stabilizing to protect democratic principles in the region.</p>

<p>Frankly with oil remaining in the hands of locals and warlords and the US being the worlds #1 oil producer, I do not subscribe to oil being all important in the conflict.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes no sense though. Antifa doesnt like Trump or the first amendment. So without a 1st amendment that means govt decides what is free speech. And that means since repubs hold the WH,senate,house,supreme court, they literally want Trump to decide whats free speech. Its bass ackwards. Berkeley the so called birthplace of free speech now wants govt regulated speech. </p>

<hr/>

<p>ADL calls on newer social media channels to join effort with industry leaders to combat cyberhate.Three tech companies endorse ADL Best Practices for Countering Hate Speech Online. </p>

<p>New York, NY (March 10, 2016) - Three growing social media platforms used by more than 150 million people worldwide are the latest to join forces with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in encouraging greater efforts to curb online hate speech and harassment.</p>

<p>The social media companies ASK.fm, Quizlet and Whisper and have each endorsed ADL&#39;s Best Practices for Responding to Cyberhate, which guides the best known Internet companies&#39; response to online hate speech and serves as a foundational piece for collaboration between industry and non-industry experts like ADL. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SoundCloud, Twitter, Yahoo and YouTube previously endorsed ADL&#39;s Best Practices.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>&quot;Fighting cyberhate has never been more critical, but we cannot go it alone,&quot; said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. <strong>&quot;It takes a community to stand together to counter online harassment. Only with an all-hands-on-deck approach will we be able to confront cyberhate and protect the free flow of ideas which lies at the core of the Internet.</strong> We applaud ASK.fm, Quizlet and Whisper for their leadership in standing up against hate.&quot;   </p>

<p><strong>ADL&#39;s Best Practices provide guidance to companies when their platforms are used to transmit anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic, misogynist, xenophobic or other forms of hate, prejudice and bigotry.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The major social media companies have made substantial progress in their response to cyberhate over the past several years,&quot; said Deborah M. Lauter, ADL Senior Vice President of Policy and Programs. &quot;But there are new battlefronts opening up constantly that we need to address, particularly newer, smaller social media platforms. <strong>We need to stop the bullies, extremists and haters from exploiting those platforms as well.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Said Nona Farahnik, Director, Trust &amp; Safety at Whisper: &quot;Whisper believes that all digital platforms maintain a fundamental responsibility to proactively mitigate online hate and bullying. We take every effort to combat cyberhate on our platform, with a hybrid community safety operation that includes both robust human and advanced technical moderation systems. <strong>We are grateful that the ADL is leading the charge against cyberhate by developing and articulating best practices in the space.&quot;</strong>  </p>

<p>You&#39;re not erasing racism and the history of it by making sure and taking down statues that commemorate and glorify the racism.  It&#39;s <em>that</em> that&#39;s being taken down - its commemoration and glorification.</p>

<p>Racism can be acknowledged without, again, being commemorated and glorified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB make it a point to foment dissent.  The masses, unfortunately, appear to be significantly impressionable.  TPTB exploit this.</p>

<p>I mean it&#39;s <em>always</em> been racist.  The statues of those figures didn&#39;t somehow suddenly &quot;turn racist&quot;.  They&#39;ve always <em>been</em> racist.  It&#39;s just that, again, TPTB (whoever/whatever they may be at this point) are fomenting dissent and finding ways to pit &quot;this&quot; idiot group against &quot;that&quot; idiot group.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, racism and prejudice of any kind should not exist and take place.  As such, I feel it&#39;s a good thing to fight against racists.  However, the manner that that fight is being exploited and taken advantage of by certain groups lends itself more toward the masses simply fighting against each other rather than fighting against hatred, bigotry, ignorance, and racism - which is what the fight <em>should</em> be against.</p>
