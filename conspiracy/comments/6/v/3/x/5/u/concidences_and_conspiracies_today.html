    <div class="md"><p>Anything less than 10% is pretty difficult to see. In fact &lt;4% is considered a new moon because it is so difficult to see at all. So yes from 10% to 0% back to 10% can take a couple days and be nearly impossible to find. If you look at moon charts you will notice that the percentage of illumination jumps significantly the further from full and new moon it get. That&#39;s why it takes a full day to go from 3% to 0% and also a full day to go from 42% to 52%. If the waning and waxing process was linear it would take much longer than roughly a month to complete a cycle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will be full again on Sept. 6th. Divide the phases of the moon by 16 days and that&#39;s a  6.25% change in the phase of the moon per day. Divide that by 24 hours, and that&#39;s .26% change per HOUR. The math shows it. I don&#39;t believe there is a parabola in the math like you say. It must be linear because it is in a tidally-locked orbit with us. Very resistant to change and flux</p>

<p>Just because you can divide things evenly doesn&#39;t mean that they progress linearly. Yes, the moon is in a locked orbit but you seeing the moon has to do with the interaction of spheres which alters the progression of illumination. </p>
