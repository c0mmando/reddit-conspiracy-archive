       From reading and researching it seems to me that the elites' plan is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last two decades (probably longer) they have been constructing vast underground cities in which they will ride out the impending cosmic cataclysm, or, a disaster of their own making that will reduce the population of the planet significantly. They will ride out the disaster in their well-equipped cities until such time as they can re-emerge to rebuild the planet in their image with superior technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: there may be more to it with them wanted digital transference of consciousness or whatever else they think up, but above seems to be the meat of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I see wrong with their 'plan':
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the cosmic cataclysm is significant enough, and I think it is, I don't feel underground bunkers will be enough to survive it. A whole number of geological factors would contribute to the integrity of these things being unreliable at best. Shit, that Yellowstone volcano will apparently wipe half the States off the globe, can't imagine being underground anywhere near it is going to help. Furthermore how do they know that it will even be something that they can 'ride out'. Could be Mars all over again and just kill the planet.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How are they going to adapt without the classism their whole power base and social identity is based on? Without the rest of us they are no longer the 'elite' they are just humanity. The thing they seem to hate. Where are they going to get their huge reservoir of people to fuck, boss around, etc? How are they going to live around and stand one another? Their whole service to self mentality doesn't seem to work well when you have to play with others. I'm sure some of these people are among the most unpleasant beings on the planet. How are they going to deal being couped up in an underground city for centuries? How does the hierarchy work? Who is in charge? Who are the new serfs? Once they are in there for a week I feel like it'll turn to shit real quick.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What makes them think they have been told everything by their superiors? Whoever is higher up, be it interdimensional self serving beings, advanced aliens, Atlantian descendents, even richer people, whoever the fuck it is. What makes them think 'these guys don't give a fuck about literally any other being, it's kinda their thing, but they totally have my back because I helped them do whatever'. Seriously guys? What makes them think this plan of theirs isn't anything more then a way to tie up the loose end that is them? What they'll get a ticket off world to become part of the gang?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think these people are just as fucked as the rest of us, but of course if they knew that they'd also try save their asses, so all these grand plans of theirs to me seem like a way to keep them inline before the big crack comes. For them to 'ascend' in the way I understand it to be, the entire human race would have to be as self serving as them and while people are generally pretty selfish these days, I don't believe they are to the extent that it polarises the greater consciousness of the planet. What does everyone think? I feel like the notion of 'oh yeah these beings are going to kill off the whole species except for us cause they think we're totally cool' is the most comically naive thing I've ever heard.

       Who knows what the hell is really going on. They could be elite bankers being controlled by Reptilians or aliens for all we know, or just an old lineage of secret societies working together for hundreds if not thousands of years and slowly are piecing together their plans and putting them to action to get a one world order, or anything in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the end game goes I always wonder that myself. Are they trying to grow their technology in secret behind closed doors until they have it perfected enough to live like Gods or to live great, and to be able to expand the technology AFTER they kill us all off?
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep hearing about the underground cities and bunkers, if they are building these then is it themselves they want to protect from the giant kill off, or is it their kin? We all keep waiting to see if there is going to be a giant end game kill plan, but is that really going to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about their power structure. What happens to their entire power structure, economic structure, and all the fear they produce when they kill everyone off? Will they be saving the ~500 million (GGS) people who don't die to feed fear from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk, I keep hearing about their end game kill plan, blue beam, fake aliens, one world government, I just keep asking myself when and how? The ultimate two questions. Maybe a better one is if? Plans change, perhaps they are not going to do a major kill off?

       Reptilian are demons. The endgame is a fake alien invasion after they destroy our economy and food sources so we give them control willingly which is how they plan to get permission from us to take outer souls.

       I get the feeling that they don't need permission to 'take our souls', but rather that they're part of our souls and have been forever.

       You think demons are part of our souls? Why? Just because they can possess us if we are cursed it if we do drugs or meditate doesn't prove that they are with us from birth? Although sexually abused children can be passed or get a demon teaches to them that way allegedly. I guess you have to see the effect of Jesus' name on them to understand the big picture. They flee like roaches after the light gets turned in.

       It's too late for that. The progress has already been made. Think of all the toxic, industrial chemicals being produced
       <em>
        every single day
       </em>
       . It's been going on for decades. Once a chemical is produced, it's released into the environment. It may be contained in a shitty plastic container but that won't hold it forever. All of these toxic substances are going to be the end of us (including the ones injected and swallowed into our bodies). It kills two birds with one stone too because not only does it cause disease but also infertility.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what depopulation is. We're living in it and we're contributing to it. It's a slow and gradual buildup toward complete environmental toxicity. After that's done, whoever or whatever alien fucks can come in and take the planet for themselves.

       You bring up some excellent points man. Also, I always wonder where they will get raw materials from, like metals and rare earths? Mining takes up a ton of space and it messy. And what about heavy industry? This isn't a major point, just what I always wonder about.

       Corey Goode says Earth is like a honeycomb, with all sorts of interconnecting caverns and passages. Some of these are found in national parks and jealously guarded by ETs living underground or feral creatures close to the surface. Think about the premise of having a government-protected area of just some rocks and trees – it's because the government doesn't want plebs to wander in there and start leveling and paving shit, leading to an open conflict with (and disclosure of) ETs.

       Gnosticism is about to bite them in the dick. All of the Antediluvian tech they've discovered probably can't be utilized by any of them. In ruling the planet, they've angered the earth herself--Sophia. When a catalysm occurs, it will not destroy us--it will empower those who are worthy of ruling.

       Great thread with great points.  I'd have to assume as they have so much money, they can hire the best minds to come up with the statistically best chance at surviving.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if they are being advised from some greater power, I hope it isn't an evil power is evil hidden intentions.

       There's a reason many of upper echelon of the elite circle are satanist. They draw from the dark powers. They hired scientists to study the supernatural laws and physics and have found out a lot about the spiritual realm.

       Also, if they're holed up underground for years on end, psychologically they won't do well, but also physically. They'll need to have plans in place to avoid developing diseases such as rickets.

       You think they could build cities literally miles underground but not install full-spectrum lighting? When you are siphoning off the collective wealth of an entire planet, you can build some pretty damned convincing artificial greenspaces.

       They are not planning on destroying the planet or any part of it. In fact, they probably realise that as a whole humanity doesn't care about ruining the place where they live, (and most humans really are just too stupid to see the consequences of their actions  involving plastic particles, use of cars etc) so they have decided to kill a HUGE part of us to have the planet for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just got lucky being born in those families.
If you were sharing a house with someone and they didn't care about polluting it, poisoning the water and the air etc, you'd probably kick them out too.
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably intend to use AI technology along with drones and lethal weapons the thin us out. Or let leash neutron bombs to make us disappear but keep infrastructure intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course , this could just be a paranoid delusion, I'm willing to believe anything.

       Keep in mind that the Elite is extremely arrogant. They have been provided with glimpses of technology that makes them feel on top of the world. But, their toys might just become completely obsolete as our planet is getting hit with waves and waves of what I call "The Great Leveling".
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, every technology has an equivalent in mind waves, except that you need either someone with pure heart (a saint) or a group understanding of the desired result to pull it off. The reason why elite adores technology so much is that it allows them to basically delay any karma and be as evil as they wish while still having the perks of being enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all this emotional enrichment we're experiencing and the unveiling of bombastic secrets that have been closely guarded for millennia, we're about to become "elite" too, except without any associated arrogance that comes with keeping secrets. We'll become equally matched and able to turn the course of humanity towards good.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if these robber barons exploited the nature and plebs for maximum gain if we arrive at a mutual understanding that allows us to, for example, effect mass healing or materialization of necessary goods. Think about how useless their trillions of dollars will be as they're cooped up in missile silos, at each other's throats; we'll be right in the middle of the happening, changing the world for the better.

       It's too bad though because they already toxified all the land with oil pipelines and chemtrails and whatever else you can think of. It may be too late to turn it around. Your idea is a nice one but I think it's unlikely.

       As a psychic-in-training, one thing that I've noticed is that in order to to access these strange powers, it requires one to 'open their heart' – the 'heart chakra' needs to be 'open' because it's 'through' there that the perceptions are received. The feeling is one of great empathy, which isn't possible for 'evil' people, i.e., those who act in ways that make for a very unpleasant experience when one's empathy is functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like this, because it's like a self-limiting effect wherein evil limits power, and that's why, I think, evil still skulks in the shadows even though it features so constitutively on the nightly news.

       I don't think the elites have a plan at all. They're simply mintaining their power and pulling strings out of the sheer thrill of it. I believe there's definitely an elite class who conduct mass social experiments on a global scale, but this idea that they're all preparing for the apocalypse so they can rise again and ascend to their next form is just bullshit quackery.

       They have hierarchies, man - they're an entire social structure and culture within their own. THEY have an "elite" among them. Part of their religion dictates that, so, your speculation is just all off.

       The top of the illuminati pyramid are all generational luciferians. The endgame is a fake alien invasion after they destroy our economy and food sources so we give them control willingly which is how they plan to get permission from us to take outer souls.

       I think they're factions have splintered and that's why we're seeing the Deep State exposed because they're essentially at war with themselves. They are the most mentally ill on the planet and have the most power, each of them wants to be on the top because it's a back stabbing game of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have decided to jump ship in the hopes that they can redeem themselves in the eyes of humanity but for those whose crimes are too large to ever ask forgiveness they only know one way and will continue down that dark and dangerous path.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hopes are that they will expose themselves enough and humanity will start taking it's power back. It is happening but we need it to accelerate before one of these factions does something irreversible.

       You don't go about it; they come to you, then you've got to follow their path. I experienced early levels of grooming early in my TV/Hollywood/Advertising career --young women who'd quickly fall to their knees, world travel, invites to secret basement parties where drugs and sex were openly displayed and parlayed. But it ate at my soul pretty quick and I self-destructed in self-hate and changed my course. Not everybody goes that route.

       I don't think that they really care about surviving. I mean they're old as f already anyway. I think their whole piece of the pie is just their current "elite" life. They get to live as gods for a while until they die. They'll die before the earth is too toxic for humans to inhabit.

       But the elites doesn't consider one woke man to be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by God Emperor Trump has demonstrated a weakness in the city. It's a small thermal exhaust port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy city station. The target area is only two inches wide but I can bullseye a cumrag and I’m no longer than two inches.

       They can't kill us until they've got the robots thing down pat. But they may also just be waiting around for some global cataclysm--Yellowstone Caldera? Some other undersea volcano we don't know about? Giant meteor? Approaching planet? Sun blast?--and heading underground right before.

       Thing is, when they do that, they also become sitting ducks. If there really is a civil war going on inside the Deep State/Secret Societies/Illuminati, many of them know where the others keep their hideouts. What's to stop a couple plugged air vents? Or bunker buster bombs? Or full-on assault?
      </p>

       The biggest weakness of the elite is their arrogance. Look at the way that Skull and Bones asshole Munchkin's wife self-destructed on social media this week. Totally clueless. There are a lot like her...."Let them eat cake!"

       Okay, so what you are saying is that the plan which you theorise they have made is kinda stupid. This could mean one of two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your theory is correct, and the unimaginably powerful people who made this plan are somehow really stupid.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your theory is stupid.
        </p>
       </li>

       Well I know which of these conclusions looks more plausible and straightforward to me.

       You also forgot one important factor which is a bummer. When the so called "elite" emerge from their bunkers there will be a rump of people waiting for them. Those people will have a memory of what the world was like before they crawled out from under their rocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The remainers will want revenge for families relatives and loved ones lost in the cataclysm. There will be a terrible price to pay by the "elite" who will be in no position to bargain or offer reparations as the world would have:
      </p>
      <p>
       1] Moved on from where it was [ A changed world ]
2] A new agenda that does not include them
3] A new leadership in place both locally and globally
4] Developments in technology that they have no awareness of
5] Ongoing hatred for them and their machinations and their contribution to the cataclysm
