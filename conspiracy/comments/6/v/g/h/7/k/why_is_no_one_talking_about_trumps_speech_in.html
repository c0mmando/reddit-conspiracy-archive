    <div class="md"><p>Fuck Arpaio. The only reason his term lasted so long is because the fucking snowbirds and other elderly in Sun City West kept voting for him year after year. Most Phoenecians 50 and under have hated him and voted against him in every election for a long ass time. Enough old people died off that we were finally able to vote his ass out. </p>

<p>Do you live here? Ever hosted a work crew from one of Sheriff Joe&#39;s chain gangs? Did you see the mouldy bread and rotten baloney sandwiches he would send for the chain gang inmates to eat for lunch and wonder, &#39;shouldn&#39;t every human be afforded a basic standard of living, a modicum of human dignity, namely food that&#39;s not rotten&#39;? Do you think Joe&#39;s human rights violations made those prisoners better people when they got out of jail?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, do you live in Maricopa County, AZ? Have you followed local politics and the local controversies over Sheriff Joe for the past 20+ years? </p>

<p>Or do you just believe what you read in the conservative media?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they do.  Consider this, too.  When Trump became President, he had no fucking clue what he was getting himself into.  Same with Obama, or almost anybody.  The power structure is hidden, but it is peeled away as you acquire a higher office.  </p>

<p>I think that Bush Jr. and Bush Snr. knew because they grew up in it, and are CIA.  Hillary knew because she was FOTUS for eight years, but she fainted on the sidewalk.  Obama probably had a clue because he was a politician for many years, but he probably did not realize the extent of The Cabal.  </p>

<p>The people posting here don&#39;t consider that there are things they do not know, but Trump does.  </p>

<p>Of course, Trump could just be another evil human that screws kids and sacrifices them to Moloch.  We will see.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I mean.  Trump did not necessarily get the people he wanted, and I know why.  </p>

<p>It is the Bilderberg Group that decides who is appointed and who is not appointed.  The President, any President, has very little say in the matter.  People act like the President has absolute power to appoint his cabinet.  </p>

<p>When Obama first came into office, he was given a list of bankers to appoint to his administration.  The list was given to him by Citibank.  I suspect the same thing happened to Trump.  However, when you ask people, they will insist that Trump appointed Goldman Sachs bankers.  </p>

<p>Are you aware of the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations?  I cannot find a link between Trump and the Bilderberg Group or the Council on Foreign Relations.  </p>

<p>I was watching carefully after Trump won the election and I noticed he was being surrounded by New World Order globalists.  If Trump had absolute power to appoint his cabinet, he would have chosen Nationalists.  </p>

<p>Goes on a 20 minute rant about the media and Charlottesville, pulls out papers that he says are &quot;word for word&quot; how he slammed white supremacists etc. Conveniently omits the &quot;both sides&quot; quote.</p>

<p>All but calls out John Mcain over losing healthcare vote &quot;but I won&#39;t name names&quot;</p>

<p>Calls George Stephonopolus &quot;little George&quot;</p>

<p>Rants about jobs, tax cuts for business, building roads, democrats, etc  </p>

<p>Says he will shut down the govt to get &quot;my wall built&quot;</p>

The crowd is upset, and  D.C. using the MS media pointed the rage at Trump. The media does a damn good job at obscuring the truth and protecting the evil doers who pillage our futures. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn good? We must have been watching different speeches. </p>

<p>For the record, I live in Phx and voted for Trump. I was tempted to go to the rally tonight with a sign that read, &quot;I regret voting for you, Trump&quot;, or &quot;I wish I could take back my vote&quot;, but was afraid my toddler and I would have been gassed. ....Which we would have been.</p>

<p>I think, officially, the temperature went up by 10 degrees while Trump was speaking, attributed to all of the hot air he was spewing.</p>

<p>And, who the fuck campaigns for 2020, when they are only 6 months into their term and failing biggly to fulfill any of their campaign promises??  &quot;Drain the swamp!&quot;?? ...How&#39;s that working out for you?</p>

<p>Trump is a liar, a fraud, and a self serving narcissistic douche. I cannot comprehend the level of cognitive dissonance you have to employ at this point  to continue believing he has any intention of fulfilling his empty campaign promises. </p>
