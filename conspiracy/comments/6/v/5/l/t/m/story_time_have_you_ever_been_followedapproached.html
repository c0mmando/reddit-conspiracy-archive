      <p>
       Once, when I first started digging into 9/11 in about 2003 and had reached out to some families who were questioning the official story, including the "Jersey Widows," I was mowing the lawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived in a fairly ritzy, self-contained neighborhood, maybe 1000 people but only two ways in and out. People knew each other pretty well, not a lot of strangers. This older guy in a red cap that said NAVY on the front walked down the street and stood in front of my house while I mowed. He didn't move. Just stood there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm both brave and sometimes kinda stupid about shit like this, so I took it right to him. I shut off the lawnmower and started walking towards him. He started flapping his hand at me, like "No, no, that's okay, go away," but I kept coming. He started walking, not fast, but away from my house and I jogged up to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was maybe in his 50s, wearing aviator shades and had TERRIBLE skin. Don't recall the actual conversation, but it went something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <p>
       ME: Dude, what's up? Why you staring at me? Or is it my house? You wanna buy my house?
      </p>
      <p>
       DUDE: No, no. Just resting there for a second. I'll be moving on now.
      </p>
      <p>
       ME: Well you were standing there for a while. It was starting to make me think you were checking me out. Were you? What's with the NAVY cap?
      </p>
      <p>
       DUDE: It's just a cap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to engage him in more conversation--had he just moved to the neighborhood? What was he doing there? We didn't really see many strangers, etc., etc. Nothing he said made any impression on me, because I don't remember it. But he walked away and I never saw him again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe nothing to it. But he was standing there a long time, looking at me and my house as I mowed the lawn before I finally did something about it.

       My personal story is being followed by a yellow sedan that had a Washington DC license plate. The driver was wearing a secret service-like suit with dark sunglasses. I outsmarted him by running a red light and escaping.

       No problem. I've kept a very low profile since then, so I haven't encountered anyone else. On the home footage, I noticed a black SUV passing by several times, slowing down in front each time. Scared the shit out of me.

       In a comment in another thread, I was asked about my idea of a perfect society &amp; unbiased news. I described my book there as well. Here is what I wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
       (For background, the question was along of the lines of what would your perfect society be like)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well, I suppose that people would be more involved in stopping government tyranny. But, if this is my utopia, there wouldn't be government corruption. Actually, there wouldn't be a government at all. Instead of having one big country, we would have many small tribes (small towns per say.) Each tribe would be like a big family and they would get along with other tribes. There would be a modified version of communism in place (removing all of the negative parts). How it would work is that every tribe would get a proportion of money. With it, they would buy food, water shelter for their tribe. After a month, all of the money will be turned back in and redistributed (to avoid inflation).
       </p>
       <p>
        Centralized news wouldn't exist. Each tribe would receive the news from other tribes. Every day, each tribe would sit down for 1-3 hours listening to the news of each tribe, comparing them. If they find out a tribe is twisting the news, they will be tried in the court system (I have a lot of documentation written of how I'd restructure the court system, but I won't go into that now). If they are found guilty, they would be dumped at sea for god to judge them. Those who survive were clearly picked by god and will be welcomed back into the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be anonymously self-publishing a book in the next coming years called "Communistic Tribal Perfection For America And Europe". If the book is a success, I plan to write books on more systems tailored to other locations. There will be an encyclopedia version (complete guide) and a shorter version (Better for the layman and will have more of a chance to be an NYTimes best seller)

       My thoughts exactly... OP are you sure you just arnt extremely paranoid? Black or white seem to be more or less government vehicles but yellow? What makes your ideas so much more confrontational than everybody else's who also sees the government for what they have become that makes you an individual target? Has anyone in your family had any contact with anyone suspicious?

       Hey, seems like you're a little paranoid.  Not that it's crazy to be in this day and age.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a book I read "suspicious minds: how culture shapes madness."  It kind of helped me figure out some stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few more things: Your ideas about the system are not that out there.  Well, maybe to the average person, but not from the perspective of some theoretical government agency designated to stop revolutionary thought.  There are much more pressing revolutionary philosophies and organizations that have money, and are mobilized.  Even if there were something to be worried about in sharing those thoughts (which there almost certainly isn't), you'd be doing everyone a favor by shouting your ideas from the rooftops.  it will allow other people who think like you to speak more freely.  There's no point in living in fear of what you're allowed to say. Just say it.  If the world is so fucked that you're going to get hunted down just for sharing your philosophy, then go out with some honor instead of hiding who you are. It's probably not, though.  You might get fired if you call for the extermination of a race or the murder of a certain person, but other than that, you can pretty much say what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fear you feel is the fear of social isolation, which is not a consequence of government intervention, but of people disagreeing with the way that you present your ideas.  People can digest most ideas and still hang around you.  It's when you stop listening to them that they don't want to be around your ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, chronic is really really strong these days.  It is not to be fucked with lightly.

       Back in 2011, I had a Sun UltraSPARC computer in my garage running a squid proxy server. One day two suits showed up and took it. About 2 months later it was returned via UPS. I dismantled the server and threw it away.
