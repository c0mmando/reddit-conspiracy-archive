       the rothschilds otoh were quite brilliant and are renowned for their gathering of Private Intelligence (cough)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        His four brothers helped co-ordinate activates across the continent, and the family developed a network of agents, shippers, and couriers to transport gold and information across Europe. Nathan’s father assigned all of his brothers to each control banking in key areas across Europe. Nathan had England, and the others were: Germany, Austria, Naples, and France. Incredible what a few people are capable of huh? By their father's order, family members even intermarried with first and second cousins, keeping the company sealed tight against outsiders. At their height, the Rothschilds' wealth, if it had been pooled, would have been the largest single fortune in world history.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it gets even better than that. This private intelligence service enabled Nathan to receive in London the news that Napoleon lost at the Battle of Waterloo a full day ahead of the government’s official messengers. With this knowledge, Nathan decided to publicize false rumors that tricked the London Stock Exchange into believing that Napoleon had won. Nathan even start

       As you can see, David is the family asshole. Hes intensely afraid of overpopulation. Perhaps why he desires a "New World Order".

       Rockafellar was the most powerful man in the US and very evil. Rotchild is the most powerful and evil man in England and he runs the entire money system across the planet. He enslaved mankind using his money printing machines and by controlling the flow of money.

       The federal reserve is Rothschilds bank in the US and it is designed to leech off of America until it one day dies financially.

       You know that this isn't one person and that the original guy lived in the 1700's in Germany?  His 5 sons started banks in 5 countries. Today the families wealth is spread across something like 200 people.

       Everyone is dumb except you right? Money is meaningless because you can't take it with you? You say "their soul belongs to them"? What does that even mean? Something actually based in reality, like money, isn't power but a make believe fairy tale like a soul is what? Imortant somehow? Your statement about "their soul belongs to them" is vague. Are you implying the only thing that matters is an afterlife?

       its interesting that you figured out that the Rothschild's were behind the opium wars. I knew about both the Rothschild's and the Opium Wars, but never put them together until just recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       the CIA has a long history of smuggling drugs, like in Viet Nam and Columbia and Afghanistan. the CIA floods American cities with drugs like cocaine, meth, crack, LSD etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan produces 90% of the worlds opium supply
      </p>
      <p>
       in the year 2001, the Taliban in Afghanistan had successfully eradicated 90% of the opium crop
      </p>
      <p>
       by the end of 2001, the US military was occupying Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       in 2002, the Afghanistan opium production was higher than it was before, and higher than it had ever been
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan has been breaking opium production records every year since.
      </p>
      <p>
       US Marines are ordered to guard opium poppy fields, presumably because the local farmers need this crop or bad things might happen
      </p>
      <p>
       there is currently an opioid epidemic in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       the opioid epidemic is started when a doctor prescribes opioids to a patient long enough to get them hooked, then cuts them off, knowing they will just go find a junk dealer.
      </p>
      <p>
       what was the M.O. of the old opium wars? get people hooked by giving away a shipload of smack
      </p>
      <p>
       the new opium wars M.O. get people hooked by giving away prescriptions for pain killers
      </p>
      <p>
       a relative of mine related the story to me of how when he goes to the doctor, they always ask what prescriptions he is on, like they do everyone else... except for him, he says they are overly eager to write him a prescription, for things like pain killers, when the drug does not even treat what he is there to complain about.
      </p>
      <p>
       your doctor is the drug dealer they warned you about in school

       In order to buy-up a controlling interest in any going concern, be it oil, railways, or anything on the Robber Barons hit list, you need "Big Money".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild's were and are one of the primary sources of that. They don't care who the public "thinks" may own those giant industries with their huge profits, in fact, they prefer that they believe they are owned by someone else other than them while they prop them up and give them all the appearances of being that from the shadows.

       Humans from Earth cannot just "be" reptilians, as far as I'm aware, as reptilians are either from another planet or related to dinosaurs or both, depending on who you ask.  Jews are humans and humans descend mostly from primates from earth, last I looked.

       That link is like 1% factual (if even) and 99% made up propaganda.  Also, I do a lot of ufo-type reading and I have not heard of reptilians and humans, jews or otherwise, interbreeding.  In nature, if you take classes in science, different species can often mate physically but cannot produce offspring, or viable offspring, at least.  That is actually the scientific definition of "species".  Thus, Jews, blacks, whites, asians, etc, are all of the human species because they can mate and have children.  Monkeys and humans can perhaps mate but cannot produce humans, likewise with all other animals.

       The more you look into the families behind the Papal bloodlines throughout the years and the aristocrat bloodlines of the Black Nobility, the more you realize that these families have maintained control and power over humanity for the better part of the last 5-6000 years, at least.  These are the descendants of the ancient bloodlines of the most powerful families of the Venetians, Romans, Greeks, Babylonians, Assyrians, Phoenicians, and before them the Egyptians (and, it's been rumored, the Atlanteans).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds and Rockefellers are "new money", the  bougeoisie of the Elite that are the semi-public face and facade that control the money supply, but not the actual top dogs in world affairs.  Ultimately the power resides with the Black Nobility, who control the Jesuits and the Vatican.  Rothschilds are Rome/Vatican's Court Factor, the official Guardian of the Papal Treasury, and hofsjuden.  I recommend reading the posts of u/AhuwahZeus, he has extremely broad understanding of these topics that I can't really touch yet lol.

       Welcome.
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">

       After much study, I’ve come to the conclusion that much of what we see on TV or read in the newspapers and history books is fake and phony. We’re being manipulated and duped on a grand, almost unimaginable scale. Our thoughts and passions are being molded and orchestrated. It’s sort of like in the Matrix movies, except that instead of a computer simulation, our Matrix has been created by a group of living, breathing human beings using mass media as their primary tool. Waking up to this realization was psychologically difficult at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much of the world we think we live in is a sham, a conjob. But it’s not just mainstream or “consensus” reality: many if not most of the conspiracies we read about are either fake or filled with false leads and misdirection. Puncturing through consensus reality does not lead directly to the truth. Waiting for us on the other side of that membrane is a dizzying and disorienting fog of disinformation and misdirection. The mainstream lies are themselves wrapped inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies…
      </p>
      <p>
       You've punctured through a thick layer of lies and deception, but it would be a mistake to believe that everything on the other side of that membrane is true. Just the opposite. Most of it is just another swarm of lies, another layer of fog. TPTB do not want anyone to discover the truth about how this world works, and so they cover everything in a thick, suffocating layer of fog so it is nearly impossible for us to find our way to the truth. The vast majority of things you will read or watch on conspiracy sites (including Reddit) or conspiracy-related matters is disinfo and misdirection deliberately spread by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disinfo can be defined as information about some conspiracy-related topic that TPTB disseminate that is not true at all. Misdirection is trickier, because it is information they disseminate that has some truth mixed in with lies. Or in some cases they tell the truth up to a certain point and then at the end they point you in the wrong direction, blaming the wrong people for what they've just revealed. (Some people use the terms disinfo and misdirection interchangeably--it's not really important.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is extremely difficult to tease apart the truth from the lies. One reason is that the lies they tell about themselves are so bad that you can't imagine someone spreading such vile lies about themselves. If you've decided that TPTB are really truly evil and then you read something about them that confirms your suspicions and portrays them as really evil, it's hard to see why the source of that information would be coming from TPTB. You might conclude that such information is wrong, but you aren't likely to suspect that it is deliberately meant to mislead. But it is. Why would anyone say such bad things about themselves? And I'll repeat: virtually everything conspiracy-related that you will read or see is meant to mislead you. It might be straight-up disinfo or misdirection, but it is designed to keep you from really getting to the truth. And they are masters of deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you every heard the advice that you can use an embarrassing lie to get out of trouble? So for example say you're hung over and miss your alarm and arrive late to work. Instead of telling your boss the truth, you tell him that you had explosive diarrhea on the way in and had to go back home to change your clothes. He would never think you were lying, since why would anyone lie about that? So it's kind of like that but on a unimaginable scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also good at giving things the appearance of truth by making it seem as if they are trying to suppress it. If it wasn't true, why would they (appear to be) trying to hide it? But the fact that you've heard of it in the first place is a good indication that they are not trying to hide it but deliberately planted it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another element of this is a specific form of misdirection known as a 'limited hangout.' A 'limited hangout' is misdirection that leads you part way to the truth but then stalls before getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       To take an example, Wikileaks is a limited hangout. The first tip-off to that is that Assange has dismissed 9/11 conspiracy theories, saying: "I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, Assange wants us looking in the direction he's pointing to but ignoring things like 9/11. He's a very good disinfo agent, because much of the information he reveals is, indeed, really shocking regarding wars and financial fraud. And that stuff might very well be true. But the point is: as long as they keep people busy with that stuff, they aren't busy looking into allegedly "false" conspiracies (which are actually true). They also give Assange more credibility by making it appear as if they are trying to suppress Wikileaks and put him in jail, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that the information he has revealed is a lie (though it may be); what I'm saying is that Wikileaks is a form of misdirection or limited hangout. If what you have to Wikileaks them is truly revolutionary, they will not touch it, because at the end of the day their job is to offer people a distraction or limited hangout. "Look here! (Not there!!)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks, like most of the information you will find on almost all conspiracy-oriented websites and youtube channels, is mostly a distraction. The information has some value, to be sure, but mostly it is there to keep you from looking elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of the conspiracy lies they spread is that they want us to be afraid, in general, and also afraid of them. You know that famous phrase from Dune, "Fear is the mind-killer." Well it's true. One of their ruling strategies is to keep us in a state of fear, especially afraid of one another. It's part of the divide-and-rule gambit, and I see that you've recognized that which is great. But beyond that they generally want us afraid since it makes us more suggestible. When you are off kilter you are also easier to (mis)lead. So in conspiracy circles there is a lot of fear-mongering that goes on. Whenever I see a conspiracy engaging in fear-mongering (Financial collapse coming! Doomsday weapon coming on line! Obama is going to grab our guns, declare martial law and round us up into FEMA camps!), my spidey sense starts tingling that I am dealing with disinfo. I acknowledge that I might be wrong in any given instance, but I will not give myself over to fear, because I believe it gives them an advantage or a minor victory. I also try not to spread a message to others that might induce fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another tactic TPTB use is called 'controlled opposition.' Basically, you create or co-opt opposing movements and points of view to ensure that there is no real opposition or that the real opposition ultimately fails. Lenin is famous for his quote on "creating the opposition in order to control it," but it wasn't just Lenin. This is a time-worn tactic of ruling powers everywhere. Sometimes the opposition appears very genuine so it's hard to discern that it's controlled. In the cold-fusion arena we see this now with Industrial Heat. If we think of LENR energy as an opposition or threat to fossil fuels, then TPTB need to control that opposition. So they've set IH up to do that by taking control of emerging technologies and delaying them. You said yourself that IH is is controlled by CIA. Your statement about that lent further confirmation to what I've been suspecting for quite awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this tactic is hardly limited to LENR. It's everywhere. I can pretty much guarantee you that anything that might threaten or challenge the wealth and power of TPTB in any way is controlled. But more than that, most of the division we see in the world are fake. The whole Russia hacking thing is a myth, since Russia has been under control of TPTB at least since the Bolshevik Revolution. (And I'm not talking out of my ass here--there is a wealth of evidence of this and I'd be happy to give you more details if you're interested.) As I've mentioned, Assange is also controlled opposition (and Snowden, too). Chomsky is also obvious since he, too, dismisses 9/11 truth. Pretty much all the major conspiracy websites, including zerohedge, bibliotecapleyades, infowars, etc. etc. are all controlled opposition, disinformation, etc. Again, it doesn't mean everything they say is a lie, but it does mean that you should not trust them since it is often very difficult to discern what is true and what is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to summarize, there are many tactics the TPTB use to keep us from learning the truth: disinfo, misdirection, limited hangouts, fake suppression, controlling the opposition, fear mongering, and telling us lies to make us afraid of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll mention one more: it's called blackwashing or 'discredit by association.' That's when they have someone tell some truth, but then act crazy or evil or espouse ludicrous ideas in order to discredit the truth. (Like promoting some actual conspiracy but then turning around and embracing Flat Earth nonsense.)
      </p>
      <p>
       You've peeled back one layer of lies. It is probably the toughest layer to pierce through and keeps the vast majority of people in line. But there are many, many more layers of lies beyond that. There is a full on blizzard of lies to try to keep anyone who gets through the first layer in a booming, buzzing confusion, far away from the truth. Good luck to you on your journey!

       The 2008 Hidden Hand comments (and recent 222 4chan comments) alleged that sites like these DO contain truth but there's b.s. in there to throw you off.  Somewhere on the order of 80/20. 
 The best way to decipher truth is to really look in multiple places and look for the patterns.  Channeled material is a great source as is QHHT like Alba Weinman (YouTube.)  So, don't totally disregard these sites but don't take everything as truth either.

       80/20, yes.  But I have an advantage over most.  You owe it to yourself to go through the Hidden Hand comments, beginning to end.
