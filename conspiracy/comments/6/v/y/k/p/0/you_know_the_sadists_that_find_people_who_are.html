        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It started in Colorado where I had a house and they tortured me out of it.  I couldn&#39;t take it anymore and sold it, moved 1200 miles across country, bought another house and they followed me.  I then went to various motels trying to get some relief and they followed me there.  How they find me and get my room number is beyond me.  They have weapons that hit the ears and heart, and it&#39;s brutal.  It took me 6 months initially to finally come to the conclusion it was intentionally aimed at me by sadist psychos.  I thought it was health or environmental or something.  It starts and stops quite clearly.  I try to ask for help and cops say &quot;you have history of mental illness&quot; laugh and drive off.  Nobody believes me.  My extreme heart pain and now permanently damaged ears are quite clearly not delusion.  It&#39;s impossible to tell where it comes from.  They have some kind of device that shows them where I&#39;m at in my dwelling and actively point it at me.  If anyone else shows up, they simply turn it off.  Also, not only do they listen to everything going on in my house, they can talk to you remotely from some unknown location.   It&#39;s brutal urban warfare technology. I have no idea the kind of reach they have, or who they are, or why they are doing this to me.   I have a cat that&#39;s been with me for 16 years, and I really want to let him live out the rest of his life in peace and happiness, but I just can&#39;t take another few years of this and can&#39;t find anyone to give him a good home, so I can&#39;t really go on the run.  I&#39;ve been sleeping in the back of my small car, which is horrible, but guess what, no ear or heart pain.  People won&#39;t listen to logic and how this is all easily proven not to be simple delusion.  I&#39;ve never had delusion, just depression and anxiety.  Big difference.  So, I&#39;m in Georgia now and debating on what to do next.  The torture I&#39;ve endured so far is nothing like most people can even imagine.  Guantanamo bay level stuff that HAS driven me fucking nuts.  I threatened random neighbors in Colorado desperately hoping intimidation would stop them from doing this to me, but I don&#39;t think most of them had anything to do with it now.  At 3am I screamed randomly into the night &quot;i&#39;m going to kill you all!&quot;  but that was pointless.  I threw a couple rocks around hoping it would interrupt the torture, nope.  It really does seem though that they recruit people around me to put directed bass machines in their home pointed at me.  When they have said things to me remotely, it&#39;s been at least 5 different voices, so there&#39;s a team of them actively torturing me, a nobody, and they must be spending a lot of money in salaries to do this to me.  Bizarre.  Is it military?  Is it a 3 letter agency?  Is it mafia?  A gang?  I don&#39;t have any idea.  Do they have access to my credit card info?  Is there a tracking device on my car?  How the fuck did they find me 26 miles away in a motel in a different city?  SO, there ya go.  Trust me it&#39;s VERY VERY real.  It&#39;s ruined my life, cost me a fortune, and I&#39;ve gone back and forth with plans to hurt everyone around me or suicide.  I&#39;ve always known, for over 20 years, that&#39;s how I was going to end this miserable existence, suicide, but I really wanted to wait until my bud lived out his life, and then go find a good scenic spot to be done, but I really don&#39;t think I can take the torture and live in a car for the next few years.  I go home, do laundry, internet, give company to my cat, shower, etc, then back out I go in the miserable cold and heat.  What should I do? I can&#39;t block this technology, even the high pitch stuff that destroys my ears goes right through brick walls, and all of it, the low and high pitches are directed so nobody else hears it, but it covers my whole house, so there&#39;s nowhere to go.</p>

<p>Anyway, it exists, people are fucking crazy.  Sadist psychos that absolutely love to hurt people are out there.  Never draw any attention to yourself.  It started because I had a pointless slight neighbor feud that would have just faded away like any stupid neighbor feud, but that drew attention of these nuts to me, and the rest is something of fucking nightmares.</p>

<p>Edit:  Question:  If I have a smartphone, android and location is turned off, can they still use that to track you?</p>

<p>To everyone saying it&#39;s mental illness, NO, it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s tech.  It&#39;s not just hearing these people every so often.   I&#39;ve only heard them like maybe 5 times total in 2 years.  That&#39;s not schizo.  Also, it&#39;s not just hearing voices, it&#39;s the heart and ear pain that&#39;s quite clearly caused externally.  Is heart and ear pain schizo?  No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we have 3 cats here, and a shared roof with another 3 cats and a dog.  we&#39;re cat friendly.  </p>

<p>i&#39;m reasonably sure we have the sound and electronic noise here too - i try to pay attention to when it really amps up.  it&#39;s not a medical condition on my part, i&#39;m reasonably sure.  it&#39;s too noticeable and too variable.  i dunno if it&#39;s ambient or targeted, but i personally am reasonably sure i&#39;ve had targeted attention.  in my opinion there&#39;s no running away from this tech or the people that use it - but there is utility in likeminded.</p>

<p>anyway, that&#39;s what i think you need to find or you&#39;ll be burning yourself out with worry.  you&#39;re not alone.  there are others in your situation.  finding them and working together can make a huge difference to you.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound very similar to a friend of mine. Sadly no amount of logic or reasoning can convince him that what he believes isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p>I used to enjoy reading and talking about different conspiracies as some subjects are fascinating but I think a combination of having access to all this information and communities that reinforce possibly unhealthy thinking can be dangerous for people with mental health issues.</p>

<p>I love him and worry and some of the points he raises are correct but he has no balance to his life. Yes there are real conspiracies, the world is full of information that is hidden and manipulated but if you have no other life it can consume you.</p>

<p>Reconnect with friends, family, take yourself out of the conspiracy world and life a normal life.</p>

<p>Not logic, science. <a href="/u/barpmip">/u/barpmip</a> needs to read the meter wikis and meter reports wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> and submit meter reports. </p>

<p><a href="/u/barpmip">/u/barpmip</a> needs to ask an environmental medicine physician to order inflammation biomarker lab tests and radio wave sickness biomarker lab tests. He needs to upload his hearing test. I did. I have loss of hearing due to optical radar shooting at my ear drums.</p>

<p>Wear an 11 inch ice bag or a 2 quart hot water bottle inside a wrap filled with clay and oil on your heart.</p>

<p>Sleeping in your car should not make a difference other than you are farther away from smart meters and routers. Sleeping on the earth would help. See the earthing wikis in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. Sleeping inside shielding would far be best. See the shielding wikis in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Since you can relocate, I recommend eluding before relocating. See the eluding wikis and especially the Eluding: Havens: Radio free zone wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>Cell phones can be remotely turned on. Cell phones have a hidden CPU. Even in airplane mode, phones can be tracked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand it would be almost impossible to trust anyone and likely you&#39;d consider me not trustworthy, but have you tried to get help or tried medication?</p>

<p>I mean if you are having that extreme of thoughts than maybe it is worth taking the gamble of a doctor. I know you will likely be anxious about it, but if there is a chance that it&#39;s just legitimate help and the dr is not them, then it&#39;s worth it at this point.</p>

<p>I know energy and acoustic weapons exist man, but they can&#39;t hit you everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To answer your question, a smartphone that has gps turned off - can still be located.  E911 function as well as triangulate to the towers.</p>

<p>You have no reason to trust me, so let me just bring up facts.  Facts stand on their own no matter who says them right?</p>

<p>1) with all your moving trying to avoid the pain - you&#39;ve changed houses, motels, cities - might the pain cause be internal?
2) if the pain source is internal, could you go to an MRI facility for a full body scan?  You sound of means.
3) is it possible if the pain source is inside you, it might be something like a hormone imbalance, vitamin deficiency, a bacterial infection, or even a tumor?
4) if the problem was biological, is there a doctor you would even be able to trust?</p>

<p>I hope the best for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Private Detective. I work mainly surveillance for large insurance companies and states. </p>

<p>The thing is, we&#39;ve gotten hundreds of people coming in to speak with us about these very same issues--maybe a call a week from aledgeded victims. </p>

<p>Then I heard a so-called ex-psyop, military spook on a podcast last week explaining that WE private detectives are hired to drive people nuts...and own and use this highly advanced directed, ELF technology on people. </p>

<p>In 18 years, I&#39;ve NEVER come across any of my colleagues taking about this. I don&#39;t even know where one would purchase it or if it even exists. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been asked by any client to subject an investigation target to such torture. I think I would laugh. I most certainly would record that conversation. </p>

<p>So, if it&#39;s not us, private investigators, who is it? </p>

<p>In all those cases of hang stalking I&#39;ve worked, I&#39;ve never found a single instance of an external source. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve stood next to the individual when said source initiated and I noticed nor heard anything close to what the victim reported feeling and hearing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! John is the gospel that was written specifically that we might believe. I think Matthew was placed first for a reason however. It is perfect for an outsider looking in. Because it shows how contrary the true, biblical Jesus is to how the world likes to paint him... He is so much more <em>real</em> and <em>honest</em> than what they make Him about to be. When you read the gospels you realize, all of His words are just <em>good, and *right</em>, and <em>true.</em> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No <strong>you</strong> are the problem. Because going to some secular psychiatrist and getting drugged does NOT fix the root of the problem - because the root of the problem is SPIRITUAL. And the only solution IS the Bible and believing on Jesus Christ. Nothing else will help him or protect him from the attacks that he&#39;s experiencing. Only Jesus Christ can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it&#39;s proven (harvard study) that regular meditation can change the physical shape of the gray matter in the brain.  Why is it so weird that something similar to meditation, like prayer, might have a corresponding neuro-physical change as well?  That sounds pretty scientific to me.  </p>

<p>That being said, I do believe that in some settings, some drugs have a use in fixing spiritual problems.  I don&#39;t entirely agree with either of you, but I don&#39;t entirely disagree either.  Neat, huh?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom offed herself because of BiPolar and my cousin never comes around due to schizophrenia. I suffer from some mental instability as well. To me, it seems like you have fed a delusion too much. Last year I was convinced everyone in my life gets paid by the hour to be with me, and translated someone&#39;s desire to help me through mental struggles as a greedy ploy to get paid. But trust me that wasn&#39;t the case, A dissociated psyche can cause serious repercussions on your understanding of the world around you. That being said, you have a history of this, you know as well as I do how bad it can get. If you really think with one hundred percent clarity that this is happening to you, don&#39;t let it ruin your life. Ignore the ringing the best you can, do breathing exercises for your heart and don&#39;t give into this chaos. This is your brain, as someone who has had to deal with mental illness you have a better understanding of your brain as well. Be strong, be smart, don&#39;t make any decisions that aren&#39;t yours and don&#39;t show them it&#39;s working. Be you and don&#39;t loose that.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>To everyone saying it&#39;s mental illness, NO, it&#39;s not... I&#39;ve only heard them like maybe 5 times total in 2 years.  That&#39;s not schizo.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you seen a psychiatrist?</p>

<p>Auditory hallucinations are a common symptom of schizophrenia, sand there&#39;s nothing strange about that level of frequency. Some people hear a lot, others have occasional occurrence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, it&#39;s not just hearing voices, it&#39;s the heart and ear pain that&#39;s quite clearly caused externally.  Is heart and ear pain schizo?  No.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, actually.</p>

<p>Tinnitus and UCP (unexplained chest pain) are both common in schizophrenia. Both have been studied specifically in relation to schizophrenia and other psych illnesses. </p>

<p>Tinnitus is often mistaken for an auditory hallucination by the patient, but is often treated successfully by standard treatments and medication. </p>

<p>UCP is related to the anxiety and panic issues that come with psych illnesses. Judging from your post it sounds like anxiety is pretty much a constant in your life, and your actions you talk about indicate a level of panic. </p>

<p>I know you aren&#39;t looking to hear these answers, and I&#39;m not dismissing your experiences in the least. Regardless of cause they are real to you, and that&#39;s what matters. But seeing a psychiatrist may lead you to the means to stop or decrease these episodes, and that is a good thing. </p>

<p>Even if you are absolutely convinced that it&#39;s not a psych issue, indeed even if it truly isn&#39;t, you would benefit from seeking psychiatric help simply because you&#39;re considering self harm or hurting others. </p>

<p>Best of luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s hard, but stay positive. You must believe that you will get through this.</p>

<p>Fight tech with tech. Step up your shit. Shielding, earplugs, noise cancellation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N0ER4A73QE">phase cancellation</a>, destructive/subtractive frequencies. If it is in fact remote audio, then it needs to be <em>attenuated</em>.</p>

<p>Stay positive.</p>

<p>Shield yourself. Maybe do the <a href="http://altered-states.net/barry/newsletter347/ax2001-grnfld-aap368a.gif">orgone generator</a> thing with layers of organic and inorganic material. I don&#39;t know too much about it.</p>

<p>Inundate yourself with healing and calming frequencies. You can find them on YouTube and rip them with listentoyoutube.com.</p>

<p>Change your diet. In case it is in fact your own self-made problem, you gotta get right, and I know a lot of health problems (mental or otherwise) can be corrected with appropriate dietary changes. Eat plant foods and get all your nutrients, macro and micro. There&#39;s a lot to this stuff and I&#39;d be happy to help.</p>

<p>Get a bible. Can&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>Pray. Can&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>Do some magic. Build your power.</p>

<p>Organize your thoughts and stay positive.</p>

<p>Get exercise and fresh air.</p>

<p>Did I say stay positive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, my northern neighbors did that to me for awhile.  our houses are really close to each other and their garage is about 15 feet from the wall to my living room and couch.  i&#39;d have my feet up watching tv and felt tingling/vibrations in my feet first, then it went through my whole body.  i know what you mean, it&#39;s brutal.  this was the only time i could tell easily where it was coming from.  i walked outside and stood between our houses and instant chest pain.  the people that are running this show provided them with the device.  it stopped (from them directly) after awhile but continued from the apartment complex behind me.  for over a year there was an suv with blackout windows, no license plate, parked backwards, pointing directly at my house and dirty beyond belief like it hadn&#39;t been cleaned for a long time.  when i finally came to the conclusion that this misery was aimed at me directly and not environmental or health related (surreal, i didn&#39;t want to believe it) I walked around the apartment complex behind my house, looked at this suv closely.  was going to go back with a flashlight, but it dissapeared the next day.  infrasound is not something i want to feel again.  since i moved the tech has gotten way more sophisticated.  they hit my diaphragm once that caused me to almost suffocate.  i was sucking air</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here&#39;s what I would do in your shoes. Go to a hardware store, get some 3/4 inch plywood and some 2X4. Next you need to get some lead ingot, in Canada I was able to buy some at hardware store. Use the plywood to make yourself a sarcophagus. Stack the lead bricks on top and around, you want 1-2 inch of that stuff. This should stop any energy directed at you. Leave plenty of side air holes for ventilation. You should not have to worry about the ground. If that still not do the trick, get a spool of copper wire and build a faraday cage around your lead sarcophagus. No radiation or frequency should be able to affect you any more after that. If it is still happening afterward... Please see someone. </p>
