Obama and Democrats fought for extending the tax cuts up to the $250k income bracket. Republicans wouldn&#39;t acquiesce. Then they moved to extend the tax cuts up to the $1 million income bracket. Republicans wouldn&#39;t acquiesce (both failed in the Senate due to Republicans).

    <div class="md"><p>That is a realistic solution. We&#39;d have to get rid of most social programs, but that seems the direction we are heading in anyways. They&#39;ve been a failure from the start, and have only sunken us deeper and deeper into debt. The US is the highest taxed nation when you put all the taxes, fees, registrations, permits, regulations, inflation, etc etc all together. One big step in fixing things, would be ending the Federal Reserve. They (international bankers) are strangling our nation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people look at total tax income as it relates to GDP to equalize all the countries. We&#39;re almost right in the middle when you do that (26%). If you just look at the 35 OECD nations then we&#39;re 4th from the bottom. Turkey, Chile, and Mexico are the only countries that have less total tax income than we do. The OECD average is 37%.</p>

<p>If you were able to include the extremely locally dependent permit/regulation costs, then, as OrangeCladAssassin said, you have to include theirs. People would probably argue other countries have way more of those requirements too than we have already. I wouldn&#39;t see our rankings changing much, we&#39;d still be at the bottom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comments: This quotation is often cited as being in an 1802 letter to Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, and/or &quot;later published in The Debate Over the Recharter of the Bank Bill (1809).&quot;</p>

<p>The first part of the quotation (&quot;If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered&quot;) has not been found anywhere in Thomas Jefferson&#39;s writings, to Albert Gallatin or otherwise. It is identified in Respectfully Quoted as spurious, and the editor further points out that the words &quot;inflation&quot; and &quot;deflation&quot; are not documented until after Jefferson&#39;s lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a bit silly because he actually did say or write several things that would cleanly assist the point you&#39;re trying to make re: the pitfalls of centralized banking (not about the wacky ideas you have regarding taxation in general).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100k/yr is at best upper middle class, and in big cities, probably not even that. I think by any definition rich would be considered an individial having assets well into the millions, or a corporation in the hundred millions. Talking about income gets more complicated at those levels of wealth though.</p>

<p>But, thats beside the point. I have no interest in telling people how much money they &quot;should&quot; be able to make. </p>

<p>Most people agree we need a government to manage certain things, and it needs to be funded in some way. Capitalism does not necessarily dictate in what way those funds are derived.  It also should be clear to anyone who understands capitalism that the more money one has, the more opportunity they have to acquire even more.  Given enough time, this leads to a trend of wealth inevitably flowing upward at an accelerating rate into the hands of fewer and fewer people/organizations. That is not a sustainable economic model as the majority of consumers are working class people.</p>

<p>Therefore, it makes sense to me that in order to have a sustainable capitalist economy, the cost of government should be paid for mostly by largest corporations and the wealthiest individuals, tapering off gradually as necessary to find a balance.  Not all that different from what we have now in principle, except that balance is severely off in my opinion.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right and it was mostly due to the fact that the bar for a &quot;luxury&quot; item was extremely low (at least for cars and boats during the time), so it affected upper-middle class individual&#39;s purchases more than it did the extremely wealth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When America was at its&#39; most prosperous in the 1950s the top tax rate on the rich was 90%. If someone had an income of a million dollars in 1955 they would have to pay $900,000 in taxes and only get to keep $100,000. There were a few deductions back then but it wasn&#39;t enough to really make a difference. If you tried to cheat or use loop holes back then the IRS would come down on tax cheats like a tonn of bricks. The positive side to the progressive tax rate was the average working Joe got to keep most of his money and the Government was able to fund big infrastructure projects like interstate highways system and the early space program without going into debt. </p>

<p>No, but I am going to feel bad that a bunch of middle-class people that build those jets are going to suffer. Proven by the sources that have been listed in other comments.</p>

<p>Again, yes, they did hold back, as evidenced by sources from other posts. </p>

<p>When you tax the rich more, or attempt to create class equality by taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor, you only create further inequality. The rich pass along the higher tax rate to the lower class in the price of goods and services, or they cut costs elsewhere (think lowering wages for workers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the comments in this thread and I believe I saw one source about the luxury tax in the &#39;90s and  someone pointed out that they had cars on the luxury list that cost $30k. That is like $55k now which is ridiculous and hurts the middle class trying to buy items. That&#39;s not a luxury item.</p>

<p>Furs, exotic skins and other items of that nature aren&#39;t made in America 90% of the time anyway but the tax revenue it brings in might be negligible.</p>

<p>A luxury tax isn&#39;t going to be the answer to all our prayers but I could some of it making sense. It doesn&#39;t even really matter our government wants us to struggle. We spend $640 billion a year on our military and give country&#39;s like Israel $3.8 billion a year so clearly we aren&#39;t hurting. I&#39;m only for an increased tax revenue if the revenue was going into the right kind of shit. </p>

<p>Could you imagine if our government cut the military budget to around $400 billion, leglized marijuana and cut foreign aid to country&#39;s like Israel? Obviously that&#39;s not going to happen though.</p>

<p>No, they should just be sad that people are actually thrown in jail for such petty reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the day the big buzzword was &quot;Class warfare&quot; and this was used a lot on TV and by politicians in the 90s. They dismissed any progressive ideas as &quot;Class warfare.&quot; It is a classical use of demagoguery to shut down conversation. You want to tax the rich? Well that is &quot;Class warfare.&quot; Everyone would boo and then applaud when the idea was shot down. Finally in late 2006 just before the financial crisis Warren Buffet admitted it was all a ruse. He said to the New York Times on Nov 26th 2006:</p>

<p>&quot;There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a realistic solution. We&#39;d have to get rid of most social programs, but that seems the direction we are heading in anyways. They&#39;ve been a failure from the start, and have only sunken us deeper and deeper into debt. The US is the highest taxed nation when you put all the taxes, fees, registrations, permits, regulations, inflation, etc etc all together. One big step in fixing things, would be ending the Federal Reserve. They (international bankers) are strangling our nation.</p>

<p>Nothing is stopping you from refusing to pay taxes by going into the middle of the desert or jungle and living away from society.</p>

<p>Government stops you from doing that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only punished if you live as part of society and yet refuse to pay taxes.</p>

<p>You mean like the sales tax that is wrapped into the products you consume?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not starving is what prevents people from just &quot;leaving at any time&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know it&#39;s shocking, but for a big chunk of the population, quitting their job right now would mean losing their home and ability to pay for food. So not really a choice, at least in comparison to taxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not the same as having the threat of being thrown into a cage if you don&#39;t pay taxes. The people doing that, have guns and will use them <em>to get you into that cage</em>.</p>

<p>Also swing and a miss on your guess.</p>

<p>And they only show up if you stay part of society while refusing to pay taxes.  It isn&#39;t theft, it&#39;s a membership fee.  No one is stopping you from cutting all ties with society and living in bumfuck nowhere.  There are plenty of people with no social security number who live completely off the grid.  You&#39;re free to join them.  You just don&#39;t get to reap the benefits of civilized society while refusing to chip in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the comments in this thread and I believe I saw one source about the luxury tax in the &#39;90s and  someone pointed out that they had cars on the luxury list that cost $30k. That is like $55k now which is ridiculous and hurts the middle class trying to buy items. That&#39;s not a luxury item.</p>

<p>Furs, exotic skins and other items of that nature aren&#39;t made in America 90% of the time anyway but the tax revenue it brings in might be negligible.</p>

<p>A luxury tax isn&#39;t going to be the answer to all our prayers but I could some of it making sense. It doesn&#39;t even really matter our government wants us to struggle. We spend $640 billion a year on our military and give country&#39;s like Israel $3.8 billion a year so clearly we aren&#39;t hurting. I&#39;m only for an increased tax revenue if the revenue was going into the right kind of shit. </p>

<p>Could you imagine if our government cut the military budget to around $400 billion, leglized marijuana and cut foreign aid to country&#39;s like Israel? Obviously that&#39;s not going to happen though.</p>
