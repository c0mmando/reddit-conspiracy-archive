       I am just wondering because i saw all the Instagram pics with my own phone on instagram when it was revealed  really disturbing btw and the music video of the band that performed having all the symbolism in their website and music videos .  Anyone that was following the whole story knows all the proof is there so why are people so quick to dismiss ? There is soooo much proof out there apart from the Instagram  and wikileaks anyone that followed PG all the way through knows this .

       Not that i dont believe in it (some aspects are exaggerated, i believe its controlled so that some of the weakest connections are pushed the most), but the burden of proof is not on the debunkers, as you cant prove a negative. Its up to researchers to prove there IS something going on, which, in my opinion, theres

       Its not that pizzagate was debunked.. Its that the very basis for it has zero evidence other than some larping 4 chan users thst cherry picked "code" words that demonize people. Its people like you that give conspiracy people a very bad fucking name and spread unfounded witch hunts. You are the judge jury and executioner and this is Salem. Despicable.

       No one has been judged nor jailed nor executed for pizza-gate by the people on-line. People on-line just want an investigation. User Prolix is over-reacting. But I commend him/her for putting putting that combined degree in dramatic-arts and English to good use. Congrats on the good work.

       Pedogate is very real. Powerful people do commit sex crimes. Surprisingly, Jeffery Epstein and Dennis Hastert were briefly jailed. Anthony Weiner has been convicted but not jailed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza-gate has been purposely ignored by the media and most law enforcement because other powerful people don't want to go to jail.

       Pedophiles are everywhere and should be fought against no matter who they are. It's not just the elite and powerful who are capable if these heinous crimes.. Its easy to Demonize someone who is ultra wealthy and powerful using evidence that doesn't exist. There are sexual predators living in your neighborhood right now that people could give two shits about but holy hell let's target these two ultra powerful people with some cherry picked words that are apparently codes deciphered into concrete evidence that its insane nobody is doing anything about. FUCK THAT.

       All the circumstantial evidence has come out would produce indictments againt the average person. However if you're rich and powerful you can avoid indictments, in the same way that Jeffrey Epstein avoided a very long prison sentence for his multiple crimes.

       I wouldn't really call it a joke. I believe "tongue-in-cheek" describes it better. But even if they don't fully mean it, what's the point of even bringing it up? It still serves to delegitimize the other person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're having a conversation and you indicate that you have conservative views, then I make a tongue-in-cheek implication that you are racist, it still has no purpose other than to try to discredit you. Calling it a joke is just trying to give it some deniability.

       "Pizza-gate has been purposely ignored by the media and most law enforcement because other powerful people don't want to go to jail."

       Nobody wantS to talk about that. Just because media won't discuss open investigations like Seth Rich or missing children in Haiti DOES NOT DEBUNK these things.

       Oh yeah. You know it. Because pointing out a disinformation tactic is tantamount to supporting sex crimes. That's the real beauty of this one. Because of the reprehensible nature of the made-up events you can claim the moral high ground when someone tries to disagree with you. "You don't support child rape, do you?"

       How many times were you attack my one smear tactic and avoid commenting on any of the other points I made. You want to try again? Here:
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedogate is very real. Powerful people do commit sex crimes. Surprisingly, Jeffery Epstein and Dennis Hastert were briefly jailed. Anthony Weiner has been convicted but not jailed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza-gate has been purposely ignored by the media and most law enforcement because other powerful people don't want to go to jail.

       Well, if we're being precise about it, I called you out on two smear tactics. The first was insinuating that someone was a shill and the second was your follow-up suggesting I support sex crimes because I called you out on the first one. (I have a feeling another one is forthcoming.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to actually discuss the matter at hand, when you say pedogate, I hope you realize that encompasses a large swath of allegations that has morphed over time. Initially this stemmed from a specific set of allegations levied against John Podesta and James Alefantis regarding the use of Comet Ping Pong as a hub for child molestation. The evidence for those allegations seems very thin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now it seems this has been rolled into one overarching conspiracy that had existed since at least the early 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem is that no one has defined a clear set of allegations that this conspiracy encompasses. If you want to be taken seriously, as opposed to just musing about it on the internet, it would be wise to compile a compendium of specific allegations, so that they can be discussed in a common reference frame.

       There is no need for me to compile a compendium of pedo-gate allegations. This has already been done. Here is how you too can see a list of confirmed sexual abuse incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step one: look in the side bar for r/conspiracy sub group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step Two:  click on the link that says "confirmed conspiracies "
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Step Three:  scroll down to the entry for human trafficking, don't click this Wikipedia link, instead look at all the incidents detailed below the link. There are over 25 separate incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step Four: Notice a  common theme; many of the incidents were covered up by authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step Five: Go to the Pizzagate wiki, read about two specific fairly recent coverups that took place at the State department.

       I love how every response is that is is not debunked - we have an accord in that we all know deep down there is truth to the theory.

       Like people have mentioned, what truly gave it legitimacy was the huge backlash against it - i have never seen anything like it in all my years of conspiracy. The way they focused on pizza place 'Comet Ping Pong' as if that was the root of the theory was just crazy - Pizzagate is about the worldwide network of human trafficking and implicates thousands of politicians and businessmen around the world. The pizza reference comes from the terminology used by paedophiles worldwide, for example 'cheese pizza' apparently is code for 'young boy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM discredited the theory because Comet Ping Pong apparently "doesn't have a basement" when we thought "there was one." Not to mention some ass-hat went down there with a gun - but this was after the MSM ran with the story, the guy was a useful idiot.

       There is just no way anybody can justify giving up on stopping human trafficking because of one lone gunman at a pizza shop.

       It just seems so fucking retarded to me.

       I am open to it being true, but I'm still waiting on some evidence. Obviously some Instagram photos and the podesta emails stuff is iffy at best. It's not debunked in my opinion but it's far from proven
