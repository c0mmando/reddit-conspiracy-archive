<p>Pedogate is very real. Powerful people do commit sex crimes. Surprisingly, Jeffery Epstein and Dennis Hastert were briefly jailed. Anthony Weiner has been convicted but not jailed yet. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re having a conversation and you indicate that you have conservative views, then I make a tongue-in-cheek implication that you are racist, it still has no purpose other than to try to discredit you. Calling it a joke is just trying to give it some deniability.</p>

<p>Oh yeah. You know it. Because pointing out a disinformation tactic is tantamount to supporting sex crimes. That&#39;s the real beauty of this one. Because of the reprehensible nature of the made-up events you can claim the moral high ground when someone tries to disagree with you. &quot;You don&#39;t support child rape, do you?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if we&#39;re being precise about it, I called you out on two smear tactics. The first was insinuating that someone was a shill and the second was your follow-up suggesting I support sex crimes because I called you out on the first one. (I have a feeling another one is forthcoming.)</p>

<p>Now to actually discuss the matter at hand, when you say pedogate, I hope you realize that encompasses a large swath of allegations that has morphed over time. Initially this stemmed from a specific set of allegations levied against John Podesta and James Alefantis regarding the use of Comet Ping Pong as a hub for child molestation. The evidence for those allegations seems very thin.</p>

<p>But now it seems this has been rolled into one overarching conspiracy that had existed since at least the early 90s.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that no one has defined a clear set of allegations that this conspiracy encompasses. If you want to be taken seriously, as opposed to just musing about it on the internet, it would be wise to compile a compendium of specific allegations, so that they can be discussed in a common reference frame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need for me to compile a compendium of pedo-gate allegations. This has already been done. Here is how you too can see a list of confirmed sexual abuse incidents. </p>

<p>Step one: look in the side bar for r/conspiracy sub group.</p>

<p>Step Two:  click on the link that says &quot;confirmed conspiracies &quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc</a></p>

<p>Step Three:  scroll down to the entry for human trafficking, don&#39;t click this Wikipedia link, instead look at all the incidents detailed below the link. There are over 25 separate incidents. </p>

<p>Step Four: Notice a  common theme; many of the incidents were covered up by authorities. </p>

<p>Step Five: Go to the Pizzagate wiki, read about two specific fairly recent coverups that took place at the State department. </p>

<p><a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page">http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton and Cheryl Mills assist in covering up the &quot;Kunduz Dancing Boy&quot; incident</p></li>
<li><p>Laura Silsby and New Life Children&#39;s Refuge (NLCR) missionaries are charged with abducting 33 children in Haiti</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Step Six: Realize that the evidence is not thin. </p>

<p>No shit the dark web is far harder to regulate than the one provided to us by TPTB - child porn is rife on the tor network if you were to look you would see that OP does not lie and you in-fact live in a bubble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how every response is that is is not debunked - we have an accord in that we all know deep down there is truth to the theory.</p>

<p>Like people have mentioned, what truly gave it legitimacy was the huge backlash against it - i have never seen anything like it in all my years of conspiracy. The way they focused on pizza place &#39;Comet Ping Pong&#39; as if that was the root of the theory was just crazy - Pizzagate is about the worldwide network of human trafficking and implicates thousands of politicians and businessmen around the world. The pizza reference comes from the terminology used by paedophiles worldwide, for example &#39;cheese pizza&#39; apparently is code for &#39;young boy&#39;.</p>

<p>The MSM discredited the theory because Comet Ping Pong apparently &quot;doesn&#39;t have a basement&quot; when we thought &quot;there was one.&quot; Not to mention some ass-hat went down there with a gun - but this was after the MSM ran with the story, the guy was a useful idiot.</p>

<p>There is just no way anybody can justify giving up on stopping human trafficking because of one lone gunman at a pizza shop. </p>

<p>It just seems so fucking retarded to me.</p>
