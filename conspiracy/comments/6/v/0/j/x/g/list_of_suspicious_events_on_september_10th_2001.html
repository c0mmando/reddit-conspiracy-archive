<li><p>Rumsfeld Announces 2.3 Trillion Dollars Missing from Pentagon | CBS News (Sept 10th, 2001)
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ZOGzs9xSs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_ZOGzs9xSs</a>
The next morning the Pentagon is hit in the exact location where budget analysts were trying to track down the missing money, killing analysts and destroying records.</p></li>
<li><p>FEMA Arrives in New York Night Before Attacks - Sept. 10
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmMRWL-jEVE#t=131">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmMRWL-jEVE#t=131</a>
<a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fematape.html">http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/fematape.html</a>
Claims that Tom Kenny mistook the arrival date are refuted by the fact that the interview with Dan Rather was on Wed. Sept. 12 and he accounted for Monday night, Tuesday, and that day (Wednesday). &quot;We arrived on late Monday night, and went into action on Tuesday morning. And not until today did we get a full opportunity to work the entire site.&quot; Furthermore, former NYC mayor Giuliani testified to the 9/11 Commission: &quot;&quot;... the reason Pier 92 was selected as a command center was because on the next day, on September 12, Pier 92 was going to have a drill, it had hundreds of people here, from FEMA, from the Federal Government, from the State, from the State Emergency Management Office, and they were getting ready for a drill for biochemical attack. So that was gonna be the place they were going to have the drill. The equipment was already there, so we were able to establish a command center there, within three days, that was two and a half to three times bigger than the command center that we had lost at 7 World Trade Center. And it was from there that the rest of the search and rescue effort was completed.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Alarm Bells Sound over Unusual Trading in US Stock Options Market - Sept. 10
<a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091001bells">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091001bells</a>
According to CBS News, in the afternoon before the attack, “alarm bells were sounding over unusual trading in the US stock options market.” It has been documented that the CIA, the Mossad, and many other intelligence agencies monitor stock trading in real time using highly advanced programs such as Promis. Both the FBI and the Justice Department have confirmed the use of such programs for US intelligence gathering through at least this summer. This would confirm that the CIA should have had additional advance warning of imminent attacks against American and United Airlines planes.</p></li>

<li><p>Gen. Montague Winfield Steps Down on Sept. 10
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMd9b2JiFo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMd9b2JiFo</a> (8:28- end)
On Sept. 10, Brigadier General W. Montague Winfield asked Capt. Leidig to temporarily take his place as Director of Operations at the Pentagon Command Center on the morning of 9/11.... from 8:30 am. until after Flight 93 crashed, whereupon Winfield resumed control. Leidig had qualified to stand in that position just the previous month. Winfield was promoted to Major General.</p></li>
<li><p>Pentagon officials Cancelled flights on Sept. 10
<a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091001generals">http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a091001generals</a>
September 10, 2001: US Generals Warned Not to Fly on Morning of 9/11
According to a Newsweek report on September 13, “[t]he state of alert had been high during the past two weeks, and a particularly urgent warning may have been received the night before the attacks, causing some top Pentagon brass to cancel a trip. Why that same information was not available to the 266 people who died aboard the four hijacked commercial aircraft may become a hot topic on the Hill.” [Newsweek, 9/13/2001] Far from becoming a hot topic, the only additional media mention of this story will be in the next issue of Newsweek: “a group of top Pentagon officials suddenly canceled travel plans for the next morning, apparently because of security concerns.” [Newsweek, 9/24/2001]</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be very surprised just how dumbed down many people are. For instance, I go to a physical therapy clinic and the owner is a staunch republican who is obsessed with talk radio. The guy is an extremely talented PT, probably one of the best in town and knows anatomy backwards and forwards. Unfortunately he deems it necessary to make small talk about politics while treating certain patients. He literally reiterates almost everything he hears on talk radio and on television (FOX News). At one point he said something to me, basically something along the lines of &quot;can you believe there are people out there who think the government caused (or planned or did, I forgot the exact wording) 9/11?&quot;. I just nodded along because I can&#39;t really risk losing such a valuable PT over such an argument. I imagine there are many, many people out there who are so indoctrinated by mainstream media that their personal opinions are interwoven with that of the mainstream media. There literally is no separation between the two (which is exactly what they want). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s kind of the point I was trying to make. In their own mind they firmly believe these are their own thoughts, ideas and opinions. However the more they talk the more you realize everything they&#39;re saying is just being recited from a mainstream source. Conservative talk radio is the absolute worst. The level of arrogance and disdain is sickening. I despise the liberal media as well, but they&#39;re slightly less annoying.</p>

One of the first things my 13-year-old nephew asked me about 9/11 was whether or not I thought Bush did it. And I was pleasantly surprised to see that &quot;Jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; was a meme.

    <div class="md"><p>Not believing the official story and believing all was set up and an inside job are not the same though. Take me for example. I don&#39;t think it was an obvious inside job. I think the CIA has been working with terrorists covertly to have insider informations and knew about the planned attack but was sure to be able to prevent it. Somehow things went wrong and the cell went dark or something. So they issued a warning and could only wait and watch it happen. The buildings were dangerously close to toppling over at some point and to avoid even bigger devastation they pushed the big red button and demolished them. </p>

<p>Basically it was a combination of a collossal intelligence fuck up and accepting collateral damage to potentially save more people. All reasons to cover it up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there was ever a deliberate plan to murder thousands of civilians for some deeper agenda.</p>

<p>Being called a brainwashed sheep because I have come to a different conclusion based on information I gathered is one of the reasons so many people can&#39;t take conspiracy theories seriously.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, that&#39;s fair, but I really think a lot of the experience depends on set and setting.  If you have a good set and setting and have a generally healthy mind, then yes.  However, if the set and setting are poor, it can make a bad situation worse.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t ask you publicly whether you have ever had a truly bad trip, the kind where death is more attractive than life even after the trip ends.  However, if this happens (and it does), it can be catastrophic for the person going through that experience.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what they have done <em>for you.</em>  They don&#39;t have that effect on everyone.  All drugs have side effects.  One of the major side effects of taking a drug to find some degree of enlightenment is you think the same drug and the same path can apply to everyone.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

<p>You mention SSRIs.  SSRIs are not placebos.  They are effective for some things, carry a serious side effect profile that can include death, and should not be taken lightly.</p>

<p>Psychedelic drugs have very similar attributes.  They are effective for some things, carry a serious side effect profile that can include death, and should not be taken lightly.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think you should recommend someone take psychedelic drugs.  They are not necessarily safe, and they don&#39;t necessarily have your desired effect unless it is in an appropriate set and setting, and the person wants to partake in the experience of their own free will (not just because someone wants them to).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not opposed to psychedelics, but I am definitely opposed to people blithely recommending them to strangers as if they are a magic key to enlightenment.  They are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So by your own standards you can blithely recommend &quot;medications&quot; but it is somehow wrong to recommend psychedelics because they can potentially have side effects? And you think SSRI&#39;s and psychedelics have very similar attributes? That&#39;s insanity! And ontop of that you are ignoring the fact that they can be excellent tools in gaining enlightenment, sometimes even as &quot;magic keys&quot; when revelations are experienced. </p>

<p>Bad trips aren&#39;t the end of the world man. And death is not really a side effect of L, mushrooms, or dmt, only when Ayahuasca is mixed with MAOI&#39;s or with massive doses of some of the RC&#39;s (like DOC). The lethal doses are not even close to the active doses (ld50 is 1680 grams of mushrooms or 550 hits of LSD lol). While your &quot;medications&quot; carry much more serious risks and side effects and far less results (again, SSRI&#39;s are equally effective to placebos with much worse negative effects <a href="http://reset.me/story/study-antidepressants-no-better-than-placebo/">http://reset.me/story/study-antidepressants-no-better-than-placebo/</a> )</p>

<p>you can blithely recommend &quot;medications&quot;</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t read my comment.  I said, very specifically, SSRIs have a risk profile that can include <strong>death.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>again, SSRI&#39;s are equally effective to placebos with much worse negative effects </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Per your own link, <strong>&quot;researchers found the drugs’ impact was noticeably stronger than a placebo in people diagnosed with very severe cases of depression.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware that SSRIs are overprescribed.  However, I said that SSRIs are effective <em>for some things.</em>  I stand by that statement, and I am supported by your own link.  SSRIs are much more effective than placebo for severe depression.</p>

<p>If your statements are indicative of someone promoting mushrooms, I strongly suggest you work on your logic and facts.  Poor arguments do not help the cause.</p>

<p>With that said, psilocybin seems as though it can be even more effective than SSRIs in treating severe depression, if administered in a controlled, safe environment with excellent set and setting.  We are a long way from that becoming standard medical practice, however.  Therefore, please be cautious about recommending these drugs.  And whatever you do, if you advocate for them publicly, please have a good and accurate view of the actual research and what it says, or you will be hurting rather than helping.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re so backwards on this one I don&#39;t really know where to go from here. You DID recommend medications in a previous comment. Maybe you could start by actually addressing the safety of psychedelics vs. benzos, opioids, and SSRI&#39;s. You recommend medications because you incorrectly claim they&#39;re safer. I recommend psychedelics because they open your mind, get you in touch with the universe, and show you the beauty of the world around and within you.  These experiences are life changing. Popping medication from your doctor is usually has the opposite effect over time. This is not just my own experience you dummy it&#39;s the magic of these molecules and I CANNOT recommend them enough to everybody except the schizophrenic types. Bad trips are temporary (and rare), enlightenment is permanent. 
Do everyone a favor and don&#39;t recommend going to the doc for medications. If effective, you are killing people that way, not to mention destroying their lives. </p>

<p>For some things, when they are effective, if someone is likely to benefit and outweigh the possible harms.  Is this an unreasonable position?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You recommend medications because you incorrectly claim they&#39;re safer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never.  Every medication is different.  Psychedelics tend to be relatively safe, but can lead to death if used incorrectly, or in combination with certain pharmaceutical drugs.  Benzos are one of the few whose withdrawals can be lethal, I think generally speaking these should be used in emergencies only.  Opioids have their place in pain control but are vastly overused and should generally be avoided in favor of other pain treatments wherever possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recommend psychedelics because they open your mind, get you in touch with the universe, and show you the beauty of the world around and within you. These experiences are life changing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware of what psychedelics are like and what effect they have on your perception of the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Popping medication from your doctor is usually has the opposite effect over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes people need that in order to heal.  Sometimes survival is more important than seeing the magical beauty -- and the darkness -- that surrounds you.  A number of people commit suicide every year while tripping.  Sometimes numbing is better.  I&#39;ve been there.</p>

<p>enlightenment is permanent</p>

<p>If you ever come to a place where you think you have achieved enlightenment, I think you&#39;ve missed the point.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh I&#39;m well aware of this.  What you seem to not be aware of is that psychedelics have their own risks.  You are comfortable because you use them, but you are discounting the risks because you personally have not experienced the dangerous aspects of them.  Bad move.</p>

<p>My stance is hard to figure out because it&#39;s complicated.

So, I have to learn all the terrible things that can happen to someone when they take SSRIs (Steven Johnsons Syndrome, anyone?) and then I&#39;ll be writing prescriptions for them.</p>

<p>Ok, WHAT? Are you kidding?</p>

<p>This would be in violation of every building security and fire safety code in existence. If people knew that a building that they were spending hours working in was rigged to explode, the companies who rigged it would be hit with a million lawsuits.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the WTC were shut down months before 9/11 for &quot;renovations,&quot; <em>around the elevator shafts.</em> These shafts allow access to the main structural supports. There was also decreased security and a power down a few days before the attacks.</p>

<p>Then you still have to believe that some terrorists with box cutters commandeered 4 planes and flew for nearly an hour without being intercepted by fighter jets. NORAD was also AWOL during that whole time.</p>

<p>Not to mention that the reported speeds of the aircrafts were ludicrous. They were going faster than their safe top speed. Not only that, they managed to hit a precise target. If you don&#39;t know why this is insane, the speeds reported should have resulted in the disintegration of the planes. If by a miracle they didn&#39;t fall apart, controlling them would have been literally <em>impossible.</em> Again, cave dwelling box-cutter wielding terrorists can do this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... so you ridicule me for suggesting that rigging the building would be violating safety regulations and get the companies into trouble but you yourself are suggesting the government did it? So that doesn&#39;t violate any regulations? Sure buddy... I mean you are free to think they did it... but don&#39;t pull that double standard as an argument. If anything it would have been easier to install an explosive failsafe during renovations in 93 than to orchestrate all that within days before 9/11. I am sorry but my variant is not more bogus than yours.</p>

<p>And yes. I believe the flights were hijacked.... at least I have not read any evidence that was strong enough to convince me otherwise. I am aware that there are some fishy things and that the government could have reacted earlier. I just haven&#39;t made up my mind yet WHY they didn&#39;t. Right now total human failure is my guess. The bush administration wasn&#39;t smart enough to pull off such a major thing with that many people involved without proof existing. The more people are involved in a plot the harder it is to keep secret after all.</p>

<p>Therefore I think that a lot of people made dumb decisions... or maybe the flight surveilance was faulty. Or one of them was in on it... I can even support that some CIA guy had a secret agenda. I can&#39;t support either Bush or his administration being smart enough to do it deliberately on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you there. Bush was probably an unwitting pawn. However, I have no doubt that Cheney was involved with this. Him and his fellow neocons were definitely in on this, considering companies owned by him have profited handsomely. He also displays psychopathic traits. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a video of Bush being asked a question about inside knowledge - and he almost breaks down. It was posted here recently, dig it up. The body language he displays is one of extreme anxiety, guilt. He positions himself directly away from the reporter - body language of someone desperately wanting to flee. </p>

<p>From what I can gather, Cheney was the one in on it. Bush was told shortly before, and basically had no choice. However, I still think he is a huge shitbag for his role in the coverup and sabotaging the 9/11 Commission.</p>

He could barely fly a Cessna, but on 9/11/01 he suddenly became a super pilot and nailed a small strip of building (The Pentagon) mere feet above ground level while plowing through multiple light poles. The Pentagon footage shows a white streak traveling level to the ground, impossible considering the plane&#39;s black box says the plane was at 480 feet of altitude above sea level, far too high to hit any light poles, and far too high to come in at a level approach. This means Hanjour had to level the plane out only feet above the ground with only a second to spare, greatly exceeding the plane&#39;s control input limits. The pilot, Captian Burlingame, was a retired military officer and had special training in counterterrorism operations, he and his co-pilot wouldn&#39;t have given up their plane upon seeing the physically very small-statured Hanjour with a tiny box cutter. </p>

<p>to be fair, operating above safe top speed say in an automobile happens if you press the gas all the way down.  many machines are capable of running at higher or faster speeds than would be safe for everyday activities.    it&#39;s not like airplanes are flying around now at peak speeds.  there is much more left in their engines they could provide, but it&#39;s not safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have memory problems:</p>

<p>&quot;example. I don&#39;t think it was an obvious inside job. I think the CIA has been working with terrorists covertly to have insider informations and knew about the planned attack but was sure to be able to prevent it. Somehow things went wrong and the cell went dark or something. So they issued a warning and could only wait and watch it happen. The buildings were dangerously close to toppling over at some point and to avoid even bigger devastation they pushed the big red button and demolished them.
Basically it was a combination of a collossal intelligence fuck up and accepting collateral damage to potentially save more people. All reasons to cover it up.
I don&#39;t believe there was ever a deliberate plan to murder thousands of civilians for some deeper agenda.&quot;</p>

The feds probably ran what if scenarios after 93(which also included an undercover operation) including what would happen if the buildings did not fall in their own footprint. They could&#39;ve modified joints in key locations and/or planted explosives to do just that. Wether someone exploited that or it was a &quot;safety&quot; measure that backfired is up to debate.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is even true. Need to find a way to create an anonymous shill-proof surveying system to find out what people actually honestly believe. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that most people don&#39;t believe the bin Laden fairy tale but are afraid to say so.</p>

<p>Sometime before 6:00 a.m. on September 11, or possibly on the evening of September 10, a van occupied by some Middle Eastern men pulls up at the resort. The men claim to be reporters and say they are there for a “poolside” interview with Bush. They then ask for a particular Secret Service agent by name. Security guards phone the receptionist at the resort and relay the men’s request. The receptionist has not heard of the Secret Service agent named by the men or anything about a planned interview with Bush. She passes the phone to a Secret Service agent, who similarly tells the security guards that no one knows of the agent the men referred to or is aware of any scheduled interview with the president. The Secret Service agent says the men should contact the president’s public relations office in Washington, DC, and has them turned away from the premises.

Incident Resembles Recent Assassination Method - Some people will later note the similarity of this alleged incident to the method used to assassinate General Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, on September 9.</p>

Do you really think that if a lot of &#39;very influential&#39; people knew that someone wouldn&#39;t have said something? Leaks happen, and the more people you have involved, the higher the chance that a leak will happen either through neglect or moral objection. IF there was some involvement in 9/11 by the U.S. Government, then they would have kept that knowledge within the smallest group possible. If they were just throwing tips about willy-nilly we would have a lot more evidence for a conspiracy than we do currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could say anything you want - it just doesn&#39;t necessarily have any implications.  I understand the theme&#39;s thread but that doesn&#39;t mean any old thing has relevance.</p>

<p>So, since you didn&#39;t say why one person getting hired in a civil service which contains 10&#39;s (100&#39;s?) of thousands, on any particular day was odd, I&#39;ll just ask the question again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think you understand what this theme is about. Let me help you. The day before 9/11, lots of strange things happened, no? Following? It suggests that 9/11 was planned. Well planned. If it was well planned, and I am not talking about a day before, a week before but months or even years. </p>

<p>Then whoever, whatever planned it needed the FBI to follow through with the grand pre 9/11 plan. Therefore Mueller position was pre planned.</p>

<p>Stressing this out, 9/11 grand pre plan was so large it needed someone friendly to cover up tracks and it was PLANNED WELL IN ADVANCE.</p>

<p>Hopefully you get it but I am guessing you won&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand clearly that this is a thread that promotes the 9/11 conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Again, that doesn&#39;t mean anything one says must have relevance.</p>

<p>You stating this hiring was odd does not make it so simply because the theory exists.  </p>

<p>There is nothing odd about his hiring.  Look at the whole timeline of when the previous director left and why, and then there was an acting director.  Those positions are temporary.  </p>

<p>Again, I also point to what must be hundreds, if not thousands of daily hireings of many positions that could be somehow construed as &#39;linked&#39;.  It&#39;s simply the law of statistics.  You&#39;re trying to see something that just isn&#39;t there because of a unfounded conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>If it makes you happy or somehow excited to do this... then continue.  If you want reality, then try some real research and stop looking with a confirmation bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said it was odd, I didn&#39;t say it was true. This thread is about conspiracy. It&#39;s my duty to put odd things in for further discussion, because that is the theme. Makes sense?</p>

<p>You keep saying about hires. So for a special job as FBI director do you place an advertisement in a paper and ask people from all walks of life to be interviewed? Does that make sense? It doesn&#39;t so let&#39;s not go there. Third time I stated this ... If indeed a inside job, 9/11 planned not a day before, but well in advanced and they placed key personal in positions of power to cover up the aftermath. Mueller COULD HAVE BEEN placed there to cover up 9/11. IT IS ODD HE WAS PLACED THERE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE 9/11 HAPPENED.</p>

<p>What????   Who said anything remotely like that?  Jesus man.  How does the hiring process matter?  Every position has different hiring techniques.  So what?  Of course his would have been a very thorough process for such an important position?  What&#39;s with your &#39;muddying the waters&#39; technique.  If anything, it makes it LESS odd since so many people would have been involved in the whole process of a FBI director&#39;s position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mueller COULD HAVE BEEN placed there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ANYTHING could be true but, again, it doesn&#39;t make it realistic just because something IS possible.</p>

<p>Using caps for a whole sentence at the end doesn&#39;t make it any more plausible or true.  There is absolutely nothing odd about his hiring.  I suggest once more you look closely at the times and reasons for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you are meaning &#39;coincidence&#39; when you say &#39;odd&#39;.  &#39;Odd&#39; has a connotation of &#39;strange&#39; etc.  I think &#39;coincidence&#39;, and not even a strong one, is the best you can do.</p>

<p>AGAIN the points I am trying to portray</p>

<p>*** If 9/11 was pre planned, they planned WELL IN ADVANCE
*** That means key people MUST BE placed in KEY POSITIONS
*** So that a massive cover up COULD BE implemented
*** Mueller COULD HAVE BEEN placed there to cover up 9/11

<h1>1. Rumsfeld didn&#39;t announce anything on September 10th. The $2.3 trillion was publicly known about since March 2000, which is 18 months earlier.</h1>

<p>Rumsfeld briefly mentioned accounting problems in a speech on 9/10/2001 titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301161721/http://www.defense.gov/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=430"><em>DOD Acquisition and Logistics Excellence Week Kickoff—Bureaucracy to Battlefield</em></a>: &quot;Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.&quot;</p>

<p>The 2.3 trillion dollar figure comes from <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">this audit report from the year 2000 (PDF)</a> about fiscal year 1999 (Oct. 1998-Sep. 1999).</p>

<p>Even before the final report was issued, the story was in the news. From <strong>March 5, 2000</strong>, eighteen months before 9/11: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/05/news/mn-5519"><em>Pentagon&#39;s Finances Just Don&#39;t Add Up</em></a></p>

<p>Audit: Hundreds of computer systems fail to keep running totals of income and outgo. Last year, the Defense Department&#39;s bookkeeping errors totaled more than the entire federal budget.</p>

<p>March 05, 2000|JOHN M. DONNELLY | ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The military&#39;s money managers last year made almost $7 trillion in adjustments to their financial ledgers in an attempt to make them add up, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general said in a report released Friday.</p>

<p>The Pentagon could not show receipts for $2.3 trillion of those changes, and half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made in earlier adjustments.</p>

<p>Each adjustment represents a Defense Department accountant&#39;s attempt to correct a discrepancy. The military has hundreds of computer systems to run accounts as diverse as health care, payroll and inventory. But they are not integrated, don&#39;t produce numbers up to accounting standards and fail to keep running totals of what&#39;s coming in and going out, Pentagon and congressional officials said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rumfeld was <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4521969/sen-byrd-rumsfeld-nominatin-hearing">asked to look into the accounting problems at his confirmation hearings</a>. That discussion was mentioned in the news, for example <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics-jan-june01-rumsfeld_01-11/">on the PBS newshour</a>.</p>

<p>Other mentions of the $2.3 trillion from before 9/11 are collected here: <a href="http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html">http://www.911myths.com/html/rumsfeld__9_11_and__2_3_trilli.html</a></p>

<h1>2. It&#39;s not money that has &quot;gone missing&quot;, it&#39;s the sum of inadequately documented accounting entries.</h1>

<p>The amount of $2.3 trillion is about 9 times the entire Department of Defense budget for the year and more than the entire federal government spent. You can&#39;t misplace that amount of money.</p>

<p>In Fiscal Year 1999, the entire federal government only spent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_United_States_federal_budget">about $1.8 trillion.</a> The Department of Defense spent about $261 billion, so $2.3 trillion is about 9 times their entire budget. It is <em>impossible</em> to lose more than your entire budget.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s going on? First, accounting entries are made for many purposes: spending, revenue, budget planning, estimating future liabilites, etc. Second, it&#39;s normal for a single real-word transaction to generate multiple entries. Spending may be entered for multiple divisions in a hierarchy (e.g. local/regional/national, or platoon/battalion/division), for different purposes, categories, and budgets (e.g. capital vs. operational, expansion v. same-store), and so on. Third, in the 1990s, the Department of Defense had more than 250 accounting systems and hundreds of thousands of control accounts. (It still has many different accounting systems, but I don&#39;t have an up-to-date number.) So entries had to be made just to copy data from one system to another.</p>

<p>The audit report only gives one detailed example of the kinds of accounting entries. It gives the details because the Comptroller disagreed with the Inspector General about whether it represented a problem.</p>

<p>Each month, the Navy had to produce a Report on Budget Execution (SF 133). The Navy accountants need to include data from the Marine Corps, which is part of the Navy. The data were not available electronically in time to produce the report. So the Navy accountants created new journal voucher entries from a print-out of the Marine Corps&#39; SF 133 report. Then after the report was produced, they reversed the journal voucher entries:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>About three or four days later, the DFAS Kansas City Center provides the DFAS Cleveland Center a detailed electronic budgetary trial balance dataset at the level necessary to produced the Appropriation Status by Fiscal Year Program and Subaccounts (DD Form 1002). Therefore, the data from the SF 133 is replaced by the detailed data when it becomes available. Since the SF 133 data is replaced, it has no impact on the financial statements. The annual audited financial statements are prepared using the detail-level year-end amounts. Therefore, none of the referenced $1,463.2 billion was used to prepare the Navy&#39;s official financial statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is from pages 19-22 (PDF pages 25-28) of the <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/audit/reports/fy00/00-179.pdf">audit report.</a> However, the Inspector General did not accept this explanation—see pages 10-11 (PDF pages 16-17).</p>

<p>Note that the Inspector General is criticizing the process of importing data from the Marine Corps to the Navy. This has nothing to do with how the Marine Corps spent the money (their budget was less than $3 billion).</p>

<p>The audit report also gave examples where the accounting procedures were proper, but the data used was not reliable. These accounting entries are also included in the $2.3 trillion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the DFAS centers processed department-level accounting entries, valued at $79.7 billion, to record environmental liabilities based on documentation that the Military Departments provided. However, because of insufficient controls that DoD used to develop the estimates, auditors could not verify the accuracy of the reported amount. Also, DFAS processed a department-level accounting entry to record the $196 billion Military Retirement Health Benefits Liability. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) acknowledged that the reported amount was unreliable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a defense of the Pentagon&#39;s accounting, which everybody agrees is terrible. And it&#39;s possible that some of the accounting mess is done on purpose to cover up some sort of wrongdoing, but not 2.3 trillion dollars, because they didn&#39;t have anywhere near that amount of money. I&#39;m just saying that the number reported ($2.3 trillion) is a sum of <em>accounting entries</em>, which is not the same as a quantity of money or spending.</p>

<p>For more on the Pentagon&#39;s accounting, see <a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2">this good series of articles from Reuters</a>.</p>

<h1>3. Although a few accountants were killed on 9/11, they had nothing to do with the $2.3 trillion audit report.</h1>

<p>A small office in the Pentagon <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100222143017/www.oaa.army.mil/rpa.aspx">Resources Services - Washington</a> lost 34 employees. They had nothing to do with the $2.3 trillion audit report.</p>

<p>The offices that were involved with working on the accounting mess were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Finance_and_Accounting_Service">DFAS</a>, the <a href="http://www.dodig.mil/">Office of the Inspector General</a>, and the <a href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/">Office of the Under Secretary (Comptroller)</a>. Nobody from any of those offices was killed on 9/11.</p>

<p>DFAS has about 12,000 employees located in offices around the world. Its headquarters is in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>You&#39;re confusing the annual triplicate and quadruplicate accounting errors (2.3 Trillion) with the total sum of money that is stolen every year by the so-called &quot;Defense&quot; industry (500 Billion, aka half-a-Trillion).  </p>

<p>According to many people like CIA critic Robert David Steele (who was a CIA officer for many years, but is now a strong critic of the agency) it&#39;s generally recognized in the &quot;Defense&quot; industry that ONE of EVERY 2 DOLLARS given to them is stolen fraudulently.  </p>

<p>Intentional waste, fraud, and abuse since at least the 1950s - that&#39;s the story of the criminally behaving &quot;Defense&quot; industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was 9/11 that caused me to begin questioning and researching the true intentions of our government and its various agencies. To this day I&#39;m not sure with 100% certainty that 9/11 was an inside job. It is impossible to have the information necessary unless you were part of the orchestration of the event to have 100% certainty. The concept that people are flabbergasted our own country would kill 3,000 of its own citizens for profit, further control, etc is laughable or dismally naive. The most important thing to realize in regards to any modern government is this:  you are a pawn, a very irrelevant pawn. The US doesn&#39;t have 8 pawns as a chess board does, they currently have roughly 320 million of them.  Sacrificing .0009% of the population Is not a sacrifice, it is business as usual. I don&#39;t believe we are viewed as people, we are viewed as a natural resource that continually grows. We are the first great empire (by my definition the West, i.e. Essentially NATO) that has stood when literacy has broached over 50%. They keep us in the dark purposefully because none of us would stand for their &quot;leadership&quot; if we knew the truth. We are therefore the smartest peasants to ever be ruled. </p>

<p>Maybe they had general ideas that it would be in NY (explaining the FEMA presence) and that it may involve a plane (explaining the generals being warned not to fly). </p>

<p>Also, they may have no had a lot of advanced warning to initiate an organized response (ie; military at all airports, etc) or maybe they just were incompetent in how they handled it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alarm Bells Sound over Unusual Trading in US Stock Options Market</p>

<p>That one is true.  There was also unusual trading on Sept. 6.</p>

<p>But the 9/11 Commission investigated it and said:</p>

<p>Highly publicized allegations of insider trading in advance of 9/11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre-9/11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks. Some unusual trading did in fact occur, but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation. For example, the volume of put options — instruments that pay off only when a stock drops in price — surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 — highly suspicious trading on its face. Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades. The SEC and FBI, aided by other agencies and the securities industry, devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue, including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments. These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous.</p>

<p>Does this dismissal hold up to scrutiny?  It&#39;s complicated!  More info:</p>

<p>Debunked: Rumsfeld says $2.3 Trillion missing from the Pentagon

<blockquote>
<p>Meaning of the quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s basically talking about accounting. The money is not missing, just not tracked up to expected accounting standards. In 2002 the amount of improperly tracked transactions was reduced to $900 billion, as they integrated their accounting systems). But that&#39;s still not missing, it&#39;s just improperly tracked.</p>

<p>Honest question.  If you knew the Pentagon was about to get hit in 24 hours why would you talk about $2.3 trillion dollars the day before?  Also how do you know the location of the room in the Pentagon where they were doing this investigation?  That seems oddly specific.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude you&#39;re so backwards on this one I don&#39;t really know where to go from here. You DID recommend medications in a previous comment. Maybe you could start by actually addressing the safety of psychedelics vs. benzos, opioids, and SSRI&#39;s. You recommend medications because you incorrectly claim they&#39;re safer. I recommend psychedelics because they open your mind, get you in touch with the universe, and show you the beauty of the world around and within you.  These experiences are life changing. Popping medication from your doctor is usually has the opposite effect over time. This is not just my own experience you dummy it&#39;s the magic of these molecules and I CANNOT recommend them enough to everybody except the schizophrenic types. Bad trips are temporary (and rare), enlightenment is permanent. 
Do everyone a favor and don&#39;t recommend going to the doc for medications. If effective, you are killing people that way, not to mention destroying their lives. </p>
