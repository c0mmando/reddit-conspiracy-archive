       but i did this morning. And its really disgusting how everything is being labeled racist or white supremacist. Not so much the comments but the articles you find on MSM sites. It's much too late to play that card. Probably 95 percent or more people in general are smart enough to know we are all equal. White, black, purple, I dont care about color. Yes I can see color but I dont see it as a defining quality. How young were you when you heard, "never judge a book by its cover"? I love everyone equal until you give me a reason to think otherwise. People that are propping up this propaganda are mentally disabled and need to self reflect. Point is if you are hopping on the racist train get off now. We all came from Africa and whether you like it or not we are all in this world together. Divide and conquer can't work anymore. Left, Right, Black, White, Jewish, what have you, we are all brothers and sisters and it's about damn time we act like adults and come together to make the world a better place for our children. Shame on you MSM. Goodbye

       Even "alternative" ways of getting information is geared towards making people hate each other. FBI Anon said some horribly racist shit but tons of people gobbled it up because he played into their already existing racist ideas. Not to mention most of what he said was false/ didn't come true

       4chan is right on somethings and is worth checking out, but the fake predictions and LARPING get old, but there isn't a way to figure out of their true than to just wait.

       I just find it funny that you would comment on a thread about how the MSM is propagating race dialectics and proceed to call out some anonymous leaker and/or larper as racist - especially when you don't even remember what he said.

       I was checking out Hatreon, you know Richard Spencer only makes 500 a month from Hatreon donations from people online. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means he is funded in another capacity, and by reading into other Hatreon users I discovered they all have Bitcoin links. Tada, whoever is funding  these groups is doing it through Bitcoin and anonymous sources. Which makes me believe someone high up is orchestrating.

       I think there was some "naming of the jew" and maybe some (((triple brackets))) and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       's but I don't remember anything you'd normally call "racist" (i.e. what the other guy said "black people are violent" or w/e). I don't fully remember though.

       FBIanon - a weird combination of a 55-year-old veteran and a 19-year-old intern. He played us well. But, if you really want to know, he said that black people are "trainable", in a sort of Uncle Tom way. As I recall, he mentioned Thomas Sowell, a respected black intellectual, who believes blacks must work their way into the middle class the usual way - hard work and education. He said minorities can strengthen a country if they assimilate. I took his comments as suitably un-politically correct, enough to keep his audience interested. But he did not come across as straight up racist. I wonder where he is now.

       Do you find the kind of overt racism that was around 50-60 years ago? Probably not. Thinking that everyone is equal, doesn't matter their skin color? You live in a fantasy land or are just oblivious

       Agreed, everyone should. It's difficult because we're still just a few generations removed from segregation and Jim Crow. People have grown up hearing from their parents/grandparents disparaging things about other races. Everyone has biases, but if we don't recognize them, confront them, try to overcome them, we can let those biases still have significant influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't live in the south either, I live in New York. Just a few years ago a study considered my neck of the woods one of the most segregated areas in the US. Racism and racial bias is far from extinct.

       Yes, racism might be lower than ever, but we shouldn't be afraid of discussing issues of race. Minorities are unfairly discriminated against by a broken and corrupt criminal justice system.

       I don't know why everyone thinks Southerners are horrible hood-wearing racists. This isn't Reconstruction. We had a black family recently move into my very rural neighborhood full of good ole boys and redneck hunters. Nobody moved out, nobody sneers at them, our kids play with their kids, I see the mom laughing and having coffee klatches at the fence with the other moms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are certainly racists in the South to be sure, but not more than any other part of the country and I'd argue we are much less segregated down here than in places like Chicago. Every hard core true racist I've ever met was from the North.

       Because they're not trying to "suppress minorities" - that's MSNBC/HuffPo bullshit. They feel they don't have any choice but to vote republican on moral grounds with issues like abortion even if they don't particularly like the republican candidate. The Democrats have gone so far left of center in the last 30 years there's no common ground any more for a lot of conservative southerners, and to top it off the left has decided to double down on their condescension and snark. I'd vote for a reasonable 3rd party candidate in a heartbeat if I thought they had a chance in hell of winning. Gary Johnson and Ron Paul (much as I like him) are not it though.

       Before 2015 I remember plenty of local and state candidates in North Carolina running on "family values" and preventing the legalization of gay marriages. And they were fairly popular as well. Son of course not everyone that votes  R wants to suppress minorities, but there sure are a sizable portion that do.

       Different hominids evolved in different places- denisovans in Asia, Neanderthal in Europe, sapiens and erectus likely in Africa. They all fought, traded and inter bred with each other, until, for whatever reason, sapiens became the most dominant. Could be because we're more War-like, because we organize better, or maybe we just fucked more than all the others...

       No, let say I am basing it on culture and not something as superficial as just skin color.  That I abhor violence in every way.  Does that change anything?  What if I insist that your assumption is wrong that I imply other races to be inferior, rather that  I am making a claim of opinion (not fact) that Western culture is best?

       Western culture doesn't mean white people does it? People of many different shades contribute to Western culture. Again saying white culture or whatever code words you want to use to say white skin being superior is wrong and racist. And again whether you believe it or not, you are insinuating other cultures are then inferior. I mean you directly mentioned supremacy in your original comment.

       Sure, Western culture means whites.  If I said sub-Saharan African culture, you are going to automatically thing black, correct?  Even though there are whites living in the region.

       Yes and no. Of course someone brought up in a different culture may have a different view of life. But a brown, Asian, black person born in the US for instance and a white person born in the US, and both influenced by Western culture won't be too different. Also in the case they are different, why is that a bad thing to you? Again lots of different races contribute to Western culture, so you can't say it just means white. For instance the US will soon have a population where half of it consists of minorities. Do you just act as if this half of the population doesn't exist? Are they not contributingn anything? Also there is a much higher percentage of minorities living in somewhere like the US then there is living in a country in sub Saharan Africa, so that isn't a good comparison.

       I thank you for taking a reasonable position, asking for clarification. I hadn't expected that.  What I believe would take a fair amount of time to elaborate on the nuances.
      </p>
      <p>
       To oversimplify, I feel Western culture has done the most good for humanity and I subjectively feel it is better to all others by clear margins. That I categorically reject the notion that all cultures are equal in all ways.  Call it a personal preference for Western/white culture, and that preference affects personal decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add, that I believe all laws should apply equally to everyone without preferential treatment to any group, no exceptions. I dislike violence and should only be used when there is an imminent physical threat to one's body.

       Depends on how far you wanna take it in terms of affecting others in institutional way.

       If it's just personal belief, then sure. But if it's like "there should be more gov funding for white people only", "these jobs should be reserved for white-only(enforced by gov laws) because they are better race", then there's a problem.

       Do you plan on preventing non-whites from moving in to your new area? That would be the line imo...the flat tire thing is pretty dumb- you're just a douche if you won't stop to help someone because they're a diff race

       Would you be more likely to stop and help your brother, or a stranger?

       How about your cousin vs a stranger?

       If you feel a closer tribal bond with somebody you're more likely to help them.

       That's, of course, assuming you don't simply stop and help everyone. Which I generally do living in an area where being stranded along the road can be dangerous rather than simply inconvenient.

       Except you actually know something about your cousin or brother, have an actual reason for prioritizing them above a stranger. Skin color doesn't tell you shit about a stranger other than his ancient ancestors evolved somewhere close to where yours did. Your ancestors also probably killed, raped and enslaved each other. There is no real "tribal bond" there because you're not a part of any tribe with meaningful common denominator, just a superficial one. You could very well be passing by a great person in need of help, while stopping to help a piece of shit- color won't tell you which.

       Understandable. But as an Azn raised in western country(Canada), it would just feel wrong from my perspective to be as "picky" as you are(only helping other Azn but not white).

       You can spin it however you want. All I need to know is this line. And upon further reading you keep saying western culture is the same is being white. Maybe you are just really ignorant, maybe you are really racist. But its not my responsibility to clarify what you are trying to say.

       This sub is getting hammered by the shills and bots, people talking freely cost Hillary the election and nearly installed an anti-war socialist (the one thing they feared more than trump).

       This whole right vs left dichotomy being deliberately forced into every discussion is nothing but an overt attempt to foster tribalism and blind people from reality. It wouldn't surprise me if similar tactics were used to rachet up the tension prior to the arab spring.

       this has nothing to do with partisan. It has to do with Bernie failing to secure the nomination and realizing that his options are, drag down the Democrats by going after them for screwing him in the primaries, or allow a buffoon to be President. It was a pretty easy fucking decision for him. You seem to be the one who cannot get past the partisan issue.

       what atrocities (props on spelling your most difficult word correctly)? in fact wtf are you talking about? We are discussing the fact that Bernie did not attack the DNC after he lost the nomination NOT because he was falling in line as a fucking shill, but because the alternative was helping Donald Trump become President which would have much worse consequences for him as a Senator trying to get legislation passed. I am humored that you have the audacity to call someone else dumb with you level of reading and writing comprehension. However, it is not unexpected.

       Okay sorry for calling you dumb. Insults get us no where. Though honestly what does a few spelling errors have to do with what I'm saying. So my thumbs don't always hit the right key's. If you could extrapolate the the predisposed underlying framework of which I was constructing a thesis upon, then what difference does it make?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes of course he was right for supporting Hillary. I over stated that attitude. Though the remaining problem is that after the election has been well and over with. There is an investigation in the works to determine the level of tampering that was involved in Hillary getting the nomination.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while, to this day, Burnie has not once talked about how he would have won if Hillary didn't cheat to get nominated. Therefore he is being a shill for the DNC for not calling out this egregious act of collusion that led to our current president.

       thats still not what a shill is though. Hes not out there cheer leading for them, pushing their agenda, shit hes not even a Democrat anymore. Bernie is an old man. He comes from a different time where he feels its better to take the "high road" then attack people for something that cant be changed at this point. I am not saying I totally agree with that, but it doesnt make him a shill for the DNC. Of all politicians left of the aisle, Bernie Sanders is probably the least shill-like congressman you'll find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, unfortunately the case has been dismissed. Its complete and utter bullshit, and it looks like the DNC is going to end up getting away with what they did to him, and I believe not coming clean will hurt them in the long run. But of all the politicians in Congress, the only real thing Bernie Sanders shills for are his policies and beliefs.

       Alright if you say so. I don't watch the man. Rather only see what passes my feed. Personally I can't stand his obsession with the 1%. I mean the mathematics of it fall apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is 3million people in the 1%, roughly. The average income is $465,626. When you factor in all of the billionaire and all of the barely 1-percenters. So that means they make $1,396,878,000,000 a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well even if we tax them 100%, we already spend $1,000,000,000,000 a year on welfare alone. What do you think an extra 1trillion dollars will help. There is already 1.4 trillion in student loans right now. So how could an extra trillion make college free? And how would government paying for colleges not force inflation as the colleges get more greedy?

       Its been determined that a major contributing factor for Trumps upset was Clinton's inability to draw major contrasts - She is the .01%, racist comments, general disregard for the average American, etc. By equating freedom of speech and racism, those in authority hope to flip this rising trend:

       I obviously know Trump is president. The thread is about Hillary's failures and specifically about her inability to distance herself from Trump on the matter of social justice. Do you people think that every time someone mentions Hillary, they also have to mention Trump? I mean fuck Trump but y'all gotta work on reading comprehension

       Not really, minority voters didn't show up for the old white lady. You could make the argument, and back it up with data, that African American voters showed up for the African American candidate and not the white candidate. Would that make those voters racist? I think that's a stretch, but does suggest Obama won because of race.

       He didn't win because of race, but obviously black folks showing up for the first black president helped a lot, especially in the primaries.

       They showed up for Hillary about as much as a typical Democrat president. She just wasn't black. And being excited that one of your own has a shot after a couple centuries of systemic racism isn't what i would consider racist.

       You can 'blame' it on two things actually, maybe three.

      <p>
       First, minorities didn't show up for the non-minority candidate.

      <p>
       Second, third party candidates did 3 times better (millions of votes) than in 2012.

       The maybe third are the disaffected blue collar Democrats, folks who voted for Obama once or twice.

       The polls weren't a disaster either. They were off by a bit. Most of what was wrong was the interpretation of the polls. Nate Silver had Trump with a 1 in 3 chance to win, which is completely consistent with the results.

       Turnout numbers from the US Election Atlas are not exit polls, data comes from the official state reporting sources.

       I said I took one of these ridiculous 'most racist district in America' maps and looked for some huge increase in votes/support for Trump in those racist districts. Guess what? Didn't exist. One or two time Obama voters swinging to Trump are not racists, they're fed up and pissed off.

       Clinton was at 48 pts a week before, and 48 pts in polls after the Comey announcement. After the Comey announcement Clinton was still at her highest in the polls since April 2016.

       Nate Silver projected minority turnout the same as it was in 2012, slightly lower than 2008. He was wrong from the beginning.

       For fun you can find one of these ridiculous maps of the most racist areas in America and see turnout did not skyrocket, i.e. racists did come out of the woodwork for Trump.

       the odd thing is, you're mad that people are being called racist while trying to prove you're not racist. Instead of trying to prove you're not racist, why don't you self reflect on if they might actually have a point?
      </p>
      <p>
       do you only care about issues if they affect you? are you aware of the struggles of other ethnic groups? do you care about other ethnic groups enough to change your thought process to help them? these are questions that can only help you be a better person.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about this: with the vast majority of white people in America, wouldn't it be much more likely that there is a pro-white agenda instead of an anti-white agenda?

       I hate that answer, self reflect on why we don't see it like 'everyone else' or the right way.

      <p>
       Solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       White people in flyover states are fairly removed from racism, they talk of course and the south has there bunch, but the majority of them are voting for issues they care about and that will effect their area. This is why they got super rock hard about the economic prosperity, because they are slipping closer and closer into debt and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what all humans who vote are doing. Voting for their interests is somehow racist because they didn't vote for the side that pretends to hold the torch for minorities. This is where we are getting to, pay attention to the rhetoric. They will attempt to make right synonymous with Nazi
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't a prowhite agenda, it's just not the agenda of the side that purports their for minorities (I'm guessing in spirit, since those historically black districts are still having trouble, they can't seem to get the representatives to help them by voting on much). It's different worlds, the smaller towns are all integrated to a degree, they just get more fired up at irrelevant nonsense like transgender shared bathrooms and the other incredible pushes activist have tried lately that they are starting to push back. This is why they spout quotes about the regressive left and dumb nonsense like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So put forth a responsible plan to help these groups, learn to compromise and work towards your solution like the rest of the country. Don't assume others have ulterior motives just because they don't align with your party.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've got an issue, take it up with the guy above you. Hate the guy above you, vote him out and make a difference.  We need to rid these baby boomers who still believe they can rule through racial division, and we're going have to be the ones that do it.

       I never said it didn't exist, I said it doesn't effect people in those areas as much as it does others or what activist consider enough. Which is why there is that whole mocking "straight white male" thing, because that's how they discredit their issues.

I feel like I'm an alright guy, treat people equally, have friends of multiple nationalities and upbringing, but if I'm going to be judged as a racist for not curving my speech to think about racial issues in the light that activist think about them then I view that as completely asinine and regressive to a progressive future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also said we should bring up responsible solutions to dealing with racial division, our media, government and so on seem bound and determined to push the violence over an attempted solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd prefer reforming police activity, and rooting out corruption in the higher branches, the ones who cook the numbers for elections and things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are trying to fix racism in a broken system that has been overtaken by oppressors, instead of rooting out the opressors and fixing the system. It makes absolutely no sense to fight for racial equality in the name of the corrupt system if we are going to still be stuck in trailer parks and ghettos under the thumb of the slumlords who live in the nice part of town.
      </p>

       It's a class struggle, we just can't realize how fucked we are.

       I think the larger problem is that we've decoupled motivation and intent from racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people have internal and barely conscious levels of preferences for familiar things and biases against different things.  Nearly all of these arise as a result of life experiences they don't have much if any control over or aren't the result of deliberate choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most preferences and biases that wind up being labeled as racist these days are the result of these circumstances, not conscious choices, racist intent or motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant harping on these things as racism and the implication that they are both beneficial to them and malicious I think is actually making it worse, not better.  It challenges the legitimacy of their life experiences, their sense of moral standing and probably causes people reaffirm their biases, not question them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think calling out overt and malicious racism is fine, but the relentless bashing of people as racists for unconscious and unintentional biases really makes things worse.

       I agree with you, a good amount of racism as seen today is so ingrained in people's heads that it's hard for anyone to think differently. but I do not agree that just because something gets pushback, it should not be done. It's not everyone else's fault that people with racial biases become more racist as a result of being called out on it. All we can do is call attention to it so that people can be more conscious of why they think the things that they do.

       We live in America. You can believe whatever the hell you want as long as you're not physically hurting someone. If my neighbor was a white supremacist, I'm not going to go out of my way to make his life hell, I'll just think he's a dick.

       That's a nice thought, but it's not reality. There are people alive that were around before the Civil Rights Act and desegregation. The KKK was still killing and firebombing people well into the late 1970s. That's just the KKK. A significant number of people were racist but not organized. The children of those people are millennials. Do you honestly believe those sentiments disappeared within a generation? Just look at how half the country treated Obama.

       I think you mistake it for propaganda because racism is expressed differently today. It's not blatant like lynching (though it still happens) and burning crosses. There is a reason that there was a spike in new confederate monuments around the civil rights era. There is also a reason that certain races are incarcerated at a much higher rate. It's certainly better today than it was, but it's certainly not a thing of the past.

       Here's my testament on white-black racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Military: There was a lot of tension and outright racism in the barracks. But in the field, there was never any question whether you trusted black soldiers or black leaders more or less than whites. Everything came down to whether you knew your job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work: My experience on the job was that blacks wanted to learn and perform the job as much or more than anyone else. In my eventual career there were almost no blacks (computers). Process that. It's just true.
      </p>
      <p>
       College: I live near a university that is situated in a black part of town. The college is half foreigners on study visas. I am able to see and interact with both American blacks and Africans. Most Africans who come to the US to study are both smart and upper class back in their country of origin. They seem totally unaffected by US race issues. They relate to whites very straightforward, as in "I'm in your country, and I respect you, but I have status where I come from. We can be equals." There is this slight difference when interacting with some (not all) American blacks. It's as if they want to say "I am not certain you will accept me as a truly equal American, and if you disrespect me, which I expect whites to do, I will act like I have a grudge against you."

       I think racism is as much a "perception of status" as anything. Perceptions change. We are a long way from the history of slavery and Jim Crow. Eventually we will see that status is as status does.

       btw, I look white but I am descended from black slaves way back. That's another thing we often forget - whites and blacks interbred a whole lot. Southerners know this better than in the North. It's all one very dysfunctional family in the end.

       We did that.  We came together and voted for President Trump, the best hope this nation has.  Fuck the MSM, they're just mad they lost the election.

       i like the 2nd video- that lovely lady got Hillary pissed with whatever she said at the end! And she got right in her face, eye to eye and remained calm and articulate, yet totally hostile. Sexy

       Seriously, we shouldn't be afraid of these guys. They are in the open and everyone can see their tactics with a few clicks.

       From there you can see the members that are receiving funds for their content and badabing badaboom you've identified the strongest target elements of a movement.

       C'mon how can you call her condescending? It seemed like she really understood black people to their core. Don't you remember she carried hot sauce in her purse - just like Beyonce!!!

       I'm still shocked she didn't get as many black people voting for her. Anytime I've ever talked politics with a black person it's "hot sauce this, hot sauce that"...
