       <p>
        The independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks reached an agreement with the White House yesterday to gain restricted access to years of classified presidential briefings, which had been the focus of subpoena threats from the panel's chairman. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Cleland called the agreement "unconscionable" and said it "was deliberately compromised by the president of the United States" in order to limit the panel's work.
       </p>
       <p>
        "If this decision stands, I as a member of the commission cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access," he said. "This investigation is now compromised . . . This is `The Gong Show'; this isn't protection of national security."

       <p>
        President Bush personally has nixed the effort of the 9-11 Commission to get all the documents in the White House, especially the Presidential daily briefs, which basically tell the Commission and the American people what the President knew and when he knew it in regards to the potential attack on 9-11 and the attack itself and the follow-up. He has personally nixed that information coming to 9-11. That means to me that all of the members of that commission will never get to see the real documents that I think are sensitive. The President, as I think John Kerry mentioned, had time to go to rodeo, but didnâ€™t have time to appear fully before the 9-11 commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Truth of the matter is, the White House has played cover-up and a slow walk to this game from the beginning. Now after sewing to the wind, theyâ€™re reaping the whirl wind. Now what theyâ€™ve done is forced the Congress to extend the 9-11 Commission two more months, which kicks the final report in July right before the Democratic National Convention. Thatâ€™s not the Democratsâ€™ fault. Thatâ€™s not the 9-11 Commissionâ€™s fault. That is the fault of the White House, to slow up this thing and it never even held any public hearing for six months. [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        One of these days we will have to get the full story because the 9-11 issue is so important to America. But this White House wants to cover it up.

         Why do you think officials tried to obscure some of the faulty decision making and communication on 9/11?

       </p>
       <p>
        It's almost a culture of concealment, for lack of a better word. You have someone like Sandy Berger, who by all accounts is a decent guy, taking rather extreme measures to remove documents from the National Archives and hide them at a construction site where he could retrieve them later and destroy them. There were interviews made at the FAA's New York center the night of 9/11 and those tapes were destroyed. The CIA tapes of the interrogations were destroyed. The story of 9/11 itself, to put it mildly, was distorted and was completely different from the way things happened.

       why was NIST created?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Articles of Confederation, ratified by the colonies in 1781, contained the clause, "The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective statesâ€”fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States". Article 1, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States (1789), transferred this power to Congress; "The Congress shall have power...To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures".
