       Private prisons are the equivalent of modern day slavery. If you don't understand that, this sub ain't for you. You have a MSM member for reform of this issue and a dickwad "president" and AG in favor of expanding private prisons. Who's the cunts?

       Except, it isn't. The crux of your post is the insinuation that JO is only getting flack because of a stance you assume the majority of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be in disagreement with. The crux of your post is a flawed perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The posts analyzing how LWT uses particular pacing and framing of discussion in order to manufacture a singularly valid viewpoint are a fair bit older than his reporting on that coal company, is it not? What makes you think that one is a reaction to the other, when the other came months after the fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also the case that it's less about the content of the show, and much more about the deceptive practices through which this content is framed and delivered. Right or wrong, those practices stifle any honest debate about those topics. And that's the crux of the issue.

       A lot of pro Oliver and pro Antifa posts lately.

       Even most of the common sense people on the left know John Oliver is establishment propaganda.

       Less than a month ago John Oliver was widely regarded as a sometimes mildly entertaining shill. He does good bits occasionally like on Net Neutrality but the entire last month has been Group Identity Politics Tonight and fanning the flames. Apparently this is what the shills like to see now that we are seeing it pushed so hard.

       Just because a talking head agrees with common sense SOMETIMES, doesn't mean they aren't pushing a bullshit agenda the rest of the time. I could probably find some redeeming values that you would agree with in infowars or the orielly factor if I were inclined, but I'm not interested in their lies either.

       It's not that I disagree that most of those theories are shit, but he generalizes and attempts to discredit any thought on all subjects conspiracy related and then other times pushes conspiracy theories he wants to be true. Theres no critical thought or genuine points he makes that prove or disprove anything. He's just another puppet, delivering snarky insults for your entertainment.

       So you agree with some of what he says but not with him in general because of the way he generalizes. So instead of following your own advice and learning to discern what you do do not agree on him with, you instead generalize just as you criticized him for doing.

       No, I generally disagree with snarky pricks who make fun of people for thinking for themselves. Whether I agree on a specific video or theory is irrelevant. It's the delivery and gatekeeping that I completely disagree with.

       Also, you can be pro / con whatever you want, but John Oliver is a fucking moron who repeats talking points given to him by a research team without any attempt to understand why someone would stand in opposition to his views.  He grandstands every Sunday as if he were ordained with intellectual superiority over us all.  He moralizes every political issue, making it impossible to have an actual argument over policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, he is everything wrong with political discourse and all the pseudo-intellectual assholes who treat his opinion as gospel need to instead pick up a book.  Fuck John Oliver and all those who think he gives a shit about these ideas or the high ground. Most people will babble whatever talking points they're given for a few million a year.

       He's a fucking comedian who makes a lot of great points. I don't understand why liberal comedians make you guys so mad. Is it because you don't have any? That's gotta be it. You guys hate john Oliver, Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and Colbert with a passion because you wish you had a single good conservative comedian.

       Who is "you guys"?  I worked for the Obama Administration.  I'm simply able to escape the dichotomy of idiocy to see what's really happening here.  He has good delivery.  I'll give him that.  But do you think he writes a single joke, researches a single fact, or develops a single topic for exploration.  No.  He does what he's told.  He's an actor.  The script, cinematography, direction etc. is all done by and for someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're guilty of exactly what he's doing.  Division by party when this has nothing to do with party.  I agree with plenty of his premises, but for wildly different reasons.  And I don't need someone who has no idea of the issues themselves, has no policy perceptions of his own, and generates outrage without providing a single solution to improve the situation.  He's a fucking carnival barker for liberal idiots.  I don't need my political opinions fed to me by comedians, liberal or conservative.

       P.S. Bill Maher is disgusting and a fucking moron.  Stewart (or Leibowitz if we're being honest) was good.

       Don't love Trump.  Just don't listen to BS theories and witch hunts. It makes improving the country much more difficult.  And if you were to watch the project veritas videos or come to DC and talk to anyone on capitol hill or in politics you would find the both these groups and the media all know this is being done for sensationalist purposes.  I don't think our country should be hurt for ratings or grandstanding.  I'm not at all saying he doesn't give a fuck, I'm saying he doesn't know what he's talking about.  He has no idea about the pros and cons of net neutrality outside of what he's told.  This holds for every topic.

       Bill Maher is a womanizing disgusting human being that rationalizes pedophilia and is known as a scumbag in hollywood and politics.  You may like his show or opinions but he is objectively a gross person.

       You've already proved your ignorance by reflexively screaming Clinton when anyone mentions Trump. If you think he only became  a pedophile in 2008 then  why is your only defense that he's better friends with Clinton than Trump.  The only one wasting anyone's time is you. I dare you to sue me for anything. You're so full of shit it's not funny. You're just trying to confuse the story.

       Okay, so John Oliver's writers are for government control of speech on the internet and think private prisons are an easy target. Not a conspiracy or even news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since few people on this sub would ever watch John Oliver, it's highly doubtful that anyone gives a shit about what he talks about, much like John Oliver himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's just the mouthpiece of his handlers regurgitating the talking points he's been fed. John Oliver doesn't know or give a shit who Robert Murray is; he just says the words for the money.

       Please don't label something as misinformation just because you're misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legal implications of reclassifying particular companies as common carriers as defined in Title II of the
       <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">
        Telecommunications Act of 1934
       </a>
       has more going for it than just the extra 400 pages of micromanagement that Wheeler added. This the same doc that let's the FCC fine TV stations for nipple slips and defines 'obscenity' for the American public and let's the FCC fine entities based upon content. It's opens the door to declaring it a public service to filter 'fake news' and maintain black lists as they do in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, no one giving the FTC any credit. Here's their
       <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/fy-2018-congressional-budget-justification/2018-cbj.pdf">
        2018 budget
       </a>
       ; feel free to just control-f, 'privacy' and see if you can get a sense for which Government agency is actually doing this sort of work across every other company, including competitors of those included in Title II. They even have their own conference 'PrivacyCon'.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also doesn't give the
       <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/current-and-recent-cases">
        DOJ
       </a>
       or the
       <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-lawsuit-against-spectrum-time-warner-cable-and-charter">
        work of the 50 State AG's
       </a>
       any credit either.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the joke is Title II blocks any FTC investigations into anti-competitiveness, deceptive advertising as well as any privacy violations effectively allowing the FCC to play favorites with their cronies in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, we're paying billions in fees for all of the overhead all this regulation creates and Internet competition sucks compared to other countries; wireless too, want to guess why? If barriers to entry are removed new business and services will be created to address and innovate the market. There is no chance for that path with increased government regulation; there never is.
