    <div class="md"><p>Except, it isn&#39;t. The crux of your post is the insinuation that JO is only getting flack because of a stance you assume the majority of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be in disagreement with. The crux of your post is a flawed perception of reality.</p>

<p>The posts analyzing how LWT uses particular pacing and framing of discussion in order to manufacture a singularly valid viewpoint are a fair bit older than his reporting on that coal company, is it not? What makes you think that one is a reaction to the other, when the other came months after the fact?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the case that it&#39;s less about the content of the show, and much more about the deceptive practices through which this content is framed and delivered. Right or wrong, those practices stifle any honest debate about those topics. And that&#39;s the crux of the issue.</p>

<p>Also, you can be pro / con whatever you want, but John Oliver is a fucking moron who repeats talking points given to him by a research team without any attempt to understand why someone would stand in opposition to his views.  He grandstands every Sunday as if he were ordained with intellectual superiority over us all.  He moralizes every political issue, making it impossible to have an actual argument over policy.  </p>

<p>In short, he is everything wrong with political discourse and all the pseudo-intellectual assholes who treat his opinion as gospel need to instead pick up a book.  Fuck John Oliver and all those who think he gives a shit about these ideas or the high ground. Most people will babble whatever talking points they&#39;re given for a few million a year.</p>

He&#39;s an actor.  The script, cinematography, direction etc. is all done by and for someone else.</p>

<p>You&#39;re guilty of exactly what he&#39;s doing.  Division by party when this has nothing to do with party.  I agree with plenty of his premises, but for wildly different reasons.  And I don&#39;t need someone who has no idea of the issues themselves, has no policy perceptions of his own, and generates outrage without providing a single solution to improve the situation.  He&#39;s a fucking carnival barker for liberal idiots.  I don&#39;t need my political opinions fed to me by comedians, liberal or conservative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t love Trump.  Just don&#39;t listen to BS theories and witch hunts. It makes improving the country much more difficult.  And if you were to watch the project veritas videos or come to DC and talk to anyone on capitol hill or in politics you would find the both these groups and the media all know this is being done for sensationalist purposes.  I don&#39;t think our country should be hurt for ratings or grandstanding.  I&#39;m not at all saying he doesn&#39;t give a fuck, I&#39;m saying he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.  He has no idea about the pros and cons of net neutrality outside of what he&#39;s told.  This holds for every topic.  </p>

<p>Bill Maher is a womanizing disgusting human being that rationalizes pedophilia and is known as a scumbag in hollywood and politics.  You may like his show or opinions but he is objectively a gross person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t label something as misinformation just because you&#39;re misinformed. </p>

<p>The legal implications of reclassifying particular companies as common carriers as defined in Title II of the <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">Telecommunications Act of 1934</a> has more going for it than just the extra 400 pages of micromanagement that Wheeler added. This the same doc that let&#39;s the FCC fine TV stations for nipple slips and defines &#39;obscenity&#39; for the American public and let&#39;s the FCC fine entities based upon content. It&#39;s opens the door to declaring it a public service to filter &#39;fake news&#39; and maintain black lists as they do in the UK. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, no one giving the FTC any credit. Here&#39;s their <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/fy-2018-congressional-budget-justification/2018-cbj.pdf">2018 budget</a>; feel free to just control-f, &#39;privacy&#39; and see if you can get a sense for which Government agency is actually doing this sort of work across every other company, including competitors of those included in Title II. They even have their own conference &#39;PrivacyCon&#39;. </p>

<p>It also doesn&#39;t give the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/current-and-recent-cases">DOJ</a> or the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-announces-lawsuit-against-spectrum-time-warner-cable-and-charter">work of the 50 State AG&#39;s</a> any credit either. </p>

<p>And the joke is Title II blocks any FTC investigations into anti-competitiveness, deceptive advertising as well as any privacy violations effectively allowing the FCC to play favorites with their cronies in the industry. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, we&#39;re paying billions in fees for all of the overhead all this regulation creates and Internet competition sucks compared to other countries; wireless too, want to guess why? If barriers to entry are removed new business and services will be created to address and innovate the market. There is no chance for that path with increased government regulation; there never is.</p>
