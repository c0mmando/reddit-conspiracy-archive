        Compilation of main ideas of Luciferianism:
Material world is an illusionary world.
Every being must escape material world by all costs(drugs, alcohol, suicide).
Golden billion concept is the ultimate way of removal of 7 billion souls from material plane.
They teach that material world is the world of suffer so you should escape into original one source from here.
I could bring more information here but overall life in material plane is the ultimate way of manifestation, shaping matter and mastering it. Not every soul is deserved to be born in material plane. Lots of  ideas above were found in "accidental discovery" of so called gnostic scriptures.

Invented sattelites map which now everyone uses in GPS, Google maps etc.
They've made a broadcast of "human landing on moon".
They've forced then tons of movies of ET through Universal corporation.
GE almost completely owns every industry in Iraq after the war.
GE was the company which electrified USSR.

       Why Hinduism? Why not every abrahamic organized religion? Clearly the Roman Catholic Church and Islam are pushing an agenda of subversion (so sorta Luciferian), but Hinduism?

       Every religion which says that material plane is irrelevant and you should nullify your karma and escape it is the Luceferian agenda. In Rosicrucian Kaballah Luceferian way is considered to be a desire of every soul to be in absolute nirvana which basically means stagnation. Hinduism is very close in it's teaching to every esoteric teaching like jewish kaballah, gnosticism etc. Basically it says that your goal is "to become God and leave this place for good".

       I completely agree. Just found it interesting that out of all world religions you mentioned Hinduism so specifically.

      <p>
       If you ask me, all organized religion in any form is a complete sham. We drifted too far away from the original, sober and simple teachings.

       You just have to understand that I don't say that Luciferian agenda is wrong. I don't know honestly. As there was a reason for human to be born in material plane there is also agenda for them not to be born. I don't know which one is right as it requires much more study before I can come to any significant conclusion. You can also check out some of me previous posts here:

       I've decided not to post anything new there for a while because I need more study before I can produce anything useful. Just check threads which I've started/

       jesus originally taught that his kingdom would be on earth and he would be king of a new just society where the rich would be overthrown. this prophecy failed and he died on the cross. later the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed by the romans and it looked like maybe jesus was right it just took a while, Christianity took over the roman empire. That was the kingdom on earth. then roman empire collapsed. Catholic church got corrupt. Centuries of dark ages. But Jesus may return, that is the prophecy anyway.

       Here is some more knowledge for you.... Jesus didn't really die on a cross. This is fiction which was thought up and taught by none other than.... The Roman Catholic church! The cross idea came from ancient Egyptian Sun god worship. LOOK IT UP.

       True but he did NOT die on a cross. The cross is a pagan symbol from ancient Egypt sir. He died on a tree. Read the book of Deuteronomy and u will see it with your own eyes.

       "kingdom on earth and would rule over a just society... etc etc" -- That's the second coming.  He came here first to die for us so that through him we may all be saved and be a part of the kingdom to come.  He brought about a new covenant, making old one obsolete.  The Jews rejected him, but they always mess up the first time.  They'll acknowledge he is the Messiah at the start of the second coming.  Due to their rejection of him, he said they would be scattered.  70 AD- The temple is destroyed and they, following the old covenant, had no way to sacrifice lambs to God, this no way to be forgiven for sin.  Easy solution - believe in Jesus!  But, they still refused and were forced to alter the religion, basing salvation doctrine on the opinions of their ancestors (Talmud), not the infallible Word of God.  It's not too late, Jews.  Jesus loves you.

       jesus believed in Talmud and said to follow law of moses. paul didn't want to preach that because it was too hard to get gentiles to convert to Judaism. Jesus brother James kept the true church of Jesus going but he was ignored in catholic history because they wanted to say Mary was a virgin forever so why would Jesus have a brother.

       Fair point. I'll go after sources myself. I realize it is pretty spoilt to demand all sources for a meta-post like this. Your post struck my interest to delve further, which I suppose was your goal.

       It does not matter where and how you study. You can watch podcasts, read books, read articles, watch videos or anything else. At some point after you havve done this for a long time eventually you will be able to easily filter the wrong information from the correct one because it will easily contradict with everything else you have studied. So after this it does not matter what is the source of your information. Only if you are just beginning to dive into it then it will be easier to start with trustful sources so you won't be derived to a wrong way.

       How is it spoiled to demand sources on a cobbled together like this? A scientific paper is able to list dozens of sources with citations to specific pages and facts that are directly used to support an argument. Saying you have to google it yourself just means you will make up your own crap to connect the dots in a way that may seem convincing but is not based on any evidence whatsoever.

       You will go there by your own will if you are ever ready for that. If not then it means that your life is about something else. I have 0 profit from convincing you into something which you don't believe in. So in your case it will be better just to continue your normal way of life.

       Out of all this list I am kinda not so sure only in Reptillian&amp;Grey - demon, gin agenda as information is kinda controversial but most likely true so I've decided to put it here. Other than that all the other facts can be easily proven even by yourself just google it. You will get a lot of facts and proofs.

       Just recently I found out that Moses held the Israelites in the desert for 40 years to let the original generation die off and the offspring could be indoctrinated into Judaism easier. The originals weren't taking well to his BS religion crafting and slid back to worship of the bull, under Moses' brother Aaron's watch.

       If you could elaborate on the Reptilian/Grey stuff that would be great. It has never really captivated me but if there are good avenues of research I would like to know.

       Most of the jews are victims of egyptian priests. Not only Moses completely erased their history and culture and replaced it with new goals &amp; targets. He introduced circumcision on 8th day and it's basically circumsion of soul because done so early human spiritual body is not completely established at that point. Originally it was the same for muslims but they have moved it far later when boy is at least 7 to 9 years at earliest and about 12-14 at latest. 
The reptillian&amp;grey is the most complicated point in research because there are simply a lot of absolute fiction &amp; ufology. You should start your study with greys and I guess good entry point for you would be gnostic archons. Reptillians are even more complicated. You should study sumerian culture a bit, you may start  with Zacharia Sitchin as introduction but please take into account that Sitchin translation is the false translation. It just will be a good entry point to overall story. Read about Ouroboros and then go into egyptian ancient mythology. Then there will be a lot of stories of inerbreeding of reptillian with humans at early stages being done in egypt mostly which actually was the reason why jews as egyptian slaves were selected for all this.

       Yeah the idea of an 80 year old man leading an entire culture of people through a desert for 40 years so that the "original generation can die off" really sounds like it has a lot of weight behind it.

       Money does lose value though the better term is purchasing power. You simply cannot buy the same amount of stuff with $10 now as you could in 1910. Therefore $10 is now worth less.

       Inflation is caused by the increase in money supply be that via debt or govt stimulus.

       Inflation is not the tool the elites use to take money off people that's called fractional reserve banking and inflation is merely a symptom of this system.

       Current system of debt is based on creating money out of nowhere. You have something which costs X and you take a loan for X + %. This % comes out of nowhere. Interest rate is unnatural to this case as it is produced from nowhere. Nor from the object cost nor from the time someone put to work. Debt system creates inflation due to interest rate. That is the reason you cannot buy the same amount of stuff as it was in 1910. Not because money "naturally" lose value but because of trillions of debt which was artifically created. The central point of this system is Basel in Switzerland.

       Wrong. The interest rate is determined by the level of risk associated with the borrower. If there was no reward for lending money no would do it and the rich would be even richer. Im no fan of credit but it does distribute wealth in some way. For example I borrow £10,000 to start a business if that is succesful I end up far better off than if I never had the 10k to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think you are trying to say is that inflation is needed to repay all of the debt. This is true but this mechanism works because the value of money is decreasing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not all debt is created out of nothing most debt is in the form of bonds. Bonds are purchased with money then the issuer pays interest until maturity when they pay the original amount back. You are thinking of unsecured loans, secured loans and mortgages.

       Money does lose value though the better term is purchasing power. You simply cannot buy the same amount of stuff with $10 now as you could in 1910. Therefore $10 is now worth less.

        Well, again it requires a lot of different information to study. Google for "Saturn original sun" "saturn hexagon" "Saturn black cude" etc. and you will find a lot of information that Saturn is EL is an ancient hebrew God which they praised most and keep praising on Satur(n)day with black cubes all over. It was considered to be exampliery Sun but later derived into Satan on celestial level. Main goal is to explode plutonium in Saturn atmosphere to ignite it once again as a second sun in our sky.
If you want to go directly without any background knowledge then google for "project lucifer cassini" and you will find some articles as old as 2008 but it will sound as nonsense to you if you won't study the story above.

       Very interesting, thanks for sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article I read says that Saturn cannot become a star because
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         it is too small to support nuclear fusion
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         it is extremely lacking in flammable material for nuclear fusion to occur.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also 30kg of plutonium (in Cassini, safely organized/separated) is not nearly enough to have any noteworthy impact. There are plenty of naturally occurring explosions and collisions, such as massive comets, that cause nothing close to converting planets to stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems completely non feasible to me, but I love learning about conspiracies like this one. Luckily we will get to see for ourselves in September if another sun is noticable.

       Yes, I agree that the outcome is not clear yet. However, if you take into account previous paragraph you will find out that Saturn is not a gas giant but a brown dwarf star which lost it's heat through centuries and in such case this whole story goes in a different way. As I told you you should check the Saturn theories.

       Gas giants have some of the characteristics of brown dwarfs. Like the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn are both made primarily of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is nearly as large as Jupiter, despite having only 30% the mass. Three of the giant planets in the Solar System (Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune) emit much more heat than they receive from the Sun.[25] And all four giant planets have their own "planetary systems"—their moons. Like stars, brown dwarfs form independently, but lack sufficient mass to "ignite" as do stars. Like all stars, they can occur singly or in close proximity to other stars. Some orbit stars and can, like planets, have eccentric orbits.

      <p>
       The very first bullet point is incorrect. Those designations "slavic, nordic, black, arabic etc." are just as arbitrary as countries and hold no real meaning. The dividing line between black and white is just as random and meaningless a classification as the border between nations.

       These are indication of genoms. Slavic nation for example possess a very different genom which NOONE other than Slavic nation has. If you are into modern "no borders, race mixing, we are all human" agenda then you are very wrong. Bloodline genoms are very important and they affect human behavior in a huge way. Countries on the other hand may have genetically almost identical people separated by an artificial line or could have genetically very different people live in the same country.  Your interest worth something only to you and worth nothing to anyone else. As you don't even exist for 99% people of this topic. Your opinion is an opinion and you have a free will to live by what you believe in.

       The Slavic genome is gonna have a whole bunch of everything from Mongolian to Jewish. More importantly the slight physical differences which we are trained to see as larger than they are are not indicative of different ethnicities being different mentally.

       Here it is. Slavic is R1A. You can believe in Mongolian to Jewish mixup as much as you want but you won't find concentration of R1A so high as dominant anywhere in the world. Search for USA or EU haplogroups if you want.

       This information is not intended for everyone. If someone is already on the path he won't find any new information. Considering all the information I've went through I am surprized all the time when people do not know that or think that it is not true.

       Red pill is waking someone up, if they are "on the path" it means they are woken up and actively investigating and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing here is going to wake anyone up. It's a list of things with no sources is all I'm saying. It's not red pilling anyone and it definitely shouldn't be described as "ultimate".

       These are some points of interest. You get one you are interested in and research which will basically be an entry point. Our universe does not work in the way that someone will be forced into knowledge and understanding of any process. This information is enough to begin. If they want sources, proofs and tons of text then they are not ready and do not seek to know the truth. Truth can only be found by oneself and cannot be given by another.

       Because they want to convince someone in their own opinion or they are payed shills which want you to have a specific impression or specific attitute towards specific occurence. Most of the threads here and over the whole internet are mass media social programming. I am not forcing anyone into believing in anything. I just gave a quick compilation of thousands of days of research. If anyone is interested in anything then his self-eduction journey begins. If not then it's not for him. It's simple. I don't benefit from others believing into anything only you can benefit from your own self-study.

       Not forcing anyone to believe anything but call it the ultimate red pill thread? You claim people shouldn't be spoon fed and should do their own research, yet you feel the need to spoon feed us a list of things to research? You don't cite sources because you claim people use sources (facts) to shill and program people?

       I am on the opposite surprised when people think that this does not happen. Read about Moloch ritual:

       Basically it was practiced by some jewish/israel tribes which were considered to be a "sect". Now their descendants still practice it and are obliged to do it. Read about pizzagate if you want or what it takes to switch from 32 degree mason to 33 degree mason or how influencial corporate people in western world are obliged to do it along with politicians. You can only believe in it once you start searching into it and find the outcome by yourself. There is no way that someone else can give you what will resonate with you.

       If your aim is to convince people that the world is not controlled in the manner it's presented, then I think what the user @lucydaydream is pointing out is that going in with ritual murder of children is likely to get people dismissing you. Despite what you think might be happening with regards to Pizzagate, without proof in terms of convictions or people coming forward to say their child has been eaten by elites and can offer some sort of paper trail then most people will regard it as fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your aim is to convince people of something then why not start by talking about how is it that there are so many recorded cases of pedophilla that were covered up (former Prime Minster, Ted Heath, and Jimmy Saville to name just two). In my opinion, it would be more effective to get people to agree in small increments. From there you can maybe start to ask them if there's anything they personally question about what the mainstream narrative tells us. I just think people will switch off and not be "red-pilled" if you go in guns blazing and saying "everything you believe is a lie". People will just react against that and find it jarring that you're trying to dismantle everything in which they believe or trust. Obviously, feel free to ignore me and I might very well be wrong and this reaction hasn't been what you've typically experienced when you've approached people with similar info.

       My intention is different from both. Your example is the desire for change. I do not desire to change anything as anything that happens happens by will of God. If something what happens I do not like that does not mean that it's going to happen to me or that I should do anything about it. I have simple stated the facts.I do not want to start a revolution of thought or create an army of followers as I am going to die quite soon. Once I die only I will remain with me and nothing else than me matters. Before that I can force people into study but I will never force them into taking sides. Jehovah is as better than Lucifer as Lucifer as better than Jehovar. They are the same  but I am not going into their matter-soul transformation machine. I have my own route in the middle and I do not seek to save nor to doom anyone. For myself there is noone except me but I live for everyone except myself. That's what I find out after everything I've studied.

       Ultimately yes. It is as you have described. In jewish Kaballah there is a book of Zoar which basically describes that every being goes from -desire to recieve for itself - desire to reject for itself - desire to reject for God - desire to recieve for God. Process of change from creature for creator. That's how they call it.

       Ok, that's cool. I think the "red-pill" terminology to me connotes trying to give something to someone that changes them (in this case, information, rather than an actual pill as in The Matrix). That was my main reason for questioning your tactics as I associate "red pill" with trying giving information to someone with the aim of making them change their minds. I respect your position though. I sometimes wonder why I bother to offer information that might change someone's mind, I guess it's because I think that some of the changes could lead to people being kinder to each other and more human.

       With regards to Lucifer, is there even a Lucifer in The Bible? From talking to some people I know who studied ancient and medieval history, Lucifer is a mistranslation of something. Isn't it the morning star and Jesus is also referred to by that title? I was told that "the morning star" referred to a Babylonian king and is used to describe a title, so "morning star" is essentially saying that Jesus is someone who should be considered by people to be of a "worthy" background. I don't know enough about The Bible, but have you heard that point of view before and would you disagree with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly think there is good and evil in the world. Have you seen Jordan Peterson's lectures on The Bible? He is a Christian, but seems to come from a quite unique position of saying that The Bible is a collection of stories humanity created in order to make sense of the world. You might not agree with him, but I found his ideas quite interesting and helped me to understand why The Bible has had just a lasting and powerful impact

       I am not Christian. Bible is not a compilation of human stories but a jewish history created out of middle-eastern historic books and teachings. Lucifer terminology can be applied to a lot of things because it translates as a light-bearer but in my context it means that Lucifer is the idea of light(soul) escaping matter(dark). Red pill was just a context name.

       How is the bible a Jewish history created out of middle eastern historic books and teachings when your post says that Jews are an artificial nation? That sound's contradictory.

       I did not completely understand your second question.
      </p>
      <p>
       For first question you may start your study with Madeline Maccann which was probably obducted by Podestas:

       MC1R
The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is primarily responsible for determining whether pheomelanin and eumelanin is produced in the human body. Research shows at least 10 differences in MC1R between African and chimpanzee samples and that the gene has probably undergone a strong positive selection (a selective sweep) in early Hominins around 1.2 million years ago.[32] This is consistent with positive selection for the high-eumelanin phenotype seen in Africa and other environments with high UV exposure.[30][31]

       Please quote me a single sentence or even a single word which indicates that I treat human beings like animals. If you think that I have a problem with "black" people then you are wrong because I live in Russia and I meet them very rarely + Russian history never had black "slaves" so we never had this problem at first place. Whatever you get from my conclusion is mirroring of your impression out of my words due to mass media propaganda. There was not a single clue that one haplogroup matters more than the other but a simple fact and an example of Slavic haplogroup as I myself belong to this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I am ready to apologize for anything which humiliated or insulted anyone "to make me feel comfortable" but please quote this from my words first.

       Umm why would someone want to be "Redpilled" on this sub. Are we admitting that it's just a right wing propaganda factory now? This is supposed to be a conspiracy sub, not leaning in any particular political direction.

       Wait so what happens to Jews when they die? Are they part of the Luciferian agenda or do they get some sort of special treatment?

       I am not offering you anything except your own journey to find the truths. I do not offer you anything at all. If you pay attention to your own comments you will figure out that you have concetrated only on one point out of the whole list which is even not as important as some of the others. Sorry if I offended you by any way.

       MC1R
The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene is primarily responsible for determining whether pheomelanin and eumelanin is produced in the human body. Research shows at least 10 differences in MC1R between African and chimpanzee samples and that the gene has probably undergone a strong positive selection (a selective sweep) in early Hominins around 1.2 million years ago.[32] This is consistent with positive selection for the high-eumelanin phenotype seen in Africa and other environments with high UV exposure.[30][31]

       I am not Christian. Bible is not a compilation of human stories but a jewish history created out of middle-eastern historic books and teachings. Lucifer terminology can be applied to a lot of things because it translates as a light-bearer but in my context it means that Lucifer is the idea of light(soul) escaping matter(dark). Red pill was just a context name.

       True but he did NOT die on a cross. The cross is a pagan symbol from ancient Egypt sir. He died on a tree. Read the book of Deuteronomy and u will see it with your own eyes.
