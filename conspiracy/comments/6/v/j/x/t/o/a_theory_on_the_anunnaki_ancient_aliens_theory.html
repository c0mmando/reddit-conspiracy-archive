        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So a common theme in the ancient aliens theory is that humans were created as slave labor to mine precious resources, namely gold, for the Anunnaki.  It is thought that this gold was transported off earth and used for what ever purposes they needed it for back on their home planet.</p>

<p>What if that was not the case?  What if it was horded on earth then used to create a world banking system.  What if our earliest ancestors were used as slave labor to further ensure their enslavement long after any physical (or at least blatantly physical) presence was needed.</p>

<p>To me this theory seems much more plausible than transporting a heavy metal through vast distances across space.  Just something to think about.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with the whole theory is that if Enki and his peoples needed gold dust to live and they came to Earth to &quot;farm&quot; it, so to speak, why didn&#39;t they take it all?  Why would they stop?  Certainly they would have known that it is not essential to our survival.  </p>

<p>They apparently had enough hubris to create a slave race but were kind enough to leave gold behind, for what?</p>

<p>Mr Sitchin has devoted an enormous amount of time and effort in his research and it is not in vain, but the theory has multiple holes in it even to a layman.</p>

<p>First off Enki and his peoples had enough technology to visit another planet on another star system but lost the instructions on how to extract the one element that would keep them safe from their sun&#39;s radiation??????</p>

<p>The names and times have changed and whatnot over time, but the general idea is correct.</p>

<p>The Draco (alien lizard dudes) setup the financial system and also the Illuminati system to manage it. </p>

<p>Humans dug up the gold and it was horded.</p>

<p>Its the secret foundation for global financial system even today but is all off leger.</p>

<p>A couple names for it are the Global Collateral Accounts or World Trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have mastered the ability to travel vast distances across space, why exactly would you need slave labor? Or even slaves for that matter?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already reached the point where we can automate 90+% of our labor (we don&#39;t cuz... capitalism), so it seems pretty ludacris! to assume such advanced aliums would need to enslave another race. There&#39;s litterally <strong>billions</strong> of other planets (and civilisations likely, in the heliocentric universe) they could raid.</p>

<p>Or maybe that&#39;s it, they&#39;ve enslaved the entire universe, and we&#39;re completely oblivious to it.</p>

<p>Also, as for gold being valuable: according to current mainstream science, it&#39;s perfectly possible to simply create gold out of different materials. (Silver, iron, you name it, if it has protons, neutrons and electrons, you can play-doh away)</p>

<p>Even us, pity, humans can do just that; We don&#39;t cuz... capitalism; it&#39;s way too costly to &quot;force&quot;-create atoms, but it&#39;s technically feasable, and has been done in the past. (So alchemy is essentially possible, just not practical)</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a good chance there&#39;s planets <em>filled with gold</em> out there in the Universe. Why? Because... Chance... And again a billion billion billion planets out there. I&#39;ve read countless science articles (NASA and stuff) and all the exotic planets that <em>should</em> be out there (Diamond planets!!!), simply due to sheer chance, and there being near infinite planets.</p>

<p>No matter how you twist or try to force the alien question into any kind of mental excercise, the truth is that there is no evidence to substantiate (intelligent) life on other planets, it&#39;s all just theorycraft, and it doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>Fermi paradox says hi, and once your eyes are opened it makes a whole-lotta-more sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to say maybe our logic is flawed.  Like with the alchemy example maybe it is not as economically feasible to transport mining equipment and personnel across space to mine a precious resource.  Slave labor sure is cheap.  I&#39;m not saying I believe in this necessary but if you prescribe to the ancient aliens theory (to which there are some interesting peculiarities) I feel this is a more plausible theory.</p>

<p>I think it incredibly egotistical and closed minded to say that the question of aliens doesn&#39;t make sense.  The Fermi paradox is flawed IMO because it involves human logic, maybe the reason no aliens have visited and said hey here I am is because they do not think like us and don&#39;t particularly want to.</p>

<p>All just things to think about my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the initial paragraph for the human race in it&#39;s current stage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a whole different thing to talk about civilisations which, in this case, are well over 200,000 years more advanced that us. I&#39;ve seen numbers between 200,000 and millions of years being thrown around, the 200,000 having some ground in reality:</p>

<p><em>I believe a couple years back I read an article which provided decent (in my mind) evidence to support ancient gold mines in Africa; which were roughly dated back 200,000-300,000 years.</em></p>

<p>I now know carbon dating, or any kind of &quot;determining age&quot;-technique isn&#39;t as <em>sciency</em> as I would like it to be, so the numbers are likely off. (Greatly, lel, take my word for it)</p>

<p>Either way, mainstream science, other planets and aliums yada yada:</p>

<p>You have to try and imagine the things such civilisations are capable off. We can&#39;t even space travel, yet we can built robots that could potentially automize 100% of labor (but we don&#39;t :( ). We&#39;re on the edge of creating a new kind of infinite resource that&#39;s world-breaking (AI), or so we&#39;re led to believe; but we can&#39;t reach Mars.</p>

<p>We can even, de facto, create new materials (or old ones) from the basic building blocks of matter (pro, ele, neutron); but we can&#39;t reach Low Earth orbit.</p>

<p>I say those things to put things into perspective; even according to current mainstream science (which is capapble of all those astonishing things), we&#39;re a loooooong way away from reaching the stars.</p>

<p>These civilisations have mastered that; Easily.</p>

<p>So to then go back to having discussions about them needing gold, or labor just seems ridiculous to me.</p>

<p>Recall also an interview with (a woman?) working in the financial sector, saying she witnessed uncommonly tall, odd looking beings participating in higher end meetings, but now can&#39;t find anything. </p>

<p>As for entertaining the possibility of the whole Annunaki lore being real and the question of <em>why did they leave gold behind?</em>, well, who knows just <em>how much was here to being with.</em> Maybe the big motherlodes exploited here are but the scraps that remained in the cracks after they plundered the real haul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banking doesn&#39;t rely on anything other than belief a resource is scarce. Bitcoin, cash, tally stick, or rare minerals.  Look at Diamonds which are plentiful but remain valuable. </p>

<p>Banking in all forms is corruptive no matter the (debt) instrument, because it reduces things with intrinsic value (labor, objects) to non intrinsic.  When non intrinsic value can be created from nothing, you have banking (from the last several thousand years).   </p>

<p>Economies produce scarcities which drive production (slave wage labour) and create caste systems from which we have all lived for thousands of years. </p>

<p>There is no way to back out of this system without a complete overhaul of society and most would reject this thought. </p>
