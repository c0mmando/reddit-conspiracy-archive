       Yeah, it's become a parody of itself recently with lots of posts from people that don't understand what they are reading. It used to be a great place to gets some digs into some edge lords. They still have a fair amount of quality content but too many people have turned it into just an anti-vocabulary space rather than the cringe it is known for.

       Him being a liar doesn't mean the media isn't lying about him alot. Just like the media hates his lies about them doesn't mean they are lying. They both happen to lie about the other quite a bit.

        Whataboutism:  is a propaganda technique formerly used by the Soviet Union in its dealings with the Western world, and subsequently used as a form of propaganda in post-Soviet Russia.

       No, whataboutism is just the fallacy "Tu Quoque" and has existed since the first sibling argument in history let alone before Russia. The reason you call it "whataboutism" is because if you were to read the definition of Tu Quoque you would discover that invoking it is your agreement that you are being a hypocrite but that the other person hasn't acknowledged your own point. This completely made up "whataboutism" only shows your own ignorance of logic, your inability to rationalize your own views, and your complete subjection to group think. Good luck with that.

       You never actually answered anyone. You first blamed the media (in a blanket statement no less) for doing the same thing as Trump, despite providing no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, to me, you argued that your "whataboutism" wasn't that, despite it looking exactly like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I will stage the first question again, and we will see if you can answer without bringing another entity into it. Does Donald Trump care about the truth?

       You just mentioned a name dude, no link or anything. You didn't cite shit.

       Here, this is how you cite a source.

      <blockquote>

        It will be seen that, as used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yet underneath all this mess there does lie a kind of buried meaning. To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy to point out and not easy to explain away, between the régimes called Fascist and those called democratic. Secondly, if ‘Fascist’ means ‘in sympathy with Hitler’, some of the accusations I have listed above are obviously very much more justified than others. Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word ‘Fascist’ in every direction attach at any rate an emotional significance to it. By ‘Fascism’ they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.

       Well, I think those users recognize the Fascism in the left that those on the left are unaware of just as you've pointed out how unaware the fascists on the right are unaware of their own teams Fascism.

       Status quo:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Perpetual war that serves weapons contractors and the crony government while maintaining the petro-dollar. Ever expanding "defense" budget for our "protection".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The drug war that fuels the Fascist police (who enforce the POLICy of the US corporation) ever increasing militarization and also feeds into the prison industrial complex; import and distribute the drugs uses to fuel it (ain't no Uzi's made in Detroit; ain't no poppy fields)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Let no tragedy, whether orchestrated or not, go to waste; use it to justify stripping and infringing on people's rights in the name of their protection
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The debt economy; when we "balance the budget" it doesn't mean we aren't accumulating debt, congress just approves a larger budget. Ever expanding federal government. Secondary education tuition cost increases exponentially because naive 18 year olds can just take higher and higher loans from the government so University's can expand and hike up the prices. Federal Reserve creates money our of thin air and adds it to combined debt of the citizenship via interest rates but no one will touch ending the Fed Res or even re-instating Glass-Steagal.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Create regulations and incorporate special interests into policy that benefits those who have the money, connections, and access to successfully lobby for them... often at the expense of people who now have to cut through even more red tape to try to compete. Never mind known harmful things to people and the environment like glycosphate, atrazine, and other toxins, that would hurt corporate bottom lines.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Give big Pharma a great seat at the table, only they are allowed to determine how people can choose to medicate themselves and what doctors can prescribe... I mean, getting hooked on opiates is better than smoking a plant to help with your chronic conditions caused by a toxic food supply and the side effects from your other prescriptions, right?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Plenty more that I'm missing off the top of my head.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that all government is corrupt, or there aren't good people in government. We've just become so bloated and laden with bureaucracy that government attracts the worst people for the jobs. I really believe we are living in a Kakistocracy... though it's not like this is anything new. I just wish more people would come together along the big injustices rather than tear each other apart over the often manufactured little things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again most people prefer comfort and safety freedom. That is until they have neither.

       That's not true. Lots of races (Indians, Chinese) like trump. Trump did better than most republicans with minorities like Latinos and blacks. And most of all, there are tons of white people who hate him!!! The whole white vs the world concept is just divisive bullshit.

       It would be great if people who spoke of fascism actually did just a little bit of research into it.  Here's a primer:
      </p>
      <p>
       The roots of fascism lie in the National Syndicalism movement of the early 1900's.  They wanted National Socialism (that should sound familiar) headed by a monarch.  This is why they were considered right wing.  Monarchism was right wing.  Rebublicanism, democracy, and other forms of self governance were considered left wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialism was Marxism with Marx's class warfare ideology replaced with nationalism.  Instead of poor vs. rich, it was German vs. non-German.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's fascism.  When people ask, "How could the National Socialist German Workers Party be right wing?", now you can answer them, with Mussolini's own words.  "Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fascism = Authoritarian Marxism, which is what leftists are pushing right now.  Fascism is left wing.

       I'm a bit disappointed (but not surprised) the comments have been tangents regarding the definition of fascism and to "who" it properly applies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say I've kept up on all current political topics, so in case there is anybody more knowledgeable than (I who is interested in answering and rationally speculating):
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Is there anything Trump said, regarding Joe Arpaio, that is factually incorrect, embarrassing, wrong, etc? By this I mean beyond someone's viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Was there anything said, that was only good or ideal to those people in attendance and/or those who watched it live? Is there any reason to edit the record, for either pro- or anti- Trump camps? Or divisions within the pro-Trump camp? (In other words, is there any reason to block Trump's comments from other non-Arizona, Internet Trump supporters?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons to doubt this was intentionally done by someone with a pro-Trump agenda:
      </p>
      <p>
       -It is a hard, very noticeable edit. Such would be sloppy and amateurish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasons to speculate this was intentionally done by a pro-Trump agenda:
      </p>
      <p>
       -The edited content is lengthy, and seems to cut out a very specific chunk of content. It doesn't seem random, nor does it bleed into another subject.
   |
   |___ However, if this is true, then what about this content would make it censor-able, and probably censor-able to their own supporters (the people likely to watch those youtube channels)?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is as far as I can go, and would appreciate anyone who is more current on political affairs and/or with other insight or POVs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Note: Before I watched this speech, I thought it odd that so many other copies had different running times, and that many began at different spots (possibly to make it seem like they are all the same?). When I have some more time, I might try to go back to previous speeches, download multiple copies, play them all at the same time, and see if any go out of sync or skip forward.

       Watching the speech itself, live as it happened, and then seeing the media coverage afterward, it is excruciatingly clear that he was and will continue to be misrepresented.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is that people who do not watch his speeches live, and who rely solely on media coverage for information, are missing out on an important conversation and some hilarious banter.

       We are raising a generation of people who can't handle listening to anything that goes against what they want. That's terrifying to me.

       Oh shut up. Conservatives were bitching about Obama from the moment they woke up to when they went to bed, today they bitch about "not my president" yet they constantly said the same under Obama. Threats against his life were constant in comment section like on fox news. They spawned militia groups that want to remove Obama.

       Yes, they were! They were burning effigies of him and calling him things like "O'bummer" and dragging Michelle through the mud.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here are the important questions: Were they throwing piss bottles at cops? Were they demanding and actually pulling down statues? Were they in the streets saying that "the only good cop is a dead cop"? Were they having a national meltdown?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or were they spreading their message and
       <em>
        using the political process
       </em>
       to get candidates in office who would advance their agenda?
      </p>

       Note the difference.

       Yeah, it's become a parody of itself recently with lots of posts from people that don't understand what they are reading. It used to be a great place to gets some digs into some edge lords. They still have a fair amount of quality content but too many people have turned it into just an anti-vocabulary space rather than the cringe it is known for.
