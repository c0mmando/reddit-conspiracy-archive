        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t anywhere on Reddit yet, or being talked about. </p>

<p>The other day a Reddit user posted a submission to <a href="/r/ModSupport">/r/ModSupport</a> in which they said, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey,</p>

<p>For months now, the r/----------- sidebar has contained the phrase &quot;pachinko machine&quot;, but when I just tried to update the sidebar, I got a &quot;this contains offensive content&quot; error when trying to save the contents.</p>

<p>Could the offensive content filter be tweaked to accommodate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not very aware of what they had just discovered, they asked for the filter to be &#39;tweaked&#39;. </p>

<p>A reddit admin (which I won&#39;t name) responded with, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey XXXXXXX, I&#39;m checking into this error message now and will let you know once I have more info.</p>

<p><strong>update</strong>: This was a mistaken deploy and has been rolled back. Apologies for any confusion this caused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a second...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>...This was a mistaken deploy</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the admin just admit they are in fact rolling out a new &quot;offensive content&quot; filter on Reddit? It seems to be that way. </p>

<p>Another user goes on to say, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So further censoring in the future is what I&#39;m hearing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had no clue what pachinko would be an offensive pejorative for, but now I know. Dirty censoring admins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it contains the word &quot;chink&quot;, which is a racial epithet for Asians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m fairly new to Reddit but damn - if they are going to that length to censor everyone, now would be the time for an different website to rise. This is crazy. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>edit: Yes, I misspelled censors. I honestly couldn&#39;t give a shit. You get the point of the post.</strong></p>

<p>Not censoring racism, spreads racism. Shitty children like you see people screaming about &quot;dindus raping our women&quot; and start repeating that racist bullshit. Normal people, get the fuck out of a community that doesn&#39;t censor racism. The people that remain are racists or soon become racists.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we censor racism, even if it&#39;s just calling someone a chink.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont feel racism should be censored. I dont feel that is a viable reason for censorship. Inciting violence and hating a race are different worlds. Racism is not illegal. If someone wants to hate someone for their color of their skin, they are allowed. I think people like you are the big problem. You get offended by something someone says or thinks and you feel that your feelings matter more than the other persons. </p>

<p>Three racial epithets.  Three false positives on any &quot;automated censoring&quot; system.  And three times that you and anyone who supports blanket censorship fail miserably at life.  </p>

<p>Blanket censorship like this is lazy, stupid, and ultimately does nothing more than irritate the community.

    <div class="md"><p>One person&#39;s crackpot is another&#39;s genius.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the anti-Jew mentality, or anti-Black, or anti-<em>insert_token_race_here</em>, but why would I want to censor those words or ban those ideas and force them underground where they cannot be seen, pointed at, and laughed into oblivion?  Making something &quot;banned&quot; or taboo just drives its supporters beneath the radar.  I would rather the idiots were easy to spot, personally.  So I get called a honky, a cracker, a race traitor, a Libtard by the Right and a Nazi by the Left, who cares?  </p>

<p>Words.  Those are just words, letters arranged in a specific order.  They are not night sticks, batons, baseball bats, axes, bullets, missiles, etc.  They can do no more harm than the words &quot;antidisestablishmentarianism&quot; or &quot;hug&quot;.  If people want to be able to say &quot;chink&quot; as a derogatory term then you can freely label them in RES and filter their comments right out if that&#39;s what you want.  That&#39;s what personal freedom is about, the right to interact how YOU want to interact, when YOU want to interact.  But censorship controlled by others is nothing more than allowing control of your life and my life, both, by some outside force which can be usurped at any time.  </p>

<p>Ultimately the ownership of any website can and will do what they want.  I can&#39;t stop them from censoring anything.  But I also don&#39;t need to stand around and keep quiet as they do it.  The founders of this website, all three of them, at different times have done interviews where they each called Reddit a &quot;bastion of free speech&quot; or a home for free speech.  Censorship flies in the face of that.  I don&#39;t protest the incursion of censorship itself, I protest the statement of free speech followed by censorship for corporate gains.  </p>

<p>If white supremacists bought Reddit tomorrow and banned all non-white users, I&#39;d be just as vocal about that travesty.  If ISIS took over Reddit and banned all non-muslims, again, I&#39;d be vocal.  Reddit was founded on specific principles and, though it has changed since its birth, it should never give up on the underpinning of its creation, which was as a conglomerated news and content amalgamation site with freedom of speech being its core concept.  SJWs are free to sit in their echo chambers and complain about T_D users who are free to sit in their echo chambers and complain about Liberals who are free to sit in their echo chambers and complain about....ad infinitum.  If you don&#39;t like the message of a sub, move subs.  I guarantee there&#39;s one that already polices its comments in the manner in which you prefer without Reddit as a whole rolling out Censorship v.2.0 sitewide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because its not inherently dangerous or offensive nor does it cause pain to someone. It is considered a slur or curse word simply becajse someone at some point decided it was. We can all agree that child porn is inherently offensive and disgusting by nature. Words are not. Words are only offensive to those that are offended by them. You can call me a cracker, honmy, faggot, shithead, cocksucker, and so on and i would never be offended because words do not offend me. Maybe a persons mentality is offensive. But the words themselves are only offensive because some sensitive folks somewhere in history were offended by the letters that were coupled together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the thread reached /all and I felt like commenting and pointing out that you guys are nuts for believing shit that cannot happen. The smoking gun was supposed to be the basement inside the pizza parlor. That was supposed to be the thing that put them away, because there would be some evidence left behind for a CSI to get.</p>

<p>The smoking gun doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s no basement. So what do you guys do? You move the goalposts. The picture that was supposed to be the basement of the pizza parlor becomes a picture of a basement in one of his other properties. You guys literally just move the goalposts, and eventually one of his buildings will have a basement, and that&#39;s when you guys shriek &quot;We found it!&quot;</p>

<p>You guys push shit like this, and then some poor soul believes it and takes a gun into the pizza parlor. The only reason that happened is because you crazy motherfuckers just make shit up. You&#39;re not concerned with the truth. This sub, like <a href="/r/uncensorednews">/r/uncensorednews</a>, is a hiding place for alt-righters. I&#39;ll stand up and speak against the alt-right any day, since I see them as just about the worst kind of person. Yeah, I think you&#39;re all pretty big shit stains and this website would be better off without you guys. You make any place you go to that much shittier.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the biggest problem with you guys. If someone isn&#39;t with you, they&#39;re against you and they stand with your enemies. That&#39;s not how reality works. Saying &quot;Not A&quot; does not mean &quot;B&quot;, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any of you to understand how logic works, because if you did you wouldn&#39;t be pushing dumb conspiracy theories that do not comport with reality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to think that you guys are just shit humans without needing to prop anyone else up as the gold standard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what the msm wants it to be</p>

<p>Comet ping Pong basement is a very convenient ploy to discredit any and all claims of elites being involved in pedo rings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fake news. There is no evidence there was ever anything going on in their basement. The owner had some very distasteful and borderline cp stuff on his Instagram sure but that should mean the focus is on the owner and his acquaintences that left strange comments on the photos of kids like #chickenlover </p>

<p>So basically Alefantis has gotten a total pass by the media thanks to the fake distraction they push and claim it&#39;s all debunked 100% so there&#39;s nothing to see here folks</p>

<p>Msm will never talk about all the evidence and arrests that have been made over the last 4 months, or last year, or last 5 years, involving chid kidnapping, un troops raping hundreds of kids over 12 years, Clinton ties to pedophile Epstein, hastert, podestas, Haiti &quot;orphan&quot; traffickers that were pardoned and now work for Amber alert and international committee on missing person, which was created under bill Clinton admin. Theres been celebrities, politicians, prime ministers, Popes, priests, ceos, etc all implicated in numerous countries of vast underage prostitution scandals, uk, New Zealand, Canada, Saudi Arabia, etc that get hushed over very quickly and never brought up again, there&#39;s a good chance there&#39;s cause to investigate how they are connected  and there&#39;s people who are responsible for sourcing and supplying the kids</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you don&#39;t believe things for which there is no evidence. That puts you in a position to believe everything until its been disproven, and that&#39;s not how rational, logical, intelligent people work.</p>

<p>Look, even the link you provide does nothing but make more unsubstantiated claims. There&#39;s no &quot;debunking of the debunking&quot;, there&#39;s simply more assertions. The NY Times actually has credibility, although I know you guys think it&#39;s fake news because you call things you don&#39;t like fake, not things that aren&#39;t real.</p>

<p>See, Pizzagate is fake news. There is nothing based in fact, and everything is based upon unsubstantiated claims. </p>

<p>Why are you so concerned about child sex but you guys aren&#39;t trying to get to the bottom of, say, the Catholic church&#39;s history of protecting pedophile priests? Why are you so focused on Pizzagate, which again has no actual evidence. It&#39;s just a bunch of claims made by alt-righters. </p>

<p>Have you watched Spotlight? That&#39;s how people investigate things like this. You guys want to act like you&#39;re investigative reporters, but you&#39;re not. You&#39;re not looking for the truth, you&#39;re looking to confirm a bias.</p>

<p>So, are you guys still supporting Milo or are you guys doing some hard hitting investigative reporting into his ties with pedophilia and pedophiles? The man has admitted to being at parties where young children were sexually abused. Why aren&#39;t you guys helping him put these pedophiles behind bars? Oh, that&#39;s right, those are also unsubstantiated claims, so you probably are in Milo&#39;s corner on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years ago, it seemed to me that a number of main subs suddenly changed in nature. I can&#39;t remember the specific ones now, maybe <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and similar, but suddenly they changed from being fairly anti-conspiracy to a significant increase in conspiracy related chatter. It felt as if I was being delivered my own custom Reddit worldnews geared to my interests. My thought was: how can I disrupt what is already being disrupted? What if <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is only disrupted for <strong>me</strong>, but it remains the same mainstream pap for everyone else?</p>

<p>This new implementation, from what we&#39;ve seen, only appears to affect the sidebar and possibly some other sub &quot;meta-content&quot;. It&#39;s not something I&#39;m overly worried about at this point, but is something to keep an eye on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, if you write careful enough regular expressions, you can usually make a decent filter, especially if the end rule you want to implement is fairly strict. It&#39;s just when you have a wide open allowable text-space and want to restrict a few words that it ends up being a more of a hassle. </p>

<p>The relatively simple slur filter we have set up here (which doesn&#39;t remove anything, just brings posts to our attention) often gets as many false positives as true positives. </p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#39;ve seen plenty of antifa and anti-trump channels that aren&#39;t &quot;offensive content&quot; gated and some of them have such titles as &quot;Trump is Hitler reincarnated&quot; and &quot;Punch every Trump Supporter you see&quot;.</p>

<p>So for the portion, I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s being removed it&#39;s being &quot;offensive&quot; locked and put behind a &quot;gate&quot; to see forcing you to log in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None, but when you have as much money as google, if you wanted to actually do something, which they claim, propping YT up right now is exactly what they should be doing. Make a statement and do something. I like google, as far as mega corporations go, they&#39;re pretty clean, and the guys at the top are at least diluted into thinking they&#39;re doing good. They should&#39;ve done like apple and made a move where they think it best.</p>

<p>Im not stupid enough to think its a good business move, but without having taken a business course, this still seems stupid. Alphabet does not make a profit off of Youtube right now, and hasn&#39;t since before the whole disaster. YouTube is valuable as an asset, and as I see it, they&#39;re chocking out a community dependant on that asset, and are threatening to glue it&#39;s mouth shut. This could be happening for a few different reasons, but the biggest is MSM is trying to kill Youtube, and is really mad that PewDiePie didn&#39;t keel over and die, and not only that, but as a community, everyone and their mother mocked them for it. If Google just went up and said the right stuff, they could blow it up in MSM again, and get their name back. Backing off like this is just... Grrr.</p>

<p>8 years of Obama and his claims to help them? We now have a more divided nation than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Trump base is nothing but identity politics. The biggest talking point is how bad liberals are. Most of them don&#39;t care that they all got conned because their guy won and it makes liberals mad. </p>

<p>You literally just said you support Trump because Cruz lost and you would never vote for a Democrat. How is the &quot;any Republican &gt; someone else&quot; mentality not identity politics?</p>

<p>Be against Obama based on policies. Sure. That&#39;s normal, natural politics. </p>

<p>Being for Trump, and spouting stuff about your &quot;reality,&quot; is absurd. His/Breitbart&#39;s/Info_Wars&#39;/T_D&#39;s reality is demonstrably false. This is beyond politics. This is just a portion of the American population being played for fools and willingly going along with it and even propagating it. </p>

<p>With everything he&#39;s done/said, if you put a (D) next to his name you can guarantee the Republicans would be screaming &quot;LOCK HIM UP!&quot; I don&#39;t like Hillary, but pretending like he&#39;s better in any sense is just laughable. He&#39;s a different brand of swamp, only he&#39;s manipulating a rabid base of angry Americans much more effectively.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you start this whole conversation by saying liberals don&#39;t understand reality. And now you&#39;re talking about President Clinton being a rapist and (I assume) you&#39;re referring to &quot;PizzaGate.&quot; </p>

<p>You are so deeply indoctrinated that it&#39;s honestly sad. This Trump supporter &quot;reality&quot; is not actual reality, man. Come on. This is propaganda and actually is &quot;Fake News.&quot; You have to see that. Provide a source for either of those things that doesn&#39;t come from some oddball Right-wing propaganda site (InfoWars, Breitbart, etc.) </p>

<p>On top of that, your reason for supporting Trump is that Democrats rely on identity politics, when that is solely what the Trump base employs. Even when I pointed out legitimate concerns, your only response is, &quot;Don&#39;t care. Democrats did it.&quot;</p>

If you hear about a speech from CNN you&#39;ll get a very skewed version and if you hear about it on FOX it&#39;s skewed the other way.

It&#39;s not how it should be, it&#39;s how it is. And looking at the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> shows you pretty quickly how bad crowd sourced vetting is. Every single post on the front page tells you how to feel about the information before they give you the information, and half the time there&#39;s no support for the outrage they&#39;re trying to cultivate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NPR is as good as it gets in the US, at least as of 2011/2012. There was a study showing that FOX and I think MSNBC were worse than no news at all for objective information knowledge, with CNN barely better and NPR with a massive lead. They certainly push an agenda, but it&#39;s the best &#39;main&#39; news source with which to compare, say, the differences between Breitbart and Buzzfeed&#39;s reporting on a given issue or timespan. I feel that we have a duty to look at the media of those to whom we are opposed, in order to understand, empathize, and convince them to believe something more realistic. As a factual resource with minimal propaganda, I&#39;d recommend WNYC of NPR, which can stream from any connected device. The Leonard Lopate show takes callers on all sorts of issues. Indivisible for the first 100 days of Trump takes calls from people of most ideologies, which is I think is 8PM east coast time. Check it out!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The algorithm change favors subs which very infrequently make it to the front page or have never been to the front page at all. It&#39;s why those multi-post thumbnail collage things never get onto the front page in a complete manner anymore. </p>

<p>This prevents a small group of subs (the defaults and a few uber-popular subs) from dominating the front page. But what also happens is that groups that share similar interests but are spread out among numerous subs can get things to the front page frequently without having content come repeatedly from the same sub.</p>

<p>Biggest benefactors of this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Subs of middling size that have things most people find cool.</li>
<li>Porn subs, there&#39;s hundreds of them so getting porn to the front without repeating subs is pretty easy.</li>
<li>Leftist subs, they fracture every time they can&#39;t agree on the smallest thing so there&#39;s plenty of them as well.</li>

<p>Nobody ever suggested that these low-subscriber-count subs were botting, or that reddit was manipulating votes to promote hate against their own CEO - because that would&#39;ve been ridiculous, and this ongoing &quot;anti-Trump&quot; thing is no different.</p>

<p>It is like an excited kid when he runs up to you to tell you something important and exciting but he makes no sense. He needs to take a deep breath and start from the beginning.

<p>So if someone can articulate what reddit is trying to censor and how it works or does not work - that may be a good start. I don&#39;t know what a pachinko machine is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely is. The word chink is a racial slur that was derived during mass Asian emigration, they often found difficulty getting jobs as new immigrants and since a large number came from fishing communities, they began working at fish processing plants. The fish were cleaned, using a machine called the iron chink, that was operated by asians. Chink became a term that was synonymous with &quot;poor, outsider asian&quot;  in that time and then developed to a word with worse connotations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s going nuts over this but let&#39;s put it into a much simpler mindset:</p>

<p>Sub&#39;s that aren&#39;t marked as 18+ will be filtered for these things most likely. This would be the most logical approach.</p>

<p>Reddit suddenly adopting this shouldn&#39;t be a surprise, either, due to the huge backlash against Google/YouTube with their AdSense boycott. If Reddit was to be found doing the same things for hate-subs that are borderline bannable, companies advertising with Reddit will pull out without question because of the YouTube drama.</p>

<p>To be honest, this is not really a conspiracy more then it is damage control. They wouldn&#39;t need to do this if SJW&#39;s and all the shit &quot;media&quot; websites didn&#39;t go full flak cannon on YouTube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the overuse of sjw too, but you are really invalidating the issue. The problem is that the WSJ came out and started this crusade against Youtube, first starting with Pewdiepie and then moving on to bigoted videos that supposedly had advertising on them (they didn&#39;t). This caused advertisers to pull out of Youtube drying up the ad revenue available. The WSJ took Pewdiepie out of context, faked evidence and &quot;called out&quot; and publically shamed companies who didn&#39;t pull their ads. </p>

<p>It&#39;s scummy and is done to make a quick buck off the controversy at the expense of people who rely on Youtube to put food on the table.</p>

<p>Go on European-dominated subreddits and drop subtle redpills.  Don’t use “gas the kikes, race war now”-type rhetoric, obviously. If you must, say “Zionists” rather than “Jews.” Use their hatred of Israel and turn it into hatred of Jewry.  Be subtle, be smart, and be persuasive.  </p>

<p>Sure that&#39;s why subreddits have rules. It&#39;s absolutely in your rights to do it. But if you are in a store and make a silly joke about indian people with a buddy if you and an employee hears you, informs the boss and they expelled you from their restarurant for taking your words out of context and ascribing a racist motive where in reality it wasn&#39;t. The customer can complain about the store moving too far to the tyrannical side.
Also they would lose a lot of customers if language is heavily supervise, just like Reddit would lose its purpose if you can&#39;t make goofy jokes about all races of people. It would stop being fun.</p>

<p>I said racism (according to whose definition?) isn&#39;t the only thing censored elsewhere.  Or here, for that matter, I had a completely innocent exchange removed from <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> earlier.  All I did was object to lumping in the Facebook shooter with the posts featured on <a href="/r/niceguys">/r/niceguys</a>, apparently some fascist mod felt this was unacceptable.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t own this site. I don&#39;t own this site. If you&#39;re unhappy with the site than I suggest you use one of the many other forums out there.</p>

<p>Maybe they have some deceitful plan to censor all of us. Maybe they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason it was stated that it was implemented when it shouldn&#39;t have been is because they haven&#39;t announced it yet. Maybe if/when they do announce it and it makes sense what they are trying to do. And maybe they haven&#39;t announced it yet because it&#39;s not finalized. Did Reddit really get &quot;get caught&quot; doing anything? And if they did, who gives a shit? It&#39;s their site. If they do enough to piss off the user base they will use another, just as has happened with many sites before and will eventually happen with Reddit. But holy shit people need to calm down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Redditor for 3 months knows what he&#39;s talking about right?</p>

<p>Reddit was not intended to be a fully free speech zone at the beginning. I&#39;ve been here since 05/06. In the beginning, it was highly moderated in order to encourage high quality discussions. You weren&#39;t even allowed to shitpost. </p>

<p>You are right that at some point in Reddit history, becoming a free speech zone became a goal/value, which was reflected in a statement by yishan at the time. Obviously, that became untenable for the main stakeholders in Reddit and they shifted away from that.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t going to have free speech unless you are on a fully decentralized platform or a platform that is fully owned by someone with those values as a priority even at the risk of legal liability or losing all mainstream sources of income (mainstream ad networks) or having business vendors and partners cutting ties with them.</p>

They have a you google Voat and the suggestions pop up and one of the first ones are fat people hate (a hate community) and their young women sub which is essentially under aged girls in bikinis which is the closest that pedos can legally get. There&#39;s a reason for some censorship. Some content isn&#39;t okay it have on your site. </p>

<p>Either way the amount of sponsored content and blatant propaganda is atrocious. Its amazing how much &quot;users&quot; complain about the_Donald but no one gives about the absolute circlejerks going on in r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews, etc. Fuck the mods of those awful subs (some defaults) and fuck the admins for ruining this platform. Soon it will die and they will lose everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because i have every right to express my opinions there. Im not going to stop just because $pez doesnt think conservative opinions matter. Those subs claim to be non bias yet PACs have bought out the mod teams, and bots/shills control the narrative. I will continue to try to redpill anyome i can until the piece of shit admin team bans me. Just wait until their next censorship change comes down.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is Reddit will never be an even playing field for political opinions. Reddit&#39;s userbase is mostly Liberal with a small Conservative portion on the fringes. The_Donald and other subs like it are where the Conservative users congregate, but the Liberal base is spread everywhere else. You can&#39;t change an entire website&#39;s userbase to Conservative much the same way they can&#39;t turn you Liberal. The unfortunate part is that we all can&#39;t discuss things because one side gets defensive and downvotes while the other agrees with whatever the other side disagrees with for the hell of it, and we get a mob mentality situation.</p>

<p>I mostly agree with Liberal standpoints but also agree with some Conservative ones. In the eyes of Reddit though, I&#39;m either ALL Liberal or ALL Conservative. It fucking sucks that this is the way things are.</p>

<p>Sorry I just had to get that off of my chest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have part of that wrong. Most comservative redditors will talk about their ideas and listen to your viewpoints. Liberals, especially those in the subs listed, will just downvote and hide any dissenting opinion. Or the bought and paid for shill mods will shadowban/delete posts that dont fit the blatant anti-trump narrative. Every politic sub on this shit site is an echo chamber now (yes that includes t_D). Dont forget that T_D was formed because of the blatant censorship and Correct The Record presense on r/politics. You (not you individually, the metaphoric you) all hate us so much, after you created us, and empowered us through your inability to have open dialogue. </p>

<p>Bottom line, though, this website is dying. Most dont realize it, but the blatant censorship is exactly the opposite of the principals it was founded on. Just wait, more is coming too. Its only going to get worse, some more impending changes are coming that will pretty much shadow ban conservative viewpoints on the entirety of the site, not just certain cucked subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree that most people on the site will downvote and dismiss any opinion that isn&#39;t their own when it comes to politics; however I don&#39;t really believe that Reddit itself is dying. There are so many other subs that aren&#39;t about politics that even if every politics-based sub was taken down, there would still be a very healthy userbase left over, most of which couldn&#39;t give a crap about politics in general. Even some people I know just filter every political subreddit and enjoy Reddit without them - it&#39;s kinda shitty that they have to do that though, there should be able to be open discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Post about censorship on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> </p>

<p>&gt; Post makes it on the front page of reddit and they still complain about censorship</p>

<p>Look, ok, I know it&#39;s disconcerting to see what can be perceived as censorship, but come on, if reddit is going to put your subreddit on the sidebar and front page of their site and promote you, they&#39;d better be sure that there isn&#39;t anything offensive on that ad.</p>

<p>Free speech is a right, but that doesn&#39;t give you a right a a platform from which to speak.  If you go into a mall and start yelling racist obscenities you will be removed from that mall for public disruption.  This does not in any way mean they are infringing on 1st amendment rights, but that mall has the right to remove you if they wish.</p>

<p>I was a admin on a server we&#39;d ban people for using bigoted slurs as per the rules of the server and IN FACT a rule for posting WITHIN THIS SUBREDDIT.  People would always pull the free speech card, but just like you don&#39;t have any right to come into my personal business and start yelling racial slurs just like you don&#39;t have the right to come into a subreddit and do the same thing, you will be removed or banned and that is solely up to the discretion of the proprietors of said establishments.</p>

<p>Likewise reddit has a right to manage what they advertise on their own site.  Certainly you can be against it based on a moral standpoint, and I&#39;d be very much against large internet domains like YouTube, Twitter, and indeed Reddit to shadowban and/or remove people based on political views, but does that REALLY compare to Reddit making sure whether the subreddits it directly advertises on their site contains offensive content in the ad or not.  I&#39;m just going to go out on a limb here and say no, that&#39;s completely fine for Reddit to do, both legally, and in my view morally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on what they consider &quot;offensive content&quot;, and how people get used to the idea of &quot;offensive content&quot; being censored. The internet is the greatest tool for communication that humanity has ever seen. As people have to go further and further down the rabbit hole to find a place with one can say anything they want, I feel like it starts to lose it value. Reddit of course has the right to do whatever they want. It&#39;s the principle of the idea that is concerning. As people get more and more used to the idea of being censored, god knows what will end up passing as &quot;offensive content&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>selective moderation, even twitter does it.</p>

<p>ever wonder why the same SJW types or users always appear in the comments under a trump tweet?  normally on social media, the first post that is visible gets a lot of traction and visibility.  but in the case of twitter, it&#39;s always the usual suspects that rise to the top.  and it&#39;s always anti-trump.</p>

<p>thats a bit odd, dont you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure if you want to go around reddit posting racist comments you&#39;re free to do so (but will probably be downvoted a lot as well as getting yourself banned from individual subs), but you&#39;re <em>NOT</em> free to create subreddits that extol racist sentiments (see the banning of <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a> and other racist/hate subs for example).</p>

<p>You call it &quot;censorship&quot; (<em>cue dramatic music</em>)... but most people just call it &quot;moderation&quot;. It&#39;s something that has happened on forums and message boards since the internet started.</p>

<p>If you could show that they were &quot;censoring&quot;, say, a politician&#39;s name, or the name of a corporation, stifling genuine discussion of topics that would otherwise be within the community guidelines, then you&#39;d have a point. As it is though I think you&#39;re making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>Chink may be a racial slur in English, along with other meanings that are not offensive, but <em>-chink-</em> is part of words in other languages that have 0 implication of racial slurs against x group.</p>

<p>In Chinese the have a filler word that sounds just like nigger. They seem to use it like um. It has no relation to racism against black people. </p>

<p>Loving the one guy who equates the sexual abuse of children to the use of offensive language. /s</p>

<p>One is rape and rightfully illegal practically everywhere, the other is at most a nasty word in some contexts. </p>

<p>People can be horrible and racist without slurs. </p>

<p>Guess we should go ahead with white washing all literature before the 90s or so. Racism is a part of history. It has been the complete norm through most of human history. Certain words were not anyways used as they are nowadays, such as fag, faggot, etc. But screw Mark Twain. He&#39;s obviously evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s do this. None of what you&#39;ve described is censorship or self-censorship. 
1. That dossier was not suppressed, removed, or censured in any way on T_D. Hell, our entire front page was full of links to it. I first heard about the dossier here. We read it, researched it, &amp;discussed it A LOT. We did not censor the story, we encouraged everyone to discuss it! 
2. That dossier seemed fishy to me from pg.1. From pg.2 on, it was laughable (&quot;several knowledgeable sources&quot;, an anonymous &quot;trusted compatriot&quot;, sources A &amp; B; you could make a drinking game out of how many times they put &quot;(perverted)&quot; after Trump&#39;s name; if this report is about Trump&#39;s activities why&#39;d they mention that they bugged Clinton, but they can&#39;t find embarrassing behavior to hold over her, p1?). This, plus finding it was a 4chan troll, &amp; people mentioned in the dossier were able to prove a number of the information false led me to believe it was false. Stating that opinion does not censure anything or anyone.
3. Of all the criticisms made about T_D, self-censorship is by far the dumbest. Have you been here before? Look around; pick a page, any page. You&#39;ll see we&#39;re so fed up with self-censorship of speech &amp; ideas due to &quot;political correctness&quot;, social fears of being labeled racist, etc. We embrace being a basket of deplorables, because it&#39;s a load of shit. 
- Here&#39;s an example: It is my opinion that men &amp; women are biologically different, voter ID laws are a good idea, &amp; strong border security is vital. There are a lot of subs that would label me a self-hating anti-feminist, misogynistic, sexist, islamaphobic, racist, bigot; delete my comment; &amp; ban me without any discussion. If I don&#39;t self-censure, they&#39;ll do it for me. That doesn&#39;t fly here.
4. Are you saying we shouldn&#39;t be skeptical of &quot;news&quot; put out by our government or MSM? Are we supposed to believe everything we hear, blindly trust govt. &amp; MSM to be their own watch-dogs &amp; fact-checkers? Nah, man. I&#39;ll dig around a bit on my own before I come to an opinion. In the case of this dossier, you&#39;re arguing against fair criticism that borders a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; mentality. Also, Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: <a href="http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html">http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html</a>
5. I&#39;ve NEVER heard anyone here say this dossier should be censored. Challenging the validity of a news story is not censorship, it&#39;s fair criticism. The document &amp; Buzzfeed&#39;s publishing of it deserved to be challenged, because they violated AP standards &amp; practices for: anonymous sources, providing attribution, responses, use of others&#39; material, &amp; crediting sensitive material. They also violated legal standards of Media Law &amp; legal principals of publication outside of journalistic privilege: Defamation (slander, actual malice), false light invasion of privacy. </p>

<p>Everyone should have The AP Stylebook at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Redditor for 3 months knows what he&#39;s talking about right?</p>

<p>Reddit was not intended to be a fully free speech zone at the beginning. I&#39;ve been here since 05/06. In the beginning, it was highly moderated in order to encourage high quality discussions. You weren&#39;t even allowed to shitpost. </p>

<p>You are right that at some point in Reddit history, becoming a free speech zone became a goal/value, which was reflected in a statement by yishan at the time. Obviously, that became untenable for the main stakeholders in Reddit and they shifted away from that.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t going to have free speech unless you are on a fully decentralized platform or a platform that is fully owned by someone with those values as a priority even at the risk of legal liability or losing all mainstream sources of income (mainstream ad networks) or having business vendors and partners cutting ties with them.</p>
