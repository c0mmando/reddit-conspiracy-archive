        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On March 30, a bridge on I-85 collapsed due to a fire that was allegedly started by a crackhead and the story we&#39;ve been given about who/what caused the fire is very questionable. Since his arrest, 5 prominent attorneys have offered to represent him pro bono and according to a Daily Report article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Members of Eleby&#39;s defense team suggested that the evidence to bolster a felony first-degree arson charge is thin and the investigation that led to his indictment cursory at best. Instead, they said they believe Eleby was quickly singled out and hustled into custody to fulfill the desire of public officials to quickly identify and punish a culpritâ€”and perhaps absolve the department of any responsibility for its storage of dozens of giant spools of petroleum-based conduit under a critical section of the city&#39;s highway infrastructure. <a href="http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202783713927/New-Legal-Team-for-Man-Accused-of-I85-Fire-on-Why-They-Volunteered-To-Defend-Him?kw=New%20Legal%20Team%20for%20Man%20Accused%20of%20I-85%20Fire%20on%20Why%20They%20Volunteered%20To%20Defend%20Him&amp;et=editorial&amp;bu=Daily%20Report&amp;cn=20170416&amp;src=EMC-Email&amp;pt=Weekend%20Edition">http://www.dailyreportonline.com/id=1202783713927/New-Legal-Team-for-Man-Accused-of-I85-Fire-on-Why-They-Volunteered-To-Defend-Him?kw=New%20Legal%20Team%20for%20Man%20Accused%20of%20I-85%20Fire%20on%20Why%20They%20Volunteered%20To%20Defend%20Him&amp;et=editorial&amp;bu=Daily%20Report&amp;cn=20170416&amp;src=EMC-Email&amp;pt=Weekend%20Edition</a> </p>

<p>Also, Sophia Brauer is the key witness in the bridge fire and said that the man confessed to her...In 2016 she supposedly located a man&#39;s dead body on the train tracks in Atlanta and was interviewed by media outlets. This could be another coincidence, as she could be homeless and in the area often, but it&#39;s very odd that she&#39;s the only person who said that the man confessed to her and has been used for media interviews before... <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/mans-body-found-along-atlanta-train-tracks/386020267">http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/mans-body-found-along-atlanta-train-tracks/386020267</a>

<p>Two weeks after the 85 incident, a railroad fire occurred under the tracks near the area where the bridge collapsed and the cause of the fire is still unknown. <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/trains-moving-again-after-railroad-bridge-fire/07QWkMwmQWfb3aluAmdJEL/">http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/trains-moving-again-after-railroad-bridge-fire/07QWkMwmQWfb3aluAmdJEL/</a> They were able to get the trains back running the same day, but still too coincidental for me to dismiss as being unrelated. </p>

<p>Today, part of I-20 buckled and all westbound lanes have been shut down. They originally blamed an underground gas leak for the buckling, but now they&#39;re saying there&#39;s no evidence of a gas leak <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-all-lanes-west-closed-after-highway-buckles/hYsmmjeyaXo6qfDIYm94mM/">http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-all-lanes-west-closed-after-highway-buckles/hYsmmjeyaXo6qfDIYm94mM/</a> </p>

<p>There was also a toxic chemical leak this morning, after the truck carrying it was involved in an accident with an SUV on I-285. According to officials, the truck shouldn&#39;t have been on the highway in the first place because it was a violation of Georgia traffic laws, and the driver of the SUV and truck both gave different accounts of what happened that led to the accident. <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/official-trucker-violated-state-law-time-downtown-connector-crash-chemical-spill/RkAp9HQ1Vm9OtcYwpt8yzO/">http://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/official-trucker-violated-state-law-time-downtown-connector-crash-chemical-spill/RkAp9HQ1Vm9OtcYwpt8yzO/</a> 
I read an article earlier today saying that the chemicals could affect people who breathe the air surrounding the accident, but now I&#39;m having trouble finding that article. I&#39;ll keep looking, but I do find it even more strange that the AJC, Atlanta&#39;s biggest newspaper, doesn&#39;t have anything on their front page about the chemical spill anymore and I know for sure there were articles there this morning. </p>

<p>Maybe our infrastructure is just shitty, which is very likely, but I feel like there&#39;s something bigger at play here... Gov. Deal already requested federal funding from Trump, but what else could be the goal of all of this? Is my tin foil hat on too tight? Am I over-analyzing? Has anyone else seen these incidents as related rather than individual, unrelated events? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the ATL question, I immediately thought it was suspicious. In Knoxville (about a year ago), an old business property that had lost a lot of value suddenly &#39;caught fire&#39; which lasted for several days, due to bums but it&#39;s pretty clear the business owners had a major payoff coming on otherwise useless property.</p>

<p>Regarding the politics of the area, ATL is becoming &#39;hot&#39;. Killer Mike (and others) are really turning it up, for Southern politics. There is a fair line of strong, I would wager Extreme, Anti-Establishment sentiment going from Knoxville, to Chattanooga, to Atlanta. However, these are major government run cities. Knoxville has a Nuclear Plant + major university, Chattanooga has the NSA headquarters, and ATL is ATL.</p>

<p>In either case, I think they are going to need to start beating up some more black people in Atlanta to prevent any organized political movements from starting up, and crippling the infrastructure will fundamentally cause people to have less free time and ability to move about the city.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a guess, but I have a feeling it&#39;s more about prevent people from being about to organize than it is about street construction, but perhaps that all it will amount to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, one of them. Not &#39;the one&#39;.</p>

<p>There are like 20 NSA bases in the US, but the Chattanooga one is not very public it seems. You can find it referenced in the Wikileaks or some shit. I&#39;ve seen it confirmed a few times.</p>

<p>However, generally speaking, if you want to know where NSA bases are located, try to find locations in which they have Fiber internet. Chattanooga go fiber internet which started around 2008, which is likely when the NSA bases was established.</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/">http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/</a></p>

<p>If you are curious, the Governor of TN , Bill Haslam, has forbidden any more cities from getting Fiber unless it&#39;s sponsored by Comcast (though I think Morristown has it as well).</p>

<p>The Chattanooga project is a bit suspicious in how effortlessly it occurred, and I think it paid for itself in like 3 years, so why wouldn&#39;t everyone do it?... Or did Chattanooga get a special pass? Hum.</p>

<p>But regarding the identification of the NSA base in Chattanooga, I can&#39;t find it at this time, though I&#39;ve read in a few different publications.</p>

<p>Elberton is more or less country near the South Carolina border. It&#39;s not a populated area by any means, and the major interstates of GA don&#39;t run through that area. </p>

<p>Interestingly enough the Georgia Guidestones are made of granite, which is basically Elberton&#39;s niche as business. </p>

<p>Granite contractors out of Elberton would make good research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. </p>

<p>A little more to add. Atlanta was a huge railroad hub in the 19th century so there is definitely easy rail access to many parts of the state that are still active today.</p>

<p>Also, look into the Colonial gas pipeline if you have the chance. Same general area, and there&#39;s been a lot of fuckery going on with leaks and explosions in the past year.</p>

<p>Madison is close to a freight line that runs between Atlanta and Charleston.
Don&#39;t know of any that run near Ellenton but seeing how the granite industry is pretty big in that area I would have to imagine there is a rail line or two for hauling the granite to their customers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidently, The Walking Dead <em>game</em> was in Atlanta. So, does this imply some kind of bio-terroism?</p>

<p>&quot;In the TV show, the same group is from King County, GA, which does not actually exist. In the first episode, the King County Sheriff&#39;s Department is shown to be assisting the Linden County Sheriff&#39;s Department, implying that the two counties are close to each other, if not directly beside each other.</p>

<p>In both versions, Rick first travels to Atlanta, GA (generally northern-Georgia or north-western Georgia) and meets the main group just outside of it. Since Cynthiana, KY is 6 hours (driving) to Atlanta, it makes more sense to be coming from the fictional King County on horseback (as he did in both versions).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly most of the highway based stuff just sounds like the infrastructure fears people have been pointing out for like 10 years is &quot;coming home to roost&quot; Though the rest of the stuff just sounds like a city being a city, I&#39;m from NYC, they fish bodies out of the rivers and bays all the time, sure some are mob/gang hits or whatever but others are suicides and general murders. </p>

<p>My point is cities are a place where massive amounts of people live together and crime is a part of what you have to expect living in one, and Atlanta has more than it&#39;s far share of crime just like it has more than it&#39;s fair share of police abuses of power. Now ask the question of who these victims were, and if it&#39;s like the Judge that recently was murdered in NYC then maybe you&#39;re onto something.</p>

I&#39;ve found a few budgets and the amount of money the governor allocated to the DOT is absurd for how horrible our roads are still, but I&#39;m having some issues trying to determine what the numbers actually mean and whether this is something that the City of Atlanta or the State of Georgia was responsible for fixing. Plus the budgets are always so pretty and look nice but don&#39;t really specify how funds are allocated other than listing how much to each department. A lot of words but no real explanations.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that Kasim Reed, Atlanta&#39;s mayor, is super corrupt (he was actually one of the first, if not only, mayors to go to a Bilderberg meeting) and does everything possible to hide his tracks and keep the money spent secret from the public.

<p>Don&#39;t think so, it&#39;s more like 1 out of 10 times. Because most conspiracy theories that people come up with aren&#39;t the true story. It&#39;s <em>hard</em> to piece together what actually happened sometimes, because there are a shitton of possibilities but only 1 truth. </p>

<p>That being said I&#39;m not discouraging people from digging through the information and trying to piece things together, but what more people need to understand is that their specific theory <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have to be correct just because it looks like it is. That&#39;s how you get people attached to their own pet theories and unwilling to consider something else. </p>

<p>Not sure if I articulated that the right way, but basically the world is a complex system with a lot of interconnected parts, and a cursory search into only online information of budgets by someone who likely isn&#39;t even an accountant <em>will not</em> find the culprit 90% of the time..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atlanta is a relatively smallish city compared to a lot of other well known cities. </p>

<p>We used to be just known for our airport heh and the surrounding area around the city is a bunch of old school neighborhoods and crumbling, old houses.</p>

<p>It has done almost a complete 180 in the last 15 years. Tons of people moved here along with businesses because of the affordable cost of living and benefits for moving your headquarters here.</p>

<p>The sudden influx of extra cash has not gone to a single infrastructure project that it should have gone to, and if people found out about the millions that have gone missing they are going to want arrests.</p>

<p>Remember that woman who was shot on the sidewalk, literally minutes after she walked out with documents and info she had requested so she could start an investigation into this last week?</p>

<p>It&#39;s gonna keep happening until people learn to shut up or forget about it. This is local corruption at it&#39;s finest.</p>

<p>You dig too deep down here in the south and you&#39;re gonna end up on a pig farm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Concrete expands when you heat it up, as does steel, when it cools it retracts. The normal expansion and retraction due to weather is accounted for in the design but a hot fire <em>under</em> the bridge? That would destroy a concrete overpass if it burned long enough. Imagine the rebar expanding within the concrete and then shrinking once more and the concrete cracking from doing the same - countless tiny cracks spreading into bigger and bigger fissures. Even if it didn&#39;t start collapsing right away it&#39;d likely be structurally unstable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. I use pvc to describe it because people are more familar with  it then hdpe. Seeing how there&#39;s not much difference between the two it&#39;s an easier way to describe what ent is made of.</p>

<p>As for flammability, both burn like a motherfuckers once lite. Thing is, it takes either deliberate arson or seriously gross negligence to get ent to ignite. And even though it does burn like crazy once ignited, neither the DOT, the NFPA,nor OSHA classify it as a flammable substance. </p>

<p>BTW, so you know why I&#39;m so familar with ent. I&#39;m an electrician. Over the years, I&#39;ve bought stored and installed this product more then a few times.
 I also live in Atlanta. I used to live only a few miles away from the site and have driven passed it a gazillion times, so I&#39;m pretty familar with the area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not claiming anything nefarious, but I&#39;m an Atlanta native myself, now living up in the suburbs. Everyone knows the public transit system here, especially rail (MARTA), is an absolute joke. It has an easy/west line and a north/south line only, tho the north line forks and sends to two areas. Regardless, there has been a huge debate in Atlanta for decades regarding expansion and revitalization but it always fails because people outside of the city, mostly red conservatives, don&#39;t want the public transit system coming into their neighborhoods and suburbs, due to the thought that it will bring more crime. Also, who is to pay for it? It falls on proposed sales tax percentage hikes that get voted
down because Marta is the only major city public transit system with no state/federal funding whatsoever. Yet Marta is required to submit a budget to the state and legislators determine usage restrictions on Marta&#39;s revenue. As mayor Kasim Reed has said himself, this is the struggle of a blue city in a red state. He&#39;s battled for expansion and Marta could certainly benefit from the revenue as could the city of Atlanta from increased infrastructure and accessibility. </p>

<p>Since the 85 collapse, tons of those living in the suburbs but working in the city, have been forced to use Marta in order to get into the city. Stations&#39; parking lots have been overflowing ever since, which anyone from here knows is unheard of. Maybe now with forced reliance, those in favor of expanding Marta will sway enough votes. </p>

<p>Just a thought on the cui bono question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This angle seems possible.  I noticed that at the initial announcement there were bus and MARTA people there making statements.. That is the obvious answer as to who benefits if people can&#39;t drive.  So maybe the bus system and MARTA (I dont&#39; know anything about atlanta, just been robbed there twice) are losing money and don&#39;t know how to turn it around.  They built it, people aren&#39;t riding it and traffic is terrible.  Create a situation where the city makes money from increased revenue in what has been a huge money sink and less people driving.  Two birds again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah Marta&#39;s problem is not that it&#39;s here and no one&#39;s using it, it&#39;s that it&#39;s <em>not</em> here and people desperately need it. You basically have to have a car to get most jobs. For real, this is asked in interviews. bosses can&#39;t count on you getting there with Marta bc if you miss your bus, you are now an hour late, and buses frequently run up to an hour behind. And it is not safe to bike most places and the city is so sprawly that unless you are very lucky or intentional, you ain&#39;t walkin to work or even a grocery store.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I just saw your comment right after I posted a reply about the Orville dam. The spillway had no business failing like it did and the whole project cost around a billion dollars I believe. The bids for the repair came in and they&#39;re around $250 million dollars. Idk if there was any shenanigans about how it was constructed but idk it&#39;s a lot of fucking money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I heard that too, and the bids were in private, as to not detail any info about the spillway?? I find that kind of odd, I don&#39;t think the spillway would be the most devastating thing to hurt if that was someone&#39;s plan, the dam itself would be the major catastrophe. So yeah I&#39;m just seeing where all of this is going, it smells fishy to say the least. Why they didn&#39;t do the repairs when they knew it needed it is beyond me, unless there is a reason why it would benefit a certain population if it were to fail. </p>

They don&#39;t want to cause a catastrophe they want to make a fuck ton of money without attracting he attention or the world like a catostrophe would.

If they dropped a nuke on Atlanta it would do the opposite of what they want it would cause mass revolt. They don&#39;t need to drop a nuke they just need to keep entertaining us with distractions keep feeding us with sugar and keep polarizing us with media. The two parties aren&#39;t red or blue they are green they don&#39;t give a shit about us despite what they make you believe. We elected a billionaire that people thought would care about them.

I can see it happening where you have purchase pass and you have it attached to your diagnostics or a sim/GPS chip.  That was the first thing I thought of when they did it.  Privatize and contract most of the major roads with a toll booth.  Company gets paid money to do so.  I am not sure it would be easy to get people to want to do it though.  No one wants to pay for something that they already pay for.  Which the only way to do it would be to create the impression that privatizing it would be better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this thought as well. Could it be possible to cause gas lines to rupture through a cyber war? Sure.</p>

<p>Also, some miles west of Atlanta in Alabama there was the huge Colonial Pipeline explosions that have occurred. I wanna say the first one was a leak that caused a short gas crisis for the Southeast as a whole, and the second was a huge explosion while they were working to repair the same leak.</p>

<p>There are tons of leaks occurring to this day with that same Pipeline. Also, I think Colonial is an Alpharetta-based company, which is metro Atlanta.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. If the equipment I mentioned were dependent upon PLCs the way that nuclear plant was then I&#39;d be telling you 100% that it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s just that they&#39;re very basic in terms of automation so it&#39;s harder for me to believe they could do that. </p>

<p>Honestly, the only safeguards we would be able to implement on our PLCs is a password. We don&#39;t even use one. So if anyone ever decided to access our network they could do whatever they wanted. Granted I don&#39;t work at a nuclear power plant or anything but still. </p>

<p>Supposedly they won&#39;t finish the I-85 collapsed bridge until June? I don&#39;t understand why they don&#39;t work day and night to fix that. Not a conspiracy just baffling to me. It&#39;s one of the most important stretches of road in our city-- 8 lanes, right after a merger with highway 400 which feeds into the northern suburbs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plain and simple. The U.S. is under attack</p>

<p>Atlanta is the epicenter/hub of all shipping and logistics that connects the east coast to the gulf and Texas etc. It&#39;s vital economically and this can&#39;t be understated.</p>

<p>If it looks like anything it&#39;s foreign agents attacking the United States.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the Oil pipeline blowing in up in Alabama twice as well just a few months back as this is very related in my opinion. That pipeline sent oil North and NE into US and likewise Atlanta is the commercial hub for logistics to the NE. It&#39;s the route all oil trucks coming from the gulf and California take to reach NYC and everything in between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The careless handling and storage of a dangerous amount of what were clearly highly flammable materials under a public bridge on a main highway should have been the first charge laid against whoever was responsible for it simply being there in the first place. Everything else is completely incidental to that.</p>

<p>Some not too bright homeless person seeking shelter and possibly lighting a fire very near or next to it and not knowing how highly flammable it actually was while simply trying to keep warm and then having it go up on him in huge blaze is understandable as is the possibility of him admitting to or feeling responsible for it perhaps in a state of shock over how quick and how big that fire got with nothing he could do about it but just get himself out of there as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to believe it could have been intentional and very easy to see how the cops could parlay that into busting a dangerous arsonist instead when they have someone that nobody cares or gives two hoots about to take the wrap. Fortunately a few good lawyers seem to have deduced that as well and come to his rescue.</p>

<p>Sparks off the wheels and rail joints by passing trains starting a fire in dry weather or where there&#39;s a lot of dry debris laying around aren&#39;t all that uncommon nor has the Atlanta region not had more than it&#39;s fair share of sink hole troubles that could possibly account for the buckled highway that are both under investigation. As for the truck transport of dangerous, hazardous, and toxic chemicals you can see enough of those virtually every day on our major highways but the truckers are usually the best and most conscientious drivers out there. Not sure you can say that about the one having an accident on a road his rig wasn&#39;t supposed to be driving on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame you for getting bad vibes or feeling a bit unnerved about this odd collection of recent incidents. Like feeling that you&#39;re under some kind of a cloud that&#39;s dropping trouble on where you live. Unfortunately bad news often comes in unlikely and disconnected batches that none of us can quite fathom why that should be. Sometimes I think that we aren&#39;t aware of how lucky we are when there isn&#39;t as much trouble as there more likely ought to be when it comes to the fits and spells of either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me just chime in on this one part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two weeks after the 85 incident, a railroad fire occurred under the tracks near the area where the bridge collapsed and the cause of the fire is still unknown. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a railfan (sometimes called a foamer), and model railroader.  Bridge fires on railroads really aren&#39;t that uncommon.  You tend to see these on older bridges where one of two factors come into play. The first being wooden structures, which are typically made of creosoted pine.  The second is in areas easily accessed by the homeless.</p>

<p>In both cases, though, the typical cause is the same.  Brake dust. Well not the dust itself, but a problem called &quot;brake fire&quot; or in older days &quot;hot boxes&quot;.</p>

<p>Let me deviate for just a bit to explain the mechanics of this, and then I&#39;ll get into how this happens.</p>

<p>A brake fire, or hot box, is a situation where the wheels of a train car will become overheated.  It&#39;s possible, in some situations, for this to get so hot that it physically melts the axle of the car. (Those things are six to eight inches thick, solid cast steel. So yeah, we&#39;re talking a LOT of friction heat.)  In lesser cases, it starts spitting out sparks and droplets of metal.  Now though it&#39;s called a &quot;brake&quot; fire, it really has little to do with the brake itself. Sure, a stuck brake CAN cause it, but more often than not, it&#39;s a bad bearing.  Friction builds up, the lubricating oils and greases start to burn, and bad things happen.</p>

<p>So back to why this is a common problem.  In the first instance, the older the creosote is, the more likely it is that it will catch fire if the hot metal and grease drips upon it.  On the second case, if you have a large homeless population leaving trash under a bridge, the same problem exists. </p>

<p>Some interesting key points:</p>

<p>The bridge is the second bridge to be located at this point. Previously an &quot;open&quot; deck truss and warren truss (google them) were at this location until the mid 1960&#39;s when the bridges were replaced.</p>

<p>The current bridge is a hybrid bridge, having a ballasted deck for the most part, but features wooden supports for the decking, atop a small steel open decking on the bottom. (This is to allow for drainage).</p>

<p>Depth of the ballast, at its thickest point, is about one foot.</p>

<p>Fire was on the north end of the bridge, in an area that is a known illegal dumping ground.  Police previously had found (and cleaned out) a number of old tires, furniture, and various scrap pieces of wood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So yeah, the CSX fire is likely organic in nature. If memory serves, it&#39;s not too far from one of the CSX yards in Atlanta, so I could see a bearing going out on a car throwing sparks around that might start this.  It could, reasonably, smoulder for some time before actually catching, so the fire could have been in its early stages for hours before it finally took hold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geez, I can&#39;t believe I just read through all 174 of those... Anyways, Atlanta Suburbs resident here. I too am skeptical of recent events. Not that it is necessarily related, but I find it interesting that there are recent rumblings of corruption in the city offices. Two CEO&#39;s connected to Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed&#39;s staff, pled guilty to bribery charges for city contruction contracts. <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/ceos-charged-in-bribery-case-gave-to-atlanta-mayor-during-controversial-fundraiser/492375397">http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/ceos-charged-in-bribery-case-gave-to-atlanta-mayor-during-controversial-fundraiser/492375397</a>
Additionally, an previous Atlanta Police Department Business manager has recently claimed she was fired for blowing the whistle on Mayor Reed&#39;s use of city money for luxury vehicles and police officers as escorts and chauffeurs for personal errands. Might be nothing to it, but its possible that someone is trying to draw public attention away from a possible corruption scandal. Let&#39;s do some investigating my fellow ATLiens.
