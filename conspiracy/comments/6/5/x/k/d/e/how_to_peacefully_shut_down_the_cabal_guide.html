        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We need to put this thing into overdrive now before the cabal further deteriorates the world. Here are a few examples and instructions on what we need to do quickly. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Every single time a politician appears on TV, there are people walking behind that the camera captures. Those people need to scream and yell accusations against that politician. (For example: John McCain, did you know that Mossad and the CIA collaborated to make 9-11 happen? I know that you know but I want to hear your answer.) The idea it to get to a point where every politician and cabal member is a nervous mess when in public. Eventually someone will crack up and have a massive meltdown right on TV. </p></li>
<li><p>Every single dollar that is exchanged should have a handwritten red pill sentence on it. Dollar bills really circulate fast. Money is our slave chain but we can use it against the slave master. </p></li>
<li><p>We can put signs and banners all over the place to redpill the masses. One good example for a sign is to drop a massive banner on one of those freeway bridges with something like &quot;Mossad did 9-11&quot;. Over 100,000 cars drive under some of these busier freeway bridges in bigger cities. That&#39;s a ton of exposure. </p></li>
<li><p>We need a cool million man march around the white house and it has to stay there permanently until the people are fully satisfied and our needs are met. South Korea did this successfully. This makes the government look real bad not only to the local citizens but to foreigners as well. The idea is that it creates an image that says the people are very unsatisfied to all the citizens of the world thereby adding extra pressure to conform to the people&#39;s needs. </p></li>
<li><p>We need lawsuits up the ass against our politicians. These lawsuits need to be filed so quickly that the sheer number of them grab media attention. These lawsuits make the politicians lives a living hell. They are time consuming and it forces them to rehearse their lies over and over again which gets completely exhausting. We want to keep them as exhausted as possible until they crack. </p></li>
<li><p>We all need to find 1 creative way to help enhance the world. Each one of us has some sort of special access to someone or something that can help us in our fight. This technique needs to be utilized across the masses regularly. This will add massive variety to the assault and keep the cabal on their toes since they never know what to expect. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, its a full frontal yet peaceful assault. This assault needs to be permanent and seemingly never-ending. Of course, there won&#39;t be any need for this once our demands are met but we definitely have to be relentless with it for the foreseeable future. </p>

<p>Our demands?</p>

<p>Drain the swamp, open source government, better representation, end of wars, unleashing the 50 years of technology they are holding from us, unleashing the 1000 years worth of resources they are holding from us, creating a fair economy, and anything else we want. </p>

<p>We basically have to kick them in the nuts over and over again until they listen to us. Eventually the pain will be too much to handle and the elite will realize they have no choice but to serve the people. Look what we did to the Clintons with just a little bit of effort. They are basically ruined politically. We can do a lot more than just that. </p>

<p>The biggest obstacle to this lies in the mind. The problem is that many of us want to see others doing it first before we jump in. This is a HUGE error because it doesn&#39;t lead to any progress at all. The secret is to just worry about the self (yourself). Its like flipping a switch from sleeper to activist and by doing so, you automatically motivate many others into doing the same thing as time passes. The best leadership is to lead by example. When people see you working to save the country, they will be motivated to do the same. Overcome this obstacle in your own mind, and you have made a huge jump towards success. </p>

<p>Critical mass is 5%. Once 5% of the population is doing something productive, the other 95% get swallowed into it. The only hard work is to get up to the 5% mark which we can do by focusing on our very own actions. </p>

<p>We can do it. We need to do it before further deteriorate our world. The more we dig ourselves in a hole, the longer it will take to dig our way out. Its simply common sense to end this madness now. We can do it for sure and we eventually will but it&#39;s better that we start now and get it over with so we can enjoy the fruits of our labor as quickly as possible.</p>

Get some creative people to make memes. Find ways to really hit home for most people. Get people from around the world with a common goal. Share ideas. Likely will get infiltrated if you don&#39;t do your homework. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think memes are the best starting point to kick our machine into gear. The spicyier the better. Every mainstream facebook/Instagram group has jumped on the recycled meme train. If we get spicy images with easy to digest information people instant associate too.
