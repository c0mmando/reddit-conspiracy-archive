<p>It started with a conduit fire underneath an interstate overpass/bridge. The bridge collapsed and now a main artery thru the city is completely shut down. It has become a nightmare for thousands of commuters in and out of Atlanta. </p>

<p>Then last week there was a mysterious fire under a CSX railroad bridge. </p>

<p><a href="http://m.wtoc.com/wtoc/db_350145/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=UuC71ICG">http://m.wtoc.com/wtoc/db_350145/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=UuC71ICG</a></p>

<p>Then today... </p>

<p>Early this morning a Hazmat situation on 75, shutting down both north and south lanes in Atlanta. This seems to be cleared up. But then...</p>

<p>I-20, one of the highways helping to reroute traffic into Atlanta since the i85 shutdown, had a gas leak that made 2 left lanes buckle. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-all-lanes-west-closed-after-highway-buckles/hYsmmjeyaXo6qfDIYm94mM/amp.html">https://www.google.com/amp/www.ajc.com/news/traffic/breaking-all-lanes-west-closed-after-highway-buckles/hYsmmjeyaXo6qfDIYm94mM/amp.html</a></p>

<p>Now they are saying it will have to be shut down as well, wtf is going on??? It really feels like they are preparing for something... </p>

<p>A terrorist attack incites terror, while a blocked off interstate or two incite mild to severe road rage.</p>

<p>Now if a dirty bomb were to go off in Atlanta or some dam were to break and people couldn&#39;t get out, then you might have a conspiracy or perhaps even a rare genuine terrorist attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be about as useless as your explanation I&#39;m afraid because we have next to no data to base our assumptions on.</p>

<p>Sure, you have a point that infrastructure is being systemically neglected across the country so that wars and mischief can be funded abroad, and it&#39;s certainly vaguely conceivable that such a coincidence could occur that several electrical fires and gas leaks would lead to several failures of highways in one city over the course of two weeks, but it would be a pretty rare coincidence in my view. A bit too much of a coincidence to my taste.</p>

<p>You have elicited Occam&#39;s Razor in another reply, and here I gotta say that a coincidence of such a seemingly coordinated cluster of infrastructure failures is pretty low on the probability scale. Not impossible, but following the metric, I&#39;d sooner consider deliberate infrastructure sabotage to some enigmatic goal before concluding it is just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a lot more likely but at least equally conceivable, so I think it&#39;s pretty presumptuous of you to exclaim that there&#39;s nothing of interest to see here as though you had any more data than we do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you are convinced that there are one or more individuals who are willfully doing harm to the city then that would reveal that the DHS, NSA, FBI and city Police are doing a piss poor job at protecting the people. So, with the NSA listening in on <strong>every</strong> phone call and reading <strong>every</strong> text message, they are totally ineffective in protecting <em>anyone</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that&#39;s a thematic pivot I didn&#39;t expect, but sure, good point. </p>

<p>They&#39;re doing jack shit of any of that and I thought that was clear to anyone who paid even a little bit of attention. All of them are tools to control and suppress meaningful dissent and have little to do with crime, as most of the crime they claim to aim to prevent are in turn perpetrated by elements in those very agencies themselves. This is true for the NSA (hacking and spying), the DHS and FBI (terrorism, drug trade, spying) the DEA (making addiction possible by refusing meaningful alternatives), the CDC and FDA (allowing a range of poisons and diseases to circulate, sometimes seemingly spreading them deliberately) and the CIA of course doing nothing to protect anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>All of them are impotent to counter true acts of subversion, so their existence does nothing to change my view on the likelihood of deliberate sabotage of critical infrastructure. If that is indeed what happened I&#39;d expect it to have been organized by one of those very agencies, in fact.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not convinced of anything – as I thought I had made clear enough – so I&#39;d rather appreciate it if you tried not to put words in my mouth so carelessly.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not deterministically, no.  But randomly, yes.  In such an event, poorly maintained systems are going to be more likely to fail.  Once a system (such as a large city) experiences one failure, stresses are imposed on other parts of the system, which themselves then have a higher probability of failure.  So you get a cascade of failures.</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;m not ruling out foul play here.  But it is entirely possible that what you are seeing is a slow-motion catastrophic failure of a metropolitan transportation system.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking true, but don&#39;t attribute to terrorism what can easily be explained by neglect and incompetence. Unless you have definite concrete evident to the contrary then your city is merely falling apart out of neglect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of us that can, have stocked up on food and take bikes everywhere/walk if we need to get somewhere. Even our bosses are like &quot;let me know if your gonna be late because you&#39;re biking in, I understand, just stay safe.&quot; We live about 10 miles away from work (Thank god) and even though we are leisurely biking/walking our bikes, we get there a couple hours earlier then our coworkers who live in south side neighborhoods.</p>

<p>It&#39;s chaos right now, we already had shit traffic but now that the main highway is shut off, it&#39;s like the fuck apocalypse. Peoples patience is wearing thin and road rage is slowly building as well.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no point in taking buses because you just sit in it as well. As far as the other roads giving out and the biohazard truck, well of course the truck was using a road it was not supposed to, what other choice did he have? </p>

<p>All of this happening at once has created a perfect storm. Our infrastructure is already heavily aged and since the city&#39;s huge influx a decade ago, it has not been updated once. All of this traffic rerouting is happening on streets and roads that were never meant to have tons and tons of cars idling on them for hours and now they are failing too.</p>

<p>Officials are panicking and pointing fingers away from themselves but it&#39;s not really working anymore, everyone around here knows it&#39;s because they used our tax money to line their pockets instead of maintaining things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting idea to brain storm for sure. What would be the reaction and protocol in the city if a series of events ended in a deadly, chaotic cluster fuck? Atlanta is landlocked, has a massive, well traveled airport, the CDC headquarters is located here, as well as a big military base. </p>

<p>I would start with monitoring social sites and subreddits that the local people in Atlanta use, to get a good idea of the mood/what&#39;s happening over here day to day. Remember that what you get on MSM is whitewashed and second hand, especially if you are hearing about somewhere far away. To really get an idea of whats going down you need to go to where the locals are talking to each other.</p>

I&#39;ve noticed where I live, fairly rural and flat, the interstates have all started running guard rails and cable fencing between the medians which prevents being able to turn around. 
I think tptb are gearing up for massive crowd control devices and strategies, whether as a preimplantation for something planned or something unknown. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Atlanta is very likely going to be the example and point to privatize the interstate.  I am saying it now.  That is something that I can see happening.  You can mark this post but I see I85 as a stunt to do it and they are seeing what it takes to push people to want this.  Really, the blame is that I would not expect even a reasonable government to actually save the taxes on maintenance.  But this should be something that they should push for a municipal bonds on to fund it.  Privatizing it only means that you are raising taxes on everything else.  In the end, they would actually kill the auto industry as people start looking for better options.</p>
