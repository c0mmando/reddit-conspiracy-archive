<p>The search for a suspect who police believe randomly shot a man walking along a Cleveland-area sidewalk on Sunday before posting a video of the fatal shooting on Facebook broadened nationwide on Monday as officials acknowledged that they did not know where the man was and announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

<p>You are not listing sources by listing articles that include information from sources.</p>

<p><strong><em>Video 1</em></strong>
Stephens got out of the car and approached Godwin, saying, &quot;Hey can you do me a favor?&quot; and asked him to say his girlfriend&#39;s name. Godwin appeared confused but said the woman&#39;s name.</p>

<p>Stephens then pulled a handgun and pointed it at Godwin&#39;s head, telling him that the woman is the reason why he was about to shoot him. Godwin&#39;s hands went up to shield him and pleaded with Stephens, saying, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t know anybody by that name!&quot;</p>

<p>Stephens fired one fatal shot at Godwin&#39;s head, and he zooms in on Godwin&#39;s bloody body on the sidewalk before walking back to his car and getting inside.</p>

<p><strong><em>Video 2</em></strong>
In a second five-minute video after the shooting, Stephens is seen on the phone with an unidentified person. Stephens encourages him to go onto Facebook and watch the shooting.</p>

<p>He then begins explaining to the person on the telephone about why he shot Godwin, saying &quot;I&#39;m at the point where I snapped,&quot; and that no one ever took his problems seriously when he tried to talk them out.</p>

<p>&quot;I shamed myself. I snapped, I snapped. I just snapped, I just killed 13 motherfuckers, man,&quot; Stephens says on the phone. &quot;I&#39;m about to keep killing until they catch me, fuck it. I&#39;m telling them to catch me.&quot;</p>

<p>In the video, Stephens also mentions that he works for Beech Brook, a Cleveland organization that provides counseling services for youth. He was wearing his name badge in the videos that identified him as a Beech Brook employee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I pretty much agree with what you said here. I was under the assumption they say they spy on everyone all the time. 
If that&#39;s true I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m sure they could, like you say selectively. 
I think mostly its a rule by fear tactic. Or could be another group putting it out there to have people go against the government. A lot of different things really but I&#39;m kinda off topic so I&#39;ll shut up now lol. </p>

<p>I imagine you have to go pretty high up to tap someone&#39;s phone.</p>

<p>All communications are tapped.  The question is: why aren&#39;t they attempting to access this information to stop this?  The answer is: because it wasn&#39;t meant to stop crime, it&#39;s meant to keep us in control.</p>

<p>Apply Occam&#39;s Razor here. I don&#39;t buy that this is a hoax. It makes more sense that some scumbag gangbanger psycho lost his temper and went on a shooting spree because he&#39;s a subhuman animal than it being a conspiracy, because there is no obvious agenda here. The video of one of the murders showed him gunning down another black man, so it&#39;s not to incite racial tensions. I don&#39;t see what purpose it would serve.</p>

<p>Since it serves no purpose, it&#39;s just random, emotionally-motivated violence.</p>

<p>This is one very reasonable assessment. They want us to want them to abuse our privacy to catch this guy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that they&#39;re playing stupid. They&#39;ll point to this as evidence that this isn&#39;t CSI, and they can&#39;t actually access your phone with ease. It&#39;s not like they would let a killer possibly kill again, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>police agencies, cia, fbi, cannot just access anyones phone without first having infected it with their malware. The NSA has direct access to query companies like Google and Amazon databases, but like I said the NSA does not help with local police manhunts. Plus if they used one of these means to track track this guy down, then they would have to admit that they can do that and he would likely get off on some technicality because of how they obtained data. </p>

There isn&#39;t just some switch they can flip, they&#39;d have to first infect the phone with malware - either by having physical access to the phone, tricking him into downloading infected apps, or the like. There is some real willful ignorance about just what was in the Vault 7 leaks online. Hell, even if they could, just turning his phone off or ditching it (as he has likely done, since he hasn&#39;t been caught yet) would render the whole thing moot.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the NSA has some really really excellent capacity, but alas the CIA really does not. The bombshell hidden in vault 7 was really that the CIA is very very behind the curve. </p>

<p>That&#39;s bullshit.  This is a forum.  Nothing you said implied the question was rhetorical.  You can&#39;t ask something potentially inflammatory and then act like it was all rhetorical when people give you answers you don&#39;t want to hear.  Rhetorical questions are for people who don&#39;t want to have their beliefs questioned but who want to live in an echo chamber where people blindly agree with them.</p>

<p>The search for a suspect who police believe randomly shot a man walking along a Cleveland-area sidewalk on Sunday before posting a video of the fatal shooting on Facebook broadened nationwide on Monday as officials acknowledged that they did not know where the man was and announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not in the car with him. He&#39;s probably driving a stolen vehicle, which majes it basically impossible to figure out where he is.</p>

<p>Apply Occam&#39;s Razor here. I don&#39;t buy that this is a hoax. It makes more sense that some scumbag gangbanger psycho lost his temper and went on a shooting spree because he&#39;s a subhuman animal than it being a conspiracy, because there is no obvious agenda here. The video of one of the murders showed him gunning down another black man, so it&#39;s not to incite racial tensions. I don&#39;t see what purpose it would serve.</p>

<p>Since it serves no purpose, it&#39;s just random, emotionally-motivated violence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more of a case that the vault 7 stuff shows that the CIA was consistently behind the curve, sortof pointless having a iOS 2 exploit being added to your arsenal in late 2009. Look at the dates, of when things were added vs what the state of the art was at the time. </p>

<p>I have no doubt that the NSA has some really really excellent capacity, but alas the CIA really does not. The bombshell hidden in vault 7 was really that the CIA is very very behind the curve. </p>
