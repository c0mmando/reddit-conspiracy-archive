       "They" are supposed to be spying on all of us through our phones and supposedly be able to turn on our cameras and microphones to do it. Why can't they catch this douchebag? 
Either 
A. They can't spy on us like they say
Or
B. This killer guy is bullshit
Or 
C. Both is bullshit.

       Which only states

       . Steve Stephens may be nowhere near Cleveland. Until then, I will take Stephens' word for it.

       No. He made that claim while he wasn't still in Cleveland. In Cleveland there is only one confirmed victim, according to the police.

        The search for a suspect who police believe randomly shot a man walking along a Cleveland-area sidewalk on Sunday before posting a video of the fatal shooting on Facebook broadened nationwide on Monday as officials acknowledged that they did not know where the man was and announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.

        <em>
         Video 1
        </em>
       </strong>
       Stephens got out of the car and approached Godwin, saying, "Hey can you do me a favor?" and asked him to say his girlfriend's name. Godwin appeared confused but said the woman's name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephens then pulled a handgun and pointed it at Godwin's head, telling him that the woman is the reason why he was about to shoot him. Godwin's hands went up to shield him and pleaded with Stephens, saying, "Look, I don't know anybody by that name!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephens fired one fatal shot at Godwin's head, and he zooms in on Godwin's bloody body on the sidewalk before walking back to his car and getting inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <em>
         Video 2
        </em>
       </strong>
       In a second five-minute video after the shooting, Stephens is seen on the phone with an unidentified person. Stephens encourages him to go onto Facebook and watch the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then begins explaining to the person on the telephone about why he shot Godwin, saying "I'm at the point where I snapped," and that no one ever took his problems seriously when he tried to talk them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I shamed myself. I snapped, I snapped. I just snapped, I just killed 13 motherfuckers, man," Stephens says on the phone. "I'm about to keep killing until they catch me, fuck it. I'm telling them to catch me."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video, Stephens also mentions that he works for Beech Brook, a Cleveland organization that provides counseling services for youth. He was wearing his name badge in the videos that identified him as a Beech Brook employee.

       its def not.. the resources are already being used, its as simple as loading a cell number that's associated with the phone, or email or whatever config the guy chose to use in order to give permissions for the video option.  they just aren't choosing to bc he has ditched the phone and they know it,the act wasn't real or they just don't care.

       Well I pretty much agree with what you said here. I was under the assumption they say they spy on everyone all the time. 
If that's true I don't believe it. I'm sure they could, like you say selectively. 
I think mostly its a rule by fear tactic. Or could be another group putting it out there to have people go against the government. A lot of different things really but I'm kinda off topic so I'll shut up now lol.

       All communications are tapped.  The question is: why aren't they attempting to access this information to stop this?  The answer is: because it wasn't meant to stop crime, it's meant to keep us in control.

       Or alternatively there's hundreds of thousands of phones for them to spy on and the chances of them just happening to be listening to a killers phone while they're killing someone is slim to none?
      </p>
      <p>
       So in order for them to be able to do as you suggested they need to know 1) who the killer is, and 2) what his/her phone number is.

       Well 1. They obviously know who it is, his name was on CNN. And 2. CNN said a detective actually talked to him on his phone at one point.  And also they have talked to his mother. Surely she had his phone number.

       I don't know, I'm not in the car with him. He's probably driving a stolen vehicle, which majes it basically impossible to figure out where he is.

       Apply Occam's Razor here. I don't buy that this is a hoax. It makes more sense that some scumbag gangbanger psycho lost his temper and went on a shooting spree because he's a subhuman animal than it being a conspiracy, because there is no obvious agenda here. The video of one of the murders showed him gunning down another black man, so it's not to incite racial tensions. I don't see what purpose it would serve.

       Since it serves no purpose, it's just random, emotionally-motivated violence.

       Perhaps that's what they want. They have the capability, but maybe they're trying to incite the public to

       Absolutely! It's so sick and sad that we have been coerced and manipulated into knee-jerk reactions when this kind of shit happens, whether real or false flag. There is an agenda here, we'll see what comes of it at the end; less freedom on Facebook, more militarized cops in those areas going door to door, ala the BMB?

       Of course they can do whatever they want whether we like it or not.  But deceit like this lubricates the process and makes them the 'heroes' for pursuing their interests.

       This is one very reasonable assessment. They want us to want them to abuse our privacy to catch this guy.

       I'm of the opinion that they're playing stupid. They'll point to this as evidence that this isn't CSI, and they can't actually access your phone with ease. It's not like they would let a killer possibly kill again, right?

       Oh, did you think those tools were for fighting crime? Our intelligence agencies don't give a flying fuck about fighting crime. They only care about their own political machinations. Those tools are mainly for blackmailing important people and intimidating whistle blowers. And spying on their ex-wives.

       He's also driving around a late model Ford Fusion that more than likely has a GPS device onboard. All they have to do is pull the VIN from registration records and get Ford to locate the vehicle. They could find him within hours of they wanted.

       From what I understand, every car built since 2010 i capable of being found using the onboard stuff that comes equipped with every car, even if the owner didn’t purchase Onstar or whatever, the underpinnings are already there.

       There’s a TV show called “Hunted” where they show off how easy it is to track someone on the run.  That they haven’t caught this guy is quite surprising given the tools that exist to do just that.

       That's all done through internet I'd assume. They probably use a 3g/4g network to communicate location and locking. Don't think you can even do starting and locking over GPS.

       You are implying that the suspect is incapable of perceiving his phone as being compromised. This happening
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       they cut his live feeds remotely...

       The guy seems quite intelligent for a
       <em>

       , so i'd doubt that he simply forgot about the powers of reverse cell phone triangulation via gps. He likely threw the phone in the back of someones pickup the moment it became useless he himself driving in the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not exactly rocket science to assume that he has no common sense. The guy is a capable threat and therefore shouldn't be underestimated...

       because like most of you liked to ignore, they cannot just tap everyones phone without every having infected it in the first place. NSA in coordination with Google or whoever his phone is from is another story, but the NSA doesnt help with police manhunts.

       police agencies, cia, fbi, cannot just access anyones phone without first having infected it with their malware. The NSA has direct access to query companies like Google and Amazon databases, but like I said the NSA does not help with local police manhunts. Plus if they used one of these means to track track this guy down, then they would have to admit that they can do that and he would likely get off on some technicality because of how they obtained data.

       Because they can't. There isn't just some switch they can flip, they'd have to first infect the phone with malware - either by having physical access to the phone, tricking him into downloading infected apps, or the like. There is some real willful ignorance about just what was in the Vault 7 leaks online. Hell, even if they could, just turning his phone off or ditching it (as he has likely done, since he hasn't been caught yet) would render the whole thing moot.

       It's more of a case that the vault 7 stuff shows that the CIA was consistently behind the curve, sortof pointless having a iOS 2 exploit being added to your arsenal in late 2009. Look at the dates, of when things were added vs what the state of the art was at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that the NSA has some really really excellent capacity, but alas the CIA really does not. The bombshell hidden in vault 7 was really that the CIA is very very behind the curve.

       Nope, since the patriot act now they have channels to communicate with each other but it's more likely to have KFC and Pizza Hut have a joint venture. Sure both may release the new Mountain Dew flavour, to give the appearance of a joint operation but getting a pizza and a bucket of chicken from the same delivery driver requires a unheard of level of corporation which requires staff to be able to communicate laterally, and that just doesn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       These programs tend to be executed and ran from lower tiers of both agencies, and intelligence of interest filters upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       the NSA is more of a wholesale sigint operation meanwhile the CIA will focus on specific targets and areas of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the NSA gets some groundbreaking intelligence stating that there is a goldmine of information on a 'air gapped' network that the CIA might be able to gain access to it can take years for that intelligence to filter through, even though the CIA might have had an operative in the same building for years. ( and the nsa would never even know that )
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at something like stuxnet that's light years ahead of the cia's technical capacity ( although definitely within their human capacity to get the implant installed ) so if it was them then its most likely that they used a third party contractor to build the worm for them.

       That's bullshit.  This is a forum.  Nothing you said implied the question was rhetorical.  You can't ask something potentially inflammatory and then act like it was all rhetorical when people give you answers you don't want to hear.  Rhetorical questions are for people who don't want to have their beliefs questioned but who want to live in an echo chamber where people blindly agree with them.

       Apply Occam's Razor here. I don't buy that this is a hoax. It makes more sense that some scumbag gangbanger psycho lost his temper and went on a shooting spree because he's a subhuman animal than it being a conspiracy, because there is no obvious agenda here. The video of one of the murders showed him gunning down another black man, so it's not to incite racial tensions. I don't see what purpose it would serve.

       It's more of a case that the vault 7 stuff shows that the CIA was consistently behind the curve, sortof pointless having a iOS 2 exploit being added to your arsenal in late 2009. Look at the dates, of when things were added vs what the state of the art was at the time.

       If he answered a call shouldn't they have been able to trace it and immediately dispatch police from the closest station to those coordinates? Something is fishy about this story, it's beginning to seem more plausible that this man is a state sponsored assassin/brainwashed by a CIA  experiment  and they're using him to execute 'random'  people of interest.
