<p>While I am relatively new here, I intend on staying and therefor have no intentions on lying to any of you or causing any trouble.</p>

<p>A reliable source informed me, around two hours ago that quite a few &quot;shooter&quot; stories are about to break very soon, apparently all in the US. Furthermore stating that the aforementioned stories will be set up and are purely designed to serve as distractions. Distractions from what, I don&#39;t know, sorry.</p>

<p>If the above mentioned source was in fact lying to me they would be destroying years of friendship so I do trust their information.</p>

<p>EDIT: Also mentioned was that there will apparently be a large story breaking soon about a kidnapping taking place, or a hostage situation that&#39;ll have global ramifications.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to believe me, I just wanted to give you all a heads up. When these stories do break (hopefully not as I am writing this) then I guess that&#39;ll be proof enough.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>c. April 19 - May 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Blood Sacrifice To The Beast, a most critical 13-day period. Fire sacrifice is required on April 19.</li>
</ul>

<p>April 19 is the first day of the 13-day Satanic ritual day relating to fire - the fire god, Baal, or Molech/Nimrod (the Sun God), also known as the Roman god, Saturn (Satan/Devil). This day is a major human sacrifice day, demanding fire sacrifice with an emphasis on children. This day is one of the most important human sacrifice days, and as such, has had some very important historic events occur on this day.</p>

<p>Remember, the Illuminati considers war to be a most propitious way to sacrifice, for it kills both children and adults.</p>

<p>Some of the very important historic dates that were staged according to this blood sacrifice day are:</p>

<pre><code>(1). April 19, 1775 - Battle of Lexington &amp;amp; Concord, which made the Masonic-led Revolutionary War inevitable

(2). April 19, 1943 - After trapping the last Jewish Resistance Fighters in a storm drain in Warsaw, and holding them for several days, Nazi Storm Troopers began to pour fire into each end of the storm drain, using flame-throwers. They continued pouring the fire into the drain until all fighters were dead. Blood sacrifice brought about by a fiery conflagration.

(3) April 19, 1993 - 50 years later, to the day, government troops, tanks, and other military equipment stormed the compound of David Koresh and his followers at Waco, Texas. Certainly, this operation fulfilled the basic requirements for a human sacrifice: trauma, fire, and young sacrificial victims.

(4) April 19, 1995 - Oklahoma City bombing - Once again, many young children were killed this day
</code></pre>

<p>April 19 of any year in the 20th Century is a day of fearful contemplation, for it seems that, as we head into the final stretch of time, Satan is becoming more and more bold, and is using April 19 more often.</p>

<p>d. April 30 - May 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Beltaine Festival, also called &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the highest day on the Druidic Witch&#39;s Calendar, while May 1 is the Illuminati&#39;s second most sacred holiday. Human sacrifice is required. Since the celebration officially began the night before Beltaine, the tradition has developed among occultists to celebrate Beltaine as a 2-day ceremony. This tradition was strong enough that Adolf Hitler decided to kill himself on April 30 at 3:30pm, thus creating a &quot;333&quot; and placing his suicide sacrifice within the Beltaine time frame.</p>

<p>Great bonfires are lit on the Eve of Beltaine, April 30, in order to welcome the Earth Goddess. Participants hope to gain favor with this goddess so she will bless their families with procreative fertility. We find it interesting that the Royal House of Windsor lights a Beltaine &quot;Balefire&quot; every year [&quot;America&#39;s Occult Holidays&quot;, Doc Marquis, p. 30]</p>

<p>The &quot;Maypole&quot; originated from the celebration of Beltaine. Since fertility is being asked of the Earth Goddess, the Maypole is the phallic symbol and the circular dance around the pole forms the circle that is symbolic of the female sex organ.</p>

<p>Four six-foot alternating red and white ribbons were connected to the pole; the men would dance counterclockwise, while the ladies danced clockwise. The union of the intertwining red and white ribbons symbolized the act of copulation - remember, this is a &quot;fertility&quot; celebration day!</p>

<p>To demonstrate their occult, Illuminist ties, Communists have always celebrated &quot;May Day&quot;. If you have not been taught how the Illuminati created Communism, and for which purpose, you need to hear our Seminar 2, &quot;America Determines The Flow of History&quot;.</p>

<p>That aside, I disagree with some of what other users are saying regarding GLP&#39;s 0% accuracy. Back in 2012 I first came across discussions about the upcoming race war on GLP. I&#39;ve read some other stuff there over the years thst did precede events similar to what was described. That&#39;s not to say GLP was an original source, but I do find stuff gets on there that I find but sont find elsewhere until I&#39;m looking for more information.</p>
