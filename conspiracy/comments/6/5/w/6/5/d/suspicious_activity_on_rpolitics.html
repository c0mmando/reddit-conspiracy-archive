<p>I&#39;ll digress here. This is 1 week of this user&#39;s history but the pattern continues going back.</p>

<p>Most of their submissions reach the front page. They are submitted around the same time each day.</p>

<p>They do comment, there is a human in control. However, these patterns seem to indicate bots are upvoting their submissions at least on r/politics.</p>

<p>Here is a partial breakdown of their posts: Note the average karma per post.</p>

<p>438 r/politics submissions and the average karma per submission is 3790. That is unnatural.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tagged over 100 bots, botters, and spammers in the past week. Easy places to find them are the &#39;new&#39; queue of political and news subs. You can also look at the domain submissions for specific websites like rt.com</p>

<p>r/politics is making it easy to manipulate but they aren&#39;t the only ones. Take a couple minutes and check out the new queue of any political subs you frequent and look for strange user patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disputing the OP at all though. All I said was that r/conspiracy is not r/the_donald2.0 as so many people (coincidentally not r/conspiracy posters most of the time) like to suggest. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen both of those videos, I think they&#39;re extremely well done.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand what point youre trying to make with me here. This comment chain is in regards to people who discredit anything from r/conspiracy because &quot;Trump sock puppet accounts.&quot; I think the OP should be seen by all of Reddit, but it would get shot down as &quot;Trump Propaganda&quot;.</p>

<p>We&#39;re literally arguing the same side. I think there&#39;s some kind of lapse in communication here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m referring to this string of comments and what they mean for curation. It&#39;s a topic that crops up on <a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">/r/TheoryOfReddit</a> from time to time. I&#39;ve seen 3 ways of handling curation of content on internet forums:</p>

<p><strong>1. No curation</strong><br/>
This is the Xchan way. You let the trolls run loose and you get rampant hostility, rudeness and trolling. The noise-floor elevates so much that genuinely hateful remarks pretty much just drown out with the rest of the trolls and, in my opinion, makes the truly thoughtful posts with a bit of creativity stand out all the more.</p>

<p><strong>2. Mob curation</strong><br/>
Outsource the curation to participants. This means up- (and usually down-) voting content. Ideally you should be voting up or down based on how interesting content is or how much something contributes to a discussion but people don&#39;t do that because we are tribal. We vote based on whether we agree or not and when this actually has an impact on sorting and even curation, we end up with an echo-chamber. Subreddits and forums with this approach always (and in my opinion <em>must</em>) degenerate to a consensus that moderates away controversial opinion or statements that go against the consensus no matter how well sourced or well intended.</p>

<p>If you make the mistake of letting people have API access, a single person with a range of IPs, accounts or however else you differentiate access tokens, can force-multiply and dictate a fake consensus.</p>

<p><strong>3. Strict moderation</strong><br/>
Some subreddits like <a href="/r/AskHistorians">/r/AskHistorians</a> and specialty niche-forums go this way. If you want high signal-to-noise ratio, this is the way to do it but it&#39;s labor intensive and it requires moderators who are capable of separating participating in a discussion from moderation activities. It also requires strict rules so everyone knows why a post was removed and can clearly tell which rule(s) were broken.</p>

<p>Of the three, I think mob curation is, by far, the worst because it enforces self-censorship and people start to virtue-signal in order to not get immediately downvoted before they can state their case. &quot;I&#39;m not religious but...&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not a conservative but...&quot; etc. If you spend too much time considering, not whether your post is readable and informative, but how well it fits with consensus you will begin to make attention-seeking and virtue-signalling a habit without realizing it.</p>

<p>Learning to function in a society by altering your own behavior to what is socially acceptable is part of growing up but I think exact metrics for each statement you make, every picture you post on instagram, every assertion you make on facebook is dangerous. It teaches people to hunt for &quot;likes&quot; and alters their thinking to evaluate their own behavior based on how it will be received. Robert Sapolsky has some lectures about this on Youtube that are quite frightening.</p>

<p>As I wrote, this crops up on <a href="/r/TheoryOfReddit">/r/TheoryOfReddit</a> from time to time and people there have made way more interesting analyses of this than I could ever do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is of course the meta-moderation approach that Slashdot used for comments (but not necessarily articles). It pushes toward groupthink like any form of curation, but the capacity to meta-moderate was given out far less frequently than standard moderation... since it required actual high-meta-moderated-upvoted participation in threads on the part of the meta-moderator, it did tend to keep the trolls in check.  I think they applied a similar technique to submissions as well if I recall correctly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yeah, I forgot slashdot. You&#39;re right, meta-moderation is <em>better</em>, I guess but it still doesn&#39;t solve the problem of how to select moderators who are mature enough and intellectually honest enough to separate moderation from participation. It does arguably reduce the botting and shilling, though.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t they toy with meta-meta moderation at one point to have someone watch the watchers and then reward those people who consistently moderate &quot;correctly&quot; with more frequent moderation points?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can think up some ways to mitigate the things that pull towards groupthink but I have yet to find something that works better than what we do in any other situation in real life: get to know people who you can trust to perform a task and then have them perform that task according to some set rules. If you can&#39;t do strict moderation, you&#39;re stuck with the Xchan way but that is vulnerable too as we see on 8ch where a good way to attack the board as a whole is to en masse post illegal content to the board, report it to the authorities and cue investigation and headaches for the owner. Do enough of that and you silence the entire community and push it further underground.</p>

<p>I feel this is a ploy by Hollywood to confuse the public into thinking people like us are crazy when we mention this stuff happens in real life.  Their response is something like, &quot;Hey, I saw that on an episode of Homeland, LOL!&quot; and then you become the butt of their jokes.  </p>

<p>In 007: Quantum of Solace, the plot revolves around a villain who secures all the water rights in Bolivia.  As silly as it sounds, this sort of happened in Bolivia:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_privatization_in_Bolivia</a></p>

<p>But then you got some asshat author that writes this piece:</p>

<p><a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5077509/the-most-ludicrous-james-bond-supervillain-plots-of-all-time">http://io9.gizmodo.com/5077509/the-most-ludicrous-james-bond-supervillain-plots-of-all-time</a></p>

<p>If you scroll down to Quantum of Solace, the author states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The faux-Gore eco-resort water grab. You know what else is evil, besides solar energy? Water management. In the somewhat muddled Quantum Of Solace, the villain, Greene (Matthieu Amalric), is a fake environmentalist. He builds a fancy Eco-Hotel as a front for his vicious schemes. And he plans to help overthrow the government of a small South American country, in return for an apparently barren piece of land. But then it turns out that land secretly allows him to control most of South America’s water supply. </p>

<p>And there are many instances where movies and TV confuse the public into knowing what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not.  And it doesn&#39;t help that the general public is dumb as rocks.  </p>

<p>I can believe that. I think there&#39;s enough evidence out that it&#39;s very easy and possible to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get this straight: You&#39;re attempting to undermine the credibility of a random reddit user by catching them in a trap using subversive questioning (which is actually painfully obvious), so that you can claim everything they say is wrong because they aren&#39;t anti-Trump on EVERY SINGLE ISSUE. </p>

<p>Yet you have a username that is based on a &quot;conspiracy&quot; that has zero evidence to support it (internet articles with anonymous sources are not evidence).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think there are good reasons to believe in a Trump-Russia conspiracy?</p>

<p>every evidence released points to another direction (recent wikileaks dumps, theShadowbrokers release [...])</p>

<p>only reason you could possible believe in this conspiracy: you do not look for evidence yourself and eat all propaganda thrown at you -&gt; this is very contradicting to the very nature of a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;</p>

<p>that being said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think there are good reasons to criticize Trump?</p>

<p>yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is plenty of reasons to believe in the Trump/Russian collusion conspiracy. Hence the name.</p>

<p>Such as Paul Manafort working directly for Putin as a Russian lobbyist for over 10 years and then immediately working for Trump&#39;s campaign for free afterwards. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example out of many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at this point it&#39;s honestly nearly every post that reaches the top. &quot;Power users&quot; like the one from this post are not new, companies have manipulated Reddit to have spam bots upvote a particular story they want to see get awareness by pushing it up a couple thousand and then letting the hivemind at it.

<p>This isn&#39;t only r/politics either. pics, gifs, reaction gifs, all sorts of no political subs have been dominated lately with political posts that the users in the comments seemingly don&#39;t want. And yet there they are with 25k upvotes all of a sudden. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah you could. T_D is not a nice place for many liberals. It doesn&#39;t pretend to be neutral, however nor do the rules require civil discussion. The point of the sub is to praise Trump and shit on the left.</p>

<p><a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is supposed to be a neutral forum for <strong>civil</strong> discussion. </p>

<p>You beg for me to provide you examples but eh, fuck off. Do this instead -</p>

<p>Go to <a href="/r/ShitPoliticsSays">/r/ShitPoliticsSays</a></p>

<p>Look for posts actually from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> (sometimes other subs are linked)</p>

<p>Read the posts submitted.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll quickly find a lot of tolerant liberals calling for the execution of rurals and referring to every Trump voter/Republican as a Nazi fascist scum. Unironically with loads of upvotes. Honestly just go look for yourself, they&#39;re so numerous it&#39;s really easy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on vacation (Happy Easter!) and I&#39;m not by an actual computer I&#39;m typing from my phone. I&#39;m not going to go find and build a well sourced essay for something that everybody already knows (that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is toxic towards anyone not left).

<p>Hard to say just now. I&#39;ve been reading r/news, r/politics, and r/worldnews a lot lately and I started to notice strange things. The past week, I&#39;ve been checking their /new queue and tagging obvious bots and spammers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve probably tagged 30 so far, just on those 3 subs.</p>

<p>What I plan to do, is write a program to watch the /new queue and look for evidence of bots.</p>

<p>What can make it tricky is just how much some people love karma. There are a lot of people that just repost or spam submit all day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been sort of casually watching and taking notes, and I&#39;ve seen quite a bit of activity I&#39;d call &quot;suspicious,&quot; primarily involving accounts that seem to be dedicated to maintaining the momentum of the &quot;Pizzagate&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>Its funny because they said that <a href="/r/The_Donalds">/r/The_Donalds</a> was doing it but in actuality they werent. Was TD using its community to upvote ? Absolutely but now the other subreddits have resorted to botting to get attention. </p>

<p>If i log out and use the base subreddit, its nothing but political left wing bullshit from <a href="/r/MarchAgainstTrump">/r/MarchAgainstTrump</a>, <a href="/r/FuckTheAltRight">/r/FuckTheAltRight</a>, etc. All those kinds of subreddits, and its always the same users posting the same copy paste comments in the threads getting massively upvoted. Im not partison to either side, subbed to TD because im pro free speech, i still dont like that they censored that subreddit, especially not for the bullshit reasoning they gave.</p>

<p>Many of the subreddits are breaking the system the same way TD was but with bots and reddit isnt doing anything about them.</p>
