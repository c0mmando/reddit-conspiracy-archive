        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been a casual observer here for about a year, but just created an account and have never really posted. I&#39;ve been increasingly sold on sandy hook, pizzagate, 9/11 and now the boston marathon among others im sure to be forgetting.</p>

<p>My wife and I always chat about politics and policy, but in the past year, it has been impossible to hold a conversation about it because she believes the MSM by default and that there is no possible way to pull off such big conspiracies. She isn&#39;t hostile toward me about it, but the conversation always dies when I reference any of the reasonable things on this forum.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure many of you have had similar circumstances so I&#39;m curious how you successfully red pilled your spouse?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any response.</p>

<p>I have same issue.</p>

<p>Start somewhere you know you have common ground and build from there.  Perhaps the JFK Assassination is a good starting place.  Most people now a days believe it was a conspiracy.</p>

<p>My wife and I used to watch the X-Files all the time and were totally into it.  when we shut the TV off, she never gave shit a second thought.  I never stopped thinking about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First things first I&#39;d type up a document with each red pill in the order you want to go in. That way you have the URL of each topic ready to go.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go into some of the extreme stuff like Sandy Hook quite yet. I&#39;d only go for stuff that is proven or that has plenty of evidence. </p>

<p>Red pilling is like seducing her at a bar. You gotta get her attention early. Then slowly build your way up lol</p>

<p>For example here is a fake bombing caught on video. You can use this and then show them the white helmets faking rescues and saying they were doing the mannequin challenge.</p>

No one wants to talk about pedophiles. I&#39;m suprized and sickened that its such a hot topic within conspiracy it self. I like other topics like NK news, War, Alines ect. Start with the less extreme topics.  Go to The_Donald for further help. They are experts at redpilling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think women are more reluctant to talk about pizzagate because they don&#39;t want to think about the reality that it entails where high-ranking government people are pedo-Satanists.</p>

<p>Many of them also cannot accept the level of corruption of Hillary Clinton; they see her as the first realistic woman presidential candidate.</p>

<p>I would say, appeal to her area(s) of expertise, if she has any. If she is in healthcare, for example, you can show her some pictures from Dave McGowan&#39;s photo analysis of the Boston Hoaxathon and she can appreciate the staged injuries and unrealistic medical response.  Or with Sandy Hook, I always start with Wayne Carver&#39;s press conference and anyone who is familiar with talking to real doctors can immediately realize he is a fraud.</p>

<p>9/11 is a complex subject, hard to start with that one. It takes careful study and dedication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the civil response my inquire was likewise informed.  I think you are saying you want her to accept your leanings as believable.  I am very politically and enconomically and socially liberal, and I am puzzled by what seems to be acceptance from not only conservatives but liberals for the official story on the events of our times.  I think on the left is the long gone reality that we had a viable 4th Estate, something that has not been allowed, by necessity of the perps,  since the assassination decade of the 60s. </p>

<p>Thus Comcast&#39;s talking head Rachel Maddow misleads liberals to believe Trump will be removed by posing as a journalist because some fool liberals and progressives think we have a 4th Estate when it has been nothing but the manipulation arm of the wealthiest conservatives for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my wife knows about maybe even half believes some of the stuff I tell her and try to talk about with her but it is clear she just doesn&#39;t want to think about this. he job is stressful and life is too and there is little to nothing that we can do. we can know and we can distain but not much we can change. we can dwell on it and it can rot us away or we can just continue to on with our lives and blissfully ignore the truth. you can hope to change the world by exposing all that is corrupted and evil but you stand little to no chance. I feel sad for my kids who will grow up in who knows what kind of savage world or will get sent off to pointless wars but I still have work to do and my life will carry on. in short read what you want to learn what evils there are find out the truth of the world but if your wife isn&#39;t into this then you need to learn to be into something she is into or talk about something a little less heavy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s going to have to &#39;red pill&#39; herself but you can introduce some of the topics to her (with an open mind/dialogue) - my personal red pills were JFK, 9/11, Monsanto/food industry.</p>

<p>Avoid using your opinion and rely more on factual information if you&#39;re in a conversation with her. </p>

<p>If she brings up something she saw on the news, start asking her questions that reveal the flaws in the narrative, questions that will get her thinking, questions that the media isn&#39;t addressing. One of the first steps (IMO) is learning that the MSM is a propaganda machine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 3/4 red pilled my wife.  She still must live in the world where you pretend all of that is for hollywood only.</p>

<p>I personally started with all the obviousness of the world of business.  The world of money.  Any and all examples of money over people.  Business rules and money is power.  Money and power/control is exactly what wars are all about.  The string together.  If she can understand Gen. Smedley Butler when he says war is a racket, she can make the obvious leap that money power and control and all the rest is the real priority.  That means those people would go far far out of their way to stay in that power position and even manufacture issues in order to stay there.</p>

<p>What rich fuck is going to gve it all up willingly?  Especially when religous extrmemists are involved.</p>

<p>youtube the Israeli lobbyist asking for a false flag to be launched so they can attack iran.   Look at the opium in A-stan?  Your US troops are protecting those poppy fields.  The US Govt is usin your money and children are being used to defend opium so big pharma can push pills state side.</p>

<p>Moneh is the tool, money is the best way to get a true believer to understand that things are actually entirely backwards for us.  Get her to watch the hidden secrets of money.....cant remember the full title.  Or the that federal reserve cartoon with Pile and whoever....that wlrks for younger but not older viewers.  It insults the almighty knowledge of the previous generation.  </p>

<p>Then if youre atill interested in the money aspect.....I reccomend Bill Still and his The Secret of Oz, Im on mobile so those titles might be off a bit but you should find them.</p>

<p>Good luck, we need all the help we can get.</p>
