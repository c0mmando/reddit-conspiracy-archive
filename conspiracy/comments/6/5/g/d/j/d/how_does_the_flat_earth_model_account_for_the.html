    <div class="md"><p>He denys the tilt of the earth has anything to do with it yet doesn&#39;t address why that is. In fact the orientation of the tilt relative to the sun predicts whether you have the sun out all day for a few months or you don&#39;t see it at all in the poles so it seems it has quite a bit to do with it.</p>

<p>I always wonder what flat earthers think of cosmological discoveries. Is the hubble deep field really just a bunch of tiny flat earths or are they all just the same super cool movie produced by God for us to watch when we figured out lenses and shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dubay, would deny any tilt, as I have understood his explanation: Flat and level. The only thing I&#39;ve been able to extrapolate from the visual rendition in his video is <em>intelligent design of or with intention</em> but don&#39;t hold me to that - it&#39;s just how I&#39;m interpreting, mulling what I&#39;ve heard him say.</p>

<p>The best I could do is my own anecdotal experiences having lived in Alaska; long dark winters and extended sunlit summers where both mess with your body, energy and brain!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve formed no conclusions. I simply remain open at this point, as it is quite fascinating to consider.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to me the flat earth model is another level of foolishness. I can even entertain the possibility that NASA is all a show and we have never got humans past the kuiper belt but I guess I&#39;m like Dirac in the sense that the amount of mathematical beauty associated with Kepler&#39;s laws just wrecks the highly synthetic FE constructions that are continually updated to account for new phenomena(ala Ptolemaic epicycles within epicycles kind of thing) whereas even ignoring relativity almost all of the planetary movement and terrestrial observations all fit cleanly into Kepler&#39;s 3 laws. If the flat earth existed it&#39;s an easy calculation to show the sun would never go down anywhere since they always animate the sun like a fucking flashlight. We would see the sun swing along the horizon like the video but everywhere on the planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it&#39;s just our inability as humans to understand objects as immense as the earth. The critical error in all flat earth calculations is by using an ideal circle with an observer <strong>on the circle</strong>, the real life equivalent to this would be swimming in a perfectly still ocean with your pupil precisely just above the water. In real life we often have even 5-14 feet of height off of sea level when observing things from the coast so as strange as it sounds even 5 feet off of the planet allows one to start to get more reasonable calculations when we imagine the &quot;seesaw&quot; behavior of our line of site along with whatever the elevation of the object we are observing is. The calculations fail to account for the height in any &#39;proofs&#39; I&#39;ve seen. As far as the stiched together photos I really feel it&#39;s NASA trying to guarantee it&#39;s funding, check out <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2883739/The-GREY-planet-True-colour-image-reveals-Earth-really-looks-like-space-without-filters-editing.html">this link</a> for a Japanese true color and relative human eye exposure satellite photo of the earth from space and you kind of see why NASA spices it up a bit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I grasp what you&#39;re saying I&#39;ve never seen the curve myself. So how many miles up from the planet do I have to be to see it when flying?</p>

<p>Flying up thru the glaciers to Denali in a Cessna I didn&#39;t see it or photograph a curve, flying all around Alaska...

    <div class="md"><p>You can use a fairly basic telescope and a webcam to photograph the ISS, yet being able to perform such an easy, cheap test does not dissuade those who believe space isn&#39;t real or that things can&#39;t orbit the Earth because it violates their notions of physics. Why would something like logic applied to evidence carry more water in this case?</p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion that there are 4 basic types of flat-earthers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The genuine crazies.</li>
<li>Those who will believe anything so long as it isn&#39;t mainstream or is anti-western.</li>
<li>Hipsters.</li>
<li>Psyop people doing things for various motives. From astroturfers establishing conspiracy theorist street-cred for the obvious benefits astroturfers might want to those attempting to forcefully inject something unpalatable to most intelligent, educated people into the conspiracy theorist community.</li>
