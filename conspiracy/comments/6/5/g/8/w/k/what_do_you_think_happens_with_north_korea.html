       China says it will not help North Korea if attacked. China refused North Korean coal, and China cancelled all flights into North Korea. North Korea is on its own; just like Iraq was before America invaded in 2003. Fat Boy Kim will end up like Gaddafi: a stick shoved up his ass.

       pretty much my thoughts, USA will provide support from their navy and most likely airforce, as china moves in with their troops. It all ends with a regime change with the new leader who is backed by China.

       The US is about to destroy NK in a show of force in my opinion, based on what we did in Syria and Afghan. Kimmy is a dead man, unfortunately so are many SK citizens.

       I feel bad for them. The loss of life potential in Seoul is enormous but if we fuck them up with all we got they won't know what's coming. But yes, I do believe the millions in North Korea deserve to be as free as us, not worrying about spending their/child's/grandchilds life in a holocaust style labor camp.

       I've always felt like there was a tiny chance that every thing we've heard about NK is propaganda. Like they live in some sort of oasis or something lol, probably not true as I'm just wishful thinking about the possibility that a whole country really doesn't believe that their leader doesn't poop.

       It's important to question the official narrative. North Korea might actually be a hell hole. It might not. I don't have enough information to say for sure. You might but that's on you.

       While that is an important endeavor, you can't ignore an option because of it's association. NK might actually be a utopia, one we're led to believe by actors and mass disinformation campaigns is a hellhole, so we can destroy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could actually be a hellhole. And by my conclusions from viewing of media concerning North Korean refugees, geopolitics, and history, it actually is a horrible place. The effort required to liberate them is worth it, IMHO. It's going to blow sometime, and they're not training those mortars off of Seoul any time soon.

       I think you are right, but I honestly have no idea how any of this would play out though. If it happens, it will happen fast. I expect that North Korea will launch against South Korea the second we attack. Will we strike with tactical nukes and MOABs first to try to surprise them?

       Launches don't work like that, it takes time to launch a nuke. Artillery yea they will launch everything they have at SK unfortunately. I hope SK evacuates shortly beforehand, bit we can't let Kim develop icbm's

       I agree... the few countries that are left NOT under central bank control are Syria, North Korea, Russia, Iran and Cuba.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumors of war lately have been with Syria, NK, Russia and Iran. 
Syrias war plan didn't work, as the people didn't agree with Trump entering Syria and taking out Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he had to move to another county, which is NK. It seems like the ppl are FOR bombing NK, so he will more Likely take advantage of this time while the ppl are agreeing with nuking NK. 
I have a feeling we will see many years of war ahead of us...

       Also i think PNAC is still actively being followed through. 
Trump needs to public to agree with war just like we agreed with bush and war after 9/11. 
I seriously believe if majority of the public wanted trump to take Assad out... he would of done so. But, that wasn't the case, majority of the ppl thought the gassing was a false flag and not to take Assad out of power. 
I think this is why Trump is focusing more on NK bc majority of the ppl agree with taking Kim out.

       Syria, NK, Iran and Russia are countries ROTHSCHILD etc need to destabilize their govts and replace the govt w a democracy, aka their owned puppets.

       I do too! What really is a mind fuck is how the media and govt lies to us so much....What if they are lying to us about how Kim treats his ppl? I did some digging on that subject and I found a lot of ppl in North Korea LOVE Kim. They worship him like he's a God and why would they worship him if he was so horrible? I also found out majority of the North Koreans believe life outside of NK is dangerous. If you think about it... I kind of agree with that statement. The world is so fucked up and the US govt isn't innocent by any means. 
All we know is what the media tells us, which is not the truth. 
Put yourself in Kim's shoes... he's protecting his country from the Rothschild owned world. Basically, the whole world is owned by them so that is who he's up against. So hell yeah he's gonna have nukes ready just in case.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a mind fuck and it all goes back to the lazy ass Americans who don't research for the truth and just agree with media. "Nuke fat boy kim" smh

       China is even taken our side to bully NK. 
We owe china sooooo much, so u can only imagine how good of a trade deal trump made for them to side with us. 
NK is definitely being cornered, which isn't a good sign. 
You hear about the foreign journalist who were taken to a secret location where no phones were aloud? Shit is def gonna go down and trump isn't going to announce it either. We will know about it after the fact. 
US soldiers in South Korea have been out in the field training and are told if shit goes down to get ready to move north.

       I think you guys really underestimate lil kim. He's a phsyco with his finger on the button of nukes. I think he's the kind of guy to say "hey, if I'm going down, I'm taking as many people with me as I can. Even if he doesn't have long range nukes, he can still do a lot of damage to china, japan and south korea. Never underestimate a mad man with nothing to lose.

       Given their track record with those nukes (primarily the rockets to carry them), and the fact that the majority of their army is obsolete aircraft dating from the Vietnam and Korean war era... You might be overestimating him.

       I don't think he's overestimating Kim, the fucker had his own uncle executed, overestimating the military capabilities... maybe.

      <p>
       Also look at the Middle East, the terrorists we're fighting there don't even have 'obsolete' aircraft and look at how poorly it has gone for us, and how much money we've sunk in the endless war there, I don't think Korean War 2.0 would go over much better.

       What if Kim &amp; Kanye are both reptilian? Then when Kanye becomes President in 2020, we go to war against the Greys. At least we will get to see all the cool MIB guns.

       I feel like the future of every NK citizen is in the hands of KJU.  Unfortunately, he's a reckless idiot.  I hope he heeds to rationalism instead of his identity he has created for himself in his own little NK world.  Otherwise, he will ultimately be removed one way or another.  My guess is China does the work, not the US.

       Source: Everyone knows Trump is very strong and willing to respond with military force.  That is why for the first time in the last few decades, Russia and China are playing diplomacy with pen and paper now instead of their past theme of militaristic and threatening actions, because they know that Trump will not be walked all over and neutered by diplomacy, Nato, and the UN's inaction like presidents of decades past.  KJU now knows this too.  And I believe he is unwilling to further test Trump's resolve.

       I hope: both sides are posturing, with the intent of maintaining the illusion of power and dominance. I am concerned about: NK being blamed for an incident in which they played no part, the US flattens them, and hands NK over to the Chinese and the country is co-governed and its resources shared between the US and China, which angers NATO, and pressures the world to drop the US dollar as the economic standard....or..... NK is blamed for an attack or incident in which they played no part, the US flattens them, we decide to make the county a US territory and establish several military bases, which angers China. China then aligns with Russia and they decide to attack the US. The US receives little support from NATO and (Brexited = weakened) Great Britian due to the NK attack, and our isolationist policies and currency manipluation. Then WW3 begins and said feces has hit said fan.

       It's most likely just a lot of posturing as usual. No one actually wants to deal with NK, they would rather leave it as is then go in, fuck it up more and be left trying to fix it.

       If North Korea remains defiant they will be attacked. There is 0.00 doubt about it. The US cannot afford to not follow through.

       I honestly think the assassination of Kim Jong-Nam is what is setting all of this off. The missiles aren't much of a threat to the leadership of any country, but assasonations in foreign countries? that'll get their attention.

       I think N Korea has money and resources that the US and China want their hands on. Because of that, they're not just going to start nuking or bombing N Korea. I think US troops and/or China will find a way to invade it though.

       Whether it be this week or this time next year, North Korea will test another nuclear bomb and the US will MOAB or JDAM their site just like they did an isolated attack on Syria. North Korea will then have two choices 1) take the bombing and discontinue their nuclear efforts and see how much longer they can keep up their government until their economy collapses or 2) attack South Korea in retaliation and then eventually lose the war and their nation
