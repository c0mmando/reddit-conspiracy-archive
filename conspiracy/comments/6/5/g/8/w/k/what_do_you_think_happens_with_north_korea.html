    <div class="md"><p>While that is an important endeavor, you can&#39;t ignore an option because of it&#39;s association. NK might actually be a utopia, one we&#39;re led to believe by actors and mass disinformation campaigns is a hellhole, so we can destroy it. </p>

<p>Or it could actually be a hellhole. And by my conclusions from viewing of media concerning North Korean refugees, geopolitics, and history, it actually is a horrible place. The effort required to liberate them is worth it, IMHO. It&#39;s going to blow sometime, and they&#39;re not training those mortars off of Seoul any time soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree... the few countries that are left NOT under central bank control are Syria, North Korea, Russia, Iran and Cuba. </p>

<p>Rumors of war lately have been with Syria, NK, Russia and Iran. 
Syrias war plan didn&#39;t work, as the people didn&#39;t agree with Trump entering Syria and taking out Assad. </p>

<p>So, he had to move to another county, which is NK. It seems like the ppl are FOR bombing NK, so he will more Likely take advantage of this time while the ppl are agreeing with nuking NK. 
I have a feeling we will see many years of war ahead of us... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also i think PNAC is still actively being followed through. 
Trump needs to public to agree with war just like we agreed with bush and war after 9/11. 
I seriously believe if majority of the public wanted trump to take Assad out... he would of done so. But, that wasn&#39;t the case, majority of the ppl thought the gassing was a false flag and not to take Assad out of power. 
I think this is why Trump is focusing more on NK bc majority of the ppl agree with taking Kim out. </p>

I did some digging on that subject and I found a lot of ppl in North Korea LOVE Kim. They worship him like he&#39;s a God and why would they worship him if he was so horrible? I also found out majority of the North Koreans believe life outside of NK is dangerous. If you think about it... I kind of agree with that statement. The world is so fucked up and the US govt isn&#39;t innocent by any means. 
All we know is what the media tells us, which is not the truth. 
Put yourself in Kim&#39;s shoes... he&#39;s protecting his country from the Rothschild owned world. Basically, the whole world is owned by them so that is who he&#39;s up against. So hell yeah he&#39;s gonna have nukes ready just in case. </p>

NK is definitely being cornered, which isn&#39;t a good sign. 
You hear about the foreign journalist who were taken to a secret location where no phones were aloud? Shit is def gonna go down and trump isn&#39;t going to announce it either. We will know about it after the fact.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you guys really underestimate lil kim. He&#39;s a phsyco with his finger on the button of nukes. I think he&#39;s the kind of guy to say &quot;hey, if I&#39;m going down, I&#39;m taking as many people with me as I can. Even if he doesn&#39;t have long range nukes, he can still do a lot of damage to china, japan and south korea. Never underestimate a mad man with nothing to lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s overestimating Kim, the fucker had his own uncle executed, overestimating the military capabilities... maybe.</p>

<p>Also look at the Middle East, the terrorists we&#39;re fighting there don&#39;t even have &#39;obsolete&#39; aircraft and look at how poorly it has gone for us, and how much money we&#39;ve sunk in the endless war there, I don&#39;t think Korean War 2.0 would go over much better.</p>

<p>Kim would be happy to watch his empire fall as long as he got to incur as much damage as possible to the US and it&#39;s allies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like the future of every NK citizen is in the hands of KJU.  Unfortunately, he&#39;s a reckless idiot.  I hope he heeds to rationalism instead of his identity he has created for himself in his own little NK world.  Otherwise, he will ultimately be removed one way or another.  My guess is China does the work, not the US.</p>

<p>Source: Everyone knows Trump is very strong and willing to respond with military force.  That is why for the first time in the last few decades, Russia and China are playing diplomacy with pen and paper now instead of their past theme of militaristic and threatening actions, because they know that Trump will not be walked all over and neutered by diplomacy, Nato, and the UN&#39;s inaction like presidents of decades past.  KJU now knows this too.  And I believe he is unwilling to further test Trump&#39;s resolve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope: both sides are posturing, with the intent of maintaining the illusion of power and dominance. I am concerned about: NK being blamed for an incident in which they played no part, the US flattens them, and hands NK over to the Chinese and the country is co-governed and its resources shared between the US and China, which angers NATO, and pressures the world to drop the US dollar as the economic standard....or..... NK is blamed for an attack or incident in which they played no part, the US flattens them, we decide to make the county a US territory and establish several military bases, which angers China. China then aligns with Russia and they decide to attack the US. The US receives little support from NATO and (Brexited = weakened) Great Britian due to the NK attack, and our isolationist policies and currency manipluation. Then WW3 begins and said feces has hit said fan. </p>
