       The Reason Why Rhesus Negative People Are Being Tracked
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a lot of different posts on different online forums asking questions such as "Why would the Illuminati (CIA) be studying Rh negative blood?" and "Why would the government be tracking Rh negative people?" I have been asking these same questions. As  a young teenager I began sensing that I was being closely monitored. A chain of events in my life lead me to research the possible reason behind why I was feeling this way. I believe many other Rh negative people have noticed the very same thing going on in their own lives. Not all Rh negative people will notice blantant intrusions in their lives, because not all Rh negative people are targeted. Intelligence agencies are interested in a certain carrier of Rh negative blood.They are looking for people who have a complete deletion of the RhD gene. Nearly all Caucasians with Rh negative blood have a total deletion of the RhD gene. It is extremely rare for Africans and Asians to have a complete deletion of the RhD gene. African and Asian people with Rh negative blood usually always have a RhD gene it's just inactive. If they do have a deleted RhD gene it is caused by recent admixture with the Caucasian race.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence agencies also prefer Rh negative people who possess the CCR5 Delta 32 gene, although this is not mandatory. The CCR5 delta 32 gene is a mutated form of the CCR5 gene. The Mutation is caused by a deletion of 32 base pairs normally found on the CCR5 gene. This gene is found only in European, West Asian and North African populations. The CCR5 delta 32 gene originated in the Caucasian race, and is only found in West Asian and North African populations due to admixture, and it isn't found in the Sub Saharan African population. This gene causes people to have a resistance to the HIV virus and other diseases that need the CCR5 protein to enter cells in order to cause infection.
      </p>
      <p>
       These rare deleted genes originated in the Caucasian race, and having these genes can cause you to be a targeted individual. You may experience a wide variety of intrusions into your life, these intrusions can range from simply having medical records monitored to mysterious paranormal experiences. I'm going to share everything I know about why Rh negative people are being monitored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm about to share a lot of controversial information, please don't shy away because this information would be classified as conspiracy theories by the mainstream public. This article is going to dive into a lot of Information that was once classified top secret. I'm only sharing what I've researched and found to be truthful. Please further research anything you read in this article, so you can decide for yourself what is or isn't factual. I've spent countless months researching this topic, and what you are about to read is truthful to the best of my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I came across a very interesting whistleblower by the name of James Casbolt. He claims to be a former MI-6 agent who worked in "Black ops" drug trafficking operations during the mid to late 90's in London, England. He has spoken out about black operations that involve the recruitment and study of Rh negative people. James was born into Project Mannequin, a mind control and genetic manipulation program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United Kingdom. The NSA is an American organization that runs projects in and outside of the United States. James stated he was chosen for project Mannequin, which is a British MKUltra sub project, due to his fathers involvment in the Illuminati intelligence community, and because he possesses rare celtic genetics, he and his family have Rh negative blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Casbolt has reported that the NSA recruits Celtic Rh negative people because they believe people with these genetics have a predisposition to have paranormal experiences and psychic abilities, such as telepathy, precognition, and clairvoyance. For many generations ancient Celtic people practised psychic and magic rituals for their pagan religion of Druidry. The NSA and other top intelligence agencies believe psychic abilities are in the genetic memories of the Rh negative bloodlines. Even if a Rh negative individual hasn't practised PSI abilities,they can be easily trained to do so.

       Legitimate question, how can I get tested to see if I'm Rh-, and have somebody actually tell me the truth if I am or not? I don't think I'd trust any doctor to tell me if I am, it doesn't seem like the kind of thing "they" would want Rh- people to know...

       Nothing like finding out that you're a universal doner that can't accept blood from anyone but another universal doner but it does prove that "O" is the oldest and original blood type and there's a lot of interesting facts surrounding that like a much higher cancer survival rate among "O's" and a higher resistance overall to many common diseases. On the flip side there's also a high resistance and higher failure rate with transplants and many biologically based medicines and treatments that work well on all the other blood groups.

       I'm interested in this topic. The CIA is quite interested in Rh factor based on several documents I've found in the reading room. I thought I read something about the Basque peoples having a particularly high rate of Rh negative blood somewhere.

       There are some British aristocratic hippies who claim Rh- is the blood of the dragon.  Almost literally like Targaryen or whatever.  They claim the ancient antediluvian (pre ice age ending) civilization had highly genetically specialized castes and the rulers were visionary redhead types living in caves.

       Look up blood of the dragon, St. Germaine, and Rh-.  Some british aristocrat has a weird site about it.  That's all I know.  Frankly, now that pizzagate has happened, i'm freaked out about that stuff.

       I'm A-, caucasian, European decent, female, brunette, experienced very bizarre paranormal things, and very good with animals. My family lineage has people who possessed these gifts. I have just recently was looking the Rh- factor and it began to make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole dragon thing, on the other hand, is something completely new to me. Do you have any links you can share? I'm extremely curious :))

       Also, pre iceage era in Europe is told to be neanderthals. Despite popular belief, they were smarter than homo-sapians as they had a much larger cranial compacity. Neanderthals were Rh- while homo-sapians Rh+. It is said that neanderthals became extinct because homo-sapians would travel in large tribes, while neanderthals would break into smaller tribes of no more than 9. HS easily out-powered neanderthals with numbers, causing the extinction and interbreeding of the two species.

       Interesting fact about all this.  While I've never personally been monitored in regards to this fact (I honestly don't know why considering I'm the poster child for recessive genetics and the Rh- blood type/Red Hair/psychic abilities, don't know if I have some sort of protection or what) my gf had some very...interesting experiences.  And it's from that fact and her research on the matter that I know they are monitoring Indian variations of possible non Homo-Sapian genetics that may actually be seperate from the Rh- strain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her birth and early life reads out as a potential sci-if thriller.  Her parents were told that they were too old to conceive, only to find a doctor who volunteered to perform a special producedure to allow them to give birth to her.  When they later tried and find the doctor he had essentially vanished, and the employees at the hospital he supposedly worked for were completely unaware of his current location.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also confessed to later experiences of having been monitored by a man in a black suit who came to her school.  Having been taken to a checkup for some reason she can no longer remember in a basement with other children.  And finally having had somebody use hi-tech spyware equipment on her computer to monitor her while she was offline while she was playing as a kid (this was in the early 2,000s/late 90s when computers where still dinosaurs, so this had to have been some $$$$ spyware).

       I'm B negative. Not sure if it matters. I'm also left handed and can literally blend with any group. Maybe it's because I'm black and Hispanic so I can blend with someone who's an introvert. Or play the extrovert. No one can really read me although my physical prescence tends to intimidate most. I'm a gentle guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My fiance jokes that I'm a reptile or some garbage I've heard that theory but don't really buy into that but I would like to know what if at all the the rh negative really means or will mean. Maybe it's just purley a mutation and that's it.

       Hello, my name is Ana Clara and I have O- blood. Ethnically I am mostly Italian, with some German, Catalan and even Turkish although I was born in Spain and raised there until I was 13 when we moved to Philadelphia. So I used to have prophetic dreams, know things were going to happen in advance, and lucid dream a lot without trying. When I was 14 or so these dreams just stopped completely. I don't know what caused it. Also I only found out that I was rh negative a few months ago. What are some signs that I am being tracked and what can I do to regain my privacy if that is the case? It's very possible that I have been tracked because my daily routine is very monotonous and I'm admittedly not very observant. 
My mother also had clairvoyance but in the past few years she no longer talks about her dreams or sightings so I think when I ask her she will say that she has also experienced this. 
Do all rh- Europeans have clairvoyance or only some? I really want to get my special dreams back, I never realized how connected they made me feel until I felt dead without them. 
Thanks

       O- here, I have psychic/ lucid dreams. Strong intuition. Sometimes people think I'm crazy cause I know things. Then years later they say, " HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?!"  I just know.

       Yeah. Growing up everyone though I was crazy so I suppressed these things. Now that I'm older I've learned not to doubt myself but I also had better instinctual intuition when I was younger.

       RH- in the U.S. and had an army recruiter aggressively call and insist that I join the army.  He said that I had been flagged for having the unique characteristics for a special operation (this was in the 90's).   Insisted that I would skip boot camp entirely and advance immediately into training for this program.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said nope.   And for years I have wondered if it was all just a ploy to recruit or if I really was flagged...
