       TPTP handling üçïgate knew that if they used their limited hangout messiah of the conspiracy movement (jones) as bait, and he backed away from üçïgate, they hoped ALL his supporters and the conspiracy community at large would also walk away from it, assuming it's fake.

      <p>
       "Well, Alex Jones said it was fake, so it must be right?".
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't work out as they planned. AJ's followers were PISSED and unsubscribed and called his ass out. He's definitely a limited hangout guys. Don't give me this "he was threatened with a suit" or "his family was threatened" shit. He ALWAYS backs down when we have something legitimately detrimental to the system. They use him as an "insider", to steer us away from investigating important information. Fuck Jones. We have to do this on our own.

       What are the odds that the gov doesn't just kill people because they are a perceived threat - I went from originally thinking "they would never do that!" about 6-8 months ago, to "everything that they do is meant to limit us and enslave us and anybody who rises above that is killed or ensnared!" - but now, I cant tell if life is just random chaos and if the gov is afraid of knocking people off due to bad publicity so they don't so it ; i just have no clue

       Yea I've thought about that as well. Maybe if they killed him it would make everything he said look true. He'd be a martyr.

       But dude they killed a Supreme Court judge (Anthony Scalia), no autopsy, and nobody asked ANY questions and they got away with it. They can get rid of anybody they want, trust me.

       We don't unequivocally know that they murdered Scalia - its another conspiracy theory.  Personally, I am open to anything, no doubt - but using an unconfirmed theory to prove another point isn't really sound logic.

      <p>
       Believe me - I see the patterns and I believe that there is a system and people are nefarious enough for this; but there is no definitive proof yet

       I've noticed that. I listen to him occasionally and it always feels like he hits on some things but definitely avoids calling out Israel and focuses on blaming Iran. Especially in regards to anything in the middle east or Islam related.... Does he think ISIS is Shia? I've seen some conservatives express a connections between Iran and ISIS but I haven't researched where that idea is coming from beyond a general lack of knowledge on the topic.

       He still acknowledged podesta, the code words, media matters and everything else in wikileaks, he just didn't focus on the one pizza place.

       Maybe he is COINTELPRO but like anything else on the internet we need to do our due diligence and use our own common sense to see what's true and what's not.

       I got some flak for some of my posts about my continual doubt with Alex Jones in not only the past months, but ever since I heard of him hears ago.  His criticism of David Icke was surprisingly a mirror of his own agenda, "a turd residing at the bottom of a full punch bowl".

       has a good channel that follows the money trail with Dyncorp, the Clinton's shenanigans, human trafficking connected with...well, everything from human organ harvesting to chemical agent and vaccine testing (especially with what seems to be going on in Haiti right now).  He seems like a good source and whoever he's collaborating with.
       <br/>
       Anyway, trying not to feel discouraged for the reddit community has been more aggressive than ever (positively and negatively) as have the major networks that most people ingest their slant on what's going on in the outside world.  Buzz words abound more than ever where everything is a "-gate", narratives and news have to be on one side or the other.  "Fake news" clouds opposed opinions and facts while being diluted and dismissed with knee jerk reactions from the magical phrase "CONSPIRACY THEORY/THEORIST"'.  Then the surreal open admittance the social elitism, secret societies, and people don't seem to bat an eye because of the social conditioning an apathetic "that's just the way it is" mentality.  It's not like this is new it just seems to have been put into high gear especially the past couple years.
It just feels a little comforting and empowering to see a little rice of truth being corroborated among the chaff every now and then.  Thanks for listening,

       Anyway, trying not to feel discouraged for the reddit community has been more aggressive than ever (positively and negatively) as have the major networks that most people ingest their slant on what's going on in the outside world.  Buzz words abound more than ever where everything is a "-gate", narratives and news have to be on one side or the other.  "Fake news" clouds opposed opinions and facts while being diluted and dismissed with knee jerk reactions from the magical phrase "CONSPIRACY THEORY/THEORIST"'.  Then the surreal open admittance the social elitism, secret societies, and people don't seem to bat an eye because of the social conditioning an apathetic "that's just the way it is" mentality.  It's not like this is new it just seems to have been put into high gear especially the past couple years.

       Perhaps I should apologize for not being clear on emphasizing what I was saying was evil and disgusting.  Not political opinions but the alleged acts of human trafficking, sex trade, etc.  I mistakenly assumed since the expanded uproar of Jones' alienation  mostly caused by his retention into the whole P-Gate thing, was likely the catalyst for the Original poster's post.
       <br/>
       I think I gave a pretty broad feeling that a lot of people would at least empathize or somewhat agree with and certainly not enough to immediately know what my political opinion is.
       <br/>
       Also, I don't think I was demonstrating anything selfish except for maybe wanting my voice heard. The link to a channel I gave would help show how much bigger it is than solely P-Gate.
       <br/>
       In conclusion, I apologize for not being clear.

       Alex Jones is a buffoon. Fear gear salesman...and a lying piece of shit. He mixes Truth with bullshit as he acts like a total asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claimed 9/11 was an inside job while not once mentioning the obvious...Israel. In fact, he would implicate everyone BUT Israel. A sure sign he is a fraud and controlled opposition. He led his audiences down roads to nowhere making up shit as he went along...screaming and hollering as if he was actually emotionally invested...what a fucking joke. The man is an actor of the establishment...Ring Master of the Shit Show. Only a complete moron would EVER take that piece of shit seriously.

       This whole thing against Jones is stupid.  No matter your feelings on him, he's been covering pedogate for a long time and still does, only he DOES NOT mention Alfantis or Comet Ping Pong BECAUSE of a lawsuit that threatened to take him down.  It's likely that the source of the lawsuit isn't even something he put up directly, but was put up under the Infowars banner.  He retreated on that piece of pedogate to save his entire organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       This baloney about him covering for the pedophiles is idiotic, if you actually listen to the show.

      <p>
       There was no actual lawsuit though, only the potential for a lawsuit. Nothing was ever filed, and he never set foot in a courtroom. As stated in his apology, his retraction was in response to a letter from Alefantis. Under
       <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.73.htm">
        Sec. 73.055
       </a>
       of Texas state law (Jones is based in Austin), a plaintiff must have requested "Correction, Clarification, or Retraction,"
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       suing for defamation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones could have used any of those three options in response to the defamation accusations, so why choose to retract? Does he not have enough evidence to back up his claims, or does he just not care? Either way it says a lot about his character IMO, and he comes off as a huge pushover.

       I'm sure you're right, and their are many parts of his apology that reference things 'we' did. But there are also parts where he personally apologizes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In our commentary about what became known as Pizzagate,
        <strong>
         I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret
        </strong>

       These are all good points.  However, consider this:  Jones is already in a court/custody battle with his ex-wife.  He is likely lawsuit-averse at this point in time.  His lawyer might have suggested he punt this one.  And I wouldn't be surprised that the wording of his apology was crafted in part by his lawyer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not out of the realm of possibility that Jones is controlled opposition, but many of the facts on this sub are half-truths or false.  It may be a case of trying to peel back layers that don't exist.

       I have a question: what does it say about conservatives that you think that people who have a slightly different political philosophy than yours are all wicked?
      </p>
      <p>
       American Liberals, for the most part, like capitalism, they support much lower taxes than even the conservative parties in other countries, they believe in civil rights but also want to see criminals punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's the fact that you feel a little bit guilty for your political philosophy, one that completely rejects collective action and is inherently selfish, so you try to project that onto others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure Hillary Clinton has done a lot of indefensible shit. I think that is common trait for any leader. But the fact that you people just seem to think that she is some constantly scheming supervillain says more about you than it does about her.

       Could you prove pizzagate in a court with a fair judge? No? Then shut the fuck up, please. Just take your nutropics and plant some seeds and shut your trap. You have no right to try to make everyone else as miserable as you feel.

       But this is just the tip of a shit iceberg. The amount of paranoid bullshit slung by right-wing conspiracists is ridiculous. These people only care about selling seeds and the only way to sell seeds is to reinforce paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The by-product of always crying wolf is that nobody believes you when there is actually a wolf. The fact that the reporting of a so-called conspiracy got so far on such flimsy evidence is proof of just how paranoid they are. Its convenient that nearly all of the paranoia is directed at their political enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I think being an American conservative is pretty damn dumb and selfish. Still, I think that most conservative politicians are probably trying hard within their belief system to do the right thing. These conspiracists on the other hand play politics like the worst kinds of football fans. The kind that cheer when the opposing players get injured. The kind that break into hotels and pull the visiting team's fire alarm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to convert anyone or anything, but it makes me furious that someone like Alex Jones can get rewarded once for absolutely inventing a conspiracy out of thin air, and then, get rewarded again when he apologizes for it. I'm not even angry at him, really. I'm angry that there are millions of people who are polluting my country who can be fleeced by nutropics con men.

       No one was handling anything. It was/is an accusation that ran wild on the internet, demonizing the democratic party during an election. Not even that had much effect. You guys can't convince a conspiracy board, yet think "TPTB" took interest on that scale? Not even close. Defaming a couple powerful people sure, but their actions in response are not surprising. What would you do if your neighbors started telling people you molest kids or are a rapist? Pretty serious accusations, and hard to wash that stink off once it's on. You'd likely have to move.

       YOU want someone powerful to go to jail. To go down. To be taught a lesson. A win for the people! This isn't about kids or sex trafficking, stop kidding yourself.

       As far as I'm concerned any voices speaking out for the common person that makes millions of dollars out of doing it isn't a common person, in it for any common people or speaking out for any of them. They're all just your typical money-grubbing snake oil salesman trying to separate them from as many of their hard earned bucks as thy can.

       I always thought it was interesting that Alex Jones &amp; Donald fans went so hard on this and the Clintons but completely ignore the fact that Donald Trump was also

       (visit properties, rode Lolita Express, aware of his taste for young women, etc) and referenced Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz just last month:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At the Nashville rally, Trump cited Dershowitz's statement on MSNBC when talking about the ruling, which he called "terrible."
"Even liberal Democratic lawyer Alan Dershowitz, good lawyer, just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States," Trump said.) at rally (in regards to the travel ban (

       was the federal prosecutor that cut Epstein a (pretty inappropriate) deal in his underage sex case.

       As someone who disliked both Trump &amp; Clinton, I tried mentioning this all to my Trump-supporting friend(s) before and it's like they block it out &amp; I'm speaking another language.

       On a tangential note, has uh, there been any discussion about the sewer dwelling, pizza eating, teenage reptilian aliens, who live in secret, take orders from a vermin, and have a secret media asset on their side?... Im talking about. The childrens story: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles of course~

       This is what separates him from CIA disinfo-Niche entertainment
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he has so many followers and has managed to become so huge, whilst revealing some pretty "unsavory" things about the establishment...
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he is still ALIVE. And has been allowed on talk shows, Fox News, CNN, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the establishment
       <em>
        allowing
       </em>
       him to grow into this phenomenon, because it is beneficial to them in some way.
