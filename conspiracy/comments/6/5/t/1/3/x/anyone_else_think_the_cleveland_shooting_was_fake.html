      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         360 degree turn right when he shoots
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Plastic bag seems empty but sticks like a rock after the shot
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Man drops and no movement or blood movement within 2 seconds of being shot
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Dead man face obscured (conveniently)

       <li>
        <p>
         No real confirmation of the kill by Steve (despite killing being the motive)

       Agreed. There's no legit reason to think this tragic happening was anything other than what is shown on video. I've been listening to police scanners for the past 3 hours, and they are most certainly trying to find this piece of shit.

       I don't think it's hard to believe it happened but we should always be thinking critically and questioning things. This seems to have been handled poorly by authorities and could of been embellished. Like him claiming X number of other victims with no official reports. Regardless of if it's a real event, it will quickly be spun into whatever agenda needs pushin.

       The amount of blood, the pattern of the spray, its color, and how quickly it appeared really surprised me. I'm not saying that I think it's fake, I think it's probably real, but I do acknowledge that it this could easily be something other than it appears...

       Ok heres a still. Look at the very red blood then look at the very dark dried up looking splatter to the left of the bright red blood. Also, kinda looks like the blood that's in a line was down and they went back over it with new. Like you can see older darker dried up stains under the bright  red.

       He shot an old man right in the face. All that blood in your head and brain will shoot out. I wouldn't be surprised if the shooter got sprayed with blood too, hence the turn around.

       He claims. Aside from the one shooting, there's no evidence yet that he was being truthful about his murder spree. He may well have been talking shit.

      <p>
       The livestreamer was making no effort to hide his whereabouts, and in fact was advertising them. The shooter is
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to remain uncaught. It's not surprising that one was easy to find and the other wasn't.

       There's no reason to and it's pretty disrespectful at this point in time to speculate. It just happened hours ago, an old guy died horriblyfor no reason, his family is hurtin'...and the suspect is still at large.

       Yeah kinda. Blood splatter forensics is essentially fluid dynamics, and the solving the Navier-Stokes equations wins you a million bucks so I'd there's some complexity to it.

       There is no way a man shot in the face "should" fall, there is absolute chaos in the CNS the brief moment after being hit but before bodily movement shuts down so his body is really apt to do anything. As far the movement if the shot hit the poor old dude's brainstem he is effectively paralyzed (ignoring being nearly dead of course) so there would be no writhing or even involuntary spasms.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that the brain has a hard time witnessing events like this in modern camera footage and accepting it as real and since we're not criminal pathologists who have seen dozens of point blank shots to the head any intuition we may have that it seems fake may just be that we are witnessing something so extraordinary. I mean this dude vlogged his life for a bit and went fishing with his nephew and then shot an innocent old man. Its gotta be a funky anti-psychotic and/or anti-depressant reaction, ever wonder why Adam Lanza's doctor disappeared before his medical records could be published?

       Adam Lanza went to the doctor? You mean he existed other than the one bug eyed picture we saw of him? You do know that doctors arent the people who hold the records? The records would be on a computer system, his diagnosis would be submitted to insurance which would pay any claims that were submitted for him?  A dr can't just sneak away in the night with records.

       thats not necessarily true. Your records definitely are with your doctor (in whatever system they use) and in the case of psych medicine, its usually not submitted to insurance by the doctor, you must do so yourself. Most psychologists do not accept traditional insurance.

       So the dr picked up the computer server and ran off into the night? You do know that in many cases his general doctor will have his psych diagnosis as well. Especially with someone as supposedly as troubled as him there will be a long history of diagnosis with various doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about any prescriptions he was on? So the pharmacy doesn't have his prescription records? His medication was never sent to the insurance.

       The story is flimsy as fuck.

       I don't know about any of that. Are you claiming there is zero record of any of that? Have you verified with his insurance companies, pharmacies, etc. that there is no record of it whatsoever? I just havent heard that narrative about him having no paper trail, Im not refuting it, I just havent heard it discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was simply pointing out that medical records are most certainly with the doctor, and that typically that type of medicine is not directly covered by insurance through the doctor.

       It surprised me when he turned around and the old man was already on the ground. Didn't really hear a loud thud which I was expecting. And I didn't know blood would be able to run down the side walk so fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I wonder how he didn't get any blood on him. You'd think there'd at least be little specks or something. I'm in no way an expert but it definitely all seems strange.
