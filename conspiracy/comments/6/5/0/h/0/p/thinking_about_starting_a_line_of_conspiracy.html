       I want to convey strong messages delivered simply in big, bold letters that take up the front of the garment:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fuck Monsanto"
"Fuck the Deep State"
"Fuck Elitism"
"Fuck the War on Drugs"
"Fuck Pizzagate"
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a ton of others, but you get the idea. My dream for this would be for someone to be wearing a comfortable, high quality tank, be walking down the sidewalk and someone who isn't
       <em>
        woke
       </em>
       ask them "Hey, what is Pizzagate??" "I'm glad you asked, I'd love to explain how Pizzagate represents the real plague of pedofiles in our upper government." Or at least be curious enough to research it when they got home after seeing it. There isn't much we average joes can do but start the conversation, raise awareness of the issues we care so much about that escape the public eye. I strongly believe T shirts can send and spread a strong message. I recently attended a rave in Texas where a gentleman was wearing a "Fuck ISIS" tank and it inspired this idea. I've been wanting to start my own business for a long time, this would be hopefully the first of many. The topics represented in this line are important to all of us... I am posting to try to get as much feedback as possible on how to go about this and if I should even. I know it probably would displease a lot of people should they catch wind. But you know, life is short and all that. Anyways, cheers all! Thanks for reading if anything. (-:

       My advice is to see what general price similar things are going for and figure out how to be 20% cheaper, people will appreciate that. Clothing is a fucking rip off with ludicrous mark-ups to fleece the buyers. Rely on shifting more product for less profit and you might just edge out the competition and make a tidy profit.

       Thank you kind soul, great advice and I couldn't agree more, I would love to keep quality and keep prices low. &lt;3 I think I would resolve to wear a "Fuck Monsanto" shirt twice a week.

       That would be a good one too, but how many people believe that and would advertise it? The first few designs need to be things people can easily and readily stand behind. Foes of mankind most people can support.

       Yea. One slogan is did you know about the third tower. And there's a lot of different versions of this. But the shorter the better. Because people intend it to start a conversation, not prove a point.

       I get the urge but it's kind of ironic don't you think? Conspiracies and the like kind of all revolve around the wealthiest of the wealthiest fucking over humanity to benefit themselves right and one of the main mechanisms of this practical enslavement of humanity is money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you want to start an enterprise, where you're gonna buy and sell product(you will have to buy the shirts/materials needed to start a business) thus allowing one of the main mechanism of oppression with a new source to feed on?
      </p>
      <p>
       You say you wanted to start a business for awhile, clothing companies, especially startups are hot right now, but you need to think of the market you're aiming for. Is someone who would wear a 'Fuck the Deep State' shirt gonna pay you to make and ship them one, or just grab a t-shirt they already have and make it themselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       just my opinion.

       I'm simply trying to spread the word. Perhaps you are right, but either way I have to make a living and I'd rather work for myself for something I believe in than handing my precious time over to a corp.

       No one wears v-necks. When ever I wore one it felt like I was trying to show off cleavage like a girl. Crew neck is the way to go. As it is often colder most of the year especially in northern states.

       You might not want to try to put fuck on every single t-shirt. The goal of spreading the truth is tough. The cognitive dissonance is real. They have spent years turning us into good little workers who never challenge authority. You might need a few less provacative phrases to truly expand your reach in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if you want to draw attention to certain things it works just fine to point it out.

       Who shot JFK? Operation Gladio, Dyncorp Ratlines, Franklin Files, FBI murders children(waco). I'm sure if you put any thought into it you could actually do some good and pocket some money while you're at it.

       How about using the "I (heart) ..." design and list the documented outrageous things governments love to do, like "I (heart) my MK-ULTRA" or Operation Popeye, Operation Paperclip, Project Bluebird, Operation Mockingbird, etc ? Maybe use a QR code in place of the heart that will link to the actual documentation.

       Like a parody of shirts that say "I (heart) NY". Maybe the heart could stay and the QR code goes near the bottom, away from the text.
