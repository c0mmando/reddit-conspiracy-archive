       So, a while back Sean Spicer
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-sends-distress-signal-to-america-with-upside-down-flag-pin_us_58c2f67ee4b054a0ea6a8502?hnz14dtlkgdd6ajor=&amp;">
        wore his American flag pin upside-down
       </a>
       , which is a sign of
       <a href="http://www.usaflagsupply.com/upside-down-flag/">
        distress
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Then recently we have these slip ups where Spicer is shown blatantly saying they are trying to
       <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/328397-spicer-accidentally-says-trump-trying-to-destabilize-the-middle-east">
        destabilize Syria
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps both of these were deliberate attempts to signal to America. Maybe Spicer and Trump know that things like war in Syria is a bad idea and these military actions are just to placate warmongers within the White House. Or perhaps they are asking for help, saying there's nothing they can do to stop TPTB and basically throwing an "America, help!" to all the viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk, just a possibility. I'm sure this has been said before, but I just wanted to throw it out there.

       It'd be foolish to think people in that realm or on that level of power are idiots.  People think George W. was an idiot, but if you look at his old interviews he was very articulate or at least compared to the W. character he played. He took the public for idiots, and got away with everything.

       GW had daddy peering over his shoulder giving him worthwhile advice. He was following an old script. Trump has no such stable mentor. He trusts nobody but his bimbo daughter. He thinks he gives himself the best advice, after being told what to think by Ivanka, Fox and Brietbart.

       That's a huge topic on its own though. It's not a topic I like to have a set opinion on, but there's certainly a reasonable argument to be made that the holocaust narrative is a highly fabricated one, particularly the aspect of it that pertains to the deliberate gassing of prisoners in chambers filled with Cyclon B.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just to clarify, as it's such a contentious topic, I am not denying that thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, died in concentration camps. A tragedy of tremendous scale did occur without a doubt, but the main culprit seems to have been typhus and other diseases that have a tendency of flourishing in cramped, swampy and wet living conditions. And while Cyclon B was found in all concentration camps, it appears to only have been used on the inmates' clothes and beddings, rather than as a chemical weapon (as its blue residue was only ever found in small disinfecting-chambers, and not in the large alleged gas chambers)
      </p>
      <p>
       Through that lens (and again, I'm not claiming to know anything for sure, just expressing my suspicions), were it true that the gassing narrative was invented after the fact and the numbers of deaths inflated, Spicer's remarks would actually be true, albeit provocative like nothing else. It would still be pretty wild for a US press secretary to hint at that publically, but at this point I wouldn't even be surprised if that was deliberate.

       The point of that one isn't that it's always true, it's that it leads one to the most likely conclusion. Weird shit happens, which is why "truth is stranger than fiction" is also a common turn of phrase.

       "Trump under siege" narrative is useful for trying to rally support for the man, while the executive branch carries out actions that were not a part of the platform. Lots of us got fooled, but we don't have to stay that way.

       OP I agree with you. I think there's something to this. I'll say for about the 15th time here,  Trump will not attack Syria. (At least not a real attack) I believe its a great possibility that Trump is indeed working with Russia, hence Assad to end the REAL tyranny the is world is under. Maybe I'm just optimistic but I follow this very very close. 
For some reason you're not being told the complete truth about the chemical bombing. 
Don't be discouraged OP you might be on the right track. It's a shills job to stop/derail things like you posted here. There will be others who will speak negative but that's just their ignorance. Stay safe, we need people like you!

       This won't be a super popular idea, but I have an extremely hard time believing any of these incidents were accidental. The press secretary reports are so visible, they must be extremely scripted. Any one of these details on their own maybe doesn't mean anything, but for all of them to happen and Spicer not be fired, maybe it is a signal? And if it IS a signal, what do you suppose we should do about it?

       Hahaha holy shit, it can never just be trump being a shitty president? You're saying this is to tell us he's in distress, then maybe he shouldn't have hired 8 Goldman Sachs swampmen, or Rex tillerson (who is gonna be a very happy man when we get the pipeline) or McMaster (LOL), the list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either he's just a stupid puppet who is there as a symbol and all the appointments had nothing to do with him, or he's really just a shitty president who's happy to bomb Syria even though he mocked Obama for years with saying how terrible bombing Syria was. What happened to focusing on America? Lol man you guys are delusional, thankfully more and more of his supporters are waking up and realizing what many knew from the beginning.
