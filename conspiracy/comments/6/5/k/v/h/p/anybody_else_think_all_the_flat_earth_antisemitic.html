       Notice the Jew posts are all by one guy, and he's crossposting them in several subs. I'm all for questioning the narrative, but there has been a significant uptick in posts about the Jews (even ones that get downvoted) since we got that post about browsing the new tab on the front page.

       I think that people who won't research the flat-Earth theory, who won't research chem-trials, and call everybody antisemitic when they question the holocausters' activities are the shills trying to discredit this sub.

       What about the majority of people who have researched those things and still think they are bullshit? You act like "researching" those topics will automatically make you take the conspiracy side, but the vast majority of people who look into FE, chemtrails, and holocaust denialism think it's all bullshit.

       Out of those three theories, I think Chemtrails has the most merit. Chemtrail theorists can at least provide evidence that it has been done
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       . Maybe not that they're doing it now, but at least there's evidence that it's been done and it's not exactly a technological reach to assume it's possible.

       My thing with chemtrails is that people tend to think that means something like "Omg the big bad government is poisoning us all and mind-controlling us through the shit they're spraying!" and like, ok
       <em>
        maybeee
       </em>
       lol. I think it's mostly just bioengineering which is also a bit unnerving, I've watched multiple planes fly over spraying something and also watched it turn into clouds and that doesn't seem so nefarious? Idk maybe both?

       having taken a gander at the subjects...i believe flat earth is shills and the mislead.  holocaust denial is very rarely flat out denial, my experience is watching a few people call the numbers in history books impossible and subsequently they are labeled as crazy.  chemtrails are very real to me, the argument is over their purpose.  world isnt b&amp;w

       Who is lumping different topics together? Professor James Fetzer claims the holocaust is a hoax, but also claims that Paul McCartney died and was replaced. So, since Fetzer is a nut, can we also say that his claims about the holocaust are full of holes?

       Before we go nuts on each other over the flat earth claims, have you taken time out from your holocaust studies to research the claims and evidence given by the flat earthers? I too, went ape-shit nuts when I first heard that there were actually "idiots" that believed we live on a flat earth. That is, until I took off the concrete blinders and started examining their evidence. And, do you know what? It is impressive. I shit you not. It will bump your head because some of the arguments are very, very impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have researched it thoroughly, and you still believe that we live on a spinning ball, that's fine. That is your right. Just like it is the right for people to believe that 6 million Jews were gassed in Hitler's camps.

       I have researched it extensively.  My PhD in physics helped me understand a bit too.

       So, you have a PhD in Physics? What is your area of expertise? I have a minor in Physics. I  changed majors when I went back to school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay. I will tell you what. If you really have a PhD (which I will assume you do) you have an opportunity before you like no other. I am being very serious here. All you have to do is go back and look at the claims made by the flat earthers, and then refute them with scientific proofs (not postulations and with "he said; she said), no, but with proofs, and you my friend will put this whole flat earth business to rest, once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, may I mention, you will be a celebrated hero; not only by the scientific community, but by all of the rehabilitated flat earthers who have been "freed".

       Did you know David Irving revised his claims about the holocaust? He now says that the Jews were gassed in Hitler's camps. He is taking a lot of heat for making these claims.

       I've done plenty of flat Earth research. It is all bullshit.  Either flat out lies or bad science.  It is so bad that I can't get myself to believe anyone actually believes it.   You would have to be so from reality because you have to believe millions of people are "in on it" from NASA to ship captains, to meteorologists, to topographers, to all world governments, to all oceanographers, climatologists, pilots, FAA, and so many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would have to be willingly ignorant or insane to actually believe it.

       No? That's what this sub has been all the time for the most part. It changed about a year ago and hasn't been the same since.

       You post in just conspiracy and very few others, you're a shill. You rarely post in conspiracy, you're a shill. If you've ever posted in t_d, you're a shill. If you post regularly in r politics, you're a shill. If you don't think Russia hacked the elections, you're a Russian shill. If you think Russia did, you're a shareblue shill. If you post about flat earth, you're a shill. If you go on threads to discredit flat earth, you're a shill. Let's just accept it, we're all apparently shills to someone.

       Given I debunk those, if those are posts by shills that's going to confuse a lot of my fans.

       The flat earth people are most certainly here to discredit this sub. Their arguments are by far the most insane I have ever seen and they have to know it.. they bring you down to their level and beat you with experience when you try to argue with them.

       No i don't think that. I think the reality is that there are a lot of people in here that use conspiracy as a switch out for "my unpopular opinion remains unpopular therefore it must be a conspiracy".
