    <div class="md"><p>Out of those three theories, I think Chemtrails has the most merit. Chemtrail theorists can at least provide evidence that it has been done <em>before</em>. Maybe not that they&#39;re doing it now, but at least there&#39;s evidence that it&#39;s been done and it&#39;s not exactly a technological reach to assume it&#39;s possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before we go nuts on each other over the flat earth claims, have you taken time out from your holocaust studies to research the claims and evidence given by the flat earthers? I too, went ape-shit nuts when I first heard that there were actually &quot;idiots&quot; that believed we live on a flat earth. That is, until I took off the concrete blinders and started examining their evidence. And, do you know what? It is impressive. I shit you not. It will bump your head because some of the arguments are very, very impressive. </p>

<p>If you have researched it thoroughly, and you still believe that we live on a spinning ball, that&#39;s fine. That is your right. Just like it is the right for people to believe that 6 million Jews were gassed in Hitler&#39;s camps.</p>

<p>Okay. I will tell you what. If you really have a PhD (which I will assume you do) you have an opportunity before you like no other. I am being very serious here. All you have to do is go back and look at the claims made by the flat earthers, and then refute them with scientific proofs (not postulations and with &quot;he said; she said), no, but with proofs, and you my friend will put this whole flat earth business to rest, once and for all. </p>

<p>And, may I mention, you will be a celebrated hero; not only by the scientific community, but by all of the rehabilitated flat earthers who have been &quot;freed&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done plenty of flat Earth research. It is all bullshit.  Either flat out lies or bad science.  It is so bad that I can&#39;t get myself to believe anyone actually believes it.   You would have to be so from reality because you have to believe millions of people are &quot;in on it&quot; from NASA to ship captains, to meteorologists, to topographers, to all world governments, to all oceanographers, climatologists, pilots, FAA, and so many others. </p>

<p>You would have to be willingly ignorant or insane to actually believe it.  </p>
