<p>“If this hostility, even aversion, had only been shown towards the Jews at one period and in one country, it would be easy to unravel the limited causes of this anger, but this race has been on the contrary an object of hatred to all the peoples among whom it has established itself. It must be therefore, since the enemies of the Jews belonged to the most diverse races, since they lived in countries very distant from each other, since they were ruled by very different laws, governed by opposite principles, since they had neither the same morals, nor the same customs, since they were animated by unlike dispositions which did not permit them to judge of anything in the some way, it must be therefore that the general cause of anti-Semitism has always resided in Israel itself and not in those who have fought against Israel.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is adding &quot;Jew&quot; makes the sub look bad (whether or not it is antisemitic) and if we want people to listen to the things we post on this sub, it would be best to at least appear to be neutral. Zionist is a term people can swallow and recognize as not representative of all Jews but they way you worded it seems a bit aggressive and hateful. Losing that type of wording would really help the sub shirk the unfair &quot;racist&quot; label. I don&#39;t think the use of &quot;Jew&quot; is racist or antisemitic but I do fear it will be perceived that way, especially by readers eager to refute the messages here.

<p>However, I I do agree, if you can get your point across by saying &quot;zionist&quot; instead of &quot;jew&quot;, then go ahead. </p>

<p>But, I have e said it many times before, and I will say it again here:</p>

<p>Not all zionists are Jewish. </p>

<p>Not all Jews are zionists. </p>

<p>All zionists are evil. </p>

<p>Do you disagree with opinions and subject matter presented here? Fine, correct those that you feel are mistaken or misrepresenting with reasoned, cited counter-arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, I am writing in concern over the inaction of the moderators of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to remove antisemitic posts. These kinds of posts can and do incite violence towards Jewish people. Recently there have been incidents where Jewish community centers and schools have been targeted by antisemitic attackers.</p>

<p>This is just a sampling of some of the posts made to that subreddit today:</p>

<p>It is mostly certain users who are posting these things, and it seems that the most effective solution would be for those users to be banned from that subreddit.</p>

<p>I would like to see action taken to show that reddit will not tolerate this hateful antisemitism.</p>

<p>Kind regards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more people that delve into obscure conspiracies, the more people will find that a lot of roads lead back to the shot callers in Israel just like the shot callers in England and USA (hint the biggest one set up Israel and his progeny are now shot callers worldwide and particularly Israel and the United States of America). </p>

<p>Most secret societies tend to revolve around obscure god worship and the teachings of gnosticism and mystery babylon. This stuff is deeply rooted in certain Judaic heritages. </p>

<p>Add that to the fact that we are starting more shit in the middle east which usually always benefits Israel and the fact that a lot of Americans hold allegiance to Israel because of muh church but don&#39;t actually closely read muh bible. </p>

<p>People notice these things. I&#39;d think now more, than ever before. </p>

<p>Sorry if this seems to offend or concern people. But it&#39;s plain truth that Israel is largely immune from criticism when they get hit hard for a day on here and people start hollering &quot;anti-semitism&quot; (a bullshit term anyways, most jews are not semitic and a lot of arabs are )</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t think Israeli Jews should &quot;thank&quot; Hitler, but without him <em>(or someone playing a similar role)</em>, there would be no Israel. </p>

<p>The Zionist leaders of the time SHOULD have appreciated Hitler <em>(and no doubt did)</em>, because wittingly or unwittingly, he served THEIR purposes - as it was Zionists - not anyone else - who wanted and NEEDED a mass-immigration of European Jews to Palestine - and before Hitler, not enough Jews were showing up.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because before Hitler came along, very few Jews had any desire to move to Palestine - especially Western European Jews, most of whom had quite comfortable and prosperous lives in Europe. Why the HELL would they want to go to Palestine?</p>

<p>These days it is widely believed that the creation of Israel was <em>in response</em> to the actions of the Nazis. <strong>That is false</strong>. The plot to create a Jewish Political State in Palestine commenced in 1896, 24 years before the Nazi Party was founded, and 37 years before Hitler became Chancellor.</p>

<p>Jews have every right to hate on Hitler - but what they FAIL to realize is that it was the Zionist Leaders - a handful of extremely wealthy and politically powerful men - that <em>intentionally</em> created/exacerbated the ethnic strife that FORCED the mass exodus of Jews - first from Europe, and later from surrounding Arab countries - into Palestine.</p>

<p>The primary motivating factor that drove the Zionists to hatch their scheme was FEAR: Fear that the <em>&quot;Jewish Race&quot;</em> was in danger of becoming &quot;extinct&quot; - NOT so much due to pogroms some &quot;Holocaust&quot; type event, but due to what THEY saw as a much GREATER danger: </p>

<p><strong>Assimilation.</strong> And even AFTER the creation of the Jewish State - it is still seen as the greatest threat to Jews as a People:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.algemeiner.com/2016/09/23/assimilation-is-our-greatest-threat-but-we-can-help-stop-it/"><strong>Assimilation Is Our Greatest Threat, But We Can Help Stop It</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/31337/rabbinical-conference-told-assimilation-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-jewish-people.html"><strong>Rabbinical Conference Told, ‘Assimilation is the Greatest Threat to the Jewish People’</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/liberman-jewish-continuity-not-iran-our-greatest-concern/"><strong>Liberman: American Jews face ‘demographic catastrophe’</strong></a> - 
<em>FM tells US Jewish leaders of imperative to fight assimilation,</em> <strong><em>says he plans to encourage 3.5 million Jews to immigrate</em></strong></p>

<p>Seeing the lengths that the Zionist Leaders of the early 20th Century were willing to go to <em>&quot;SAVE JEWS&quot;</em> from the assimilation threat, one has to wonder: What are they planning to do to <em>&quot;SAVE&quot;</em> Jews who are in danger of assimilating TODAY???</p>

<p>Half of the world&#39;s Jewish population lives in the United States - and it is THESE Jews who are seen as being most &quot;at risk&quot;. Surely today&#39;s Zionists must have a PLAN in mind to &quot;SAVE&quot; them, no?</p>

<p>But like the Jews of Germany 100 years ago, the Jews in the US are VERY comfortable and FEEL SAFE here - why the HELL would they want to move to Palestine?</p>

<p>Keep an eye on unfolding events - I have a feeling that the Zionists might have some ideas - but I seriously doubt that the US or its Jews will enjoy what they have in mind.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Do you hate Israel?</p>

<p>Were it not for Hitler driving Jews OUT of Germany and Europe and INTO Palestine, <strong>the State of Israel would not exist</strong> as we know it - <strong><em>WHY?</em></strong> Because without Hitler and his &quot;sheep dogs&quot;, there would not have been enough Jews IN Palestine to form the population base the Zionists needed to establish their Jewish State.</p>

<p>So then, <em>Do you hate Israel?</em></p>

<p>And SPEAKING of Israel, is ethnic cleansing &quot;okay&quot; when the Jewish State does it?</p>
