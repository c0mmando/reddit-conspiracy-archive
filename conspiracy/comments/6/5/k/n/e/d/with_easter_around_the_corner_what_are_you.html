<p>Have you sat down and done any serious research on this? Like, not just atheist forums, but actually read any serious scholarship? To give you one example, the New Testament has consistently been confirmed by archaeology, sometimes after centuries of mockery from critics:</p>

<p>Yes...Ehrman, Metzger, multiple works on the synoptic problem, on the mythicist side Price, Carrier, Doherty....</p>

<p>I think Hector Avelos in his work title &#39;The End of Biblical Studies&#39;, is most consistent and rigorous. </p>

<p>As typical in this type of discourse we have a meaningless statement.   The literary setting is in real geographical locations situation in a historical period.   Presence of real places and characters does not confirm or disconfirm literary pieces.  Otherwise every work in the whole genre of historical fiction would be confirmed.  However, there is no evidence of Jesus, other than literary attestation.   Due to the nature of the work it is not good evidence to other confirm or disconfirm. Therefore judgment should be suspended. </p>

<p>Here is a good scholarly introduction to the New Testament for those interested:</p>

<p>This idea has really been discredited for some time among scholars, although it persists in popular culture (Dan Brown).</p>

<p>Even skpetical scholars rarely place more than 1-2 books outside the 1st century, and Christian scholars generally place them from about the late 40s to before 70, with the exception of Revelation which was later.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is a serious problem. Lots of infiltration of churches.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certainly the Jesuits. And probably most of the top leadership. But I also know a lot of Catholics who are good people.</p>

<p>It depends on how you mean this. It&#39;s obvious that there were earlier traditions with similar ideas (Plato&#39;s story of the Just Man who would suffer), but most, if not all had been corrupted by this time.</p>

<p>And none had the concept of a messiah that died to atone for human sin. That is very different from Persephone or Osiris (even though these may be based on earlier traditions that had the content correct).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The messiah part is where we diverge into 100% fairytale. So, that want what I meant. And that story wasn&#39;t even original. It was ripped off of Egypt&#39;s myth of Ra iirc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parallel implies they were developed independent of each other. I think the story was just adapted to make it consumable, much like Catholicism was adapted to incorporate a pantheon of saints to make it accessible to South American indigenous peoples. I am making some gross oversimplifications here, but I think you know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m saying you need to consider the possibility that they are both based on a common tradition. i.e. ancient people knew there would be a dying god, but eventually this knowledge became corrupted in certain cultures. Look at Zoroastrianism or early Sumerian writings and note how similar they are to Judaism.</p>

<p>Sure, the Catholic church adopted syncretism when they became the official religion of Rome. That doesn&#39;t make Christianity itself false, when you have the original documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge gap in the Jesus story, the entire timeline from age 5-early 30s is missing. So the Asia theory is very plausible.  </p>

<p>There are some similarities between Christianity and Zorastrianism, suggesting a connection to the Perisans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Faith is a personal journey.  The Bible hasn&#39;t changed over time.  The Dead Sea Scrolls support this.  I believe the Bible is the closest we have to the word of God.  </p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t believe in the Bible, I would say try taking a read through it.  It is a fascinating narrative and there is a great deal of wisdom to be gained.  Further, the prophecies and timelines are interesting.</p>

<p>Try not to confuse the Bible with organized religion.  I&#39;m not telling you to go to church.  I&#39;m just humbly suggesting that you might find the Bible to be an interesting read.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus definitely existed, and believers in the Christ myth theory are a laughingstock, even among atheists.</p>

<p>The &quot;Council of Nicea rewrote the Bible&quot; story is demonstrable bullshit. We have hard copies of the whole New Testament from before Nicea.</p>

<p>The New Testament is the most textually sound book from antiquity, and it&#39;s not close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is legit. How do I know? I followed the recipe, the teachings, and eventually got indwelled with the Holy Spirit, ego death, access to light/soul/pure consciousness and bliss.</p>

<p>You can connect to beings on the other side just like you can connect to people on the meatsuit/avatar side. </p>

<p>So you cultivate a loving heart, you ask Jesus to show you that he&#39;s real, get baptized eventually, and then you get blown away by the holy spirit enlightening</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee. I came here to write something like this, but you did such a good job I don&#39;t have to. </p>

<p>All I can say is to OP: If you don&#39;t believe, or aren&#39;t sure, pray about it. Ask for guidance. Open your heart. Try to find a good church and ask for guidance to find it--I realize it&#39;s not all that easy; I&#39;ve been part of some lousy and/or hypocritical churches. </p>

<p>Jesus changed my life. Jesus helped me put my self-defeating vices behind me. Jesus has made me see that this material world is not what we are told by society. </p>
