<p>With a shill or someone you think is a shill? There&#39;s a big difference. </p>

<p>Even now when you banned the threat to your pedo safe space you still allow blatant cunts to come on this sub with strawmans galore. Big suprise the site owners are helping the pedos just like what happened with Twittergate. The mods and admins are only there banning the people who point out the obvious bullshit shill speak that u/Rockran and even yourself use either because you&#39;re so prideful of your fake position our you&#39;re on their side entirely. I have a feeling it is the ladder you push over prick. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you just ban me because you can&#39;t defend your two-faced pussy speak and actually come up with an argument as to why you happen to be helping pedos evey step of the way.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. If a shill is exposed as a shill, then the opposite of what the shill said is probably true. That&#39;s why when someone calls me a shill I&#39;m like whatever I don&#39;t care, but when you call a genuine shill a shill he keeps trying to bully you into taking it back.</p>

<p>And your guess is wrong. I&#39;ve spoken to two redditors one who said was ex pentagon employee the other who said was ex intelligence. These accounts were both speaking to me in relation to my 911 post on Israel. I simply said &quot;are you still being paid by the Government?&quot;</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. You can think someone is wrong and they aren&#39;t a shill. A shill is someone who is a trained persuader who might be right on a number of points, however is misdirecting and sowing dissent.</p>

<p>Mods typically do flair up when they&#39;re being serious and/or enacting the rules. But Mod-Flaired or not, your Owl BC flair is noticeable enough to indicate you&#39;re a mod/special user, even for new users.  </p>

<p>And who says I called you a shill? Last I checked not all shills are feds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what my fans would say. </p>

<p>Rather than saying &quot;shill&quot;, they just use the abundance of other obvious &#39;hints&#39; and suggestions. </p>

<p>It does accomplish something. It makes a third party reading the conversation wonder whether the shill has used emotional words and other underhanded manipulation techniques to steer the argument away from certain topics and discredit valid points.</p>
