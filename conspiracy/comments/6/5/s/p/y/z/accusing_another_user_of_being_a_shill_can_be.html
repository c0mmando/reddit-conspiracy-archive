       When you see an obvious shill and their wasting everyone's time with their bullshit straight outta the Gentlemen's guide to forum spies and spooks, what is the correct etiquette for exposing them? I quote the Gentlemen's guide whichever passage they are using. Are there other ways around rule 10? And do you think this rule was put in place by shills? Do you think they will try to put in more rules like "antisemitism is not allowed" and "no russian propaganda" to further control us?

       No one here is making this claim. I'd say most long-time users suspect that at least some of this sub's userbase are made up of shill accounts, though I imagine there's a pretty broad range of how prevalent we each think there are.
      </p>

       But going around calling those who disagree with you shills doesn't do anything except distract from any conversation that might be had.

       What kind of a conversation do you think you can have with a shill? They just use crass manipulation techniques. They don't even want to be there, it comes across in every post they make. "Fuck I hate these guys, their NSA provided internet history shows how sad they are, this guy masterbates like 3 times a day and he wants us to take him seriously? Fuck it I'll just say he needs to take his meds, that'll work"

       With a shill or someone you think is a shill? There's a big difference.

       If someone tells you to take your meds, that's simple. Report them and we'll deal with that user. We don't have much tolerance for users who directly insult other users in that fashion.

       Bullshit you'll deal with trolls and shills. This sub has only gotten worse in the many years I've been lurking. Fuck, the whole pizzagate sub was banned because shills kept crying about imaginary Doxing that wasn't even happening but you listened to those crybabies instead of the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now when you banned the threat to your pedo safe space you still allow blatant cunts to come on this sub with strawmans galore. Big suprise the site owners are helping the pedos just like what happened with Twittergate. The mods and admins are only there banning the people who point out the obvious bullshit shill speak that u/Rockran and even yourself use either because you're so prideful of your fake position our you're on their side entirely. I have a feeling it is the ladder you push over prick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you just ban me because you can't defend your two-faced pussy speak and actually come up with an argument as to why you happen to be helping pedos evey step of the way.

      <p>
       You can always disprove someone. Well, unless they're right. If that's the case why would you want to?

       No it isn't. If a shill is exposed as a shill, then the opposite of what the shill said is probably true. That's why when someone calls me a shill I'm like whatever I don't care, but when you call a genuine shill a shill he keeps trying to bully you into taking it back.

       And your guess is wrong. I've spoken to two redditors one who said was ex pentagon employee the other who said was ex intelligence. These accounts were both speaking to me in relation to my 911 post on Israel. I simply said "are you still being paid by the Government?"

       No it isn't. You can think someone is wrong and they aren't a shill. A shill is someone who is a trained persuader who might be right on a number of points, however is misdirecting and sowing dissent.

       Yeah my big problem with people being called shills is it stops discussion and people use it to get out of arguing against points they don't agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I see a point where someone says "you're obviously a shill" but can't make a single counter-point to the so-called "shills" arguments, then I know that they're likely not a shill and the accuser just can't back up their claims.

       Once everyone has been called a shill (and it will happen sooner or later) no one will take the accusation seriously, kind of like what is happening with "anti-semite" or "racist".

       Just downvote and move on. Arguing with a shill is like arguing with a brick wall.

       It's a very bizarre rule to be in here. It's hurt feelings vs us finding out which users are pushing a toxic narrative. Call me a shill all you want, you'll never see me use the report button. I'm an adult and I've been called worse things in my life.

       I remember when this rule came about, the accusations were totally out of hand. And there was probably more friendly fire than not. This was a logical move by the mods. As frustrating as the rule is, calling someone a shill doesn't really accomplish anything anyway.

       It does accomplish something. It makes a third party reading the conversation wonder whether the shill has used emotional words and other underhanded manipulation techniques to steer the argument away from certain topics and discredit valid points.
