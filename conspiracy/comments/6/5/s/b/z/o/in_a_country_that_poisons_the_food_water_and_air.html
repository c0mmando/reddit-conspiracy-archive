       If we want to look at where their money is, look at their funding of anti-climate change policies and studies. We don't need to believe the government. I'm happy to discuss why climate change is verifiable if you'd like. The reasons greenhouses work is the same reason climate change is legitimate. I don't trust the government, but I do trust physics.

       In a country where the government is more concerned with regulating the citizens than the corporations, it is to ne expected that those corporations will pursue profit. Sustainability can be less than profitable. Do to weak laws and lax regulatio, the companies that poison the food, water, and air have tremendous say in public policy.  The companies that profit from the status quo can only be expected to want to maintain it.
So to me, the question seems to be, when corporations profit from poisoning the food, water, and air, why should I believe them when they tell me that climate change is a myth?

       Another question, if I may, regardless of whether or not our damaging, wasteful, irresponsible, and toxin-generating use of natural resources is actually contributing to climate change, shouldn't we do what we can, with the knowledge and technology that we have, to live as sustainably as possible? If only so that some day our great great etc. Grandchildren can drink clean water from a stream like our great great grandparents could?

       America is not the epicentre of climate research.  Many other scientific bodies in other countries: Canada, Iceland, Sweden, have come to these conclusions about climate change.  Countries that are less corporatist than America actually do a decent job funding public science.  America is actually the epicentre of climate denialism, if you look into it, the position of climate denial is an elaborate brainwashing campaign pushed by the Koch brothers and other American industrialists that are against regulations.

       The simple fact is that CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has doubled in about 100 years.  It is very easy to measure.  We know the vast majority of this change has been from the massive amount of carbon we burn.  There haven't been enough natural events like volcanoes to contribute significantly to CO2 rise, it's almost entirely us.

       Price and jobs. For years, coal was cheapest. It's basically why anybody ever built a town in West Virginia. Protecting those coal jobs is politically important. We saw that in this past presidential election. WV still has two senators as well, despite having fewer than 2 million people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now natural gas is cheaper than coal. That's why it's impossible to bring back coal jobs. People can buy natural gas energy cheaper.

       Neoliberal changes mean fuck all. Those "feel good" shit do nothing when the whole day-to-day economy is based around consumption and fueled with non-renewable sources. Climate change is very easy to understand and explain. All the arguments against climate change have been disproved through a variety of different mechanisms. They all support the same theory, that the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere causes the earth to warm.

       What does "neoliberal" have to do with anything? It's not Democrats blocking the actual legislation that works. Trump is ending Obama's EnergyStar program. How much backlash did he get over led bulbs? Carbon tax credits?
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be federal subsidies to switch to high efficiency windows and boilers. Trump is even trying to get rid of fuel efficiency standards. These are legitimate programs that work.

       Not American, don't care about Rebulicrats (both are neoliberal anyway). I'm talking about the ideological underpinnings of modernity and industrial/post-industrial societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, and this is all I'll say on the topic, whilst Obama was far better on climate change, he was ultimately interested in re-invigorating and maintaining the economy, and the same way of life that got us into this mess. Not only that, his maintenance of the status-quo was a big part of Trump's popularity i.e. drain the swamp.

       Cows fart a lot more... Cows are not an animal you find in nature. They were artificially selected to be delicious. We have a whole economy based on it. Did you know you can be sued for calling your beef "Kobe" if it isn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cows eat grass, then digest it twice. They have insane farts. Methane is also a lot worse greenhouse gas than CO2, like 20 times worse. Many farms capture the methane and "flare" (burn) it to be more environmentally friendly.

       Cows fart a lot more? LMAO. NO they don't. They don't fart more than any other wild ruminant species of which there are a lot more than domestic cattle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ridiculous. A cow operates like any other ruminant. Selective breeding to increase muscle mass or dairy production has not changed anything about the way a ruminant's system works. Kobe beef is like any other beef cattle. They are just raised according to a strict regimen that helps produce less stress and better flavour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Herbivores eat grass. This includes deer, moose, elk, bison and a host of other wild ruminants. Again, ruminant systems are all the same. Man never changed the way it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but it blows my mind to see this stuff talked about by people who have never been around any of these animals and just believe whatever they read on the internet. My mind is blown.

       You may not be able to master the science, may not have access to the data,    or the causative factor for CO2 might not be as claimed,  or perhaps there is a motive by the global oriented to shift the focus from the poluters to those whom they wish to pass the costs off onto,  in other words,  half of what is not to be trusted is the motives of those who have already shown themselves to not be focusing on the real immediate issues of poisoning the food, water and air,  and prefer to find a way to raise money they intend to waste on corruption and prefer to dither with debates about scientific details while its already obvious that the corporations who pollute need to be thrown to the wolves.    But that won't happen, instead they will give them carbon credits.   Its a BS scheme for bureaucrats and state power.    They can make billions on red tape and kick the problem down the road to the genetic mutants who will be living in a hellish dystopia if things keep up.

       I don't understand why there is even a debate necessary for us to stop polluting the environment. Do we really need to
       <strong>
        prove
       </strong>
       anthropogenic climate change in order to cut down fossil fuel consumption? Shouldn't we just do it because it's obviously the smart thing to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the chemistry/physics is sound, even if there is a chance that data has been manipulated. More greenhouse gases make the atmosphere warmer and lower the pH of the oceans. We know that the Earth is getting warmer at a rate much higher than any time in recent history. We know that we are putting huge levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We know the the acidity of the oceans is increasing, and the coral reefs are getting bleached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially now that the GOP, who have always denied climate change, control every branch of the government, you'd think that it if it were possible to scientifically disprove climate change, it would be done immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there is a remote possibility that heavy industry is contributing to climate change, IMO that is more than enough reason to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but it's clear as day how much pushback there is from people that make money from the fossil fuel industry. I mean,
       <strong>
        that's the conspiracy guys
       </strong>
       . Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil, and the lot have been pushing against any scientific study that might confirm climate change for decades. We now know that Exxon Mobil and Shell both knew about climate change as early as the 70s, and started a huge lobbying effort to dispel knowledge about it and prevent funding for studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously everyone, there has been a massive conspiracy behind climate change, but the conspiracy is people in the know who make money off of fossil fuels trying to block studies and convince everyone that climate change is BS. That's the conspiracy. I feel like people are getting ahead of themselves, and anything that seems too believable is immediately suspected to be a conspiracy. I believe in questioning everything, but the conspiracy in this one is plain to see.

       There is a natural human bias that makes it seem that we are the cause for everything around us. It is a natural conceit, but seriously... it is a HUGE stretch to say that we humans are the major cause of climate change...
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have a hunch... so let's act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck the third world, right? Let's stop all the coal burning. We can afford Hyrdo, Nuclear and Wind. Sure... it's 2 or 3 times more expensive than coal, but we can bear it, in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy costs mean the difference between life and death for some people on this planet... but hey... they probably don't have your color skin or speak your language, so you don't need to think about them when you are placing trust in quasi-scientific political apparatchiks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been studying complex computer models for 30 years. To me, it's easy to dismiss people who think that useful predictive modeling can be done on the scale of the climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, I'd say you are a bunch of morons and move on... but you're not morons. A lot of you are smart, but you have no fucking clue how the exponential complexity of interactions fucks any complex predictive model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the ONLY fallback in such a case is historical trend matching, that means that the MOST you can predict is 5 to 10 years out, and that's being VERY generous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shitheads with PHD's spend ten years studying complex modeling techniques, and their investment in this field is so high, that they cannot conceive of the idea that it is practically worthless for large systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extra CPU speed doesn't do SHIT in the face of exponentially scaling complexity, and ALL natural systems are like that... but if you just spent $180k learning how they work, it will cost you exactly $180k and your pride to accept the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the fossil fuel we've ever burnt amounts to almost nothing compared to the mass of the atmosphere it is affecting, or the earth it covers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like Fukishima... people bad at math think that it is dangerous. You could dump all the reactor cores from all the nuclear plants in Japan, directly into the center of the Pacific, and you'd never notice the difference.

      <p>
       The amount of radioactivity released by natural thorium DWARFS the manmade release by orders of magnitude... but since it was caused by mankind, it must have magic powers... right? Wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad science is bad science. Global warming... I didn't think anyone would take it seriously... but, if you can convince a world that marijuana belongs on Schedule 1, or that Ron Paul is a racist, or that Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump are fit presidents... it just speaks to how fucking frail our judgment is... as a species.

       Talk about a stretch... Saying that I support renewable energy because I'm racist against people with a different skin color than me? WTF?

       Saying we shouldn't ever stop burning coal because poor countries can't afford to do anything else? As if I would really recommend against helping the rest of the world convert to renewables....

       Referring to your experience "studying complex computer models" as something that makes you a climate expert, while at the same time referring to people with PHD's as "shitheads" doesn't do a lot of your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are scientists in the world spending hundreds of thousands on trying to disprove climate change, and have been so far unsuccessful. But it's okay, some angry guy on reddit said he's an expert on computer models, no reason to listen to the scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it is too coincidental, how increased CO2, rising temperatures, and ocean acidification happen to be at record highs, and it started right around the time we started burning fossil fuels on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think marijuana should be on any schedule. Ron Paul is probably racist but that story was overblown (he certainly is a bit of a nutcase though), Hillary and Trump are both scumbags, and you sound a bit unhinged.
      </p>

       What did they miss... clouds. The current models don't factor in clouds. Also, current models don't take solar cycles into account... which is good, because we don't understand solar cycles.
Oceanic currents are not modeled... they are copied and extrapolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only air convection and thermal reflection are taken into account. There isn't even any modeling of the day/night cycle.

       My frustration isn't with you. It's with an entire community that calls something a "physical model" when it barely qualifies as a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A model is impossible, but I doubt most climate scientists even understand the distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first problem with physical models is in determining the time resolution. You should resolve the model by the nanosecond, if possible... but modeling years at the nanosecond level would take more computers than the earth contains... so even with the limited "model" we use, it is roughly estimated because math.

       We know that the country pollutes the food, water, and air. Climate change is caused by air pollution by CO2.

       So, climate change is just the same old thing that you know has been happening for a long time. That is why you should believe that it is real.

       I am finishing a degree in atmospheric science in less than three weeks. The science behind climate change is basic thermodynamics that has existed long before current fossil fuel companies and governments. There were papers from the 1800s discussing climate change due to greenhouse gases. The science is sound. The current government is the one trying to get you to doubt it. If you truly are a "skeptic", the thing to be skeptical about is not basic science, but the people telling you that the basic science is wrong.

       You should not believe it's fake because we do those things. These things show our culture's concerns for own health and future are nothing in the face of profits. Because money matters more than life. Since we don't care about our health and future, it's not leap in logic to imagine we would end up in a situation where we are facing a serious threat to our well being. We're facing climate change, and business interests are running a campaign to delegitimize the scientific findings which show climate change is under way. Because money matters more to them than life.

       The data manipulation article is labeled as fake news because it's an article meant to make it seem like data was manipulated in a deceitful way. This is not the case. There was no deceit. I encourage you to research this claim with science blogs. Go to the scientists, not people with political agendas.

       If you look at climate on a geologic timescale, you see we are way colder than the mode, the median or the mean. The mean is 4 or 5 degrees hotter than today, and even hotter than the medieval warm period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Math says the Earth should be warming on average.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to blame unexplained phenomena on God... now we blame it on ourselves or a convenient enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have any way to craft a model of the atmosphere with all the computers in the world. It takes a supercomputer to just calculate where pool balls end up on a pool table after a break, and they are completely unable to figure out how a bee can fly. We can't predict the weather more than 5 days out, and that hasn't changed much in 50 years, because we don't use physical models for the task. YOU CAN'T USE PHYSICAL MODELS TO MODEL THE WEATHER.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use pattern analysis to find similar situations in the past, and then you guess the next 5 days will be the same as the 5 days after the most similar period you can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meteorology doesn't use physical models because they are useless on the scale of weather, and exponentially worse on climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The feedback loops on the climate give no indication of having a runaway state. They are normalizing feedback loops, as evidenced by the fact that we go in and out of ice ages periodically, and we have survived and renormalized after massive volcanic periods as well as large meteor strikes.
