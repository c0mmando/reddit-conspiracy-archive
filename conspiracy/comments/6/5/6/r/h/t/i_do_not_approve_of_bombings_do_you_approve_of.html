<p>Holy fucking oversimplification. We are having to navigate through the waters created by former administrations. It&#39;s not as easy as &quot;oh Trump is here, let&#39;s pull everything out of the middle east and build a wall and tell everyone else to shut the fuck up&quot;. He never said that, and only a fucking idiot would&#39;ve voted for him expecting that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hate you, but We have to move on now.  You said you don&#39;t want to reinforce us vs them, let&#39;s not then. I&#39;ll acknowledge that I&#39;m being stupid about what subs people post in, but I cannot condone it anymore. I&#39;ve made my point about why. You&#39;re free to disagree, and maybe you do have valid reason or beliefs why it&#39;s okay to hang out with a cult. I can&#39;t get past my bias today, but if anyone wants to stand against wars and bombs together I&#39;ll always do my best to look past the surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every bomb dropped means someone&#39;s daddy won&#39;t be coming home. Not that night, and not ever again.  It means a destroyed hospital, school, or home. It means pushing those people down so far and putting them in such a hole that they&#39;ll never recover. </p>

<p>Those people don&#39;t hate us &quot;for our freedom.&quot; They hate us because we&#39;ve killed millions of their parents and children and destroyed their institutions. We&#39;ve crushed their hopes and spirits and replaced it with a pain that will plague them until the day they die. </p>

<p>And for what? </p>

<p>We have no fucking business being over there in the first place. </p>
