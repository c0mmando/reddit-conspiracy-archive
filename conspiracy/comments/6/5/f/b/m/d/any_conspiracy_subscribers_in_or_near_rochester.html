        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dennis Hastert is in Rochester Federal Medical Facility and NOT one journalist has gone for an interview...Inquiring minds want to know: how did he get $15 million on a $140K per year salary while serving as a Representative in the US Congress?</p>

<p>To be clear: I don&#39;t work for any publication--just thought We the People should be trying to follow-up on this Dirty Politician who has been allowed to get away (virtually) scott-free.  In fact, I&#39;m not even sure if anyone other than friends/family are allowed to contact him.  </p>

<p>Hastert is due to get out in August (?) -- original sentence was 15 months...his exact release date is unclear.  The only report on him since he went in (other than civil legal proceedings) was that he &quot;acted up&quot; and may have added to his time after first being admitted.</p>
