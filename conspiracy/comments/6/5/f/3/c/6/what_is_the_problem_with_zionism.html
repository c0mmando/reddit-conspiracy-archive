       I believe every ethnicity/peoples have a right to a land to call their own, it seems only natural, given humans tribal nature, in that context, is there anything wrong with the concept of Zionism? What makes it different than the French wanting a France, or Germans wanting a Germany, or Chinese wanting a China?

       BTW just warning you, there's a few brigaders here at the moment who actually hate Jewish people. But for me, the problem is with the oppressive and imperialistic actions of the Isreali state(Mossad, etc.).

       <p>
        The Jews domination in the state seems so assured that now not only can he call himself a Jew again, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate national and political designs. A section of his race openly owns itself to be a foreign people, yet even here they lie. For while the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the national consciousness of the Jew finds its satisfaction in the creation of a Palestinian state, the Jews again slyly dupe the dumb Goyim. It doesnâ€™t even enter their heads to build up a Jewish state in Palestine for the purpose of living there; all they want is a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with its own sovereign rights and removed from the intervention of other states: a haven for convicted scoundrels and a university for budding crooks.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security that at a time when one section is still playing the German, Frenchman, or Englishman, the other with open effrontery comes out as the Jewish race.

       Bullshit - the exactly opposite is true. Your communism is the social construct. Race, Ethnicity, Nation, Tribes - those are real, flesh and blood.

       "Class" is a capitalist construct.

       I thought your point was that the elites have an agenda of pushing diversity and miscegeny?
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that diversity is a mainstream concept, just like understanding that sugar is bad for you is a mainstream concept. So what?
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record I don't think elites GAF about diversity. They do care about turning people against each other so we can be easily controlled and the SJW agenda is that. I'm actually in favor of most of the things SJWs say they are in favor of: peace, love and understanding. diversity. racial justice. people being free to choose their own identities etc etc etc. But the SJWs push a load of bullshit just to trigger those of us who can be trigger by their bullshit. That's not diversity. It's low level warfare.

       "They care about turning people against each other so we can be easily controlled" and they do this by simultaneously provoking animus on the basis of race, e.g. the Soros-funded race riots, and indoctrinating us with absolute racial egalitarianism.

       It's an observable phenomenon that racial diversity really leads to anomy and the balkanization of society and they use that to our detriment. Kind of an Orwellian doublethink tactic.

       I'll bite. What evidence do you have of this? I'm genuinely openminded but I'm a pretty deep study of society and I have not seen this to be the case. Is this just your offhand perception based on a few instances, or is this a well thought out and argued line of reasoning?

       Rest assured you could probably go and find "scientific authorities" that assert precisely the opposite.. like that Scientific American thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say that as a result of real life experience and studies like those of Harvard professor
       <a href="http://archive.realtor.org/sites/default/files/BowlingAlone.pdf">
        Robert Putnam

       who made replicable observations that increases in diversity led to the decline of willingness to participate and donate into the the commons, and generally led to increased distrust and unhappiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically incorrect yes, but to me it doesn't sound outrageous based on the way things have transpired in America, the experimental "melting pot."

       I don't care what the establishment publishes. I reject all authority. But I do still take a scientific approach to knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       In biology diversity makes a group resilient. The most advanced placed on Earth went through periods of great diversity, followed by eventual homogenization and then usually more diversity - The US being a great example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you look at places that lack diversity they are usually inbred backwards cultures geographically and socially isolated from the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       But diversity itself is the norm. You should try getting your DNA sequenced and seeing how much diversity you already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will read Robert Putnam and see what he found. Perhaps there is something to what you say.

       In biology, genetic diversity is good insofar that no, you don't want to inbreed. Beyond that the concept hybrid vigor is sort of a myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really a complicated subject that it's easy to sound stupid talking about, because as you say we are all genetically "impure" to some degree and it's hard to even define what that means.

No Way. It's a very basic concept that is demonstrated easily with math.

       Imagine you have a group of organisms. 10% of them will die if exposed to pure oxygen. Add pure oxygen. 90% survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine 100% will die if exposed to pure oxygen. Add oxygen. Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what diversity does. If everyone is the same then the group is fragile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, as to the first article you sent, he makes some really good points about the erosion of social institutions in our society but he completely fails to actually show any cause. It is possible to make a hypothesis and test it. It's not useful to just say "I think this is why".
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I think we have seen social erosion because the military industrial complex wants to erode our institutions in order to make us servile. That's my hypothesis. But without trying to disprove it it means nothing.

       Oh man. I just read the link now. He's really doing some very dishonest things here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, he quotes some statistics (people in diverse neighborhoods trust their neighbors less) but then acts that the conclusion (diversity hurts social cohesion) is obvious from that. What he should do is make a hypothesis and then test it. Maybe diverse neighborhoods have higher crime and and cheaper places to live. Immigrants move there because they can afford it and yet they don't trust their neighbors as much because of the crime. Not the diversity. And maybe a 1000 other explanations. The key is to not stop at the first possible explanation you think of, but to put in the work to actually find truth in the statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second thing is does is claim that people marrying and living near people like themselves means people like people like themselves more. Alternative explanations could be that people select mates from the available pool of people near them and they live near the people they are used to.

       Diversity just means different kinds of people. That's not how they turn us against each other. They turn us against each other by:
- Siloing knowledge
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Telling us lies about each other
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Encouraging the worst elements of each group to be assholes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Encouraging sub intellectual thought and memes
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Diversity isn't the problem. Idiots who think diversity means saying things like 'cis-gendered men are unwelcome here' are the problem.

       Diversity is the problem. The more diversity, the more conflicting interests. The more conflicting interests, the more fighting, the more violence, the more conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two neighbors living next door to each other don't fight. Two strangers living in the same room fight all the time.

       I think diversity is a problem for you. Personally I prefer it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm white and I don't really like anyone. But I do usually prefer black and latino people to other white people. For me that means i can tolerate like 1% of white people and maybe 2% of non white people. I'm still an asocial asshole who hates the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as much as you restate your case that diversity is the reason people fight, it's just you saying it. If you are right then prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothesis: Diversity increases conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Test to disprove hypothesis: Find a place where diversity increased but conflict did not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Result: Diversity doesn't always correlate with conflict, so there must be something else that causes conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have access to any GIS systems for getting the data needed to test this, but if you want to make a claim like you are it is on you to find the proof.

       Nothing about France being French or Germany being German or China being Chinese requires a police state, those all exist and 2/3 of those are very little in the way of Police State. Maybe Germany isn't the best example as it has been turning into more far left police state. Groups form naturally, look at communities, they are usually self segregated into races, ethnicity, cultures, religions, etc. There's nothing wrong with living with people that resemble you, countries are just that on large scale. Everyone needs a tribe, its human nature. That doesn't mean your tribe needs to dominant or destroy others tribes, or you need to hate other tribes. Many tribes can come together and celebrate their differences and embrace their similarities, while having mutual respect. We see this all the time, countries themselves are perfect examples of this, as each region differs slightly from one another. Countries forming alliances, trade partnerships, etc. Tribal nature of humanity is what has gotten us so far, the ability to work in groups for the benefit of the group/individual. I think its only nature to want a home land, that doesn't mean you need to go and be imperialist about it. So my question is asking, is there any problem with wanting a home land for your people? How you go about that is what the issue should be, and I think from a lot of these comments, is the main issue with Zionism.

       It saddens me that your common humanity has been brainwashed out of you and you've instead been filled with a plethora of false consciousnesses about identity. I hope that you can someday come to understand who the real enemy is: not the men and women of various colors and creeds whom you work with every day, but the bosses, landlords, and bankers who enslave us all.

       I think you're trolling if you think my common humanity is washed out of me, especially how in my response I specifically said tribes can celebrate one another and respect one another. Why the fact you make that a bad things or something that has to have negative competition, I don't know. There's nothing negative about having a tribe, you do not need to think your tribe is superior and needs to dominate or hate other tribes.

       What makes it different is that the French already have a France and do not need to steal a France. I mean everyone wants a nice car, right? What is so wrong with someone stealing a car? Why is his wish to have a car different from someone who already has one.

       A bit. When Columbus found Native Americans he wrote that they would make great slaves (I'm paraphrasing). He wanted to colonize and exploit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when other Europeans decided it was their destiny to have those lands -- that is exactly the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really kind of unfair to Zionists. They did the same thing that other people have done when they conquered a land and made it theirs. They moved in, pillaged and murdered the inhabitants and drove them out into reservations where they became an underclass to be exploited. So did every ethnic group that has ever taken over someone else's home.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is that the Zionists did this in the middle of the 20th Century when people were beginning to realize and accept that this is a fucking horrible thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists can't use the old arguments of "We are stronger therefore this is ours." so they need to make up new arguments and somehow claim that they aren't just colonists committing ethnic cleansing. But they are. No better and no worse than my own ancestors who did they same thing to countless people (I'm mostly descended from Brits and Vikings so...)
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that makes Israel a special case is that the ethnic cleansing is not complete. There is still a chance to save the Palestinians as a people and so many of us try to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel isn't Any More Evil than any other Nationalist Ethnic Cleansers. But is it Just As Evil.

       Have you read the Talmud?  Non-Jews are to be slaves for the Jews.  I am not saying that all Jews believe or want this, but it is what the Talmud says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with the Quran.  Non-Muslims are treated differently than Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the problem is that Judaism and Islam are not Secular religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Zionism, the problem is that there are already people living on that land.  Instead of peacefully integrating with them, they are basically committing genocide.  This is very ironic considering Jewish history.

       They are not entitled to own land just because an old book says they used to live there. The Germans etc actually live in their own countries, zionists expelled the previous inhabitants illegally and moved on in. There is no comparison.

       I just want to add in the Zionist Bible it says something along the lines of. 
A regular persons blood in shouldn't be given to a dying Zionist because regular blood is an abomination.

       I'm paraphrasing and would love a follow up or if any one is familiar with what I'm talking about

       Substitute "Frankfurt School" or omit it completely, you're still demonstrably entirely wrong.

         It's an observable phenomenon that racial diversity really leads to anomy and the balkanization of society and they use that to our detriment. Kind of an Orwellian doublethink tactic.

       I'll bite. What evidence do you have of this? I'm genuinely openminded but I'm a pretty deep study of society and I have not seen this to be the case. Is this just your offhand perception based on a few instances, or is this a well thought out and argued line of reasoning?
