       Yes sir, you are the real deal. Before we move for good to the other sub we should organize a shill list and just lay this place to waste.  I think the mods over at the new place will make sure certain accounts cannot post.

       Perhaps, we should build an easily trolled list as well. Gotta classify the gullible. Some people will believe literally anything that is posted without thinking.

       I think many, many of us would agree. Those truths have been forgotten by the masses, but once you see that the system is structurally built in order to mask those truths and maximize profit for the elites, you begin to see the truth. And while it ain't pretty, and it probably gets way uglier even, it's a happier feeling imo to know that based on all your research, completely separate topics often point to a singularity in spirit.

Fairly new to reddit and I'm a lurker, don't really like attempting to voice an opinion or thoughts here mainly due to shills etc etc and me honestly just starting to open my mind and actually learn some facts, trying to weed oud what i can determine as bs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'd love to be in a place where i feel i can actually converse/debate things properly, so I'd love an invite to any of these other places / invite only subs etc. I just don't know who to contact about this.

       Bring this attitude in your comments and you will easily spot the funky accounts. They will fixate on grammatical errors rather than refute the point itself, conduct ad hominem attacks, or use multiple accounts. If you are open-minded and patient, the liars reveal themselves

       100%. Over the past few months its easier and easier to spot the obvious bs and coercing/pushing agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats basically what's kept me lurking though, since finding this sub (and then others from posts in here) its been like a reset button on my life, everything i was taught etc I'm finding there is an ulterior motive as to why i was taught that bit of history the way someone decided it would be taught. I have so many questions, and to be honest just complete befuddlement at some things but I don't feel comfortable joining in with the torrent of bs you see wash through here every day :/
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm a bit more "educated" in ways to find things out, understand what happens etc I'm definitely going to get a bit more vocal and pose questions / thoughts. :)

       Browser add-on, basically, that makes browsing Reddit so much more enjoyable. I like the tag function that enables you to label users (so for example, I have a few titled "Monsanto Shill"). Don't know if the site has incorporated this feature yet, but RES is well worth it.

       You are describing a typical redditor commenter. They aren't shills but they are a waste of your time to debate. That's why I keep all of my Reddit communication one-way. I have my say, move onto the post. I debate my friends, families, associates, and people that actually matter.

       Notice the use of the racial slur "redneck." Calling a white person a "redneck" is the same thing as calling a black person "the n word."

       No I'm not joking. You don't think it matters that a word that was used to denigrate black people for hundreds of years while they were beaten, exploited and killed? It was heavily backed by institutional racism Don't worry, the upvotes from replying to your nonsense are really helping offset my bad karma. How many years have rednecks been exploited, abused and killed again?

       Don't try and make white people out to be victims like black people. You're being a fucking ignorant redneck. Seriously join the KKK.

      <p>
       The fact that people use the word "redneck" and other slurs freely, while that other word is never spelled out but is identified only by its first letter, makes the opposite point you hoped to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently using racial slurs for people perceived to be "white" is fine, while "The N Word" cannot be spoken, or even spelled out, like how Jews can't say or spell "God" - it has to be spelled "G-d" lest the universe becomes angry or something.

       LOL this again? Buddy, you're not going to convince anyone that redneck is as bad as nigger. You don't believe that they were slaves, you don't believe they suffered systemic racism and for some reason you think whites have it as bad as blacks. This is coming completely from your insecurities as a white man and seeing your opportunities and privileges fade. The days where a white man is always chosen over a person of colour is fading. Just learn to adapt lol

       You're right, a house isn't a good example, as there are legal concepts surrounding it. But you understand the principal of the matter, don't you? Would you be okay with someone standing over your shoulder while surfing the internet, watching everything you do, even if it's nothing incriminating? If you support the concept of "nothing to hide", are you okay with the massive data collection on people being done by the NSA?

       Lol how is someone looking through your comments equivalent to "someone standing over your shoulder while surfing the internet, watching everything you do"
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you post all your fetishes and favorite jerk off vids on this account? Again, did you post private financial information? If it's all just innocuous opinions that your have no problem with your friends reading, whyd you delete it? I would have no problem with anyone I know reading my reddit posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol Wait now your friends are equivalent to the federal government? Your friends work for the NSA? You realize that if the NSA is doing data collection on you, it wouldn't matter even if you deleted your comments? So literally all you're doing, according to you, is hiding shit from your "irl friends" that you don't even need to hide.

       My explanation makes more sense, so I'll go with that. =)

       Way to avoid actually answering any of my questions. Clearly you don't want to admit that there's nothing wrong with me enjoying my own personal privacy, regardless of whether or not I'm "hiding" anything, so you simply try to deviate away from any of my actual points by arguing on technicalities surrounding them, rather than the actual point I'm making, which is pretty clear to anyone with half a brain, yourself included.

      </p>
      <p>
       Of course theres nothing wrong with enjoying privacy, however, in the context of this situation, your desire for "privacy" makes no sense. People want privacy in their homes so strangers can't watch them shit and fuck. So people can't watch them sleep. People want privacy for all their online browsing because they don't want strangers having access to their financial information or reading emails about their mistress or their erectile dysfunction.
      </p>

       This is a website where you put up opinions or post links that are publicly viewable. The only reason for you to delete you comments here is if you are afraid of people reading your comments. So, either you are afraid of your friends seeing your opinions, or you scrubbed a newly acquired account of opinions that might have conflicted with the narrative you're preparing to push with this account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally the only other person I've ever heard pull the "I delete my comments every once in a while" crap is another relatively young account, here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , who was blatantly pushing narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also find it funny that you say it's your way of maintaining privacy without having to make a new account "all the time" as if the 15 seconds it takes to make a new account was more burdensome than going through and deleting all your comments. Makes perfect sense!
      </p>
      <p>
       One more thing. For a guy who is so detached from what he posts that he deletes his comments regularly, you sure seem to care a lot about your comments. I first saw this reply when I was about to walk out the door and couldn't respond, so I left the tab open. It said "3 hours ago" with no edit asterisk when I opened it back up. By the time I started writing this, there was an asterisk. So, you came back
       <em>
        3 hours later
       </em>
       to this post to edit in a single comma. Haha, yes, that was the edit you made. You put a comma after 'point I'm making'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol, man, you seem reaaallly concerned about your comments. Way more than the average reddit user. And the average reddit user doesn't claim to delete everything !!1! , either.

       The type of person who thinks Jews should be forcibly removed from the US isn't going to be convinced by any argument from a random person in the internet, regardless of the logic behind the argument. I'm not going to waste my time formulating a proper argument in that scenario.

       I mean, I've been pretty consistent with everything I've said, which is that I'm too lazy to write up an essay on why the Jews aren't an evil race of people trying to conquer the world, so I just resort to calling someone with that mindset a cunt. That's pretty much the complete opposite of cognitive dissonance, or do you not know the actual definition of that word and simply use to describe any sort of faulty logic?

       I'm not saying you're wrong about blaming the jews for everything, I 100% agree with you. The elite power structure is more than just the jews. I just think attacking someone, rather than their arguments is wrong. It creates division amongst us, which is exactly what TPTB want.

       It's the zionists that are the root of all that is evil, not Jews in general. However, the holocaust does seem to have been grossly exaggerated, there is a huge amount of evidence regarding Israeli/Mossad involvement in 9/11 and the banking cabals that pretty much rule the world are for the most part owned by zionist Jews (rothschild etc). It's not being anti-semetic to ask questions of bad people - the fact that some bad people are Jewish is just the way it is. Fucks me off that the anti-semitism thing has become such an effective shield....

       It's not the fucking "zionists". I'm in favour of strong counter-semitism, and I'd say I'm also a zionist - I don't want the gas chambers, I want the spectre of semitism confined to the country we created for them at enormous expense to ourselves.

       85% in 1960. If you feel 90% is too absurd, that's fine, I'll take 85% as a compromise if you promise the 5% will be pure Chinamen and/or Japanese, no latinx or semites.

       When you bring "superiority" into it, the jews often treat it as though it were some inherent, abstract concept that can be refuted morally. When we speak of "racial superiority", we're talking about clear, objective measures such as time preference, agency, social trust, etc. I don't care if you have a moral aversion to the notion of superior and inferior peoples. The only morality is civilisation.

       Speaking for myself, I would prefer to first establish a lawful pretext for peaceful ethnic cleansing, since any high-trust European society should value the rule of law and the submission to lawful authority. This is how our societies have always worked, best, when everyone knows their place, obeys their superiors and can expect obedience from their subordinates. If we throw that out to play race war, we're bound to end up as savage as the peoples we seek to cleanse.

       Recently I found this and have been watching through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm keeping very open minded and to be honest this series does get a bit anti semitic and pushes the "facts" very hard. (I'm not in a position to say fact or not). Gotta remember theres always 2 sides to a story, and with alot of history you get told one / the victors side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only part way through and feel like its ripping everything in two in my life that I "understood", will watch it all this weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope it is of some use. Even just from understanding how some people see things differently, or how bad religion in general is, or whatever you want to take away from it.

       It's going to be nigh impossible to get a feel for "what the beliefs are," as they are extremely varied. There's no general consensus here, just lots of discussion and sharing of information. It's important to use your own critical thinking skills and decide for yourself what you believe. Proof is important and of course always consider the source.

       And Assad didn't even need to be in London the chemical attacks, maybe it was planned out by Putin to throw Assad under the bus and distract from the FBI investigation? Whatever it was, it merits discussion on a conspiracy sub.

       Honestly, I'm not particularly opposed to being friendlier with Russia. We get along with many nations. Why not them too?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of what happened between us was mostly based on posturing and misunderstanding. I read War and Peace in the Nuclear age way back when I was in school. It explained a few things that made most of what happened after WWII make sense. We cut Russia out of most of the partnership we had with our other allies. It's no wonder that they joined us in the arms race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, Stalin cutting a deal with Hitler was more than a bit shady but Stalin ruled from an old school perspective. He wasn't concerned about what Hitler did as long as Hitler didn't attack his country.

       When Steven Greer first came out with his incredible National Press Club briefing where all those military and professional people stood up and said I've seen extra terrestrial vehicles I really thought he was going to do something. Now it's what 16 years later and nada zilch nothing. All he does now is take people's money for appearances, seminars, and other more personalized retreats and activities. He's probably making 10 times what he was making as a doctor without all of the stress. He's commercialized everything and turned it into a weird cult like organization. He's the L Ron Hubbard of the UFO community.

       As soon as rex tillerson left russia putin arrested a ton of "political opponents".
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin does this all the time, and every time I have to engage in an argument with someone who is either a shill, or who loves Trump and therefore Putin by extension, I just point to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're arresting political opponents. Not terrorists. Not criminals. People who oppose Putin politically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, for fuck's sake. If you knew nothing else about Putin, that would be fucked up enough. Nevermind that the really obstinate opponents have a high rate of "accidental death".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is fucked up. The fact we're normalizing it, that we have a President that just shrugs and tolerates it, as if that's simply OK in a world power with millions of people, is absurd.

       No - these people are not even being accused of specific crimes. They are arrested
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they are politically opposed to Putin. That's their crime. And there's no

       It's as if Trump suddenly had all the Democrats arrested in Congress - or Obama had had all the Republicans arrested - and then locked away, with no mention of their actual crimes and no real trial.

       The issue is you need to point out the right conspiracy. There was a clear mutual goal between Putin and Trump of destroying establishment politics, yes. However there really isn't a clear connection between Putin and Trump right now and the more time goes on, the more obvious it seems that most of Wikileaks was whistleblowers and not Russian hackers. So not an obvious angle there. But Jared Kushner and Chabad Lubavitch? Big ties, yes! Steve Mnuchin and Skull and Bones? You bet! The Supreme Court judge he picked was a Jesuit, Paul Manafort has Ukrainian ties, but which one is it that has him compromised then?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where I stop reading further for most conspiracies about him. There are lots of little bits of powerful deep state elements in his cabinet, but before pointing fingers the issue is making a clear narrative that follows any individual path. Trump, Bannon, Steve Piecnezik (at least earlier in the campaign?) and Cambridge Analytica are evidently experts at thriving in dis-iniformation environments, like Putin. That makes it way too hard to pin down who owns who.

       Want to hear my theory?  Israel wants a conflict in that region, with hopefully a break down in relations with Iran.  They'd love it if Trump engaged in a nice simmering conflict with Syria.  He was praised and cosseted after that missile strike after a cold honeymoon.

       That thread got down voted because it is not good content. There are people on this sub, that provide real information to support conspiracy. That thread reeks of alt-right propaganda as well as compromise of other sorts.

       It is simply not enough to state, "why would Assad do that, what does he have to benefit?" There is plenty of concrete evidence to suggest someone with the last name Assad would gas their own people, up to and including he has already done it before.

       Well, I see where people would downvote your post just because it's speculation with a couple articles. People are quick to dismiss CNN, so it's hard to get them as a source people believe. I think with your posts, some people didn't agree with it and downvoted and it just didn't go anywhere. I doubt it was Trump shills looking to counter any bad news being conspired against Trump.

       I don't think any of them should be sources. Doesn't matter if it is fox, CNN, msnbc, rt, breitbart, they are all biased to their side and will turn stories to push their narrative. It's not about reporting facts anymore.

       Would that have been too hard to say the first time instead of being a complete dick for no reason? You throw out every well-known source that you don't personally believe should be used because of bias, and I'm the asshole for asking what you think

       Yes, I am just shitting on things and I know nothing about it. I stopped watching MSM over 10 years ago because it was so flawed. I turned to other media sources, more independent sources. The point of my post was to get you to make up your own mind and find your own sources so YOU know what is what, instead of me telling you to go here and listen to this person or that person, think for yourself and find your material. That is all I am saying. If you want to think that is me telling you to fuck off, then by all means, but think for your self and think outside of the box.

       Nothing's perfect, but these two sites are the best attempts I've seen of categorizing news outlets in a useful way. Media Bias seems to do their own cataloging. AllSides has a voting system. You can go on there and vote.

       While reality is much more nuanced than a simple left or right spectrum, there is definitely still some use for these services.

       There are people, including plenty in this sub, who have their perspective skewed by extremist media. To them, centrist publications appear to be extremist on the other side. For instance, people who read Breitbart think NPR is leftist propaganda. It's clearly not. Any centrist can see that. However, without a unbiased group to point to that does their best effort to categorize these things, there is nothing to point to to back you up when you say it's centrist.

       Yes, and go through the posts and how many are from CNN? Many many times has CNN been talked about with their collusion with the DNC? There is a trust level that you should have with any news source. Yes, this sub is about conspiracies, they are not about pushing a conspiracy based on something CNN has reported.

       There will be, but it will be so far down the line to likely be inconclusive.  The people who play these games learned far on "Iraq has WMDs": there can't be enough evidence available to disprove.  It's much easier to stage an attack than it is to produce a production facility.

       It is not T_D brigading. They don't organize and tell people to come here. Why do you see their influence then? They were already here. They were here before T_D existed. You should be able to determine this if you have eyes and are capable of processing the information they receive.

       Dude, I have been on this sub for years and was on the Donald since the start. I have never see a post telling people to go to a sub, the opposite actually. The moderators told the Donald subreddit to not even bring up the politics subreddit or you could be banned from Reddit for overpowering a sub. I can't agree with what you said because these group raids don't happen there. Now, it is possible that people were on here before the Donald, like the previous post states, and if there was a large group of users, then you will see certain posts move up. Pizzagate was a big thing that is still developing and IS a conspiracy and really came out when Podesta's emails were released. That. Ring said, pizzagate isn't something that the Donald subreddit came up with, nor do they claim to be the ones that broke it.

       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4t5oxg/rthe_donald_clearly_brigades_a_rworldnews_post/">
        Brigading by t_d subreddit
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a hoax that was invented on 4chan, moved to t_d, then to conspiracy. This happened during the vote brigading by t_d. Oh and t_d were officially warned by the reddit admins that their sub could be banned for vote rigging that we stopped seeing the flood of pizzagate and Trump posts on
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       What they were doing was asking for upvotes to get the post to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       and the mod was stickying the post. They also used
       <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-upvoter/elhcgdmnchcdopoehgdkejbpcpflbfio?hl=en">
        this extension
       </a>
       to automatically upvote all posts and comments in t_d which is how so many of their posts got to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       so fast (within a few minutes of each other) and why they had so many comment upvotes within each post in such a short space of time.

       Ok, so your cross post is from 9 months ago, and like I said the mods brought it to the attention of users and get banned now for brigading. Do you have a source that pizzagate is all just some thing made up by 4chan? Because I have seen tons of evidence not on 4chan by independent investigators and show some crazy coincidences. If you don't want to believe in pizzagate that fine, but you can't deny kids are being kidnapped and killed based on the arrests we have seen recently. I don't care if shills want to downvote me, but the Donald does not opening brigade subs like some other subs have done to the Donald. I've been on Reddit long enough to see how this shit works and people will branch out from their subs to defend their ideas on other subs. Because a guy posts a screen shot on Reddit about 4 comments and the names are blocked out but his, you are going to blame the subreddit for people looking st the post history and seeing where the post came from? Do we just eliminate post history for other people to see?

       As a person who thinks Trump is pathetic, I think other guy is right in this instance. You can argue it was happening previously, but the OP is about current practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stands to reason that because the majority of users here support Trump, they're going to downvote Russia connection storylines. Just as it stands to reason that politics users like me will downvote a Brietbart submission.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason for a scheme when one side or other have the numbers. And Trump has the numbers here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There just doesn't seem to be any need for manipulation when a couple hundred people one way or the other decide the fate of posts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Same reason I've argued it's ridiculous that anyone would care to invest money in manipulating this sub. The return on investment is just minuscule if it's free...preposterous if it's any spend at all. Yes, this is a contest, but it's just a small contest among users, most of whom already have their minds made up about everything.)

       You have no sense of proportion if you think some IRC chats which are so invisible that most T_D users would have no idea about them caused the demographics of this subreddit to change so dramatically. That is very lazy reasoning. A hand-waving explanation. The massive overlap between the subreddits can't be explained away like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, this sub is more liberal now because Trump won and so it is now more permissible for the left to talk about the evil government. But all conspiracy theory communities overwhelmingly support Trump. The users here have always had the same tendencies as T_D. They have always overwhelmingly had the same style of rhetoric, reasoning, and beliefs and it is completely natural that so many gravitate towards Trump and T_D.

       Is there any proof of that or are you just assuming theyre brigading? There are POTUS supporters all over this sub, the only ones brigading are the Hillbots and anti-truth shills. Not trying to be rude or anything im genuinely curious.

       I'm a trump fan but I'm pretty okay with that. Now that it's not an election I'm happy to see conspiracies from all sides of the isle, since an anti-trump agenda doesn't exactly have a clear goal (versus anti-trump articles being posted explicitly to help clinton win, before november). And the pro-trump spin is always around the corner at t_d

       Those are a bigger conspiracy than starting wars, the biggest political scandal in world history, and the inner workings of easily the worst presidency in U.S.??? Oh and Trump's complete 180 on many of his campaign positions. Oh and Russia influencing our elections and having social media teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no pedo ring and certainly not one involving Hillary. But Trump is well connected to a known pedo. So I guess we'll include "an elite pedophile network involving Trump and Epstein".

        "yet another “Jane Doe” filed a suit in New York accusing Epstein and Donald Trump of raping her at a series of sex parties when she was only 13."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be mistaken but pretty sure no one has accused Hillary of raping them. Guess it's time for you to dismiss all the pedo stuff since it directly implicates Trump.

       So you're actively stating Hillary is involved in a pedo ring but simultaneously denying Trump is when he is literally mentioned in court documents as raping a 13 yr old along with a pedo you just mentioned?

       That sounds an awful lot like all of the accusations made against Hilary Clinton for decades and yet people continue to talk about how corrupt she is, when they can't point to even one crime she's ever been charged with and convicted of.

       More importantly, if you're not advocating resolution on yesterday's crimes, why even bother with today's or tomorrow's? If Hillary won't be held accountable, at that point, what difference does it make? The effort itself to forget about Hillary and pivot to Trump seems like an act from CTR or similar.

       They are all big conspiracies.  Also what President hasnt done a 180 on their campaign promises.   They all feed us what we want to hear then once in office they change their mind, or "I can't get you x because the other side is blocking me"  well then don't promise us x.  But so many people fall for the same shit over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for influencing elections.  We do the same shit, so hate to say it but we got a taste of our own medicine if they did.  Pay backs are a bitch
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Hillary may not have her name tied directly to Epstein like her husband(who has flwon in his plane and been to the island just like trump and many other rich and famous people) but she and huma abedin did show interested in

       Who tried to take kids out of Haiti without following proper protocols.  I know that as kidnapping, and thats not cool.   I believe there are other connections to her and Hillary but I can't find them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the whole situation goes, no one is perfect and all presidential candidates make promises they cant keep.  The Clinton's and trump are not innocent in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope none of this, literally, blows up in our faces.   Its a shit show of a situation here.

       There's more than one. He was also accused of raping a 12 yr old. There's also witnesses.

      <p>
       There's wayyyyyy more validity to that than pg.

       And there's plenty of other sexual assault allegations against Trump, so take your pick. And before anyone says it's women looking for a payout, there's lots of rich men that haven't been accused dozens of times of sexual assault.

       Mountains upon mountains of evidence, vs. Some sketchy lawsuits that have all been dropped, and an accuser who admitted they were paid to slander Trump.  I mean, voat has been digging for months now, and we've found dozens of connections to CPP, pedophilia, and the Clintons, but not many links to Trump.  That's not to say he's innocent, just that the evidence isn't there.  Also, there have been more pedos arrested in Trumps first three months than in Obama's entire 8 years.

       I don't have time to dig it up right now, but it's on the archived pizzagate sub if you want to dig a bit.

       I'm not a Trump supporter, btw.  If he's guilty then hang him.  What I am is a voater who has followed pizzagate from day one, and I have yet to see much evidence involving Trump.  He was in Epstein's black book, but never flew on the Loli express.

       I'm trying to be amicable here but you're making it hard. Yet again, a pg theorist uses absolutely no common sense.

      <p>
       I could tell you weren't, which is why this is weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article doesn't back up that claim. It's absurd to think in 3 months there's been more pedo arrests than in the past 8 years. It's even more absurd to think Trump had anything to do with that. Local law enforcement is not receiving directions from the White House.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even more absurd to do easily dismiss claims that Trump is a pedo and sexual predator when there have been actual accusations against him. You gleefully accept the entire pg narrative but then immediately dismiss claims against Trump. It defies any bit of common sense. Trump was very close to Epstein, which is your smoking gun against Clinton.

       Did you know that Bill Clinton flew on the loli express more than twenty times?  Or that Jeffrey Epatein considers himself the cofounder of the Clinton Foundatipn?  Yes, maybe Trump has some ties to Pedogate (although I haven't personally seen much evidence of that).  The Clintons are smack in the middle of it.

       First off, it's Lolita Express. I don't give a fuck about the Clintons. Trump is the president. Maybe try focusing on him...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Trump is just as close to Epstein as the Clintons? But don't take my word for it, take Trump's:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That was 15 years ago. So Trump's known him for 30 years. Then there's accusations of rape by a 12 and 13 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you don't mention that. Because you're a hypocrite. You don't care about reality. You use pedo accusations as a political tool. It's appalling and disgusting. But that's what you do.

       I'm not a believer in Hillary &amp; Co being involved in pedophilia, but you can't say there are not pedo rings for the rich and elite. It's all over. Hollywood, England. Employees of DynCorp were caught having sex with, and trafficking, young girls in Bosnia.

       No. They had evidence that indicates the CIA can make some attacks look a like they were done by a different country (but doesn't specifically apply to the DNC hack according to what netsec people are saying), which Wikikeaks talked up in their summary, and has been twisted in a game of chinese whispers.

       Be mindful of bullshit too though, scrolling through the new section is a lot of Nazi/Alt-Right garbage in there. No doubt the "let's turn

       Be mindful of bullshit too, like people using slurs like "Nazi" to describe people who are not left wing. For instance, "Alt Right" describes everyone from Donald Trump to Gavin McInnes to Trump voters in their 20s. Leftists of course believe that Trump = Hitler and that half of Americans are "Nazis."
      </p>
      <p>
       So watch out for left wing cranks trying to divide and conquer between left vs. right.

       We had actual commies in the street in full black being responded to by American flag defenders equipping themselves for defense against their attacks. (I'm on the Trump train btw - I'm not calling Trump supporters Nazis, you are.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I draw the comparison is because YOU mentioned something about Hitler and that triggers me because I love talking about Hitler and Nazis [You can read my history if you want to pull on that string]. This recent period of political conflict leading up the election of our glorious God Emperor DOES have comparisons to the political environment in Germany pre-1933 with just how polarized and seemingly violent is was getting (maybe I just saw a lot of media of Leftists beating on "NAZI TRUMP SUPPORTERS"), you're literally eating your own here - we think the same thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean I'm calling all Trump supporters Nazis, or all Shillary supporters Communists. That just means I like history.

       That's horse crap.  You can't take crap you see in posts and translate that into all the "leftists" in the US.  It's the same statement as crap like all Trump supporters are racist just because some of them are.

       Kind of ironic saying there is a crusade against whites when whites created the original Crusade. But I'm guessing white people slaughtering anyone a different shade of skin color in the name of their god is ok with you.

       To be clear, I am not saying that there is no antisemitism or racism in this subreddit. All I'm saying is that it's massively exaggerated, and that racists are on many other subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of those examples was a single troll who posted
       <em>
        tons
       </em>
       of racist stuff all over Reddit over a long period of time. A single troll can do massive amounts of damage. It also seems to me that it would be pretty difficult to prove that a user is a troll, given that they are at least slightly careful. We are lucky to even know about these two. Therefore, there must be tons of other trolls who do this, likely upvoting themselves, and never getting caught.

       Such bullshit, I remember back in the day when articles from the daily stormer, a stormfront publication, and if you ask who is stormfront, they're the Aryan Nation's web presence, anyway their articles appeared in this sub every day, especially the ones that covered the topics
       <a href="/u/tsiru12">
        /u/tsiru12
       </a>
       cited. There isn't a false flag that stuff was legit, the sentiment echoed on the sub was legit, and mods were replaced for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the userbase is anyway near as bad as it was back then but I still see the same topics pop up rather frequently, they just normally never reach the front page anymore.

       So are you saying that one idiot being caught doing this, which is pretty much the same as the idiot who burnt down the Synagogues to impress or get back at a girl or other examples, says that there are none on this sub? No attempts to recruit here or push agendas?

       <a href="/r/uncensorednews">

       Nobody is saying there are zero racists here. I'm showing you that there are trolls out there who like to exaggerate how many racists are in this sub.

       No the worst posts are the ones that are actually racist like any of that white genocide bullshit and anything along those lines, the blatantly anti-Semitic posts are a close second to those for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second worst posts are all of the concern troll posts that pop up every day from
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       users or people sucked into it these posts are like "c'mon guys we can't let the shills divide us" "well who are the shills?" "anyone that doesn't think like OP does"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are the ones that make a point to shit on the Trump campaign/Russian collusion conspiracy yet anything against Hillary is fine like "Hillary Clinton eats babies for longevity" yet you mention anything about Trump "nah man you're just accepting the mainstream media's narrative" sure okay dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall I haven't bitched about racism in this sub since a few years back, this place has come a long way since then, but they still pop in here or there from shitholes like
       <a href="/r/uncensorednews">
        /r/uncensorednews
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/TheRedPill">
        /r/TheRedPill
       </a>
       but there is always going to be overlap, just like there is overlap with
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and r/news and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       . Regardless though I think racists are ignorant pieces of shit and I have no problem with them being called out on it when they actually pop their heads up, but I do have a problem with people generalizing people because of their subs or political leanings and using terms like "shill" or "racist" merely because they have a different viewpoint than the person tossing those labels at them.

       I frequent there as well, there is so much conspiracy satire on that sub and over the top asshats like Alex Jones are a good laugh, but unless the video or post they're joking on is actually racist they usually don't just bring up this sub and say anything about this sub being racist. Just saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that no this place is not full to the brim with racists, that's apparently Voat, same with Pedo's apparently as well, but there are a sizable percentage who obviously are and quite a few subs who cater to them, and I'm sure there is actually recruitment happening, as they would be foolish not to harness that negative energy if that is their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The link proved one person was hoaxing, I don't believe that it disqualifies all other claims, that's like saying that one dick spray painting swastikas who was Jewish or whatever was caught and it was a hoax so all other swastika grafitti is a hoax or false flag, that's just ludicrous. Another example is how false rape allegations make it harder on actual rape victims because each fake subsequently makes it harder to prove a true traumatizing event.

       in some of these subs I mentioned were written by this troll. Do you realize how many posts and how many usernames he had? And that's just what we know about.

       It's a fluke that we even found out about this guy. Read up on the back story and everything. Why would there not be more trolls like that? It's called black propaganda--posting comments supposedly written by one group that were actually written by another group to discredit.

       You are talking about how people see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and said there are several trolls that have been caught trying to make the sub seem racist correct?.  I'm not trying to prove or disprove that at all.  In fact my point was that regardless of people trying to make this sub seem racist the mods have done stuff that makes this sub seem racist.  Hence my point about a picture of Hitler with a link about a Holocaust denial documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Complaining about trolls is fine, and I'd say warranted, but when the mods do something like what I mentioned they aren't exactly helping the image of this sub.

       I doubt the majority of the people here are glad that the mods did that. The mods don't represent this community. They are only the people who happen to have control over the moderation here, nothing more. If there was a better sub without these mods and a lot of traffic, we would go there instead, but this is what we have to deal with for now. Not that I'm saying you did this, but going around pretending that the actions of at least 1 mod discredits this sub and deems it to be "a racist subreddit" is retarded.

       Yes they do.  Especially at the time that Hitler pic went up.  There was crazy shit going on with the mods, including Flytape's infamous podcast.  All of that reflected on the community and still does.  Every sub's moderators represent their community.

       And as such they can make up rules they want, they can sticky threads, notate threads as unverified, delete threads, remove comments, ban users, make their own comments, and do whatever they want essentially.  They are a part of the community, not separate from it.

       I'm not saying that one mod or one event determines if a sub is racist or not.  So I'll have to restate my point.  This sub has done things in the past, all on it's own and separate from its users or trolls, that makes it look racist.  The Hitler pic and documentary was just an example.

       This is a very weird statement and has nothing to do with what I'm saying.  I'm not trying to discredit anything, I'm just simply stating that I don't think it is just trolls that are to blame for this sub getting certain reputations from time to time.

       At least you're obvious with your agenda. I agree with several things in his post. It's easy to play your bullshit "anything pro white is racist" card but the truth is that there is an overwhelming anti-white sentiment that is taught and reinforced in school and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black on white women rape fact is not only in America. But why would your statement that it is only in America be worth anything anyways? Is America not important? I'd say not to someone promoting the agenda OP was speaking out against. So in that context your reply makes sense.
      </p>

       I get it. You think America doesn't matter and white people should shut the fuck up and anyone who says anything against that is a crazy racist idiot who should be disregarded.

       I love how these posts always end with the obvious "girls don't like me" motive. Maybe you should try being a likeable person instead of being a raging asshole. Another thought, have you ever thought about going gay? I mean apparently women aren't your thing.

       No one is saying those are good posts, other than you and a fringe minority of Internet racists (who can be found on literally any forum or website), posts that are more often than not downvoted by most who come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point OP was trying to make, is the frequency of quality content inexplicably downvoted and buried before most here even have a chance to see it, content from both mainstream and independent sources, ranging from proven to plausible conspiracies, or at minimum conspiracies the majority here would be interested in researching if not support.

       It is almost every single one. The timing coincides perfectly with the spike in t_d subs. It is very odd and my favorite theory is it's Russia gearing up for the damning media reports of the last few months.

       i don't. go look through my post history. i was for bernie. did not vote hillary. certainly not a trump supporter, but i also think it's ridiculous to call anyone you disagree with a nazi or a fascist. i literally have created a sub describing my socialist beliefs because they don't fit in with any part i currently know of.

       All the hardest trump supporters on this sub (im intentionally not calling them shills, that word is poison) claim to not be trump supporters. Its better for them. Makes them more credible.

      <p>
       "i dont even like donald trump, but even I can see that he is the smartest man who ever lived"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also claiming to be a bernie supporter furthers the divide on the left, pitting sanders supporters against mainstream dems, allowing someone as unpopular as trump to get even more traction.

       You could be legit. but if I had a pro trump agenda Id use the same script you just used.

       So you concede Russia utilizes bots on social media. But it's insane to you to think they're using bots on one of the most widely used social media websites in the world? Because "I've never seen broken English posts that looks like it from Russia and I'm on t_d everyday!"

       Yes, the entire Russian internet propaganda machine was exposed in Russian court. Don't listen to the FBI, CIA, Congress, British, French, or any other NATO ally. Listen to the Russians.

       So why did you link to this article instead of one about the supposed "win"? I'm not seeing anything else about this court case. And it still doesn't prove that TD is Russian bots.

        A Russian court has ordered a secretive pro-Putin “propaganda factory” to pay symbolic damages to an employee who sued them in a bid to expose the workings of the Kremlin’s online trolls.

        “I am very happy with this victory. I achieved my aim, which was to bring the internet trolls out of the shade,” said Savchuk, 34.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I never beated around the bush. I guess I didn't realize this isn't common sense. I thought it was common knowledge. I forgot people live in a hive mind cult where none of this is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, we know there are thousands and thousands of Russian propaganda teams working the internet, which even you can now admit. Which websites weren't specified.
      </p>
      <p>
       I now realize you have absolutely no common sense but Reddit and the most pro Russia sub is completely off limits to the Russian internet propaganda teams, right? Keep putting politics before your country. Russia before America.

       What proof? So PR propaganda exists in Russia. So what?

      <p>
       Your belief is that there is no way that the Donald subreddit can be this active. It has to be bots. So you're assuming that just because the Russians do exactly as Americans do with PR and all the Bullshit that therefore all Trump supporters must be Russian trolls.
      </p>

       I then provided a source saying Russia is using tons of bots.

       It's just common sense. Russia is using bots on Twitter. But for some reason they stop at Twitter? That's what you think? They would use bots only on Twitter and no other social media platform?

       I don't think many people here doubt that the Russian government uses bots on social media, including Reddit.  I'd expect every national government to employ bots on social media, provided they possess the necessary knowledge and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       What raises people's eyebrows is how a foreign government's efforts to influence American public opinion is being widely promoted as some sort of an emerging and unprecedented threat, given the freedoms of speech and of the press that have existed since the ratification of the Bill of Rights.  Propaganda is nothing new, and we don't mind its existence as long as other arguments and viewpoints are freely accessible.  This is why I really don't mind the Marxist propaganda that for years has been creeping more and more into the content of left-leaning broadcasts and publications.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's not that more Americans are increasingly becoming pro-Russia and anti-American.  Rather, many Americans see the utter disregard for basic constitutional freedoms coming from the people fear-mongering over Russian influence, and they see that domestic agenda as the more immediate threat to America.

       What Constitutional abuses are coming from people fear mongering over Russian influence? I'm very concerned about Russia, so much so I wrote my Congressman. I also swore an oath to the Constitution. You won't ever find me promoting violations of the Constitution.

       It is an emerging and unprecedented threat. The modern internet hasn't been around very long. Social media is brand new to most people. Pretty sure the 60 &amp; 70 yr olds don't know the difference between fake news articles and real ones.

       I was a strongly critical of the Bush administration (whose reputation you may have noticed is enjoying some rehabilitation in the mainstream press lately) before I was strongly critical of Democrats, for the same reasons: blatant disregard for the constitution.  I'm well aware that this isn't a situation of one side being staunch defenders of the constitution and the other being habitual violators.  It's a continuous analysis, and right now I view the Democrats and Neoconservatives opposing Trump as a bigger threat in comparison to Trump.  They are the bigger threat to basic freedoms due to their paternalistic presumption of knowing voters' interests better than the voters themselves.

       Trump is attacking the media for everything. If they report the criminal investigations into him he attacks them. If they report his blatant lies, he attacks them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But somehow you're justifying exactly what you just said was a big deal. When Trump does it's okay.

        I agree with Roe v. Wade, but the government is not explicitly prohibited from restricting access to abortions in the Bill of Rights or anywhere else in the constitution.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And they're only explicitly prohibited from infringing on our right to bear arms in "a well regulated militia" but that's not how the Constitution works is it? There's explicit and implicit government powers and limits. Nice try though.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's actually Planned Parenthood v. Casey that allows abortion.

        blatant disregard for the constitution.  I'm well aware that this isn't a situation of one side being staunch defenders of the constitution and the other being habitual violators.  It's a continuous analysis, and right now I view the Democrats and Neoconservatives opposing Trump as a bigger threat in comparison to Trump.  They are the bigger threat to basic freedoms due to their paternalistic presumption of knowing voters' interests better than the voters themselves.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You mean like Trump's blatant disregard for the Emoluments clause? Ohhhhhhh, not so important now, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       You previously said "utter disregard for basic Constitutional freedoms" but completely ignore Trump's rampant and blatant attacks on them. He's doing nothing different than past presidents to curb them while flaming hatred for he press like nothing we've ever seen before. You're simultaneously blasting the establishment for "utter disregard for basic Constitutional freedoms" but justifying Trump's "utter disregard for basic Constitutional freedoms".
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, one of the clearest displays of cognitive dissonance I've seen in a long time. It's hypocrisy, plain and simple.

       You "corrected" me by claiming that
       <em>
        Casey
       </em>
       is the case that allows abortion rather than
       <em>
        Roe v. Wade
       </em>
       .  For your sake I'm going to doubt you are being sincere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, your belief that
       <em>
        Casey
       </em>
       "allows abortion" shows that you don't actually know what the constitution and the Supreme Court are addressing.  They are addressing whether or not certain actions or restrictions implemented by the government are within the scope of government authority.  They do not determine what private persons are allowed to do.  There is no case that allows abortion.  The cases dealing with abortion address whether certain government restrictions on abortion are allowed under the constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can keep going, but I'd recommend against it.  Mixing condescension with demonstrated ignorance tends to do a number on your credibility.

       While this may be true for those in privileged life styles. The average college graduate debt amount has never been higher. While the average college graduate employment rate is declining. All the while health insurance cost is on the rise, no matter which political party is the president. So while in the 50's and 60's and arguably the 70's you could afford a house mortgage, a car loan and a family of 4 on the average national salary. That no longer can be said for the same for our current date.

       No one can possibly blame Russia for that. So if your reasons for blaming Russian is truly based on keeping the US "great and wealthy", maybe start pointing blame some where else, cause Russia isn't causing the next crash equivalent to the housing crash of 2008, which will be student loans.

       Wealth and stability across the world. Not just the U.S. And we can thank the U.S. for that. Worldwide conflict is down, combat related deaths are dramatically lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about what you're​ complaining about. Education and healthcare. Not food, safety, wars. I'd say that's fine with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're deflecting. Your original rebuttal was "well the U.S. does it". Yes, we do. And that's great. Doesn't mean it's acceptable when a foreign adversarial country does it to us. Especially one like Russia.

       You seemed to suggest that Russia's agenda was becoming more negotiable as far as Americans are concerned, despite the same policies that we've had for decades, and that this unprecedented infiltration of Russian talking points had to be countered in some novel fashion.

       I do too. I was skeptical for awhile, although kept an eye on the Russian connections since they were reported last summer. But if you've been following this whole thing, there's so many connections. So many things align perfectly.

       A vast majority of Trump/Russia defenders I engage with on Reddit are eerily similar. Same account age, same history, similar comments, always reach a point they can't refute and ignore.

       I'm assuming it's because there are groups of users out there who target and harass specific users, following them around Reddit, sending them PM's, etc. If they know what your account is, they can easily find where you are posting and either downvote your stuff, post replies to discredit you, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people make an extra account or two, it takes a while for those harassing users to find you. That's why I made this account and a couple others, and I'm going to do it again when they target me again. I like to "spread out" my stuff on Reddit so that I don't appear to be a "power user" who is a real pain in their ass. They think I'm just some random dude who posts on Reddit once a week, and therefore I don't seem to be a problem for them.

       You guys both sound like trolls though just gaslighting us all like we're stupid worrying about shills. You know who creates multiple reddit accounts? TROLLS especially the douchey alt-right type. I remember a time on this website before 2013 when trolls didn't have an agenda and were just doing it for the lols, but the more corporate this site has become the more its attracted the wrong type of toxic people on here. If you don't like challenging viewpoints go visit /pol over at the hacker 4chan. Leave us true conspiracy theorists the fuck alone.

I am honest in all of my posts, I'm not sure what you think my agenda is. Trump has changed so much in the last month or 2, I do NOT agree with him on how he handles leaks or how he thinks about them, I do NOT approve of the way he handled Syria, I do NOT approve of how he passed that internet bill, I do NOT approve how he talks about NK.

       of course he wasnt what he said he was. He sold you the lie. A lot of people saw it. Most of the country in fact. But you were too high energy, weren't tired of winning. You thought the manhattan billionaire gave a shit about the common man because he said he did. itd be hilarious if it wasnt so fucking tragic

       Well, the problem is that non-discord sowers eat the shill stuff up. It's an incredibly cliché phenomenon where certain people will latch onto any theory--no matter how ridiculous--that discredits the proponents of opinions they disagree with. It's doubly hilarious in a sub that purports to be filled with "critical thinkers." And it's triply hilarious because the shill accusers constantly warn that we should be wary of shills and their "forum sliding" techniques. Which, of course, is exactly what a shill would want to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if there were an army of "Shareblue" shills on this sub, the best response to them--and the only way to truly avoid forumsliding--would be to argue with them using facts and substance. If they make a point, counter it. If they start just engaging in ad hominens, ignore them as you would anyone else who did that.

       A lot of reasons. 1stly is many idiots totally disregard anything you daily based on whether or not you've posted there. 2nd is a lot of 4channers make new or alternate accounts. 3rd you get banned from subs for either posting once ever or commenting.

       This needs to be on the sidebar. I'm not just saying that should be the case. The mods literally need to add a disclaimer on the sidebar to do this. Doing so will likely help counteract the brigading and conspicuous influx of users with an agenda who attempt to bury posts containing certain keywords for example, which happens here on a regular if not daily basis unfortunately.

       Yeah, it's pretty clear that "Not everyone who disagrees with you is a shill" implies that you think OP is calling people shills only because he disagrees with them. Do you even understand what you say, or do you just spew out words?

        A shill, also called a plant or a stooge, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, confidence games, or other business areas. A shill may also act to discredit opponents or critics of the person or organization in which they have a vested interest through character assassination or other means.

       How many more anti donald trump posts do we need? I supported donald trump in the election that doesnt mean I agree with everything he does but I'm not a shill. I feel like there are more anti trump propaganda on here these days. When the election was going on it was dominated by anti hillary propaganda. I feel like you guys are a little paranoid and are anti(insert whoever is in power at the time). I understand that power corrupts but you guys look for conspiracies in everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be the point of shilling for donald? He has already won and your approval no longer matters. You guys are just paranoid.

       This sub is being brigaded, and not by T_D. Notice how it's very common in many subs to claim that T_D is brigading all the while pretty much every upvoted post is actually Anti-Trump stuff. i.e WorldNews/News/Politics, etc. It's a deflection tactic.

       Anyone who claims they have all those answers other than insiders in a half dozen intelligence communities is lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is not that we know the answers. The point is that there is far more than enough for Democrats and Republicans alike to welcome honest investigation and truth, no matter what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course that's not what we're seeing. We see Republican legislators who spent millions on "they said it was a video" Benghazi investigations...but saying today that leaking is all that really matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see hardline Republican commenters, who loved leaks and leakers six months ago, covering their ears and humming, as every day this looks worse and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was nothing to this, Republicans would've already trotted out Carter, Manafort, Kushner, et al, to testify and make Dems look awful. That's not what we've seen for the past weeks. We've seen insincere looking people in front of cameras explaining why there's nothing to see here, and no investigation is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own opinion is the same as yours: Trump himself probably wasn't personally involved before the fact. And even if he was it'll never be evidenced. But his incompetence, as if not already proven, and his part in covering all this up afterward, is going to come out. All just my opinions, and anyone who claims certainty on either side is either lying or obfuscating.

       You're not good at straw man arguments just so you know. Acknowledging the crusade against whites is not racist nor does it constitute an anti-ethnic agenda. It means you see the very real globalist agenda against whites. Simple.

       I believe in this theory, esp since they get VERY active whenever news that is bad for trump or russia or collusion comes out. Especially with BS filler posts that push anything off the front page that has to do with the above topics.

       First off, it's Lolita Express. I don't give a fuck about the Clintons. Trump is the president. Maybe try focusing on him...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Trump is just as close to Epstein as the Clintons? But don't take my word for it, take Trump's:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York Magazine for a 2002 profile of Epstein. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       That was 15 years ago. So Trump's known him for 30 years. Then there's accusations of rape by a 12 and 13 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you don't mention that. Because you're a hypocrite. You don't care about reality. You use pedo accusations as a political tool. It's appalling and disgusting. But that's what you do.

       So why did you link to this article instead of one about the supposed "win"? I'm not seeing anything else about this court case. And it still doesn't prove that TD is Russian bots.

       Can you prove definitively that The_Donald is being botted? Or is it all more of this weak sauce beating around the bush?
