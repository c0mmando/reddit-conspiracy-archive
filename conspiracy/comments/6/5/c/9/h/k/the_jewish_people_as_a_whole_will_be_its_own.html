       What? Messing around with money, and politics?

       Money, and politics won't matter much in a post apocalyptic Earth. Jewish people aren't widespread enough, or even liked enough to even try to take over like you suggest.

       We Jews have known about G-d's Plan to depopulate the Earth. I remember learning this as a child and I always wondered how it would happen. Now I see it happening right before my very eyes. The Earth will only have 500,000,000 inhabitants. I think many of you know that. One thing to keep in mind is that with fewer people inhabiting the Earth, the Earth will be restored and it will become a paradise. That too is also prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.
      </p>

       "Watch out! G-d is about to depopulate the land and devastate it; he will turn it upside down and scatter its inhabitants."

       No, I am not "thrilled" by any means. I am "overwhelmed", though, to have lived long enough to actually see this stuff becoming reality. I'm mixed in my feelings. I'm excited, but I am scared at the same time. It's kind of like what a Christian would feel if Jesus returned.

       The entire Earth was promised to us in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jews interpret these scriptures in different ways. Much of the Hebrew Scriptures contains proclamations by G-d that He will annihilate the "nations" (Gentiles) and give the Earth to His people. I was never taught as a Jew that there would be 500,000,000 people left on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, with regards to 500,000,000 remaining, what alarmed me is that there "respected" prominent scientists who are now pushing this agenda. Why? Who is behind this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I was alarmed by the article written by Rahm Emanuel's brother, a doctor, that suggests the notion that people shouldn't be allowed to live beyond 75 years of age.

       Something in a book says blablabla. I'm so glad I'm an Atheist. Do you know how often the 'end of the world' has been looming?
Forever. 
So far all the thousands of 'End of worlds' have been just hot air. Maybe this time eh? Just keep at it, has to correlate at some point.
That would show us unbelievers how right the book was all along...

       I think you are viewing the Hebrew Bible from the viewpoint that a supernatural, higher power supposedly inspired these prophesies. For centuries, Orthodox Jews who worship a higher power believed that they had to wait on G-d to fulfill scripture, yet nothing ever happened. The Zionists said "Fuck it. G-d needs help." So, instead of waiting on G-d they are fulfilling the scriptures themselves.

       Okay. I just wanted to clarify that even though the "prophecies" are over 2,000 years old, they are still in the hearts of Jews, whether they were inspired by G-d, or not inspired. But, what is bewildering is to see the Zionists fulfilling these scriptures.

       That's all symbolic connections. Like I said, you can sometimes follow symbols back, but only because they're in stone. You don't have any reason to think it's the exact same group doing the same things. Many symbols have different meanings to different people.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, the co-opting of the term "Illuminati" by people who have no connection to the historical Illuminati.

       Go read about how Mystery Schools push the Jewish conspiracy so you won't pay attention to who they really are. It has nothing to do with Judaism, at all. You're confusing Judaism with Kaballah.

       Kaballah is jewish witchcraft is it not? Still mystic judaism. Not saying all jews agree with it either. But there are those who do and follow it very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it was the brits if im not mistaken who funded israel. The royal families of Britain believe they go back to the Phoenicians. While technically not jews they still believed in the pantheon and worshipped certain deities the jews recognize.  Been doing alot of reading on these fuckers because of some genetic questions regarding my family. All this "elite blood" bullshit goes back them from what i have found and read so far.

       Sort of. That's a component. I would call it esoteric Judaism, or almost inverted Judaism, where they flip all of the teachings. It has absolutely nothing to do with people who are ethnically Jewish.

       The Jews only recognize one God. Talk to an Orthodox Jew who really believes in the teachings (not just a cultural Jew), and they absolutely reject all of this worshiping of evil gods.

       It amazes me that people who claim to be the pinnacle of critical thought have absolutely zero self-reflective capabilities. People who claim they are "awake" drifting off to a bias-confirming lullaby sung by any theocrat/dictator.
      </p>

       A person who claims to be a critical thinker will have no issue whatsoever to genuinely doubt the beliefs they hold and deduct their way to reality.

       He probably would if any salient points were actually made. Instead we get a New Agey Christian block of text that honestly looks like something a person suffering from schizophrenia wrote up. I mean, what does this even mean:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jupiter (king) comes from the Leo zodiac sign (House of David) in 2015/2016 and enters the zodiac sign virgo (Virgin) in late 2016 and stays inside her belly for nine month and a half (birth pain) end comes out between her legs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's certainly English, and I get the references, but the author is clearly making some sort of connection to various pseudo-spiritual concepts that he/she expects everyone to innately understand.

       Slandering? That's a bit rich don't you think, coming from a nazi like you? Consider OP's post and then reconsider your use of the word slander - and take a good and long at your own post history. You should be ashamed of yourself for misleading people, but mostly you should be ashamed of yourself for letting charlatans deceive you - regardless of what or how hard you believe...you should understand this(and any kremlin crawler too for that matter): You have been duped. You never woke up, in fact you've never been as fast asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       No points have been made by OP to refute. It's nonsense. Just like your short but entire post history bashing Jewish people and Israel. It's pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS. If these cretins can call people shills they shouldn't feel slighted in the least when they're aptly called nazis.

       You guys must be confused. How dare you fool your fellow humans with your un-verified and assumptive reasoning. You'd do the world a better service if you explained math or chemistry to younger generations, rather than be fooled by the likes of Bill Hicks dressed as Alex Jones who want to fool as many of you as possible for that sweet ad-revenue.

       I'm sure glad you found my post abusive.

Why would we ever practice self-reflection for personal growth, right?

       You can realize that some groups as a whole hold certain beliefs (not all the members have to), or that their texts contain beliefs that are "evil" (not a good descriptive word in my opinion since it's usually subjective, but whatever), etc., without thinking they are to blame for all of the "evil". Everyone has done shit things and many hold shit beliefs, it doesn't mean they can't be called out for it. I don't think there's any use in labeling something anti semitic, islamophobic, anti christian, or whatever, because at the end of the day you can be "anti" something and still have a valid point.

       I think you need to be careful about what you're defining a "shit belief" or an "evil belief" that needs to be called out. I actually think the post that kicked this whole thing out is a "shit belief" that needs to be called out. Which is why I'm taking the time to do so.

       Let me just say that I'm not an expert in messianic theology or any of that, but I have spent some time thinking about religion, and I'm only taking OP's evidence at face value.

       He says:
      </p>

       <p>
        "They need to create WW3 and destroy most of humanity."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But the text he points to doesn't say [this]&lt;
       <a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah%3E">
        http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah&gt;
       </a>
       . Instead it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The objections of these scholars, however, rest principally on the hypothesis that the idea of the Messiah is inseparably bound up with the desire for universal dominion, whereas, in reality, this feature is not a characteristic of the Messianic hope until a later stage of its development. The ideal king to whom Isaiah looks forward will be a scion of the stock of Jesse, on whom will rest the spirit of God as a spirit of wisdom, valor, and religion, and who will rule in the fear of God, his loins girt with righteousness and faithfulness (xi. 1-3a, 5). He will not engage in war or in the conquest of nations; the paraphernalia of war will be destroyed (ix. 4); his sole concern will be to establish justice among his people (ix. 6b; xi. 3b, 4). The fruit of his righteous government will be peace and order throughout the land. The lamb will not dread the wolf, nor will the leopard harm the kid (xi. 8); that is, as the following verse explains, tyranny and violence will no longer be practised on God's holy mountain, for the land will be full of the knowledge of God as the water covers the sea (comp. xxxii. 1, 2, 16). The people will not aspire to political greatness, but will lead a pastoral life (xxxii. 18, 20). Under such ideal conditions the country can not but prosper, nor need it fear attack from outside nations (ix. 6a, xxxii. 15). The newly risen scion of Jesse will stand forth as a beacon to other nations, and they will come to him for guidance and arbitration (xi. 10). He will rightly be called "Wonderful Counselor," "Godlike Hero," "Constant Father," "Prince of Peace" (ix. 5).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Note that this source is itself 100 years old, so in order to understand the concept of the Messiah you'd probably have to look more closely at the specific books named.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, the Enoch literature rises out of the Seleucid empire dominating Judea, and the Book of Daniel arises from the Babylonian exile. But these are examples when a people was being oppressed! These books they wrote were expressions in response to that. They imagine a different world, one better than the empire that's affecting them.

       Does that mean every idea in these texts is something modern people should believe? Not necessarily; but in that case let's go through and see what the text actually says. In my view, both of this literature contains VERY powerful stories that could be seen as a treasured part of humanity's cultural output. I don't see any reason to start describing these ideas as evil right off the bat. If you disagree, point me towards sections in Enoch, Isaiah or Daniel that you disagree with and let's talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree there's a lot in the Hebrew scriptures that's troubling, and there's a long religious history responding precisely to the character of YHWH. Gnosticism emerges, for instance, as a critique of that character. And I think a lot of thought working off the Hebrew scriptures would reject some of the ethics embodied in those texts. But they are thousands of years old! They were written to meet the needs of a different people. Yet there is much in them that is timeless, which is why it still speaks to us today. And this is where you have to be fair, and say that EVERY religious tradition, every CULTURE in fact, every single RECORD OF HUMANITY has similar moral lapses. I don't think it's a good idea to condemn all of our ancestors, and I ESPECIALLY don't think it's a good idea to single out one specific group of our ancestors to slander as being in particular evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the other links? The fact that you have groups of people raising a red heifer. Well, this again is a long and ancient tradition of a particular people, at least according to this evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the Temple Institute that OP linked to? Here is what it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Temple Institute hopes one day to replace the Dome of the Rock with the Third Holy Temple, but not by violent means. Observant Jews pray for that to happen in every daily prayer service, with some awaiting the appearance of the Messiah and others believing that they must act to bring the Messiah closer.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But here's the thing-- there's a long history of religions laying claims to sacred spots. The churches of Europe are built on the remnants of pagan sites. Temple Mount or the Dome of the Rock is a sacred place to millions of people. It's of great significance to a huge portion of the world's community. Is it possible to hope that one day groups will be able to lay claim collectively? I personally hope this is a place that one day all the children of Abraham could be at. As the three religions understand it, they are worshipping the same God. I hope future generations come to see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where religion is significant, because part of what it's getting to is the political differences between people. Which are deep and sustained. Religious texts are in some ways memories of the past, of our history. They provide powerful emotional catalysts. For there ever to be peace around these issues, it means that the people involved need to learn to get along. I think the religious symbolism could be a means to accomplish that goal, which to my mind would bring a reduction in human suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the way I read the sources that the OP provided, and try to extract my own interpretation from what I saw as a polemical and flawed interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We KNOW it doesn't do good to pick out specific people to hate. There's a reasons there's been centuries of pogroms against all sorts of minorities. This is something that I hope people can stand against -- if the kind of thing you value is human decency, honesty, fair and critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's totally possible that someone would disagree with what I've said. I've given my own read based on my own ethics and personal beliefs, which may be different than yours. But in any case let's have a conversation thinking about the sources, exchanging ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you've committed to a dogma when you have a pre-conception of the world that cannot be overturned. When everything fits into a narrative. This is not how knowledge works; this is not how people learn. I am worried that anti-Semitism as well as Islamophobia is one such dogma that has played a long and awful role in history, and I would like to see that end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again that's not to say there aren't things to criticize about the actions of the State of Israel, or the way aspects of Muslim theology get turned to murderous ends (which is something condemned by many of the religious authorities!). And there's things to criticize about Christianity, and secular liberalism for that matter, and pretty much any freaking ideology out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But criticizing doesn't mean you have to find a scapegoat to be sacrificed.

       Sorry for the very short reply to a good post, I'll read over what you've said again in the morning because my brain can't process it at this time of night. But what I was saying was more of a general statement of my disapproval for the phrases anti-semitism and islamophobia used because I don't think they're productive.

       I understand what you're saying. Words like anti-Semitism or Islamophobia or racism or sexism or homophobia can be used as buzzwords or polemical terms that are meant to discredit conversation. This is frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what I also think we need to recognize is that there IS persecution of minorities, which at times has included Jews, Muslims, black people, and hundreds of other examples. Europe in particular has a long history of carrying out murder of people of Jewish descent. We absolutely need a word to talk about these things, and recognize that these things happen. If we throw out the concept of anti-Semitism, in my view we blind ourselves to very real aspects of history.

       Well having had "lovely" dinners with an ex's jewish family, and hearing how they spoke of specific ethnic races.... I'm by far someone who gets offended easily, but I can't really take their side. Nor do I the muslims or bible bouncers. I do know there are jews who believe Israel shouldn't be its own state. They were brought up as "lunatics" in convo. Some of the most prejudice views I've heard (outside of shock value comedy type shit) and i know those views weren't just theirs. I know they aren't the view of all jews but sadly there are people who express shit like "the dirty Palestinians need to be bombed for good" comparing them to roaches, they kind of get grouped into a name and its easiest for people to choose the name the group identifies as. Not saying its right but people freak when they feel threatened man.  Sheeple exist in all sects of society. Blind followers who read up and study 5 percent of what they believe. When majority of a group consists of those people... Well. Funniest thing I learned after reading up on what my ex spouted. Of all the groups that have the most native "Israeli" blood. The Palestinians
