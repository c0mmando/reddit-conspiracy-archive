<p>this idea originated late in post-exilic times <a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah">see</a></p>

<p>their game plan is described in their prophetic books. Book of daniel, Enoch, Ezra, Baruch, Ezekiel, ...</p>

<p>According to their &quot;prophets&quot;, they need to create ww3 and destroy most of humanity to build their kingdom on earth and rule over the remaining people. </p>

<p>It seems that Revelation 12 gives the answer which date they planned for it to happen. </p>

<p>Jupiter (king) comes from the Leo zodiac sign (House of David) in 2015/2016 and enters the zodiac sign virgo (Virgin) in late 2016 and stays inside her belly for nine month and a half (birth pain) end comes out between her legs. </p>

<p>The sign in Revelation will accure exactly as described on the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZUAlk97B8Ww/Ut0KtVsJ_SI/AAAAAAAAPvk/V2QF_4jn-DM/s1600/September+23+2017+sign+woman+moon+12+stars+tribulation.jpg">23 of September, 2017</a></p>

<p>And No, it doesn&#39;t mean Jesus is comming back (nevertheless  most of the words ascribed to him are true, especially what is said about the pharisees]. The messianic time means a time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0LpQrJDgsw">when Israel is mighty</a> and rules the world.</p>

<p>In Israel they already prepare for this event</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We Jews have known about G-d&#39;s Plan to depopulate the Earth. I remember learning this as a child and I always wondered how it would happen. Now I see it happening right before my very eyes. The Earth will only have 500,000,000 inhabitants. I think many of you know that. One thing to keep in mind is that with fewer people inhabiting the Earth, the Earth will be restored and it will become a paradise. That too is also prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<p>&quot;Watch out! G-d is about to depopulate the land and devastate it; he will turn it upside down and scatter its inhabitants.&quot;</p>

<p>Isaiah 24:1</p>

<p>&quot;Take notice! I&#39;m about to create new heavens and a new earth; the former things won&#39;t be remembered, nor will they come to mind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire Earth was promised to us in the Hebrew Scriptures. Jews interpret these scriptures in different ways. Much of the Hebrew Scriptures contains proclamations by G-d that He will annihilate the &quot;nations&quot; (Gentiles) and give the Earth to His people. I was never taught as a Jew that there would be 500,000,000 people left on Earth. </p>

<p>Now, with regards to 500,000,000 remaining, what alarmed me is that there &quot;respected&quot; prominent scientists who are now pushing this agenda. Why? Who is behind this?</p>

<p>Also, I was alarmed by the article written by Rahm Emanuel&#39;s brother, a doctor, that suggests the notion that people shouldn&#39;t be allowed to live beyond 75 years of age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are viewing the Hebrew Bible from the viewpoint that a supernatural, higher power supposedly inspired these prophesies. For centuries, Orthodox Jews who worship a higher power believed that they had to wait on G-d to fulfill scripture, yet nothing ever happened. The Zionists said &quot;Fuck it. G-d needs help.&quot; So, instead of waiting on G-d they are fulfilling the scriptures themselves.</p>

I actually think the post that kicked this whole thing out is a &quot;shit belief&quot; that needs to be called out. Which is why I&#39;m taking the time to do so. </p>

<p>Let me just say that I&#39;m not an expert in messianic theology or any of that, but I have spent some time thinking about religion, and I&#39;m only taking OP&#39;s evidence at face value. </p>

<p>He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They need to create WW3 and destroy most of humanity.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the text he points to doesn&#39;t say [this]&lt;<a href="http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah%3E">http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah&gt;</a>. Instead it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The objections of these scholars, however, rest principally on the hypothesis that the idea of the Messiah is inseparably bound up with the desire for universal dominion, whereas, in reality, this feature is not a characteristic of the Messianic hope until a later stage of its development. The ideal king to whom Isaiah looks forward will be a scion of the stock of Jesse, on whom will rest the spirit of God as a spirit of wisdom, valor, and religion, and who will rule in the fear of God, his loins girt with righteousness and faithfulness (xi. 1-3a, 5). He will not engage in war or in the conquest of nations; the paraphernalia of war will be destroyed (ix. 4); his sole concern will be to establish justice among his people (ix. 6b; xi. 3b, 4). The fruit of his righteous government will be peace and order throughout the land. The lamb will not dread the wolf, nor will the leopard harm the kid (xi. 8); that is, as the following verse explains, tyranny and violence will no longer be practised on God&#39;s holy mountain, for the land will be full of the knowledge of God as the water covers the sea (comp. xxxii. 1, 2, 16). The people will not aspire to political greatness, but will lead a pastoral life (xxxii. 18, 20). Under such ideal conditions the country can not but prosper, nor need it fear attack from outside nations (ix. 6a, xxxii. 15). The newly risen scion of Jesse will stand forth as a beacon to other nations, and they will come to him for guidance and arbitration (xi. 10). He will rightly be called &quot;Wonderful Counselor,&quot; &quot;Godlike Hero,&quot; &quot;Constant Father,&quot; &quot;Prince of Peace&quot; (ix. 5).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this source is itself 100 years old, so in order to understand the concept of the Messiah you&#39;d probably have to look more closely at the specific books named. </p>

<p>For instance, the Enoch literature rises out of the Seleucid empire dominating Judea, and the Book of Daniel arises from the Babylonian exile. But these are examples when a people was being oppressed! These books they wrote were expressions in response to that. They imagine a different world, one better than the empire that&#39;s affecting them.</p>

<p>Does that mean every idea in these texts is something modern people should believe? Not necessarily; but in that case let&#39;s go through and see what the text actually says. In my view, both of this literature contains VERY powerful stories that could be seen as a treasured part of humanity&#39;s cultural output. I don&#39;t see any reason to start describing these ideas as evil right off the bat. If you disagree, point me towards sections in Enoch, Isaiah or Daniel that you disagree with and let&#39;s talk about it. </p>

<p>I agree there&#39;s a lot in the Hebrew scriptures that&#39;s troubling, and there&#39;s a long religious history responding precisely to the character of YHWH. Gnosticism emerges, for instance, as a critique of that character. And I think a lot of thought working off the Hebrew scriptures would reject some of the ethics embodied in those texts. But they are thousands of years old! They were written to meet the needs of a different people. Yet there is much in them that is timeless, which is why it still speaks to us today. And this is where you have to be fair, and say that EVERY religious tradition, every CULTURE in fact, every single RECORD OF HUMANITY has similar moral lapses. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to condemn all of our ancestors, and I ESPECIALLY don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to single out one specific group of our ancestors to slander as being in particular evil. </p>

<p>And what about the other links? The fact that you have groups of people raising a red heifer. Well, this again is a long and ancient tradition of a particular people, at least according to this evidence. </p>

<p>And what about the Temple Institute that OP linked to? Here is what it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Temple Institute hopes one day to replace the Dome of the Rock with the Third Holy Temple, but not by violent means. Observant Jews pray for that to happen in every daily prayer service, with some awaiting the appearance of the Messiah and others believing that they must act to bring the Messiah closer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing-- there&#39;s a long history of religions laying claims to sacred spots. The churches of Europe are built on the remnants of pagan sites. Temple Mount or the Dome of the Rock is a sacred place to millions of people. It&#39;s of great significance to a huge portion of the world&#39;s community. Is it possible to hope that one day groups will be able to lay claim collectively? I personally hope this is a place that one day all the children of Abraham could be at. As the three religions understand it, they are worshipping the same God. I hope future generations come to see this. </p>

<p>This is where religion is significant, because part of what it&#39;s getting to is the political differences between people. Which are deep and sustained. Religious texts are in some ways memories of the past, of our history. They provide powerful emotional catalysts. For there ever to be peace around these issues, it means that the people involved need to learn to get along. I think the religious symbolism could be a means to accomplish that goal, which to my mind would bring a reduction in human suffering. </p>

<p>This is just the way I read the sources that the OP provided, and try to extract my own interpretation from what I saw as a polemical and flawed interpretation.</p>

<p>We KNOW it doesn&#39;t do good to pick out specific people to hate. There&#39;s a reasons there&#39;s been centuries of pogroms against all sorts of minorities. This is something that I hope people can stand against -- if the kind of thing you value is human decency, honesty, fair and critical thinking. </p>

<p>It&#39;s totally possible that someone would disagree with what I&#39;ve said. I&#39;ve given my own read based on my own ethics and personal beliefs, which may be different than yours. But in any case let&#39;s have a conversation thinking about the sources, exchanging ideas.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;ve committed to a dogma when you have a pre-conception of the world that cannot be overturned. When everything fits into a narrative. This is not how knowledge works; this is not how people learn. I am worried that anti-Semitism as well as Islamophobia is one such dogma that has played a long and awful role in history, and I would like to see that end.</p>

<p>Again that&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t things to criticize about the actions of the State of Israel, or the way aspects of Muslim theology get turned to murderous ends (which is something condemned by many of the religious authorities!). And there&#39;s things to criticize about Christianity, and secular liberalism for that matter, and pretty much any freaking ideology out there. </p>

<p>But criticizing doesn&#39;t mean you have to find a scapegoat to be sacrificed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the very short reply to a good post, I&#39;ll read over what you&#39;ve said again in the morning because my brain can&#39;t process it at this time of night. But what I was saying was more of a general statement of my disapproval for the phrases anti-semitism and islamophobia used because I don&#39;t think they&#39;re productive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. Words like anti-Semitism or Islamophobia or racism or sexism or homophobia can be used as buzzwords or polemical terms that are meant to discredit conversation. This is frustrating. </p>

<p>But what I also think we need to recognize is that there IS persecution of minorities, which at times has included Jews, Muslims, black people, and hundreds of other examples. Europe in particular has a long history of carrying out murder of people of Jewish descent. We absolutely need a word to talk about these things, and recognize that these things happen. If we throw out the concept of anti-Semitism, in my view we blind ourselves to very real aspects of history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well having had &quot;lovely&quot; dinners with an ex&#39;s jewish family, and hearing how they spoke of specific ethnic races.... I&#39;m by far someone who gets offended easily, but I can&#39;t really take their side. Nor do I the muslims or bible bouncers. I do know there are jews who believe Israel shouldn&#39;t be its own state. They were brought up as &quot;lunatics&quot; in convo. Some of the most prejudice views I&#39;ve heard (outside of shock value comedy type shit) and i know those views weren&#39;t just theirs. I know they aren&#39;t the view of all jews but sadly there are people who express shit like &quot;the dirty Palestinians need to be bombed for good&quot; comparing them to roaches, they kind of get grouped into a name and its easiest for people to choose the name the group identifies as. Not saying its right but people freak when they feel threatened man.  Sheeple exist in all sects of society. Blind followers who read up and study 5 percent of what they believe. When majority of a group consists of those people... Well. Funniest thing I learned after reading up on what my ex spouted. Of all the groups that have the most native &quot;Israeli&quot; blood. The Palestinians  </p>
