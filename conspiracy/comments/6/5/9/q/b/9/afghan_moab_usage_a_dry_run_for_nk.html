        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Nothing more than speculating on my part. But I find it curious that we just tested what our largest non nuclear bomb does on &quot;caves and tunnels&quot; in Afghanistan. We know it&#39;s a Air Burst weapon that is designed to cripple surface buildings. Yet we used it in a heavily mountainous region of Afghanistan. We were told this week that NK has placed their device in a mountain tunnel.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your thoughts on this theory?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 14 November 2011, Bloomberg reported that the Air Force Global Strike Command started receiving the Massive Ordnance Penetrator and that the deliveries &quot;will meet requirements for the current operational need&quot;.[14] The Air Force now has received delivery of 16 MOPs as of November 2011.[15]And as of March 2012, there is an &quot;operational stockpile&quot; at Whiteman Air Force Base.[16]</p>

<p>In 2012, the Pentagon requested $82 million to develop greater penetration power for the existing weapon.[1] A 2013 report stated that the development had been a success,[17] and B-2 integration testing began that year.[18]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solution for NK in general? It&#39;s truly hard to say. Toppling government will only make their humanitarian issues worse, in short term. But for the average NORK, removal of Kim and company would be the best long term, I think.  Would allow them to sit at the big boy table after years of isolation. Good mean an economic boom, such as we saw in China in 90s. Very  cheap labor . Depends too if one thinks they have the right to a nuclear weapon. Their insisting on using it for strictly offensive purposes is what bothers me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can fall in line with that assessment. Xi reportedly stated they had little influence over North Korea to Trump. We certainly struck a deal with China, it&#39;s telling with their returned NK coal. If they don&#39;t have much control over them, it explains why they have their army ready to go. I find it hard the top brass will follow through until bombs start dropping though. They need to know they aren&#39;t on the outside and have support to carry through. I also envision their million man army laying down weapons. We have seen Jong Un publicly execute and make examples of his own family that conspired against him. Ruthless against senior officials. China wanted his step brother to replace him, hence his assassination</p>

<p>I do think people believe that these people are completely loyal to Kim&#39;s. </p>

<p>But in reality the army is the only consistent way of producing income and comes with an increased ration of rice to take home to a hungry family. Outside of that there is no incentive. These people are not brainwashed, just know that their and family&#39;s life is at stake if they are publicly outspoken of the regime. A similar aura was around Iraq&#39;s mighty Republican Guard, which when confronted by a true adversary laid down their weapons.</p>

<p>All that said, I do believe that South Korean casualties will be unavoidable. Question is if the shooting starts how many will give up, will determine that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard to determine what the best weapon would be if we don&#39;t know the objective. I read the MOAB was used with intent to destroy the caves and tunnels. Our IC may have Intel that this test may be the final before miniaturization is mastered. If we obstructed their test and data by making the cave inaccessible, that&#39;s a win. </p>

<p>The reason I believe that this is a capability test is the peculiar nature behind it&#39;s usage. Never before used, and using it against a target that is different than its intended designs. Also the notion that the plan has been in the works for months. I&#39;m not sure the bunker buster has the penetrating power to render the NK nuke complex useless. May deal the door shut, but bomb still intact. Where we might have just tested if the MOAB can collapse an entire cave complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2015 article on new bunker buster bomb. </p>

<p><a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-f-35s-new-bunker-buster-super-bomb-12933">http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-f-35s-new-bunker-buster-super-bomb-12933</a></p>

<p>&quot;Like other bunker-buster missiles, such as the gigantic 30,000lb Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), the HVPW is designed to destroy buried targets like underground bunkers and tunnels. However, unlike MOP and traditional bunker-busters, his new kinetic weapon is rammed into the ground like a pile driver instead of being accelerated naturally by gravity. The force with which the HVPW strikes the ground allows it to penetrate underground targets while still being compact enough to be carried on the F-35.&quot;</p>

<p>Guy hypothesizes this is Israel testing out a HVPW in Yemen. Kinda best of both worlds from what I read, a thermobaric kinetic penetrator. I just wonder how deep into a mountain they can make it</p>

<p>&quot;The MOAB is not a penetrator weapon and is primarily intended for soft to medium surface targets covering extended areas and targets in a contained environment such as a deep canyon or within a cave system.&quot;       </p>

<p>&quot;On 13 April 2017, a MOAB was dropped on an ISIS cave complex in Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan.[4] It was the first use of the bomb on the battlefield.&quot;       </p>

<p>We were told this week that NK has placed their device in a mountain tunnel.      </p>

<p>You got a source? I must have missed that.     </p>

<p>You are probably on to something.</p>

<p>CNN which I hate, reports tunnel is &quot;primed and ready&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can tell is ever since that anon post about NK, (albeit as off as it was with the timeframe) everything seems to be steaming towards a US, china intervention. MOAB might&#39;ve been a show of strength as a final deterrent against missile launches. We&#39;ll see I&#39;m running out of popcorn</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mostly it was a show of force, but the MOAB is still effective on caves or tunnels if they&#39;re not too deep or not reinforced.  The effect on tunnels or caves is mostly just a secondary perk due to how big the explosion is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;d use the MOAB to disable NK&#39;s device because they&#39;ll at least have the sense to reinforce the bunker it&#39;s in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see trying to deliver the MOAB ordinance over N.Korea with one two or even three C-130&#39;s being very practical. Even with massive air cover. 
Perhaps on an unsophisticated adversary with no air defenses or fleet of fighter aircraft.</p>
