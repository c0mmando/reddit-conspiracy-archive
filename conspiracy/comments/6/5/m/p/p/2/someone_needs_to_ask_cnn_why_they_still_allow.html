        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alan Dershowitz is professor Emeritus at Harvard Law School.</p>

<p>Mr. Dershowitz defended, on more than one ocassion, convicted rapist and child molester Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>Mr. Dershowitz himself was named as a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought against himself and Mr. Epstein by a 16 year old girl. She alleged that both Mr. Epstein and Mr. Dershowitz raped her on separate ocassions over the course of a stay by Mr. Epstein and Mr. Dershowitz at one of Mr. Epstein&#39;s vacation homes.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rH1vaZXgbd0">...yet Mr. Dershowitz somehow has the balls to make comments like this.</a></p>

<p>Watch that video...and then find a clip of the comments made by Chancellor Sutler in V For Vendetta.</p>

<p>The two sound eerily similar, don&#39;t they?</p>

<p>You know what irks me about these comments by Dershowitz? </p>

<p>In the United States, one need not fight for the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot; to influence public debate in this country. By very definition of the rights our Founding Fathers expressly stated as being inherent to all men (gender encompassing) as endowed to them by their Creatot in nature, no man need &quot;earn&quot; this right....nor can an inherent right be called a privilege.</p>

<p>Mr. Dershowitz is attempting to guilt trip this country into believing that we are anti-semites if we dare speak a word about the inordinate amount of influence held by Zionists (I refuse to call them Jews and I will explain why late in this post).</p>

<p>Mr. Dershowitz wants you to equate anti-semitism and daring to ask why Zionists have such a disproportionate hold over the media, politics, and finances of this country.</p>

<p>Well you know what I say to that?</p>

<p>Fuck him.</p>

<p>See, here&#39;s the thing. There are two groups which primarily comprise modern Judaism:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ashkenazi (88%) (Almost exclusively of Eastern European origin).</p></li>
<li><p>Sephardic (12%) (Almost exclusively of Middle Eastern origin).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You know what&#39;s hilarious?</p>

<p>The Ashkenazi bloodline can be traced back to a single group of ~50 in Eastern Europe around the Middle Ages. Their genetic lineage has, at most, a 10% connection to the Jews / Tribes of Israel of the Bible.</p>

<p>You know whose bloodline is &gt;80% connected to the Jews / Tribes of Israel of the Bible?</p>

<p>The Muslims of Palestine.</p>

<p>Call me crazy....but maybe there is a reason why Israel does not actually want peace with the Palestinians.</p>

<p>Maybe Israel does not want anyone to figure out this inconvenient fact;</p>

<p>Maybe Israel does not want anyone to start questioning why these Zionists who proclaim to be true Jews....are slaughtering those whose blood and genealogy is empirically proves that they are more closely related to Avraham and his children...<strong><em>then those who claim to be Jewish!</em></strong></p>

<p>Maybe Israel wants people to continue buying the narrative of 9/11 and ignore the mountain of evidence which implicates Mossad  as having worked with rogue elements within the U.S. Intelligence Community, the military, all branches of government, the financial sector and the media to carry out a false flag operation as a pre-text for war in the Middle Eaast.</p>

<p>Maybe Israel doesn&#39;t want you to know that they themselves assassinated Yitzak Rabin for...gasp...trying to be a moderate and make peace with the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>Maybe Israel doesn&#39;t want the United States and the rest of the world at large to dig a bit further into how Zionism uses the Torah to cover its ass from the fact that Israel gives great weight to an oral law...The Babylonian Talmud...written in 400 AD. Long after the death of Christ and long after Babylon had come and gone into the annals of history.</p>

<p>Maybe Israel doesn&#39;t want the world at large to see <a href="http://www.talmudunmasked.com/chapter5.htm">what the Talmud says about Christ and Gentiles</a> or that Orthodox Judaism views the state of Israel as heresy and a violation of their covenant with God.</p>

<p>Maybe Israel wants Islam to be the enemy of Gentiles so that we&#39;ll <a href="http://www.talmudunmasked.com/chapter5.htm">forget this was stated by a Zionist in the 1800s</a> and just accept evetuthid as told and hate Islam so that we&#39;ll forget <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam">what Islam says about Christ and how he is revered.</a></p>

<p>Weird, right? The ally of &quot;the Christian nation&quot; tries to hide the fact that its oral law claims that Christ &quot;is in hell boiling in his excrement for eternity.&quot;....and our enemy are the people of a religion which, although in disagreement as to the nature of Christ and his death, fundamentally revere and respect him as a prophet of God.</p>

<p>And damn....isn&#39;t it weird that there is a ton of evidence supporting the claims that Israel and Saudi Arabia secretly worked together, with the help of the CIA, to create ISIS? </p>

<p>But you know what?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also of a people who were long oppressed and, as a result of 800 years of that oppression at the hands of tyrants, many of us were forced to flee our homeland and never return.</p>

<p>The Irish.</p>

<p>It&#39;s  is such a thing called The Irish Diaspora. </p>

<p>And you know what? </p>

<p>When I remove race, religion, and nation-state affiliation from the equation, view wveryone as human, and compare words said versus actions carried out...I suddenly realize that the people I need to fear most aren&#39;t those praying to Mecca five times a day.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the nation which claims to be the true descendants of the Biblical children of Abraham....yet whose bloodline traces back to a tiny group of Eastern Europeans in the Middle Ages, whose genealogy can barely be tired to the biblical children of Abraham.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the nation which claims to be a home state (not the home state....stupid Balfour Declaration) of a religious people....yet they&#39;re run by a Secular government and the U.N. just recently named them an apartheid state.</p>

<p>So....disagree if you want...but here&#39;s how I see it:</p>

<p>Support of Israel and its current government and military establishment absolutely spits in the face of this country&#39;s founding beliefs and principles.</p>

<p>.....and I start thinking to myself &quot;Hmmm...both the Jews and the Irish have both undergone diasporas. Yet those who claim to be Jews are not only barely related in genealogy to the biblical children of Abraham....but the very existence of a home state before the coming of their Messiah is a violation of one of ACTUAL Judaism&#39;s core tenets.&quot;</p>

<p>Shit...it&#39;s almost like the people running this country in the truly meaningful areas...which are disproportionately dominated by one group...want all citizens of the United States, and we of Irish heritage, to forget who we of Irish blood are, where we come from, why we&#39;re here, and what we&#39;ve been through.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because it reflects poorly when your disporadic group has been kicked out of nearly every nation which has taken it in since the Middle Ages....yet another Diasporadic group has managed to get along just fine in every nation which has taken them in from the time they were conquered by England in the 1100s up until they won their freedom in 1921.</p>

<p>To that I say....enough is enough and game on.</p>

<p>You see, my Irish ancestors came to this country at the height of English tyranny and, despite anti-Irish and anti-Catholic sentiment, managed to fight and claw their way up in society and were some of the first non-WASPs to be admitted to Yale....and they became Bonesmen.</p>

<p>Funny, then, how someone related to this family tree married a person whose father was a 33rd degree Free Mason.</p>

<p>....low and behold their son, who looks back on the family history, and realizes that neither parent ever truly understood the significance of a 33rd degree Free Mason on one side and in-laws belonging to Skull &amp; Bones on the other.</p>

<p>I look back at my family history and this is what I see:</p>

<p>Irish-American ancestors who helped build up this country and give us an accepted place in society and a land to take us in when The Famine occurred and we were starved out of our homeland.</p>

<p>Men who fought in every war from WWI through Vietnam....wars which all survived, yet took them far too early in life afterwards due to health complications.</p>

<p>Now, here I am as a young man and what do I see?</p>

<p>The nation which took in my people waging war against nations and people who never attacked us....nations and people whose religion gives more reverence to Christ, whose death and resurrection so many in this country and around the world will celebrate tomorrow, than a false religion called Zionism which masks itself in a truly beautiful religion called Judaism.</p>

<p>So with all due respect Mr. Dershowitz....as much respect as I can give to a man who defended a pedophile and was then himself formally accused of rape, molestation, and pedophilia....</p>

<p>Kiss my freedom loving, truth speaking, red, white and blue, and gree, white and gold, Irish American ass you sanctimonious prick.</p>

<p>Oh... and before anyone dares to call me anti-semitic...let me make one thing ABUNDANTLY clear. The vast majority of the followers of modern Judaism are good, kind hearted people....my ire is directed towards the Zionist government in Israel and those in this country who use positions of influence, power, and wealth to tie us into a death cult alliance with Israel.</p>

<p>How do I know the majority to be good, mind hearted people? Because over the holidays, when life just kept dealing me blow after blow, a man who I once strongly disliked....and who was not so fond of me either...invited me to his Temple to cook for, aerve to, and break bread with homeless persons of my city who relied on the goodness, kindness and generosity of this Temple for that neighborhood in my city.</p>

<p>My issue will never be with anyone&#39;s religion...my issue will always be with words which proclaim one thing and actions which run contrary.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m calling out....and it&#39;s time for everyone else to do so as well.</p>

<p>So maybe now is a good time for some good &#39;ol red pills to be tossed around like jelly beans at Easter.</p>

<p>I think when I&#39;m done sharing what needs to be shared....the House of Windsor will have wished they&#39;d starved all of Ireland.</p>

<p>Those who control the past control the present and those who control both control the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this.  </p>

<p>People should not fear being called an antisemite or a nazi or whatever.  I don&#39;t give a shit any longer.  Israel has no right to exist, holds far too much influence over this country, and uses the holocaust to constantly remind people that you can&#39;t criticize their actions.  Fuck that.  They have destroyed the lives of millions of Palestinians for many decades, and continue their illegal expansion with our tax money.  Israel is a rich country, the fourth largest military in the world, and they can stop sucking us dry.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, <strong>ISRAELI Mossad and the Bush administration did 9/11!!!</strong> Say it every day.  Say it everywhere.  Those guilty still live.  It&#39;s not too late to make those responsible pay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, torture, because that was sanctioned during the Iraq war by people like Cheney and Bush and continued in places like Guantanomo and Abu Graib.  These people destroyed the reputation of all americans, and should suffer the same consequences they inflicted on many others.  Then death of course, but not a quick death.  It should be similar to what others that they had control over suffered.  If this is done, our rulers will think twice about dragging us into illegal, unethical and unnecessary wars again.  They just might start working for the people again.  Will it be ugly?  Yes, but at this point it is necessary.  Everyone else has consequences for their actions.  Our leaders have been without consequences for a very long time, and that is why we are in the fix we are in.  I would gladly volunteer for the anger I still feel over 9/11.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>.....guess whose 33rd degree free mason grandfather lived one town over from the Bush family compound? </p>

<p>Let me put it this way:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>God is real and both he and Allah are one in the same. God is how we humans have long fit the true essence and being into an understandable and relatable concept. In reality, God is truly akin to &quot;The Force&quot; of Star Wars. God/Allah/The Force naturally inclined and calls all living beings to the Light....that which is its essence. There are many extraterrestrial races which serve this side of God/Allah/the Force.....and they know that this planet and solar system were long ago overtaken by extraterrestrial beings who serve the Darkness and have manipulated humanity throughout the ages to do their bidding.</p></li>
<li><p>These extraterrestrials who serve the Light are watching....waiting to intervene....but only when humanity remembers its gift of Free Will, unites as one (or as close as humanly possible), and stands against those humans who, knowingly or unknowingly, serve the extraterrestrials which serve the Darkness. </p></li>
<li><p>Once humans are willing to stand up and fight back, those who serve the Light will intervene and offer the necessary support.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Christ was himself either a fully, living, breathing Pleiadian....or a man who was chosen to have his consciousness divined with the wisdom and knowledge of the Pleiadans....humanoid Extraterrestrials who serve the Light and call &quot;The force of the universe&quot; that which  we call &quot;God The Father&quot;.</p>

<p>No human or human hybrid on this Earth is to be judged for what they&#39;ve done to one another, as we have all done terrible things to each other in this belief that we were alone in the universe and, thus, the end goal was for one to conquer all on this planet.</p>

<p>Love, forgiveness, compassion, understanding, mercy, kindness, charity.</p>

<p>These, coupled with remembering our free will and exercising it to declare ourselves no longer as slaves, are the key by which humanity will collectively unlock the door and have the secrets of our known universe revealed.</p>

<p>Christ is the beginning and the end....but the end is not an end of time. The beginning was humanity&#39;s introduction to this idea of the Universal Force and its inherent nature of the Light....presented to us as God....and the end is proving that we have mastered unity of the concept and are willing to ascend as a peaceful, united species....living in all those aspects of the Light...to join a very galactic community.</p>

<p>And hey, food for thought....</p>

<p>Just because Christ was God&#39;s only begotten son at the time....doesn&#39;t mean that he was to be the only begotten son for all time.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is that which allows us to commune with God The Father....that universal force of creation rooted in the Light...and communicate with those who look out for us and over our shoulder as we walk in the path of Light.</p>

<p>And, quite honestly, I think Mohammad was a messenger of this as well...sent down to correct this notion that only Christ could commune with God because of a confusion over how &quot;God was in man and man was in God&quot;, leading people to believe that Christ was God personified in man and that ONLY Christ could ever be capable of that connection with God / the Light.</p>

<p>Some call us Starseeds, some think of us as Angels....but up until 9 months ago, I was just a dude trying to find his way in the world and a dude who had wandered far off the path of the Light.</p>

<p>....that was until I was &quot;woken up&quot; / &quot;switched on&quot; and pushed into a crazy journey of discovery these past 9 months.</p>

<p>I was not supposed to be born. A son was to be born to my parents before me, but my mother miscarried. Out of tragedy, in their eyes, came Light. One of them is a child of a 33rd degree Freemason and the other is a relative of Bonesmen.</p>

<p>They&#39;re no longer married, but I&#39;ve laid out to both of them what has been happening to me these past 9 months....and it&#39;s as unexplainable to them as it is to me other than to say that nothing which happened was coincidence (took a while to confirm that...).</p>

<p>I met up with my father a couple weeks ago. We had lunch...and it was my first time seeing him in over three years. I told him I forgave him for everything, because we are all flawed, we all fall, but we can all be redeemed by grace, mercy, love and forgiveness. </p>

<p>He said he didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d ever forgive himself for what he did to my mother and our family....and this is what I told him:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an atheist, so I do not believe what you&#39;ve written here about forgiveness etc, but I also do not begrudge anyone who wants to believe in god.  I also do not ascribe to the notion that people will eventually pay for what they&#39;ve done in a hereafter.  People need to pay in this life, this existence for their wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Yet we&#39;ve got the largest population on the face of the earth in a inhumane prison system for profit.  We have a lot of human suffering because those at the top are without consequence for their actions, and as we see today, the entire world could end tomorrow because of these irresponsible and frankly stupid people, are unlimited, unconstrained in any way.</p>

<p>I spent over two weeks trying to find any explanation for Kissinger and Draco other than my immediate thought...which was Kissinger being Earth&#39;s longtime human liaison to the Draco.</p>

<p>My friend, I&#39;ll make this simple.</p>

<p>They exist. Not just the Greys, not just the Reptilians, but many, many species.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll follow up more tomorrow, but ponder this until then.</p>

<p>You can transfer data from a laptop to a cloud drive without a sinker wire connecting you from Point A to Point B.</p>

<p>In essence, while you cannot see the codes bytes of data being transferrred through the ether, you know that it works because you see your files appear at the terminus point.</p>

<p>What are we then? Where does our consciousness...that which makes us self aware but also gives us individuality, uniqueness and personality come from?</p>

<p>That which makes you more than a self aware, organic AI is the individual consciousness divined onto you as your spirit.</p>

<p>😇 And this 👽? Same thing....just replace the Greu with something a bit more friendly like a Nordic, Pleiadian or Lyran.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>....yet little does he know that some of us are ready to push back.</p>

<p>I wonder how Mr. Dershowitz and The Deep State would react if someone could corroborate all that&#39;s been alleged by Corey Goode and William Thompkins regarding extraterrestrials...both good and bad...and the U.S. Navy&#39;s Secret Space Program.</p>

<p>Maybe it would start to shed some light on why the Office of Naval Intelligence was the specific target at the Pentagon on 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t have the land for 3,000 fucking years.</p>

<p>Oh but look, I&#39;m a Jew hater because how dare I question the actions of a nation which claims to be &quot;a&quot; homeland....not &quot;the&quot; homeland...for 20,000,000 people out of 7,500,000,000.</p>

<p>But this is what your people have always done, right?</p>

<p>Take advantage of good graces, demand more and more, ask a country to fight battles on your behalf, and then get kicked to the curb when everyone tires of your shit.</p>

<p>Hell, I&#39;m not a &quot;organized religion&quot; guy....but you all did it with the crucifixion of Christ!</p>

<p>Pontus Pilate said of Christ, &quot;I see nothing wrong with this man; I release him to you.&quot; </p>

<p>And what did the crowd say back?</p>

<p>&quot;Our laws forbid us from killing him!&quot;</p>

<p>You all literally twisted the arm of Pomtius Pilate into killing Christ by saying &quot;Well <strong><em>we</em></strong>cant do it because of our laws, but if <strong><em>you</em></strong> don&#39;t, then you&#39;re accepting him as greater than Caesar and you&#39;re a traitor to Rome!&quot;</p>

<p>And you know what? While your people were kissing the Royal Family&#39;s ass in the 1800s to get back a land you hadn&#39;t occupied for years, you were plenty fine with them starving my people to death in Ireland!</p>

<p>What did my people do?</p>

<p>They nary raised a complaint....they just went to the United States and busted their asses through honest, hard work and built up this country on the East Coast. There&#39;s a reason why there are poems and songs about &quot;When New York was Irish&quot;. </p>

<p>So then comes along WWII....and who baile your assses out from the Holocaust? The United States....the majority of whose soldiers were second generation Irish and Italian Catholic immigrants.</p>

<p>How did your people repay us?</p>

<p>You come here and run the banks, charging interest on us and making us debt slaves.</p>

<p>You take over the media and push your agenda.</p>

<p>You put Mossad agents and moles in nearly every corner of the U.S. Military and the USIC.</p>

<p>And now you&#39;re helping a traitorous and co-opted CIA run heroin out of Afghanistan and to....the descendants of Irish immigrants in America&#39;s heartland, WHO LOST THEIR FUCKING JOBS WHEN YOU ALL COOKED UP THE MERGER AND ACQUISITION CRAZE OF THE 1980s, and you&#39;re now killing them off with a crippling heroin addiction because they&#39;ve lost all hope.</p>

<p>So maybe....just maybe....after 3,000 years of taking advantage of anyone who shows you good graces....we&#39;re all getting real sick of your shit.</p>

<p>Find me a Zionist who emigrated to America post-WWI and had a career of honest manual labor or something of honest creation....and not a doctor, lawyer, banker or media mogul....and I&#39;ll sell you some fine ocean front property in Bozeman, Montana.</p>

<p>My mother lost her father as a kid because he fought to liberate your people.</p>

<p>Her brother fought in Vietnam...a war based in a pure fictitious attack in the Gulf of Tonkin...and it destroyed him. Who pushed for that War? That fat fucking Zionist prick named Henry Kissinger. My uncle died before he was 60 because Kissinger decided that the United States could be the geopolitical puppet for Israel&#39;s long term goals.</p>

<p>So you know what?</p>

<p>Fuck off. I&#39;ve got 3,000 years of history on my side....and I&#39;m a Socialist Liberal who spent over 10 years working for the Democratic Party at all levels and I nearly joined the CIA out of college.</p>

<p>I neither hate nor dislike the Jewish people....but the state of Israel? All it has done to the United States is undercut and undermine the freedom, liberty and inherent rights our founding fathers fought for. Israel has done this by buying off anyone and everyone who sought self interest and power over the benefit of all.</p>

<p>Now, let me ask you this:</p>

<p>Do you want to tell the world about what Baal / Moloch truly is? </p>

<p>....because repetition of a theme through history across multiple cultures separate by both time and distance isn&#39;t a coincidence.</p>

<p>Draco. And if you&#39;re truly in the know about the end goals of the Zionist death cult...then you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Also, care to explain the Martian Scientists of Hungary?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know anything about those two things above....then you truly do not understand what is actually carried out by your professed faith as opposed to, and in contradiction of, what you tell us Gentiles is written in scripture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again....I really don&#39;t give a flying fuck.</p>

<p>20,000,000 of you world wide and, from a nation that&#39;s smaller than the state of New Jersey, your people have done nothing but bring continuous war and violence for over 75 years.</p>

<p>See, you&#39;re not going to win with me on this or change my mind. Why? Because I&#39;ve seen the generosity and kindness extended to your people in their darkest hour of need....and I&#39;ve seen how it was repaid in the time since.</p>

<p>A bunch of put options placed against United Airlines and American Airlines stock to plummet on 9/11?</p>

<p>Geez...must have been Al-Qaedq using that sweet, sweet insider information from the caves of Torah Borah in Afghanistan! No way it was the sweet, little Ashkenazi angels who run Wall Street!</p>

<p>A bunch of Mossad operatives cheering as they film the planes crashing into the twin towers....while driving a truck with a mural painting of a plane flying into the towers? God damn! Al-awards really thought ahead on that one!</p>

<p>A bunch of Israeli &quot;art students&quot; getting a construction permit to wok on empty, upper floors of each tower....with boxes of explosives and fuses visible in a souvenir photo? Shit! Al-Qaeda must have figured out how to clone people or they found Jihadis so dedicated that they were willing to bleach their skin!</p>

<p>Again, piss off.</p>

<p>By the way, tell your Whore of Babylon (Queen Elizabeth...the Cannibal and Bride of Moloch) that history has not fully wiped clean General Cornwallis&#39; warning and admission of &quot;the holy war to come&quot; when he surrendered at Yorktown... </p>

<p>They are a breed of people with such repulsive behavior that the non-jews imagination can&#39;t even comprehend it, non-jews can&#39;t imagine that something as disgusting as the jew exist because they could not in their most evil fantasy behave how the jew behave.</p>

<p>They have one motivation in life; sucking energy out of hard working people. They are the origin of what has become tales of vampires, they are the literal vampire, sucking you dry with their banking system and fractional reserve banking, they suck you dry with interest, but just enough so you can still live and serve the jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical misinformation. Jews were the ONLY minority in Christendom during this period. Muslims, Hindus, Christian heretics etc were BANNED. There were various crusades against Muslims, pagans &amp; heretical Christians (Cathars etc).  Occasionally due to religious fanaticism etc the status of  Jews reverted to the same applied to other non-Catholics. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to argue against Jewish morality when it forms the basis of Christian morality. </p>
