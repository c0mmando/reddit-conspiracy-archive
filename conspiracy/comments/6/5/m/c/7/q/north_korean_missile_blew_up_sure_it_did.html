    <div class="md"><p>i dont know if you appreciate how difficult rocket science is.  seriously, this is not east stuff.  its not as easy as putting some stuff in a metal tube and lighting a fuse.  its really no surprise they have had so many failures considering they are working with inferior circumstances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually do. I&#39;ve been building flying model rockets all my life. And those are the simple, but there is still 2/10 misfires, not even talking about staging, or the serious liquid propellant builds. First, it&#39;s funny I didn&#39;t think about that, you&#39;re absolutely right. In my defense, I assumed they were aren&#39;t creating from whole cloth. Either buying old SCUD tech, or getting help from the Chinese or Russians. I still think it is highly believable the US is &#39;helping&#39;, but you are absolutely correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly i think they are trying to create missiles with a longer range from whole cloth.  if anyone were caught selling long range missile tech to them it would be a huge round of sanctions for them.  and you could probably tell where the missile originated just by inspecting the design, so the norks are pretty much on their own on this one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. Simple rockets fail all the time, sophisticated rockets would be infinitely worse. And fyi the kind of model rockets I&#39;m talking about are not the ones you are probably thinking of. They are much more complex than the estes bottle rocket type. They are 20ft tall with launch platforms and complex hand built propulsion and recovery systems, although still no guidance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s be realistic for a minute. There&#39;s a population brainwashed to believe that he&#39;s a god. They&#39;d die for the smurf. We want to believe they are just normal people, but nearly all are ignorant to anything else, and it might just be the only answer. When you have a dog that only attacks people and won&#39;t be a normal nice dog, sometimes euthanasia is the only choice to prevent more harm. I&#39;m not sure what the best choice is, but saying they don&#39;t deserve that when they want death for you and all other free nations is crazy too in some ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I appreciate your response. Well said, and the kind of civil discussion I really dig. Good on you for not being a dick even though we don&#39;t necessarily agree. </p>

<p>Second, I absolutely see where you are coming from, and it is a valid point. My personal view is this; those people would only kill you or I because they&#39;ve been brainwashed to do such. They are ignorant through no fault of their own. And they are manipulated by fear, torture, and rations being withheld. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m getting at (and my apologies if I sound like a hippy), but I really do appreciate, respect,, and love all forms of life, and my argument would be that these folks, as human beings, deserve the opportunity to really live. They&#39;ve unknowingly been robbed of the two greatest things about being a human; free thought &amp; free will. </p>

<p>All that being said; it is an absolute clusterfuck, and the only thing I&#39;m sure of is that neither of our views are the way to handle it. We can&#39;t &quot;save&quot; everyone there, nor can we just kill everyone there. </p>

<p>Light and love to you, friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is to do a massive psychological operation. First seeing the leader dead and bleeding would show he&#39;s not invincible and shatter some views. That&#39;s enemy #1. Some of the generals and whatnot, some might have to be killed, but many could be captured and put on trial. Now for the more innocent people--they for the most part would not take kindly to their lives changing, albeit for the better, but showing them the truth and helping them would bring about change. Look at Germany--not all stayed deluded from Nazi beliefs forever, even thought some still support it.  </p>
