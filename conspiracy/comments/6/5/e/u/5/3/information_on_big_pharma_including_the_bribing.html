          One of the world's leading experts in child development, Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan: "ADHD is an invention. Every child who's not doing well in school is sent to see a pediatrician, and the pediatrician says: "It's ADHD; here's Ritalin." In fact, 90 percent of these 5.4 million kids don't have an abnormal dopamine metabolism. The problem is, if a drug is available to doctors, they'll make the corresponding diagnosis."

          In Guilty Plea, OxyContin Maker to Pay $600 Million. The company that makes the narcotic painkiller OxyContin and three current and former executives pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused.  Company sales officials were allowed to draw their own fake scientific charts which showed a lower addictive potential, which they then distributed to doctors.

          About 128,000 people die from drugs prescribed to them [in the US per year.] This makes prescription drugs a major health risk, ranking 4th with stroke as a leading cause of death. The European Commission estimates that adverse reactions from prescription drugs cause 200,000 deaths; so together, about 328,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe die from prescription drugs each year.

          Though research does not support the use of antidepressants in children this young, medication of preschoolers, often off label, is on the rise. One child psychologist told me about a conference he attended where he met frustrated drug-industry representatives. “They want to give these kids medicines, but we can’t figure out the diagnoses.” As Daniel Klein warns, “Right now the problem may be underdiagnosis, but these things can flip completely.”

          80 percent of the drugs approved for sale in 2008 had trials in foreign countries, and 78 percent of all subjects who participated in clinical trials were enrolled at foreign sites...The FDA was often unaware of foreign clinical trials as they were being conducted. As a result, federal regulators have no ability to ensure that patients in these trials are being protected while the research is continuing...The report “highlights a very frightening and appalling situation,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut. “By pursuing clinical trials in foreign countries with lower standards and where F.D.A. lacks oversight, the industry is seeking the path of least resistance toward lower costs and higher profits to the detriment of public health.”...“I think this report just confirms the potential problems with foreign trials,” said Dr. Adil E. Shamoo, editor in chief of Accountability in Research, a journal about research ethics. “There is less liability, patient recruitment is far easier, the concept of informed consent is not well established, and it’s cheaper.”

       I know people who worked in pharm marketing and sales. It's pretty much understood that pharm industry is evil as fuck.

      <p>
       Basically imagine taking high profile doctors to $10,000 dinners and convincing them that your medicine is actually the best one and "did you know it's malpractice if your patient complains about X and you don't offer this medication?"
