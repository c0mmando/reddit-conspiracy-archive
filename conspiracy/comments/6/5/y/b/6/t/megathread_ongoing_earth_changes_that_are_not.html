<p>What is going on with Syria? I think we are all being distracted. The response letter from Vladimir Putin -</p>

<p>(<a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54241">http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54241</a>)</p>

<p>Still sticks to its guns with references to international law and UN related rhetoric. Who controls the UN? <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/02/26/the-united-nations-exposed-who-is-in-control/">http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/02/26/the-united-nations-exposed-who-is-in-control/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://anonymousphysicist.com/the-north-korean-psyop/">http://anonymousphysicist.com/the-north-korean-psyop/</a></p>

<p>Is it a psy-op? Are we experiencing yet another well planned distraction.. (as insane as that sounds, and as insane as N.Korea really seems)</p>

<p>The map of the UN is..interesting -</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/_images/azimuthal_equidistant_projection.png">http://docs.qgis.org/2.0/en/_images/azimuthal_equidistant_projection.png</a></p>

<p>It is an equidistant azimuthal projection. Which is a highly accurate map and one that I believe an accurate geometrical map.  One of Mercators early maps supposedly copied from older geometric maps is beautiful and extremely accurate.. it makes the earth look hollow? - <a href="https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/">https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6766/view/1/1/</a>. It is a beautiful map.</p>

<p>You may notice Antarctica in that map, and the azimuth projection.</p>

<p>What is going on there? Why is/was Lockheed Martin the leading contractor there? Who are &quot;Leidos,&quot; ? <a href="http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/leidos.html">http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/leidos.html</a></p>

<p>Was the United States of America the victim of a coup many moons again that installed a pseudo government in power via Washington? There are 2 United States, one formed in 1787, the collection of the several sovereign states of the union, and another separate and different one formed in 1871, which only controls the District of Columbia and it’s territories.</p>

<p>I will continue to post until I feel there is a change of &quot;pace,&quot; and everything slows down... but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s going to happen anytime soon. I don&#39;t feel that I am the only one who has suddenly become &quot;awake,&quot; at something not being quite right at the moment in the world, whether it being a local change I can see or a global change as detailed below.</p>

<p>Please check my older threads for information from end of November 2016 onward.. I have run out of characters because there is just so much shit going on.</p>

<p>Apologies if you have read most of this already.. but just check on the recent updates at the bottom to see that whatever is going on is a global phenomenon and not something to turn your nose up at... and it&#39;s not stopping.</p>

<p>First.. read this - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events">https://web.archive.org/web/20170113094903/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/10/13/executive-order-coordinating-efforts-prepare-nation-space-weather-events</a></p>

<p>Regardless what you think, this Order is worded very seriously and encompasses a huge amount of resources in only a short release. It was released rather quickly and;</p>

<p>&quot;But the order bypassed the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), the interstate grid security monitor, which has been developing solar storm protections for the grid since 2012.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a surprise to us,&quot; said Gerry Cauley, NERC president and CEO.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxaM7BWb4Lw</a></p>

<p>What is the Schumann Resonance? Why is it increasing?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/">http://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/consciousness/what-does-the-spike-in-the-schumann-resonance-mean/</a></p>

<p>&quot;On January 31, 2017, for the first time in recorded history, the Schumann resonance reached frequencies of 36+ Hz. It was considered an anomaly when in 2014 this frequency rose from its usual 7.83 Hz to somewhere in the 15-25 Hz levels—so a jump from 7.83 Hz to 36+ Hz is a big deal. That’s more than a five-fold increase in resonant frequency levels. What does this mean to us as inhabitants of Mother Earth? According to neuroscience, frequency recordings of 36+ Hz in the human brain are more associated with a stressed nervous system than a relaxed and healthy one.&quot;</p>

<p>Information on the &quot;Earth Wobble,&quot;.. or pole shift etc. Whatever you want to call it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html">http://www.wizaurad.com/axis-drift.html</a></p>

<p>We are wobbling on our axis, which will obviously have consequences on the earth.. if you notice in that plot diagram that the latter half of 2016 looks much more.. extreme. The Earth Wobbling is natural my only correlation in this is that where the graph gets more extreme is where I feel the world has started to respond at a similar pace.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? I don&#39;t know. So many different things at once, so many theories and facts to digest and dispute.. so much fake information, shit sources!</p>

<p>The URL is unfortunate but the links are solid and the information can be checked.</p>

<p>For Earth Changes (weather,seismic,volcanic) I started posting around November.. because November is when I started to become &quot;awake,&quot; that there is something not quite right with our planet at the moment and it is behaving abnormally.</p>

<p>Why do I say this? Most articles state that scientists are &quot;perplexed,&quot; or &quot;puzzled,&quot; at things that are happening.</p>

<p>FYI - All information is from watchers.news, an invaluable resource which is unopinionated and deals in facts. They reference various local institutions.. obviously depending on what the earth change is.</p>

<p>(I have cut content from older posts, please see those for additional information)</p>

<p>OKAY...</p>

<p>STILL WITH ME?</p>

<p>Going to pre-face December with some quick facts about Earthquakes.. because most of you will be saying &quot;volcanoes and earthquakes happen all the time.&quot; and you&#39;d be RIGHT! they do..</p>

<p>but; There have been 257 earthquakes over magnitude 5 and many more very close to this number. Just to put this into perspective on average there is an estimated 3.6 earthquakes of a magnitude of 5-5.9 a day, in the last 9 days there have been an average of 24.8 nearly 7 times what is usual. It is estimated there is a 6-6.9 magnitude earthquake every 3 days, we have had 2.6 a day for the last 9 days. Lastly for the big earthquakes of magnitude 7-7.9 you usually get 1 every 25 days (estimate) there have been an average of 1 a day for the last 9 days. (Stats from End of Dec.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/">http://www.anonews.co/257-earthquakes-9days/</a></p>

<p>This is also referencing a cosmic energy wave, which is also being attributed (mostly on youtube unfortunately.. but nothing [mainstream] is talking about this) a helium gas cloud which we have entered bringing in higher H3,H4 into our atmosphere.
does anybody know what a brown dwarf star is made of????? (HELIUM)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you referring to the Schumann Resonance? I have been following it as well but my sources aren&#39;t that great. One is in Russia that is far away from my location. (This one was also down for a few days after spiking almost non-stop, and then portrayed suspiciously normal levels after it was back up and running) The other is heart math (I think?) but the data is always like 2 days behind for me. The Russian one is live so that&#39;s the one I&#39;ve been relying on. Could you link to where you get these measurements from? </p>

<p>I think they&#39;re trying to bait North Korea into attacking. My belief is that Kim Jong Un is more moderate than portrayed, and will in time open up North Korea to increased trade. Further, the concern is that they will sell nuclear and missile tech, and it&#39;s alleged they already do.</p>

<p>Their concern is that he may position himself as a purveyor of nuclear weapons tech for the next 40+ years.</p>
