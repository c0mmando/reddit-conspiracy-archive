<p>I have been searching this topic daily and each day a new article is coming out with the scientific studies of th catastrophic potential we are heading towards.</p>

<p>Help spread the awareness, especially if you have friends or family along the coast as most likely in 3-5 years they will have to move. Where will they go? There will be millions impacted. Where will they go?</p>

<p>Each 3 inches the sea rises is a half a mile of flooded coastline. Hundreds of millions live along the first half mile of coast in our world. Where will they go?</p>

<p>I take it you&#39;ve never driven through the midwest</p>

<p>Space isn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s getting people to give up their land that will be the issue if this comes to fruition. Great way for TPTB to take what little control landowners have away from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rising sea levels mean rising water table. Rivers will flood also. Flat open plains will be swamps. Rising sea level is just one problem. </p>

<p>The fraking and deforestation has released other gasses into the air and altered the jet stream. Inland and other areas will be altered in climate. We are warming, so more deserts will be popping up in the plains and the area along the Mississippi and great lakes will flood. It will be like Egypt there. </p>

<p>This is why I&#39;m putting this awareness out there. We have polluted, drilled, fra, defrosted. Just the toxic waste from slaughtered cattle is so massive the earth would of responded. But all these other factors are just amplifying the earth s response. The earth wants to survive, look how we kill it. It will fight back to survive. Think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another point I will make also before I go out for the day, all of the millions of people will be showing up on your doorstep. If you live in an elevAted area or any place safe from the flooding then that&#39;s where everyone will go.  We still have time to prepare and we still have time to organize, but not much.</p>

<p>Do not listen to government propaganda saying this is not as dangerous as it seems. They would rather wait until the devastation is upon us then herd us around. They have already prepared themselves for this so fuck them. They have underground bunkers/luxery suites in mountains for any kind of disaster. We don&#39;t. Start looking at your neighbors in the vein of cooperation. What can each of us do to make this less traumatic than it will be? You know we can&#39;t keep slaughtering animals like this and burning fuel like this, and polluting the world. We have to make drastic changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so science isn&#39;t enough. How about that it&#39;s already happening not just some wave that comes in five years all of a sudden? You will be one of the ones kicking and screaming when this really gets bad.</p>

<p>You probably think I&#39;m just some gullible idiot on the corner with a sign of an approaching doom. But It&#39;s already approached. It&#39;s already rising fast. And getting faster while you focus on its comparison to the arrests of the elite!  C&#39;mon bro, that type of attitude delays our preparedness. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s already happening and by 3-5 years from now it will have happened a lot more. You aren&#39;t even close to being ready if you are playing it off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just science. I have channeled info going back years warning that our most probable course , or the timeline we are creating involves major earth changes. I can give a damn about the science myself, I already have detailed info on what&#39;s going to happen. But if you don&#39;t like science you probably won&#39;t like channeled info but the writing is all over the walls.</p>

<p>But anyway here is another link for everyone to have a problem with. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the purest and least distorted channels. I have invested a monumental amount of time studying channeling. Elias is an actual energy exchange. I call it channeling because it&#39;s a familiar term. This is an energy exchange. The difference is in an energy exchange the personalities exchange positions. So you get a less distorted flow of info because it&#39;s more direct to its source. A channeling goes through layers of energy and specifically through the channelers own beliefs which clouds the info. </p>

<p>The only two I have come across that do an actual energy exchange is Seth through Jane Roberts. And Elias through Mary Ennis. Nobody knows about Elias. It&#39;s a more technical and detailed source of info about reality creation, highly specialized. </p>

<p>Now Elias began telling our small forum what&#39;s going to happen. Elias has been warning us for years. Lots of info just on this subject in many of the sessions lately as the awareness is starting to become more apparent that this is upon us now. I am not writing this and making these threads for my own amusement. I am doing this because people are in Denial.</p>

<p>Wait... so you can believe the physicists when they say that water vapour is a greenhouse gas, but not when they say that CO<sup>2</sup> is a greenhouse gas?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve carried out experiments with CO<sup>2</sup> and thus know it doesn&#39;t act as a greenhouse gas? Care to explain what you did?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If water vapor is a green house gas</p>

<p>You just said it was. You do realise that clouds are essentially condensed water vapour, right? That&#39;s how they trap heat.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I oh see... you&#39;re talking about chemtrails. Did you know that clouds also block sunlight from reaching the ground in the first place? That&#39;s why cloudy days are usually colder than sunny days. There is a strong argument to be made that &quot;chemtrails&quot; are actually an attempt to keep the earth cooler despite rising GHG concentrations.</p>

<p>A good example of this is the fact the temperatures of North America actually rose a few degrees when all air traffic was grounded after 9/11.</p>

<p>It may very well be that there is a massive secret attempt to mitigate the effects of global warming via the use of &quot;chemtrails&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with your last statement about chemtrails knowing full well how conspiracy theorist that sounds. Though, parts of our gov and military are aware of this and do try and block outt the sun to lower the temp a few degrees. The irony is they are using an airplane, a total air pollutant, to help mask the effect of one of the components of the warm: fuel emissions.</p>

<p>You could probably make an argument our leaders are insane. </p>
