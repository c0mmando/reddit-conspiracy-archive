       my initial thoughts (i sometimes read it but not that much) of scanning their websites / articles (appreciate diff columnists can have diff views):
      </p>
      <p>
       1) they point the finger at Israel / Mossad etc (something that Breitbart / Infowars dont do)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) they are critical of both Trump and Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       3) they do seem to flip flop on some things (e.g. their position on Flynn - but keep in mind that i dont religiously read them &amp; this is just my view after reading a few Flynn articles)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) hits out at Alex Jones / Breitbard
      </p>
      <p>
       5) hits out at "fake news" such as pizzagate &amp; email scandal (???)
      </p>
      <p>
       6) does seem to have a positive view on Russia (claims sources etc...but then again with Russia standing up for Syria / NK / Iran vs Israel cant help but be pro Russia if youre anti Israel influence)
      </p>
      <p>
       7) they see ISIS for the false flag creation that they are (from what i gather)
      </p>
      <p>
       8) i haven't noticed anything glaring crazy on their site (gay frogs, flat earth, inter dimensional vampires)
      </p>
      <p>
       if my above assumptions are correct why doesn't this website have a greater following in the conspiracy realm?
      </p>
      <p>
       i understand it might be "too real" for Trump supporters (of which i used to be a passionate one but now sort of just hoping he keeps to his campaign promises of no world police etc) but otherwise it doesnt seem like a "limited hangout" etc type of place.
      </p>
      <p>
       i dont think i see it at all here.

       apologies, i guess this is a bit of a META post (perhaps mod can flair it as such?) but thought its still relevant to this sub. they do seem to have some good articles and dont seem to be too in bed with anyone in administration.

       vt is pretty good.  i spotlight mike Harris.   the radio program he does is always entertaining.   you can find him on revolution radio.  where he does his own thing.   they are independent with funding and ownership.

       The first I heard of them they described in great detail how suited men had been ushered in and ordered that a group of  US soldiers start the famous oil well fires at the beginning of the Gulf War in 1991. The account was quite detailed and had the ring of truth and I have no qualms about listening when they speak.

       i always see it when people discuss Alex Jones and his credibility. e.g:
      </p>
      <p>
       "he is limited hangout. he talks about CIA surveillance sure, but then makes all of us seem crazy by talking about them putting chemicals in water that turns frogs gay"
      </p>
      <p>
       i think there def was some reporting by him of it and funnily enough i think later research has turned up that certain chemicals (estrogen etc) do alter behavior of frogs funnily enough.

       whats their disinfo about it? i had a brief look at their 9/11 section and they def say its a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       in other parts of their website that ive been reading today they have no issue pointing the finger at Israel / Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       are they going for the "crazy method" approach (e.g. holograms) which discredits the "truthful" element of who did it (mossad/cia etc)?

       you know you could have already zero'ed in on exactly what their disinfo is instead of this silly back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       infact it was easier for me to google veteranstoday + 9/11 disinfo on google than talking to you / looking at their past articles to get to this:

       question is, who do you trust more:
      </p>
      <p>
       source a) which says 9/11 was controlled demolition...orchestrated by THE VATICAN &amp; JESUITS
      </p>
      <p>
       or source b) which says that 9/11 was hologram planes &amp; mini nukes...orchestrated by Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       answer is that you don't trust anyone and read multiple sources and get multiple views on things and make your mind up yourself.

       Yea, I was down with some of VT's stuff at first until I saw them pushing the whole "nuke" narrative. And then read a bunch of the guys split off and started veteran news network or someshit. I feel like every site is limited hangout, because any real site wouldn't exist if it had all the truth....they be dead already.

       They're closer to the truth than just about anyone else. Alex Jones is clearly controlled opposition, Noam Chomsky doesn't touch the topic, and anyone credible will point to Mossad taking care of the specifics and the neo cons maintaining plausible deniability throughout, with a cover up after the fact. That's my opinion though

       It depends which article/author you're talking about, but they generally say 9/11 was a false flag, controlled demolition, with Mossad involvement. Seems pretty legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do sometimes call it a mini-nuclear attack, which in my opinion is disinfo. For example, the Khazarian mafia piece is very interesting, but it mentions the mini-nuke theory and that tends to make people skeptical of the entire piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be some evidence of nukes, the presence of certain isotopes and persistent heat from the wreckage. But in general I think the theory is disinfo. The question would be if they actually believe it, are knowingly spreading disinfo, or are spreading disinfo as cover (e.g. the lizard people so you seem crazy theory).

       Why do you think it's called "ground zero"? Mini nukes are just as plausible as traditional demolition explosives. Nearly everyone involved in the cleanup is getting cancer as well. Asbestos will do that but so will radiation, I would imagine.

       do you mind expanding on the "outing" of Gordon Duff? they seem to have a whole section devoted to him under investigations (the Gordon Duff files) and the most recent ones seem to be devoted to the Gas Attack in syria being faked.

       Yeah, positions vary wildly depending on the author. Which I think is good, it means they're not pushing a narrative and giving alternative viewpoints a voice. But it also means you have to consider each author and article on its own merit.

       It's gone off the rails on any number of issues and had a lot of infighting and accusations that became public between two of the people that originally managed it that laid it low and damaged it's credibility, as I recall.

       The site get's referred to most often on other sites like "Beforeitsnews" that really is a mixed bag of both genuine stories and events along with a lot of really off the wall shit like end times prophesy, aliens, and near death experiences, etc. that are always to found on their roster along with them in no particular order or one that constantly shifts and shuffles them around. A time waster, when you have time to waste and see what's going on in the outermost fringes and gets more traffic than VT, I'll wager, that places it in the same category.

       Yea, I was down with some of VT's stuff at first until I saw them pushing the whole "nuke" narrative. And then read a bunch of the guys split off and started veteran news network or someshit. I feel like every site is limited hangout, because any real site wouldn't exist if it had all the truth....they be dead already.
