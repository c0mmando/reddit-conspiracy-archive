       This is from his post attack interview:
      </p>
      <p>
       "…I was very cautious in saying any opinion regarding him before he became President and after. I always say let’s see what he’s going to do, we wouldn’t comment on statements. So, actually, this is the first proof that it’s not about the President in the United State; it’s about the regime and the deep state or the deep regime in the United States is still the same, it doesn’t change. The President is only one of the performers on their theatre, if he wants to be a leader, he cannot, because as some say he wanted to be a leader, Trump wanted to be a leader, but every President there, if he wants to be a real leader, later he’s going to eat his words, swallow his pride if he has pride at all, and make a 180 degree U-turn, otherwise he would pay the price politically”.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world probably knows who's really in control. Trump didn't reverse on any policies, he just learned his place like a good little boy. That's why every president is essentially the same as the last one. There is no left or right, democrat or republican. It's all an illusion to make you feel like you have a choice.

       Well, for all intents and purposes, Putin is a one man Deep State. He knows where the bodies are buried, because he's probably buried a few. I don't think he's up at night worried about his own intellignece agencies. I think they are an extension of him. A truly well oiled machine. And Putin and the FSB/KGB are apparently the anti-globalists, so that makes the game more exciting.

       I think they are specifically not anti US. They are against the US/UN/NATO global alliance that seems like it's always either working to squeeze Russia out of Europe, or destabilize Russia's middle eastern neighbors like Iran/Iraq/Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's generally easier to guess Putin's intentions as he's pretty overt in his speeches and actions, and he's been at the helm of Russia for 17 years now, so he's been able to play the long game, and he's been pretty consistent in his goals.

       The US imprisons more people per head of population than any other country on earth, including North Korea. In prison, they are treated as slave labour, making consumer products while law-abiding Americans are unemployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is 31 on the list of nations ranked by life expectancy, behind nations like Greece and Slovenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the world's richest nation, 13% live in poverty with over 600,000 homeless people wandering the streets. 44% of those homeless people are employed in some capacity. Recent census data suggests half of the American population qualifies as poor or low income.
      </p>
      <p>
       In June 2016, the IMF warned the nation that spends 600 billion dollars a year on its military that poverty needed to be tackled urgently by raising the minimum and offering paid maternity leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that the US could use some pity.

       I've been shaking people for years just to watch them fall back asleep. I've realized most of the population really legitimately does not care. They need a hard eye opener unfortunately. I believe most of the world know it's not the American people that are bad. We are how we are because of our system.

       Americans are terrible for it. They actually believe that their country is the greatest place to live with the highest standard of living and there couldn't possibly be anywhere better. I love it when I get to tell them how I live, what I do for a living and how much I make. Not for sadistic pleasure but for awakening.

       Yeah mate. Not here to brag but that's what it is. No bullshit "socially compulsory" student debt. Just good honest hard work for good pay to pay for a good honest life. That's living. Australia by the way. 3 cities out of 8 all up in the top ten highest standard of living cities in the world. We don't get shot when we go shopping and our politicians, while maybe retarded, are not ACTUALLY retarded.

       Classic. So history from 200 years ago is still relevant is it? If Australia is still a prison then I think you guys need to fucking stop using slaves ya racist cunts. And yes we are freer. You paid off those student loans from when you went to college to pursue those diplomas that aren't in any way relevant to your day job yet?

       Mike Myers said in his book, Canada, that Americans invented and then  weaponized the film industry.  I thought this a particularly astute conclusion and even we, who were born and live here, have false notions about what living here is really like because of it, especially while we're young.  America is very good at presenting an idealized image of itself via its entertainment industry.

       There's nothing wrong with a little product placement. Problem arises whenever you make a war movie, you have to make the US look good otherwise they wouldn't let you film their stuff or use their uniforms

       Yes many countries are MUCH better in this respect. You're not a 'red pill' if you believe in the 'hordes of refugees'. 
I live in Denmark, if you listen to the MSM we're practically turning completely muslim. Which is non-sense, and the 'problem' is not a problem at all actually, there are minor issues.

       what a moronic statement, the united states has a massive population of people who are specifically weary of government and literally want to keep giant assault rifles to protect themselves from it and essentially insurrect if it ever gets out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       want to show me where else in the world that sort of skepticism of their politicians exists? oh wait you can't? because it doesn't? that's right. because this is a mindblowingly stupid statement you're making.
      </p>
      <p>
       peoples all over the globe have given their governments massive power to redistribute wealth, police speech, and essentially overstep their boundaries at ever point. they do this because they apparently "trust" their officials and genuinely believe in what they're saying to the point where they're willing to hand over their own personal sovereignty.

       yeah ok keep saying what you're saying because all know whatever shithole country you're sitting in if you say the wrong thing you can be fined or thrown in prison lmfao, even if it's western european.
      </p>
      <p>
       and if you're an american then you're just a dumbfuck ignorant about what the rest of the world is like. you don't like it here? go somewhere else. see how much fucking worse it is kiddo. see how everyone bends over and gets fucked in the ass by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       to say "americans worship their leaders" or "uniquely engage in cult of personality" is fucking stupid about a nation that literally has armed fucking militias set up that are at the ready to stand up to the fucking government at a moments notice if it gets out of line (bundy ranch, anyone?). oh and is there a "sovereign citizens" movement in fucking iran? or africa (outside of primitive tribes that are allowed to remain "free" by government degree)? or even god damn europe? no? didn't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       and europe is totally left-wing, which literally means growing government and giving it more power and responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fucking stupidity of what you're saying is massively off the fucking charts.
       <strong>
        massively
       </strong>
       . you can "wah wah muh kool-aid" all you want, but that doesn't change the fact that what you are saying is

       You talk a lot about how you can be thrown in prison for all sorts of things in other countries. You realize that the United States has the highest prison population on earth? Do you realize that we have more people locked up in the United States then China does, while China has 4 times the population of the United States?

       yeah because we have working police force, that you can't just slip a benjamin to in order to recuse yourself of any sort of investigation, and we don't execute massive numbers of people, you ignorant tard. we also have the financial resources to house criminals in ways that many other nations don't, which means fucking zimbabwe doesn't have a lower prison population "because they're more free" or anything, idiot. we also don't do mob justice here (except on the front page of reddit, home of retards who love to congregate here).

       Patriot day is one of the blatant examples of film propaganda I've seen in a long time. 'We all came together that day to defend Liberty and freedom!' when the exact opposite happened that day as police trampled on Liberty by conducting warrantless house by house raids in search of 'terrorists'.

       One of the truest things good old David Icke ever said:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The greatest form of control is where you think you're free when you're being fundamentally manipulated and dictated to. One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell and you can see the bars and touch them. The other one is sitting in a prison cell but you can't see the bars but you think you're free."

       Obama was a great example. Said all sorts of great stuff when running; then gave us center right republican policies. Obamacare was original a right wing thinktank alternative to singler payor.

       And Robert Reich, Bill Clinton's labor secretary, says Clinton was planning on doing all sorts of liberal economic policies and Greenspan threatened him. Said if you do that, I'll raise interest rates and you'll be another Jimmy Carter. He says that in a book.

       I recall paying attention to the MSM during the second invasion of Fallujah.  This is before I knew better...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I travelled to Asia and watched their coverage of it.   It was very, very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US media was focusing on the heroic effort of the Marines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foreign media was focusing on the civilian casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was quite the eye opener.

       I'm a Canadian and yeah that's basically how anybody semi-woke or even remotely educated thinks about the states. I'll give you an easy example: me and some friends watched American Sniper and were shocked with how
       <em>
        bad
       </em>
       it was, not just politically but also just in terms of basic film composition (for example, there is almost no establishing shots; locations just change at random). We couldn't believe the popularity of the film but we went on line and saw review after review of people saying stuff like "wow this kept me on the edge of my seat what a powerful movie" and we could just not believe it

The more who see the less power they have. Diplomacy would solve every last issue, but the deep state and their pedo occult mk ultra beyond fantasy people want a satanic world order... that's really the goal.

       We're the enemy of the world and also the unwanted ally of the world. They want us out of their business and then when they need more help they run to us and then once we give them what they want they return to saying they didn't want our help, etc, etc.

       Usually the reason they need our help is because we got them into a horrible quagmire in the first place.

       Don't ever kid yourself, the US works hard and spends tons of money to put them into a position where they suddenly need help that US quickly steps up to provide for even more demands and control over their business than they were rejected and kept out of it in the first place.

       I think you need to do some research about the CIA before you make such claims. From its inception until now. Read what past presidents have said about them. If you don't think there's ample evidence that the CIA is it's own entity with no oversight that has been deeply entrenched in the system (deep state) then you are wholly ignorant on the subject.

       Then Assad is murderous on occasion. The whataboutism was to suggest that all governments are tyrants (by their very nature) and both sides of this argument (US/Assad) are shit

       I say dictatorship in effect, because though the public figure changes every 4 years, the real governing force evidently does not.

       Yes.
I am sure.

       Just because you can point out a theory which has some fitting aspects of our current world, and how the USA fits into it, does not mean it is accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the USA we have seen a slide towards corporate power. A problem that we, as a people, can fix. But much like the Declaration of Independence states that a people aren't likely to revolt until extreme discomfort is imposed upon them, a similar such scenario must take place for the public to care enough to get properly involved in the government as such to impose certain changes that would tip the balance of control back to the people and away from corporations and the ultra rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have seen what other countries are like. Others who have seen far more than I have also agree with me, in the USA we experience a freedom unlike that anywhere else in the world. And not only that, opportunity like noplace else.  Most native born Americans are blind to it. Instead they complain about corporate greed, and a lack of jobs. Meanwhile an immigrant opens a shop and provides a comfortable life for his family, buys their first home and puts a couple kids through college...
      </p>
      <p>
       America is full of problems, but it's still the best overall game on the planet for those who are willing to work for what they want.

       Just look at Denver International Airport and the ego it takes to essentially create a place like that and then place these, "We're smarter than you and more superior than you," murals and statues. It's egging those who are awake on, basically saying there's nothing you can do. The mass of the herd is asleep at the wheel and those of us who understand the way this government is working (to some extent,) know that we don't affect change and never will. It's an illusion. Much scarier things are on the way people.

       Yeah, on conservative talk radio, they had a clip of Trump being asked if he ordered the bombing and he hedged. He talked around the issue. (Clearly, he didn't order it, and it embarrassed him that the Deep State was acting autonomously.)

       When asked whether he had authorized the bombing, he said, according to a pool report, "What I do is I authorize my military. We have the greatest military in the world and they’ve done a job as usual. We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing and frankly that’s why they’ve been so successful lately."

       Pretty safe bet to say that he authorized it.

       That's per Fox Business News.

       Difference between being in charge and ordering. I get in trouble for my employees doing something bad vs my own screw up. Not defending anything though.

       We're the enemy of the world and also the unwanted ally of the world. They want us out of their business and then when they need more help they run to us and then once we give them what they want they return to saying they didn't want our help, etc, etc.

       Classic. So history from 200 years ago is still relevant is it? If Australia is still a prison then I think you guys need to fucking stop using slaves ya racist cunts. And yes we are freer. You paid off those student loans from when you went to college to pursue those diplomas that aren't in any way relevant to your day job yet?
