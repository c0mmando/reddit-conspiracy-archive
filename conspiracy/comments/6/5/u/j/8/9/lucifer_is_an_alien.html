    <div class="md"><p>I have two issues with your conspiracy.</p>

<p>Individualism is the direct enemy of any government, religion, or controlling force. People being their own person, not a collective are much harder to control. In regards to ancient ancestors the Greeks would like to have a word with you. And if Lucifer is an alien, isn&#39;t god an alien? </p>

<p>In reguard to LGBT being pushed on society, I think this is done on purpose to further divide us. There are LGBT people who have or &quot;suffer&quot; from being gay, transgender, etc. We should treat them with compassion and kindness, as we should everyone. But I think it has been high jacked and used to push depravity and push it on children to cause a societal backlash and give us more non issues to worry about. People should just be asked to be compassionate and kind to others for the things they did not chose, nothing else, nothing more. Having a society like that is much harder to control</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one is out there trying to get children to say they&#39;re transgender or do whatever you imagine &quot;depravities&quot; are. What&#39;s happening is that transgender kids, much like I was when I was young and isolated from all other LGBTQ influences, are seeing people on TV and saying, &quot;hey Mom, look at this! That&#39;s what I am. There&#39;s a word for my gender! It all makes sense now.&quot; There&#39;s nothing depraved about being open about your gender.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents pushed the role of being a girl on me, because I looked like girl and the doctor said I was a girl. They had no idea I was actually a boy inside and when I came out my mom was in denial for about a year. </p>

<p>My parents never asked me if I was transgender. It was 1990. I doubt they even knew transgender boys existed back then. Transgender girls were the only trans people you saw back in the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s only being talked about because you have two groups. Group A who wants to help these people be accepted by society, and group B who wants to profit off of these people, weather that&#39;s in the form of transition or votes or anything. There&#39;s always sick people like that. I&#39;d also say it is quite credible to know you&#39;re transgender from a young age. However that is not always the case and that&#39;s why we should wait until you&#39;re in your late teens to begin transition of any kind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By individualism I mean our traditional community structures. In the last few decades the traditional family has been replaced with an increase of single mothers on welfare raising children who grow up without fathers. This has huge societal impacts, and psychological effects too. Not to mention it increases the size of the State, and the number of people dependent on it, ie a greater transition towards Socialism. I would say that people in the past were far more connected with each other, and people went out side and played with one another. Today, we are very isolated, and technology creates the illusion of connectedness. People are very scared of one another, and with the rise of terror attacks and radicalization, it&#39;s understandable. </p>

<p>The thing about LGBT is maybe it is natural, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to procreation. My theory is that it is being so heavily pushed in the west because it will restrict the amount of children White people are having. Same thing with contraceptives, abortion, birth control, pornography, etc. Not to mention children are expensive, and if you are being taxed heavily and already in a struggling economy you just cant afford it. Also, I think there is something strange about how transgenderism is suddenly becoming very talked about. I realize people have been born with conditions in the past, but I always figured it would have been rare, the way we hear about transgenderism now you might think something like 1/4 people have some condition. Maybe it has to do with pollution or chemicals they use. I was reading about how progesterone at birth can effect an individuals sexuality later in life. Might be something similar, like all the plastics we are exposed to. </p>

<p>Sure I think it is fair to say that if Lucifer is an alien, then perhaps God or Yahweh or Adonai is also an alien, but maybe either a different kind or with an opposing viewpoint/mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to some interpretation of old Sumerian myths, the whole creation of humans is actually aliens (looking like humans) making some genetic experiments with existing human species on earth to give them enough intelligence so that they could use them as workforce/slaves to use in the mines and in other work. That&#39;s where all garden of eden myth originates, so does Lilith and Eve (who possibly had sex with Lucifer and even born a child from him, hence the whole forbidden apple story). God and Lucifer are supposedly two brothers in the high council of Aliens called Enki and Enlil. Enki is like the Lucifer you describe, he&#39;d the head scientist, a more open minded guy who has a certain interest in his human experiments while Enlil represents a more Yahweh-like character and is in charge (commander) of alien forces on earth, so he is god and he&#39;s not very fond of humans and kicks those &quot;filthy animals&quot; from eden as soon as he finds out the obscenity of how far the experiments have gottem while Enki tries to give them wisdom, Enlil only wants them to serve and do nothing else. Enki later moves to Egypt and becomes a god there too, Enlil is still in middle east and once he realize the spawn of Enki is getting too out of hand he helps their land get invaded by other humans existing (hence the whole Tower of Babel being destroyed, and the whole &quot;we used to speak all one language but God confused our languages&quot; story because their land was invaded by other humans speaking a different language, humans who were around before their civilization) and destroyed their city states. Then Abraham leaves Ur and &quot;the God&quot; guides him up north, then through Syria into Israel and then Egypt. I guess by then after spending too much time on Earth, gods became like humans with factions and competition between them.. But the main competition is between the two brothers, Enki and Enlil, or God and Satan. The God (Yahweh) has very angry, militant attitude, quiet frequently punishes humans with his wrath (the military commander) and shows similar characteristics to Islam&#39;s god Allah in terms of attitude, while Enki/Lucifer is more open minded to new things, experiments etc..     </p>

<p>Supposedly when they first began genetic experiments, they used their own genes to upgrade the existing and lesser advanced human species on earth in the lab (in Eden) and created several prototypes, some unsuccessful and some finally successful, hence the &quot;God created man in his image and likeness&quot; thing, and had them multiply and have children (like Abel). But supposedly Enki (Lucifer) also slept with Eve and she a had a child with him (Cain?). This part is shortly told in the Genesis as <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1 - &quot;Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, &quot;I have gotten a manchild with the help of the LORD.&quot;</a>. This is only mentioned for Cain (the alleged sinner) and never for Abel. Then there&#39;s also a section where it says they were naked but never ashamed.     </p>

<p>That&#39;s because humans were like animals and they were all naked slaves/workers, only &quot;gods&quot; who were colonizing earth had dresses, some kind of fashion and romantic dramas between them as they were the civilized race. But after the genetic cloning experiments had advanced, Adam, Eve, Lilith and those favorite slaves close to the royal family (Enki and others) in the Garden of Eve (where Gods resided) started to dress clothes like them and this really pissed Enlil off, and when he found out Enki had begotten Eve a child of his own (the forbidden apple) he ordered all to get kicked out of &quot;Heaven&quot; and onto the street. Then they all started having sex like animals out there and started multiplying too fast, and some of those &quot;gods&quot; and &quot;semigods&quot; (lower in rank?) were having sex with human women and having semi-god children from them (hence in the [Genesis 6:4-&quot;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown](4The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown]  (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm)">http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm)</a>&quot; and Enlil and some of the Gods got too pissed off and soon came the Noah and the flood incident where a lot of these people were destroyed &quot;for their sins&quot; but supposedly it was Enki (Lucifer) and not Enlil (God?) who helped Noah and some of those people by providing the blueprints for the ship or an escape patch (since the flood and the ship could also be a metaphor just like the apple).    </p>

<p>So there&#39;s always this competition between the two brothers, where one is in charge elected by the council, is pissed off, and promises to destroy humans with his wrath unless his commands are followed who then promises salvation, and always threatens humans to not listen to the other brother and his teachings (sounds like the God we know?) while the other always experiments with things, has an open mind, and tries to teach humans new ways (hence he&#39;s &quot;tricky&quot; and will lead you to sin - sounds like someone we know?)    </p>

<p>Supposedly, some of those elites are from a certain bloodline (Lucifer and Eve&#39;s child or children?), and according to some theory, maybe even Jesus is (if the story about him is true). One thing is certain and that is the humans at the time, especially during and before Sumer were scared shitless against some &quot;gods&quot; and things they don&#39;t quiet understand, like dogs and cats near people. But certain people amongs them, namely their &quot;kings&quot; and their bloodline and priests, were being given certain knowledge and privilege to speak to Gods directly while other humans couldn&#39;t speak to Gods directly and were more average than their kings in terms of intellectual ability or knowledge.   </p>

<p>You have to remember, a lot of these religious stories are bit part stories taken from older myths from a much older civilization or two before the Israelites. Abraham, for example, was a Sumerian from the Sumerian city of Ur (modern day Basra), Sumerian believed some of these myths and so did Babylonians after them, who were a much more advanced civilization than Israelites and took them as slaves/captives for a very long time. This was when the bible/tanakh and torah wasn&#39;t even written down yet, it was written down way after Israelites were freed and it&#39;s quite possible that some of their stories could&#39;ve been very much influenced by what they have learned from the Babylonians when under captivity..</p>

<p>You have to remember, this is just a possible theory out of many possible theories because all we have is religious myths/stories with lots of metaphors told with the understanding of much older civilizations, missing lots of parts and pieces and translated in a language much different than older civilizations, and many parts probably changed to fit the current religious narrative, and a lot of these religious stories are bit part stories taken from older myths taken from much older civilizations who came before the Israelites. Abraham, for example, was a Sumerian from the Sumerian city of Ur (modern day Basra), Sumerian believed some of these myths and so did Babylonians after them, who were a much more advanced civilization than Israelites and took them as slaves/captives for a very long time.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. Call it Enki, or Abraham, or Dwayne Johnson. As long as accurate historical records and findings accurately support their story, I don&#39;t see a significant difference between Sumerian tablets, canonical texts and gospel written on parchments, even though they still shape the world we live in. I don&#39;t see how a god creating Adam and Eve, kicking them out of heaven for biting an apple and the humanity coming through them is any more or less credible than the story of Enki or any other mythology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. Tho i did really mean this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What i would like to know is what happened to Enlil and Enki? Are they still alive? What is their planet of origin? And any sources where i could read the complete story? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any resource that i could read that summarizes it? I got lit. Your comment got me hooked. Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just a bunch of stories I&#39;ve seen in Zacharia Sitchin&#39;s books and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Grail-Kings-Explosive-Bloodline/dp/1931412936">Genesis of the Grail Kings</a>. Sitchin&#39;s books were criticized as conspiracy theory on grounds of mistranslations and interpretations of ancient texts, astronomical and scientific observations, and literalism of myth, both by scientists and religious institutions, who accept their literalization of ancient myths as true religion of god, so I don&#39;t see the difference between the two. One takes Sumerian tablets as his reference point and the other takes bits and pieces of canonical text and gospel written down by councils of rabbis and bishops later in history, telling similar (or overlapping) storylines. I don&#39;t see how one is a conspiracy theory and myth and the other isn&#39;t. Maybe they&#39;re all metaphors but obviously they&#39;re all still taken very literally as they&#39;re still enforced upon us and shape our world one way or another.      </p>

<p>This thread really made me curious and that&#39;s why I&#39;m actually asking a question here rather than trying to provide answers as I don&#39;t have them myself. There&#39;s all this talk about Lucifer and Luciferians. Who&#39;s this Lucifer? According to Jewish Bible, it&#39;s not the Satan described in Christian and Muslim belief, but rather an angel with the mission of being an adversary like u/LyleMillar said.     </p>

<p>What is an angel? Are Luciferians evil? How is the idea of a God and his angels and more or less credible than the idea of aliens landing on the planet, conducting certain genetic experiments on a species that is less advanced so that they can task them with certain missions? These are honest questions because I don&#39;t see a clear difference between two points of view in terms of credibility and believability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now i got more intrigued. Whatever those aliens are, hopefully they have good intentions with us. Aren&#39;t we all entities of this vast universe that wants to survive peacefully? And also, i apologize if i sound sarcastic on my first comment.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think the elites are <em>not human</em>? How is it they breed with poor people sometimes? </p>

<p>Why do you think the bible even accurately describes ancient history? Do you realize that Lucifer was created by Christians and is not present in the old testament? In the OT lucifer is attributed to characters with different names. These names related to the gods of other peoples, competitors with the Abrahemic God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even in regards to Abrahamic god, early in the genesis there seems to be several characters all called &quot;LORD&quot; even though they sometimes seem to display different characteristics and also a mention of gods and sons of god. While those myths probably miss many parts and some parts are omitted from the original stories, we can tell there&#39;s a clan of gods (or a species or people called gods) with different personalities and abilities, these ancient people are awed and scared of them, and some competing against each other. Like you said, there is no mention of Satan in the old testament. It&#39;s an invention of Christianity and first appears in the new testament. We have to keep in mind that the Jewish Bible was a collection of stories written way after their captivity by the Babylonians and we have good reason to doubt their authenticity, and the Christian bible was written by a council of bishops convened in Nicaea in 325 AD and written according to their religious doctrine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and that is why I mean specifically in the Jewish Bible. Jews don&#39;t believe that Satan is evil, iirc, they believe he is one of G-d&#39;s angels with the mission of being the adversary. There are many different names or titles given throughout it, like Yahweh, Adonai, Ba&#39;al, Lord, etc Perhaps these are separate entities from a common race of aliens. When I look at Egyptian gods, there are human and animal hybrids. I&#39;m sure the same is with Babylonian and Sumerian gods. I&#39;m sure you could also include Hindu gods as well. The thing is that the Elites worship Lucifer, and I figure they are either in direct contact with him or descendants of his bloodline through hybridization with the alien and human dna. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they&#39;re just ideas people created to try to explain nature and suffering and psychological occurrences out of their understanding. The egyptians gods weren&#39;t real, none of these gods were real. They&#39;re like fairy tales for adults who can&#39;t handle how brutal and scary life is, and the fact that we&#39;re mortal.</p>
