       I wanted to share some Law of One teachings that some of you guys may not have read before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Law of One is something that has always been a great resource of information every time I read it, and I highly recommend you guys to check out the full changelings sometime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is Ra?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra is a seventh density (or dimension) consciousness channeled by L/L Research (Carla Rueckert, Don Elkins, and Jim McCarty) between 1981 and 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
       “I am Ra. The Law of One, though beyond the limitations of name, as you call vibratory sound complexes, may be approximated by stating that all things are one, that there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator.” (from session 4)

       There were a few sessions where the subject of UFO's was brought up. I am just going to go ahead and copy the whole text here because it isn't too long. Read it over and let me know what you guys think, I thought it was very interesting. It brought up more questions and lead me to researching into the confederation of planets. Apparently 53(?) different intelligent ET species belong to this counsel and follow the law of one in relation to the creator. I found this book I want to check out sometime, figured I would share it here as it is relevant.

      <p>
       6.23 Questioner: The photographs of the bell-shaped craft and reports of contact from Venus [exist from] less than thirty years ago. Do you have any knowledge of these reports?
Ra: I am Ra. We have knowledge of Oneness with these forays of your time/space present. We are no longer of Venus. However, there are thought-forms created among your peoples from our time of walking among you. The memory and thought-forms created therefrom are a part of your society-memory complex. This mass consciousness, as you may call it, creates the experience once more for those who request such experience. The present Venus population is no longer sixth-density.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.24 Questioner: Do any of the UFOs that are presently reported come from other planets here at this time, or do you have this knowledge?
Ra: I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. There are approximately fifty-three civilizations, comprising approximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in this Confederation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who have attained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities within your solar system, and it contains planetary entities from other galaxies. It is a true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but allied in service according to the Law of One.
      </p>
      <p>
       6.25 Questioner: Do any of them come here at this time in spacecraft? In the past, say, thirty years?
Ra: I am Ra. We must state that this information is unimportant. If you will understand this, we feel that the information may be acceptably offered. The Law of One is what we are here to express. However, we will speak upon this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each planetary entity which wishes to appear within your third-dimensional space/time distortion requests permission to break quarantine, as you may call it, and appear to your peoples. The reason and purpose for this appearance is understood and either accepted or rejected. There have been as many as fifteen of the Confederation entities in your skies at any one time; the others available to you through thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       At present there are seven which are operating with craft in your density. Their purposes are very simple: to allow those entities of your planet to become aware of infinity which is often best expressed to the uninformed as the mysterious or unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.12 Questioner: I am interested in the application of the Law of One as it pertains to free will and what I would call the advertising done by UFO contact with the planet. That is, the Council has allowed the quarantine to be lifted many times over the past thirty years. This seems to me to be a form of advertising for what we are doing right now, so that more people will be awakened. Am I correct?
Ra: I am Ra. It will take a certain amount of untangling of conceptualization of your mental complex to reform your query into an appropriate response. Please bear with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Council of Saturn has not allowed the breaking of quarantine in the time/space continuum you mentioned. There is a certain amount of landing taking place. Some of these landings are of your peoples. Some are of the entities known to you as the group of Orion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, there is permission granted, not to break quarantine by dwelling among you, but to appear in thought-form capacity for those who have eyes to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, you are correct in assuming that permission was granted at the time/space in which your first nuclear device was developed and used for Confederation members to minister unto your peoples in such a way as to cause mystery to occur. This is what you mean by advertising and is correct. The mystery and unknown quality of the occurrences we are allowed to offer have the hoped-for intention of making your peoples aware of infinite possibility. When your peoples grasp infinity, then and only then, can the gateway be opened to the Law of One.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.13 Questioner: You mentioned both our people and those of Orion coming here. Can you expand on that?
Ra: I am Ra. Your thought complexes did not match your vibratory sound complexes. We are unable to respond. Please restate your query.
      </p>
      <p>
       7.14 Questioner: I’ll just ask about Orion. You mentioned Orion as a source of some of the contacts of UFOs. Can you tell me something of that contact, its purpose?
Ra: I am Ra. Consider, if you will, a simple example of intentions which are bad/good. This example is Adolf. This is your vibratory sound complex. The intention is to presumably unify by choosing the distortion complex called elite from a social memory complex and then enslaving, by various effects, those who are seen as the distortion of not-elite. There is then the concept of taking the social memory complex thus weeded and adding it to a distortion thought of by the so-called Orion group as an empire. The problem facing them is that they face a great deal of random energy released by the concept of separation. This causes them to be vulnerable as the distortions amongst their own members are not harmonized.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.2 Questioner: There was a portion of the material yesterday which I will read where you say “there is a certain amount of landing taking place. Some of these landings are of your peoples; some are of the entities known to you as the group of Orion.” My first question is what did you mean by the landings are of your peoples?
Ra: I am Ra. Your peoples have, at this time/space present, the technological achievement, if you would call it that, of being able to create and fly the shape and type of craft known to you as unidentified flying objects. Unfortunately for the social memory complex vibratory rate of your peoples, these devices are not intended for the service of mankind, but for potential destructive use. This further muddles the vibratory nexus of your social memory complex, causing a situation whereby neither those oriented towards serving others nor those oriented towards serving self can gain the energy/power which opens the gates to intelligent infinity for the social memory complex. This in turn causes the harvest to be small.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.3 Questioner: Are these craft that are of our peoples from what we call planes that are not incarnate at this time? Where are they based?
Ra: I am Ra. These of which we spoke are of third density and are part of the so-called military complex of various of your peoples’ societal divisions or structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bases are varied. There are bases, as you would call them, undersea in your southern waters near the Bahamas as well as in your Pacific seas in various places close to your Chilean borders on the water. There are bases upon your moon, as you call this satellite, which are at this time being reworked. There are bases which move about your lands. There are bases, if you would call them that, in your skies. These are the bases of your peoples, very numerous and, as we have said, potentially destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.4 Questioner: Where do the people who operate these craft come from? Are they affiliated with any nation on Earth? What is their source?
Ra: These people come from the same place as you or I. They come from the Creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you intend the question, in its shallower aspect, these people are those in your and other-selves’ governments responsible for what you would term national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.5 Questioner: Am I to understand then that the United States has these craft in undersea bases?
Ra: I am Ra. You are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.6 Questioner: How did the United States learn of the technology to build these land [inaudible]?
Ra: I am Ra. There was a mind/body/spirit complex known to your people by the vibratory sound complex, Nikola. This entity departed the illusion and the papers containing the necessary understandings were taken by mind/body/spirit complexes serving your security of national divisional complex. Thus your people became privy to the basic technology. In the case of those mind/body/spirit complexes which you call Russians, the technology was given from one of the Confederation in an attempt, approximately twenty-seven of your years ago, to share information and bring about peace among your peoples. The entities giving this information were in error, but we did many things at the end of this cycle in attempts to aid your harvest from which we learned the folly of certain types of aid. That is a contributing factor to our more cautious approach at this date, even as the need is power upon power greater, and your people’s call is greater and greater.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.7 Questioner: I’m puzzled by these craft that we have undersea bases for. They are [inaudible]. Is this technology sufficient to overshadow all other armaments? Do we have just the ability to fly in these craft or are there any weapons like there are… Were they given to us [inaudible] or are they just craft for transport? What is the basic mechanism of their [inaudible]? It’s really hard to believe is what I’m saying.
Ra: I am Ra. The craft are perhaps misnamed in some instances. It would be more appropriate to consider them as weaponry. The energy used is that of the field of electromagnetic energy which polarizes the Earth sphere. The weaponry is of two basic kinds: that which is called by your peoples psychotronic and that which is called by your peoples particle beam. The amount of destruction which is contained in this technology is considerable and the weapons have been used in many cases to alter weather patterns and to enhance the vibratory change which engulfs your planet at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.8 Questioner: How have they been able to keep this a secret? Why aren’t these craft in use for transport?
Ra: The governments of each of your societal division illusions desire to refrain from publicity so that the surprise may be retained in case of hostile action from what your peoples call enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.9 Questioner: How many of these craft does the United States have?
Ra: I am Ra. The United States has five hundred seven three, five seven three [573] at this time. They are in the process of adding to this number.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.10 Questioner: What is the maximum speed of one of these craft?
Ra: I am Ra. The maximum speed of these craft is equal to the Earth energy squared. This field varies. The limit is approximately one-half the light speed, as you would call it. This is due to imperfections in design.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.11 Questioner: Wouldn’t this type of craft totally solve, or come close to solving, a lot of the energy problems as far as transport goes? That we’re used to transporting [inaudible]… transporting [inaudible].
Ra: I am Ra. The technology your peoples possess at this time is capable of resolving each and every limitation which plagues your social memory complex at this present nexus of experience. However, the concerns of some of your beings with distortions towards what you would call powerful energy cause these solutions to be withheld until the solutions are so needed that those with the distortion can then become further distorted in the direction of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.12 Questioner: At the same time you mentioned that some of the landings were of our peoples, you also mentioned that some were of the Orion group. [We] talked a little about the Orion group, but why do the Orion group land here? What is their purpose?
Ra: I am Ra. Their purpose is conquest, unlike those of the Confederation who wait for the calling. The so-called Orion group calls itself to conquest.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.13 Questioner: Specifically, what do they do when they land?
Ra: There are two types of landings. In the first, entities among your peoples are taken on their craft and programmed for future use. There are two or three levels of programming. First, the level that will be discovered by those who do research. Second, a triggering program. Third, a second and most deep triggering program crystallizing the entity thereby rendering it lifeless and useful as a kind of beacon. This is a form of landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second form is that of landing beneath the Earth’s crust which is entered from water. Again, in the general area of your South American and Caribbean areas and close to the so-called northern pole. The bases of these people are underground.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.15 Questioner: Was the landing at Pascagoula in 1973 when Charlie Hickson was taken [on board] this type of landing?
Ra: I am Ra. The landing of which you speak was what you would call an anomaly. It was neither the Orion influence nor our peoples in thought-form, but rather a planetary entity of your own vibration which came through quarantine in all innocence in a random landing.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.16 Questioner: What did they do to Charlie Hickson when they took him on board?
Ra: I am Ra. They used his mind/body/spirit complex’s life experience, concentrating upon the experience of the complexes of what you call war.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.17 Questioner: How did they use them?
Ra: I am Ra. The use of experience is to learn. Consider a race who watches a movie. It experiences a story and identifies with the feelings, perceptions, and experiences of the hero.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.18 Questioner: Was Charlie Hickson originally of the same social memory complex as the ones who picked him up?
Ra: I am Ra. This entity of vibratory sound complex did not have a connection with those who used him.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.19 Questioner: Did those who used him use his war experiences to learn more of the Law of One?
Ra: I am Ra. This is correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.20 Questioner: Were the entities that picked him— can you describe… is that the normal configuration of these entities? They [inaudible] rather unusual.
Ra: I am Ra. The configuration of their beings is their normal configuration. The unusualness is not remarkable. We ourselves, when we chose a mission among your peoples, needed to study your peoples for had we arrived in no other form than our own, we would have been perceived as light.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.21 Questioner: Well, what density did the entities who picked up Charlie Hickson come from? What was their density?
Ra: I am Ra. The entities in whom you show such interest are third-density beings of a fairly high order. We should express the understanding to you that these entities would not have used the mind/body/spirit complex, Charlie, except for the resolve of this entity before incarnation to be of service.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.22 Questioner: What was the home or origin of the entities that took Charlie?
Ra: I am Ra. These entities are of the Sirius galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.23 Questioner: The most startling information that you’ve given me, which I must admit I’m having difficulty believing, is that [the] United States has 573 craft like you describe. How many people in our government are aware that we have these… how many total people of United States designation are aware of this, including those who operate the craft?
Ra: I am Ra. The number of your peoples varies, for there are needs to communicate at this particular time/space nexus so that the number is expanding at this time. The approximate number is one five oh oh [1,500]. It is only approximate for as your illusory time/space continuum moves from present to present at this nexus many are learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.24 Questioner: Where are these craft constructed?
Ra: These craft are constructed one by one in two locations: in the desert or arid regions of your so-called New Mexico and in the desert or arid regions of your so-called Mexico, both installations being under the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.25 Questioner: Do you say the United States actually has a manufacturing plant in Mexico?
Ra: I am Ra. I spoke thusly. May I, at this time, reiterate that this type of information is very shallow and of no particular consequence compared to the study of the Law of One. However, we carefully watch these developments in hopes that your peoples are able to be harvested in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.26 Questioner: I am totally aware how this line of questioning is [of] no consequence at all, but this particular information is so startling to me that it makes me question your validity on this. Up until this point, I was in agreement with everything. This is very startling, and [it] does not seem possible that this secret could have been kept twenty-seven years, and that we are operating these craft. I apologize for my attitude, but I thought I would be very honest about this. It is unbelievable to me that we would operate a plant in Mexico, outside of the United States, to build these craft. Maybe I’m mistaken. These craft are physical craft built by our physical people? I could go get in one and ride in one? Is that correct?
Ra: I am Ra. This is incorrect. You could not ride one. The United States, as you call your society divisional complex, creates these as a type of weapon.

       The full text is quite long so here is some high lights I wanted to share with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       17.30 Questioner: Well, if an entity wants to learn ways of it, wants to be of service to others rather than service to self while he is in this third density, are there best ways of being of service to others, or is any way just as good as any other way?
Ra: I am Ra. The best way to be of service to others has been explicitly covered in previous material. We will iterate briefly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking to the intention of your question, the best way for each seeker in third density to be of service to others is unique to that mind/body/spirit complex. This means that the mind/body/spirit complex must then seek within itself the intelligence of its own discernment as to the way it may best serve other-selves. This will be different for each. There is no best. There is no generalization. Nothing is known.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way of service to others is the constant attempt to seek to share the love of the Creator as it is known to the inner self. This involves self knowledge and the ability to open the self to the other-self without hesitation. This involves, shall we say, radiating that which is the essence or the heart of the mind/body/spirit complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioner: Then why do we have the extreme starvation problem in, generally, in the area of Africa at this time? Is this, is there any metaphysical reason for this, or is it purely random occurrence?
Ra: I am Ra. Your previous assumption was correct as to the catalytic action of this starvation and ill health. However, it is within the free will of an entity to respond to this plight of other-selves, and the offering of the needed foodstuffs and substances is an appropriate response within the framework of your learn/teachings at this time which involve the growing sense of love for and service to other-selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       50.7 Questioner: Thank you. Can you expand on the concept which is this: that it is necessary for an entity to, during incarnation in the physical as we call it, become polarized or interact properly with other entities and why this isn’t possible in between incarnations when he is aware of what he wants to do, but why must he come into an incarnation and lose memory, conscious memory of what he wants to do and then act in a way that he hopes to act? Could you expand on that please?
Ra: I am Ra. Let us give the example of the man who sees all the poker hands. He then knows the game. It is but child’s play to gamble, for it is no risk. The other hands are known. The possibilities are known and the hand will be played correctly but with no interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In time/space and in the true-color green density, the hands of all are open to the eye. The thoughts, the feelings, the troubles, all these may be seen. There is no deception and no desire for deception. Thus much may be accomplished in harmony but the mind/body/spirit gains little polarity from this interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us re-examine this metaphor and multiply it into the longest poker game you can imagine, a lifetime. The cards are love, dislike, limitation, unhappiness, pleasure, etc. They are dealt and re-dealt and re-dealt continuously. You may, during this incarnation begin — and we stress begin — to know your own cards. You may begin to find the love within you. You may begin to balance your pleasure, your limitations, etc. However, your only indication of other-selves’ cards is to look into the eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot remember your hand, their hands, perhaps even the rules of this game. This game can only be won by those who lose their cards in the melting influence of love; can only be won by those who lay their pleasures, their limitations, their all upon the table face up and say inwardly: “All, all of you players, each other-self, whatever your hand, I love you.” This is the game: to know, to accept, to forgive, to balance, and to open the self in love. This cannot be done without the forgetting, for it would carry no weight in the life of the mind/body/spirit beingness totality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am Ra. We leave you in the love and light of the One Infinite Creator. Go forth rejoicing in the power and in the peace of the One Glorious Infinite Creator. Adonai.

       Law of one is one my research books of the matrix. I finished half of it and am working on Urantia now.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like law of one, you will love Urantia. It's slightly easier to read and it's 2000 pages of mind blowing knowledge bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Urantia says that channelers are simply people who are able to tap into something called a "thought adjuster" or "mystery monitor" that resides in our super-conscious mind. Urantia was a sleep talking man who was deeply intimate with his thought adjuster. A team of 200 psychiatrists were observing him saying very interesting things and wrote it all down. They checked the text for discrepencies and couldn't find any. The book is very informative. For example, the entire history of our evolution from presun era is in there in full detail.

       The channeler never asks, but the Orion Confederation is brought up alot. This is a large confederation of service to self based entities from the Orion star system that go around trying to influence third density planets to "go to the dark side" so to speak. Perhaps some of the races within the Orion group are the same reptilians that are brought up in UFOlogy.

       You can't always trust 'channeled material' such as this. In fact, usually you cannot explicitly, though there are exceptions. Take it with a grain of salt and see how it measures up to other sources, and your own subjective experience. If 'Ra' is legit he would appear to be a pseudonym for an 'ascended master' of sorts, if not an outright hoax. It's hard to say, really.

       If you actually read his channelings you realize you can't hoax this. I'm not going to make anyone believe anything though and as you say it's good to be cautious with any channeled message. Law of One personally resonates amazing, it's a great body of material and I recommend it to anyone.

       Agreed, for the most part. I still try to remain as objective or agnostic as possible with matters such as these, in the event it should be proven false or potentially tainted with disinformation or bias. That said, I enjoyed the Ra Material as well.

       I've read quite a bit of the Ra material and believe that the being doing the channeling is from the dark realms.  No good or evil?  Does anyone really believe that?  You sign off with "thanks for reading guys and much love."  Would it be the same for you to say "Thanks for reading guys and much hate?"

       It goes further than that. You gotta think in terms of oneness as in good AND evil. You can't have evil without good. For if you didn't know the feeling of hate how can you know what love is? Get what I'm saying? I simplified it there but as hard as it is to say it, evil is an aspect of creation and it's up to us to move past the negative low vibrations of fear, anger, hatred, judgement, etc.

       The tip-off that this material does not come from a positive entity is the BS that the most important thing is to achieve polarity -- whether positive or negative hardly seems to matter to Ra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statements such as "to serve the self is to serve all," should send up a red flag. Who would really believe that if I steal your dinner, I am actually serving you? You are served by me stealing your food and serving myself while you go hungry? Riiight.
      </p>
      <p>
       This book attempts to justify evil. Take a look at this excerpt about the extremely evil Genghis Khan, who, Ra says, was so devoted to serving himself that he "graduated" to 4th density STS, otherwise known as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Questioner: What does he presently do there? What is his job or occupation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. This entity serves the Creator in its own way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioner: Is it impossible for you to tell us precisely how he does this service?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ra: I am Ra. It is possible for us to speak to this query. However, we use any chance we may have to reiterate the basic understanding/learning that all beings serve the Creator."
      </p>
      <p>
       For a look at some genuine channelled material, check out the Pathwork lectures channelled by Eva Pierrakos. The Pathwork lectures radiate love, joy and wisdom, unlike this Ra stuff.

       Dude. This is from one of the highest levels of awareness. Ra is a 6th density social memory complex, it has transcended the need for concepts like polarity and now seeks unity with infinity and source.
      </p>
      <p>
       God, Logos or Source does not hate anyone or anything no matter what it is, it has infinite love for all, and it knows all is one. Ra understands that all is one. If we are all one than all service is to both the one and the all. Polarity is a measure of how one gives service, with ignorance of One, and to the self, or truth and understanding of one, where all service is service to all, there is simply more "other selves" (as Ra puts it) to give service to than to the self, so it's more effective to serve all/One by serving others. Source and Ra want all to progress and return to source. The next step for humanity is polarizing to service to self or other/all. Then we can develope spiritually and dedicate ourselves to service. Ra would say that the negative/service to self path is the more distorted of the paths, for it is the farthest from what is true, not that they are evil, or shouldn't exist. In the end we will all go back to source, and the negative is simply a longer, more confused and painful path than the positive path.

       That's basically your reasoning and the reasoning of "Ra". You belittle goodness as being a side effect of evil and vice versa but you pretend that this is healthy. It is not. Evil is evil and good is good, they aren't some masochistic splice of energy that is attached to one another. This sounds like someone trying to pose as a God so they can kill morality and make us dissociate with real kindness. Its like an updated version of MKUltra that pretends sadism is the big misunderstood cure for all ailments when its really suger coated trauma based mind control. I bet if I stole everything that belonged to this Ra guy he would drop that unity bullshit and pull out a shiv like the rabid animal it really is.

       You made a lot of assumptions and negativity off something I guarantee you have not read fully. It's obvious you're missing the message of law of one and I hope you see the truth in it some day. Peace

       Good and evil are wholly subjective. They rely upon omniscience of a situation, which is unattainable.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       I have in my hand a vial containing a contagion that will kill people. I release it into the local water supply. 800 people die.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        WTF SO EVUL!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The contagion eliminated a bacterial outbreak in the water supply that would have killed the 2 million people supported by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Oh... well I guess it's ok... And you're sure the bacteria would have killed us? Ok... I guess that's good
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bacteria was really a form of extra solar life, and in 3000 years time, that bacteria will allow humanity to evolve in a way that will eliminate skin cancer, and the need for sun screen, while reducing the global need for food by 28%.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Oh... well then... it was kind of good, but evil, but in the grand scheme of things...
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see what I'm getting at. This particular game is endless. Only someone with perfect knowledge, not bound by linear time, could hope to play.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goodness/evilness of an event is determined after the fact. Our morality is just a set of biases and ideas that have worked for our species for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone is killing one another, we all starve. If no one works the fields, we all starve. If I kill Ug, Uth and Ulk will kill me. If we work as a team, we bring in more food, and we all live a better life because of it. With the surplus of food, we have all the sexy cave ladies stopping by for roast mastodon. And that's how you Mesopotamia.

       Nice compilation of material. I was wondering your thoughts on teh following:
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read much of the Cassiopean material or much of Corey Goode's testimony? It would seem from these sources (and others as compiled by
       <a href="http://wespenre.com/">
        Wes Penre
       </a>
       ) that human history would go back about 250,000 years and our genome largely comes from genetic experiments crafted by the Sirians and other humanoid groups that evolved millenia ago. This lines up with Goode's "22 genetic experiments" testimony. This goes against the Ra chanellings account that we arose 75,000 years ago with a mixture of Earth-evolved DNA plus DNA from Yahweh used to transfer the Martian souls. Ra I think mentions other genetic experiments but doesn't go into much detail. Which account do you think might be more accurate? Have you read much from these other sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Ra account is inaccurate, do you think its possible that the Ra channeling was entirely manipulative? For me it seems unlikely but certainly possible. On our origins, Ra always mentions we are at the end of the 3 25,000 year cycles so it seems unlikely this discrepancy would be due to a channeling error. It seems more likely to me that the other sources are less accurate / intentionally misleading. Perhaps they are all quite inaccurate, but interesting nonetheless!

       I've watched a lot of Corey Goode's work and testimony in regards to secret space programs and other ET phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not read that other body of material you brought up but it sounds interesting, I'll need to check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the law of one was a hoax or ruse or anything, but I do believe small errors could be present that wouldn't line up with other things such as what you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe some errors could be present given the technicality of the information and the fact that it is coming through a medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless you gave me more stuff to look into and I appreciate that, thanks for the reply man

       I love the law of one. So happy to see it being discussed here. Probably the greatest body of wisdom i jave ever encountered, on an entirely different level from other channelings.
Thank you very much OP.
      </p>

       I know it's not a big deal, but I just wanted to mention that Ra states it is a 6th density group, not 7th.
