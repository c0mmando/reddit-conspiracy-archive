    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some clues.<br/>
1.) Syria -- US has to evacuate its assets or so something to avoid the revelation that indeed, that Alqaeda and ISIS are US operations. Many of the foot soldiers might not be aware, and probably will be pissed to find out they are puppets of Washington and TelAviv.<br/>
..<br/>
2.) North Korea -- You have to look at what is happening in South Korea. Disgraced leader there probably is a puppet of outside forces. Guess who that might be? SK populace is <em>pissed</em> already at her corruption, as well as her cronies&#39;. Well, Sir, they might become <strong>enraged</strong> when the truth comes out.  ...Will it?  US DeepState is making all to moves to start a HUGE crisis with crazy hair-trigger NK perhaps to prevent an all out shitstorm of controversy from erupting and getting out of control in the South. </p>

<p>I admire your optimism, but I feel you will be disappointed with Trump when all is said and done. He will fix no mistakes, only create more. People keep thinking he was elected, he wasn&#39;t, he was chosen. What better way to get money out of politics than to bring in a lifelong mogul right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea does not &quot;have&quot; nukes. They have large devices that they cobble together and set off in tunnels that have some radioactive component. They&#39;re huge, crude, low yeild, and shit. And they have one at a time.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t &quot;have&quot; ICBMs at all. They can&#39;t make it over the Pacific at all. They have solid fuel rocket tubes that we would call boosters. They&#39;re crude, and they blow up all the time. They&#39;re basically big bottle rockets. </p>

<p>They&#39;re not the liquid mixed fuel space machines loaded with high yeild mirv heads like we use.</p>

<p>It&#39;s moot. They will never strike, because they can&#39;t and they&#39;re not even close to capable. It&#39;s sensationalist bullshit. This isn&#39;t simple stuff. </p>

<p>The best they can do would be hit a particular area of Japan or South Korea with a basic explosive warhead on one of their rockets.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll never have to hit them. But even if we did, China wouldn&#39;t do shit but scream at us. They know that the international community would be against NK and by proxy China for supporting them. And China knows it would be the end of the world if they fired on us. Because if we actually let em rip across China it would be full scale WW3 and end of the Earth.</p>

Australia, why would Australia be a target for nuclear missiles from a united Korea? Again, Australia owns shitloads of uranium and I&#39;m pretty sure they have the technology to enrich it. About their missiles, I have no idea, but, at any rate, they can send out lots of emus or kangaroos, or brown snakes, or whatever is most venomous in the outback.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mcipac.marines.mil/Living-in-Okinawa/Okinawa-Area-Emergency-Evacuation-Plan/">http://www.mcipac.marines.mil/Living-in-Okinawa/Okinawa-Area-Emergency-Evacuation-Plan/</a></p>

<p>PETS. Although US Government policy does not require pets to be evacuated, the U.S. has recently supported the evacuation of pets. The U.S. will make every reasonable effort to evacuate pets, but please realize that the evacuation of people will always take priority over pets. Owners should register their pets at the Kadena Veterinary Hospital as well as prepare a suitable travel case, supply of pet food, and three copies of pet vaccinations as part of the emergency readiness kit. Carriers must be sturdy, properly ventilated and large enough for your pet to freely be able to stand, turn around and lie down. The kennel must also be able to be to be closed securely, as well as be designed so that other cargo will not block ventilation.</p>

<p>PERSONAL PROPERTY. The only personal property that will accompany evacuees are limited to items that can be comfortably carried. In the event that recovery of this property is not possible, DoD evacuees must ensure that they can support a claim to recover the value of the lost property. Documentation of household goods left behind will be your evidence when required to justify a claim. Be prepared to return your house keys (on or off base) as well as the keys to your vehicle(s) as you process through the ECC.</p>

<p>PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES. Documentation to prove ownership and value of your vehicles (such as title, registration or bill of sale) should be part of your emergency readiness kit to support vehicle claims. You may be required to abandon your car or have it commandeered by military or civilian authorities for official use. During a crisis, the host nation government and military authorities can be expected to strictly control highway access in order to reduce congestion. Do not expect to be able to drive your family in your vehicle unescorted during times of crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that there may be just as much of a chance that we&#39;ll either see or hear of a nuclear missile attack or possibly even an atomic explosion somewhere that will be attributed to North Korea but that was actually engineered by someone else in order to make it look like it was. </p>

<p>The US, of course, has major bases in South Korea and Japan as well as warships off the coast of the Korean peninsula that are all right next door and close enough to North Korea that a missile launched from any of those towards North America or anywhere else could be fairly easily palmed-off as having originated in North Korea, instead, and then be used by the US as a justification for doing whatever it wants no matter how extreme it is or how many people wind-up dead as result.</p>

<p>An opportunity, if you will, for the US to finally nuke someone else and start playing &quot;nuclear chicken&quot; in earnest with both China and Russia who may have atomic weapons but have never actually dared to use them while the US both created and used them and then subsequently put them into the position of having to develop and stockpile them to counter the possibly that the US wouldn&#39;t have hesitated to use them against them, either. </p>

<p>I doubt that either of them would ever have had the initiative or lack of conscience and disregard for life in general to ever do that on their own, no matter how bad or seemingly ruthless or heartless they might have appeared to be in any other ways.</p>

<p>I think the same situation exists with chemical and biological weapons where the US quite simply picked up where the Nazis left off and forced others to get into that utterly sick and wicked game to counter the possibility of the US using those on them as well.</p>
