       It certainly took everyone in India by surprise. But then, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a flair for the dramatic. In an unexpected primetime address on Tuesday, he announced that in a few hours, millions of high-denomination currency notes would no longer be legal tender.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the only way, he insisted, to deal with “the disease” of unaccounted-for income -- or “black money,” as it’s called in India. “Your money will remain yours,” he assured a stunned citizenry -- as long as you get around to depositing it in post offices sometime over the next several weeks.

       Mumbai: A new internet is being built: it has 1.1 billion users, a third of the world wide web. Indian banks are running transactions on it and Microsoft has embedded it into Skype.

       The biometric identifier program Aadhaar — or “foundation” in Hindi — has taken on a life of its own, authenticating loans and job seekers, pensions and money transfers across India. And last week’s landslide state election win could embolden
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime Minister Narendra Modi to push Aadhaar beyond its early cost-saving goal, even as questions are raised about the security of its data and the proliferation of private companies seeking to profit from the information it stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other countries are also looking at similar programs, but research shows it’s best to develop one standardised system so people can carry their IDs wherever they go in the world, said Paul Romer, chief economist at the World Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in just 4 months, one of the most densely populated countries on planet earth has implemented not one, but two policies that NWO conspiracists have warned us about for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concern generated by policies that give governments more control over a citizen's ability to purchase in anonymity, while at the same time giving the government a method to track the citizen through checkpoints of daily/weekly/monthly activities should be viewed as legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever increasing examples of corrupt government colluding with corporations and banks on a global scale, (see Libor as recent example) coupled with media outlets that are constantly and blatantly lying to citizens points to a fairly logical conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are giving up everything to a system that cannot and should not...be trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's wait and see how it plays out in India will be the most common reaction to this post. But I would remind the reader that the citizens of India were given no warning at all before the first development.

       As we watch ex-Goldman Sachs members take over more and more of the most important positions in the current White House administration we need to start asking ourselves some difficult questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questions like -
      </p>
      <p>
       Has our government earned or lost our trust overall?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have central banks given us any reason to trust them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have oversight procedures regarding the two most powerful entities in our country been successful?
      </p>
      <p>
       When we look at the constant rash of scandals repeated time and time again the answers are quite obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, we need to start having public discourse regarding the possible answers to those questions. We may not have as much time as we once thought.

       If they are already managing to implement the biometrics system in rural areas of India, it should show us how fast this will occur. Couple that with a spokesman for the World Bank declaring that a single standard system for all countries that implement it would be ideal and you have a legitimate reason to believe it will happen.

       They are related. Start a War in The Middle East and simultaneously implement a cashless society at the same time. Start WW3 and cause mass destruction and chaos with an economic crash and implement the NWO (economic/govt/religious) control of everyone as the only way to stop the destruction. It is all related for the global plan. We will not be fooled!!

       Meanwhile, the NWO is testing a social-credit system in China that correlates and evaluates all aspects of each citizen's life and assigns to them a number score. Certain behaviors, associations, purchases, compliances, and other activities smiled upon by the state increase the score, which in turn could allow or disallow virtually any activity imaginable. Integrate this with total surveillance and a cashless economy and the state (or hackers) could unperson someone deemed non compliant or reward a loyal servant of the state with permission to have a child, take time off, maybe a few extra eRMB on their account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the evolution of technology and the state's adoption of it for surveillance and corporate purposes - it's clearly headed in this direction, and with lots of momentum.

       CREDIT CARDS, as we have them, are ILLEGAL, in China- you can't carry balances, you can't maintain a negative loan, etc- credit is based on cash deposits in banks, which spoiler again, are not Insured against fraud or loss-
So if you get a card by maintaining a large account, which I have at a ccb ( Chinese Construction Bank) if I don't pay my bill I GO TO FUCKING JAIL, if I default on my account I GO TO FUCKING JAIL

       Awake already, thank you. I lived in China for years and have spent cumulative years in China, India, Malaysia, and various other countries while doing business on that side of the globe, and I currently have RMB HSBC accounts, so I'm intimately familiar with and accountable to Chinese policy in that regard. Your reply misses the point of my comment: technology being implemented as social control policy as in India, and how these systems could easily be adapted globally. Social credit in America? Cashless economy in America? Is it an if or when?

       I am not denying the crimes committed against them, just pointing out your statement about legally murdering dalits is completely bullshit at cosmic levels. On the contrary, legally they are more protected compared to majorities.

       American music is superior to all other forms of music. I. E. Limp Bizkit, Creed, P. O. D., Disturbed, Static X, Powerman 500, Sugar Ray and Smash fucking mouth! Indian music is pretty bad.

       Well they removed 1k....

      <p>
       And added a note of 2000 instead. Which makes it 2x easier to store black money :V

       All of that was just political drama.

       The main focus of that move was to force everyone to be dependent of banks.  Its the banks that run every country.

       I have came accross this, but this is horrific. Reminds me of Aaron Russo video.

       How comes India implement this?  I thought some strong east asian state (China, Asia, etc.) would resist to this for some time somehow. Are those countries subdued to worldwide bankers or do they do this on their own free will?
