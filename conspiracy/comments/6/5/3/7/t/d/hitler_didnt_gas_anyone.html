    <div class="md"><p>Hitler prolly didn&#39;t personally gas anyone... I was the defense attorney for the entire Nazi party in the mock Nuremberg Trial in high school... I did an awesome job... there were no eyewitnesses to anything... dismissed the photographer who took pictures of the Zyklon B canisters after one question which tanked their entire cross-examination. Only lost 3 high ranking officials... everyone else was free to go. Good times... I love playing Devil&#39;s Advocate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My general feeling is that it&#39;s unlikely Zyklon-B was used to kill Jews or anybody else. The camps did not have real gas chambers for killing human beings -- however, they did have real gas chambers for de-lousing clothing.</p>

<p>I believe the stories of Jews getting gased are the result of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hysteria and myth-making among Jewish prisoners at the concentration and work camps. They made up the fantasy about gas chambers in the same way they made up the fantasy about soap made from Jewish fat (which has been admitted by historians to be completely false). The human fat story persisted a long time, and still persists in some quarters in spite of it being disproved. I believe the homocidal gas chamber story had the same origins, and has persisted for the same reasons ... it is too horrifying to disbelieve.</p></li>
<li><p>The deliberate misinformation campaign mounted by the Allies designed to demonize the Germans, so that Americans and the British would hate them and want to kill them. This campaign began even before the war, spread by Jews, and it was encouraged by the Allied command, even though they knew it was untrue. In some senses, it is just a continuation of the German villification that took place during WW1, when the same kind of horrifying stories were told about German soldiers (the &quot;Hun&quot; as they were called).</p></li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I believe the stories of Jews getting gased are the result of two things:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two, and then there&#39;s the primary reason, which is rarely discussed - the Torah/Talmudic prophecy of 6 million Jews having to &quot;disappear&quot; before the lost tribes of Israel could return to G_d&#39;s Promised Land. </p>

<p>This is why Zionists (whose primary objective was the creation of the State of Israel) were pushing the 6 million as a meme for two generations <strong>before</strong> Hitler even came to power. The Zionists are mainly Ashkenazim, who are not semitic or properly Jewish at all, but impostors - white European converts who carried out a reverse takeover of the Jewish religion, and accounting for perhaps 85% of all Jews today). </p>

<p>The Zionist cuckoos are essentially atheists - they don&#39;t care about G_d&#39;s will, so why did they push the prophetic 6 million narrative? Simple, because they wanted to prophecy to appear to have been fulfilled to persuade the <strong>real</strong> Mizrahim, Sephardim and Orthodox Jews that the creation of Israel was legitimate and sanctioned by G_d. To this day, many, if not most Orthodox Jews do not believe the prophecy was correctly fulfilled, and not recognise the State of Israel. </p>

<p>Incidentally, the word Holocaust means &quot;burnt offering&quot;. Kind of odd, don&#39;t you think - an offering to whom, exactly, and to what end, do you think? Zionists believe that the Jews who did die at the hands of the Nazis (probably 2-300,000, and none of them in gas chambers) were a price worth paying for the creation of the State of Israel.</p>

<p>So the key part of the &quot;Holocaust&quot; myth is that Jews had to be burnt - and this is why the crematoria, and mass funeral pyres play such a big part in the Holocaust narrative. But nobody was going to believe that 6 million were burnt alive, so the <strong>story</strong> required a convenient means of mass execution, and these fictitious giant gas chamber-cum-shower-rooms (right next to the crematoria, how convenient!) were invented to fulfill that need.</p>

<p>If you recall, in the Balfour letter to Lord Rothschild in 1917, the British Government promised the Zionists that they would be given Palestine (a British controlled territory) in return for Jewish influence to persuade America to join World War 1. The Zionists kept their side of the bargain, but the British did not deliver after the end of the war. The British (Churchill) had to renew their promise to get America (Roosevelt) to join the Allies in WW2, and this time the Brits couldn&#39;t wriggle out of it, because the Americans made sure of it. Britain ceded Palestine and the UN sanctioned the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. That was the Zionist end goal, all along, and the &quot;Holocaust&quot; narrative of gas chambers was supposed to be a legitimising part of the process, from a Jewish religious perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is important to remember that even the <em>official narrative</em> of the Holocaust has been revisionist. </p>

<p>For a few years after the war the official narrative included Jews being killed in &#39;steam chambers&#39; and in &#39;electrical chambers&#39;. The narrative also included Nazis making shrunken heads from their victims as well as lampshades from their skin and soap from their body fat. Cinema audiences in Britain were shown footage from apparent gas chambers in the Dachau camp.</p>

<p>None of these former facts are included in the modern version of the official narrative.</p>

<p>Not only that but after the collapse of the Soviet Union the number of alleged victims at Auschwitz had to be revised from 4 million to 1.5 million. Yet, the official figure of Six Million did not itself undergo any diminution.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago it was reported that Jewish sources had rejected the figure of 5 million non-Jewish concentration camp victims. The reason given for this was that the figure was the invention of Simon Wiesenthal who apparently wanted non-Jews to feel a sharing in the Holocaust but not have the larger share. </p>

<p>So, 5 million victims of the concentration camps have now been accepted by the official narrative as never having existed. </p>

<p>The director of Auschwitz is on film stating that the building that is shown to visitors as a gas chamber is a post-war reconstruction. The features that would lead a visitor to believe that the building had been used for gassing were added once the war was ended by the Soviets.</p>

<p>Also, a number of the narratives by people who claim to have been survivors Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski) have been shown to have been literary inventions. </p>

<p>So, what I am pointing out is that even the official narrative has undergone substantial revision since 1945.</p>

<p>Now, add to all that the fact that the confessions by German military personnel that were used during the Nuremberg trials as evidence of mass gassing were made under torture then I think doubt about official Holocaust narrative is the most rational position. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, expressing the rational position is punishable in a large number of countries.</p>

<p>&quot;In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one&#39;s own mind&quot;</p>
