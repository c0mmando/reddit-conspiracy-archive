    <div class="md"><p>It looks like Orange has made the ultimatum to China that if they don&#39;t invade, we will. In the run up to WW3, this is important for three major reasons: 1) Chinese intrusion on the peninsula will freak out the S Korean people and push them back into loving their authoritarian government, 2) this gives China 5 years or so to transition from export to wartime economy, and 3) Chinese war fighting will increase their addiction to oil from the ME. China already imports a larger percentage of its oil from the area than the US (24% Chinese imported oil comes from Iraq). If that spigot is cut off or interrupted due to insurgency, that is where the Sino-American showdown comes into play - this gives the conflict of two major powers (plus a lot of little states) for Pike&#39;s plans of the 3 world wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no WWIII scenario coming out of the Korean peninsula. China and America are intensely symbiotic economically and neither country&#39;s ruling class can afford to disrupt that relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of your statements, especially about WW3 not starting on the Korean peninsula; my guess is that it starts near the Balkans or in the ME (and not for 5-8 years). Next major shoe to drop will be the fracture of the EU.</p>

<p>I think that Western <em>and</em> Chinese elites share the same issue of demographics that are problematic for holding power in the long term (too many useless eaters, particularly in the age of automation). In this sense, I think that a war favors both sets of elites. When the US economy finally tanks, we will be of no more use to China as a trade partner. Atlanta Fed just lowered 2017 Q1GDP to .5%... With assumed 2% inflation (of Fed mandate), how much <em>growth</em> is that? answer: -1.5%... in other words, the descent has already begun. By the way, most of Q1 took place before the <em>second interest rate hike in a decade</em>. Do you really think that the situation will <em>improve</em> as this credit adjustment works its way into Federal and private budgets??? The only way that things will <em>look</em> remotely normal to us over the next year is if China starts dumping all of their Treasuries (to counterbalance the banksters&#39; greatest fear <em>deflation</em>).</p>

<p>Also, if the state brainwashing program in NK is <em>half</em> as effective as we are sold, then any occupation force could be looking at the same prospect (of citizens fighting to the death) that allegedly got the US to drop Fat Man and Little Boy on Japan in &#39;45. Besides, American intelligence seems to be <em>extremely</em> skilled at arming/using insurgents to extend conflicts for as long as possible - makes mad $$$$ for the MIC. It could easily be US that invades, but that probably would start WW3 too early IMO (China is not yet mobilized for war with US).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that NK only poses a real threat to China, Japan, and S. Korea, and some surrounding islands.</p>

<p>I think the US only cares because all three countries I listed are incredibly important trading partners with the US. It all comes back to money. The US gov doesn&#39;t give a shit about the korean people, they give a shit about market stability.</p>

<p>I think China largely is on the same page as the US, and that someday the US and China will have joint military action to remove the Kim Dynasty from power, and leave SK to clean up the mess.</p>

<p>That someday may be coming sooner than we expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North Korea is a threat to the world banking cabal that is made up of the Bank for International Settlements, the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

<p>Any country that  has an independent central bank as all of our enemies do, has the potential of issuing a value based currency such as a gold backed currency. </p>

<p>That would be an extreme threat to the central banking mafia since all of their currencies are backed by faith in governments alone.</p>

<p>Any value based currency would quickly destabilize the fiat currencies of the banking mafia so those countries are having huge debt loads created for them in order to force them to borrow from the central bankers mafia.</p>

<p>All debtors have to follow the rules laid out by their creditors and those rules will include that only fiat currencies may be distributed. Russia and China are already part of the central banking  cabal and will not interfere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lmfao, dude if you think that NK could destabilize currency markets by releasing a gold backed currency, you have literally no idea wtf you are talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saddam Hussein wanted to trade oil for gold he was killed for that. Qaddafi  also wanted to trade oil for gold and create a Gold Dinar, so he was killed.</p>

<p>Any currency backed by anything of value would be preferable to fiat currency backed by nothing no matter what the source was.</p>

<p>Countries that were recently capable of creating a value based currency  or still could include Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Somalia. All of these countries will have or have had theis independent abilities removed by military means unless they give in to pressure from the US before they can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no. Just look at a satellite pic of NK at night. See the lack of lights? That&#39;s not because everywhere is so safe no one needs streetlights. </p>

<p>Look at their internet traffic, maybe 10 people in the entire fucking country are allowed to go online. </p>

<p>Sure all of the escapee stories may be fabricated by SK&#39;s own propaganda machine. I highly doubt it though. </p>

<p>The song and dance they perform for tourists is so desperate that I actually feel sympathy for all of the poor farmers that can&#39;t get enough to eat so that they can fill an entire empty restaurant with a banquet just to convince two journalists that there is no famine. </p>

<p>The behavior of the citizens absolutely reeks of deliberate long-term cult of personality brainwashing. </p>

<p>NK has it bad, and its only been made worse by an incompetent leadership that is impossible to depose. </p>

<p>If you have some evidence that points to all of the above being anti-NK propaganda, then please post me some data regarding any possible utopia over there. </p>

<p>I really want to believe that it <em>is</em> a utopia, and all of the above reservations are just central bank propaganda bullshit. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the evidence I have looked into speaks for itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Night satellites pics of NK, their import/export ratio and the amount of food aid they extort with their childish military pranks. </p>

<p>The unvarnished looks of amazement that NK refugees have when they see what a grocery store in SK looks like. </p>

<p>The desperate displays of food wasting presented to authorized tourists, where every table in an empty restaraunt is loaded with &#39;display food&#39; that will never be eaten and is whisked away at the end of the meal to be put back on ice for the next dog and pony show. </p>

<p>All of these things are more than enough evidence to demonstrate that the leadership of NK is dangerous to their own citizens. </p>

<p>I have looked, I have judged, and every warning sign points to a totalitarian dictatorship grown fat off of the hard labor of their citizens in spite of their horrible mismanagement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of words.  No actual evidence provided.  </p>

<p>Either you&#39;re intentionally disregarding the rules of debating/sharing information (on a public forum where you&#39;re attempting to convince people), or you actually are this intellectually dishonest.  Do yourself, and people having to listen to you, a favor -- show ACTUAL evidence when you try to make claims about far away people/places.  Saying you interpreted a &quot;look&quot; on someones face (that you didn&#39;t see in person) IS NOT EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily disputing the conditions of NK, I&#39;m asking the guy claiming he knows the conditions to inform the rest of us, and not just by saying &quot;trust me, I can tell&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that it has  been assured that Syria will have to borrow from the world central banking group, placing their policies and abilities in the hands of the BIS the World Bank and the IMF&#39;s  hands,  we can turn to the next country on our list of victims. </p>

<p>That country was expected to be Iran but somehow North Korea has presented a more attractive target of opportunity in the short term.

<p>&quot;Somehow&quot;? It seems pretty obvious for many reasons. Iran has a well equipped modern military that could actually put up a fight, unlike Iraq, and has a few friends in the form of Russia and Syria (not the most powerful friends, but still). The DPRK has no friends on the world stage, its military is a one-pump chump aimed at Seoul, and pretty much everyone who isn&#39;t KJU wants KJU out of power, including the senior military leadership of his own country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They  do have an independent, government owned,  central bank. Interestingly that banks website has been taken out for the last couple of years  to restrict their ability to do business, and their central bank building has been directly attacked  to create a message to them wiithout actually destroying them. Syria&#39;s infrastructure has been virtually destroyed and their real estate  has been demolished to create debt to make  Syria borrow from the world&#39;s central banking cabal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At a practical level NK can&#39;t be allowed to continue its present behaviour. Even if we think the present capability of NK&#39;s equipment is exaggerated there is no doubt that continued testing will provide them with true nuclear ICBM capability and that capability will be in the hands of a potentially more erratic leader as sanctions and outside pressures increase on the country. To paraphrase Macbeth,  &quot;If it were best done then &#39;twere best done quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>The trick is to drawer the concentration of troops on the SK border to defend PyongYang and other critical areas in the North. This could be achieved by a Chinese incursion on the Northern border or a faked US invasion from the North Eastern seaboard around Wonsan. Carpet bombing and perhaps even the recently tested MOABs (remember them) would be particular effective against any remaining massed infantry or exposed artillery directly north of the SK border.</p>

<p>The timing of the events had better be precise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one. I think something should be done to help NK either somehow peacefully get rid of KJU or somehow convince him that we are not the enemy and we could work to slowly reform the nation and make them a more stable and healthy nation. </p>

<p>With regards to their nuclear test and stuff: NK this whole time has just been like a kid getting bullied and they are just saying &quot;please leave me alone&quot; over and over until they stand up for themselves by showing that they are strong and won&#39;t accept being bullied. But they are crazy, so if we attack them for doing a harmless (I&#39;m not actually sure if it&#39;s 100% harmless, and I&#39;ll admit that, I just can&#39;t figure out how it&#39;s harmful to anyone outside NK) nuclear test. They will fucking retaliate hardcore unless the first strike on them is enough for it to be the last. </p>

<p>Instead of wave after wave of soldiers we should be sending regiments of fucking diplomats to these countries. </p>
