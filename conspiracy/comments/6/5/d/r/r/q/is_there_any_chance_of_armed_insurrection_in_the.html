<p>But the difference between Vietnam and today is that the government has got everybody in database. They gather info on us and then it is compiled into super computer in Tel Aviv.

<p>Well, I know they want to reduce the world&#39;s population to about 500 M people, so maybe they would release the nukes.  Maybe not on Washington, but I think they are psychotic enough to destroy most of the world and hope that they survive to rebuild it in their evil vision.  </p>

<p>I have a rifle, and can hit large targets with it at maybe 200 yards (like millions of people in this country).</p>

<p>Tell me, what can the Federal Government do with no power grid? Radar? Satellite imagery with no receivers and computers to process it? Cities are on fire because there&#39;s no power at distribution centers so food stopped coming?</p>

<p>Your scorn makes me wonder if you&#39;re sitting in a military installation right now. If so, you should know that you have absolutely no power over us that is not granted by our remarkable restraint. It is only our desire not to see millions of innocent people die that holds up such an incident.</p>

<p>I just showed you that they don&#39;t. There is no contingency. They don&#39;t have transformers available, they must be ordered from China.</p>

<p>Do you know how many transformers there are? Or that you could even do this taking down transmission lines?</p>

<p>You could have a whole region down before anyone even realizes an attack is going on.</p>

<p>My post refutes the myth of Al Qaeda. If it&#39;s that easy to cause a complete collapse of the US government, why haven&#39;t they done it?</p>

<p>Is it because they were created by the CIA, including Brzezinski bragging about it?</p>

<p>It would take ~48 hours to take down the grid.</p>

<p>So, why did it take a month the last time someone did this? And where would the transformers come from?</p>

<p>Do you think the government just keeps thousands of expensive transformers, each with different specifications, sitting around waiting in a contingency?</p>

<p>They would not need to. Most people in the army would not fight American citizens. And the American government can be brought down quite easily, perhaps by a smart individual, if they struck at the right targets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating this, unless it were absolutely necessary to prevent nuclear war, or mass attrocities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The surveillance state necessitates that once a group of people got together to &quot;fix things&quot; (just by communicating their intent), they could easily be outed and/or rounded up. They have had watch lists for this stuff longer than most of us have been alive. Search engine technology also facilitates the flagging of suspicious communications (with particular combinations of keywords that would illustrate intent). This is the real reason for the War on Terror (that, and spending lots of our $$$$)</p>

Sounds very romantic but its nonsense in reality, did you see that MOAB bomb drop?, yeah, I&#39;m fighting against that, lol, did you also see the drone the size of a small toy car they have now with HD streaming back to the FOB? Yeah there are different levels to this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is highly unlikely due to logistics alone. The continental US is huge with its major population centers spread way out. </p>

<p>If you wanted to gather enough people to have any chance of success, those people would have to come from all over the country (unless you believe there are enough people in the vicinity of Washington DC who would be willing to do something like this, which I do not). </p>

<p>So, you have armed militias traveling from all over the country to Washington DC. All the govt would have to do to stop the movement in its tracks is to set up military checkpoints on the interstates leading into DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal opinion is that when push comes to shove the police and a large portion of the armed forces would side with the citizens.</p>

<p>This country is still very much a cowboy country at heart. That&#39;s the only reason we&#39;re not all locked down already, they know that they can&#39;t get away with it yet. Hence the push to dumb us down with porn and drugs. Even people here in this sub push that agenda for them unfortunately.</p>
