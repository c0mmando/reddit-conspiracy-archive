       If I was an intelligence agency that had thousands of data points on every citizen and could intercept and monitor what everyone was doing online, I would be compiling all of that information into a database to create behavior and personality profiles on everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there I'd want to create maps of how information flowed between certain personality types and chart how behavior is affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I'd definitely want to know is how easily lies are believed, what kinds of lies are believed, how they spread, and who spreads them. A great way to test this would be to come up with something very bizarre but seems like it could maybe be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd create a few dozen youtube videos about how the earth is "flat", give odd examples that appeal to people's immediate observations and not scientific process, and then start posting them to sites like reddit, facebook, forums, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a year or two, you'll now have a whole new set of data points on how false information can be spread, which videos worked the best, which points in the videos have been repeated the most, and what demographic of people believed them and shared them.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there you have a new avenue to spread false information. Better yet, you can create a new experiment based on the data you've collected from the old one and try to slowly perfect your ability to control the beliefs of a huge number of people.

       There was a great article on that that I'll try and dig up tomorrow on how the Flat Earth Society started out satirical but so many people got on board. Many of the original founders backed out after how eager people were to believe the videos they were putting out

       I think it's just a convenient psy-op and limited hangout.  In this forum it's used to forum slide a lot.  Talk about this stops discussion of much more important issues, like the fact that Israel is a 5th column in this country.

       My family member later eventually started running around on the street, yelling green green green. And then made his children stay home because he thought all food outside of the house was poisoned and that the government was out to get them. A few days later, the house became haunted, and he made his family stay at his mom's house. A week or two later, he told his wife that he has to kill himself in order to make a sacrifice to God and to save his kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn't always like this, but a few years prior to this he was normal, but flatearth beliefs was the first sign of something wrong.

       there are so many different ways to respond to what you're saying, but the pure and simple truth is our society is sick and extremely fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're prescribed pills that fuck with our bodies/minds, most of the food we are sold is poison is some form or another, even 'organic' food isn't safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if you were there and actually saw all of this with your own eyes and ears or if they were just second hand stories from other people who said they saw it. The reason I bring this up is because I know of others who had been accused of 'going crazy' and the reality is the family was lying or exaggerating what was happening because they were scared. Not saying this is the case, but it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if this was the case, why the break down? you say he wasn't always like this, but 'normal' so what happened? new medication, stresses from work/money? I mean really, FB or other internet services could have programs that 'trigger' people to go 'crazy', we know that FB and Twitter run manipulation systems to get people to feel/think about certain things, maybe he watched a youtube video that scrambled his brains?

       I was there. I was close to this family member. Everyone in the family hated him, but I always tried to give him a second chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was the one trying to help his family get him to seek help, but he refused to do so until it was too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said he had bipolar mixed with something else. The changes started to happen when he got into a car accident and had major head trauma. He recovered and seemed ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he started working night shift every night for several years and wasn't really sleeping much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think the trauma from the car crash and the lack of sleep and stress about taking care of his family drove him off the deep end.

       It was the major head trauma. You hardly ever recover to the person you were, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guaranteed he was on some prescription pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       This not a mystery, he wasn't crazy, there are just somethings it's incredibly hard to heal from. I would bet if you found out the drugs he was on and looked them up, the side effects correlate to what was happening :/

       This is a weak attempt at trying to discredit flat earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subtle manipulation only works on non critical thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       By taking the stance that flat earth is an assumed absurdity you can move past it without going into any actual scientific analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post of your "theory" is completely worhtless, except as an attempt to divert people's attention away from looking at flat earth seriously. Shame on you.

       Anyone who has honestly looked at the evidence can make their own conclusions without your pathetic validation.

       How about watching a ship go over the horizon on radar? I've done that and it was precisely at the distance calculated based on the height of our radar antenna. How about how snipers calculate the coriolis effect into their shooting calculations? Why are all the other planets in the solar system round?

       Ok well you could replace "flat earth theory" with literally any other conspiracy in this post and the point would remain the same. Every theory has it's believers and non-believers. I don't think he was specifically trying to discredit the flat earth theory, it was just an example to help bring up another theory.

       It's very simple. Pilots need to calculate their fuel pretty much exactly when they're making long trips. Fuel weighs a lot. If you over fuel, the plane will be to heavy to reach the destination and they'll either have to dump the fuel over the ocean, or return to the airport to de-fuel. If you're flying halfway around the globe on a 16 hour flight, you need your fuel calculations to be 100% perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know one of the things they factor in when they're navigating long trips? The curvature of the earth, because a curved line is longer than a short one. Source: my father, the career pilot, teaching me how planes navigate while we were on a trip together and he was flying the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I assume you'll tell me that my dad is in on the conspiracy. That every single pilot in the world is in on the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that we have damned icecaps which exist because those area of the planet receive the least amount of sunlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact that we have seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that we can launch satellites which orbit the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the fact that when I was in highschool we launched a weather balloon with a camera to take space pictures and could clearly see the curvature of the earth.

       That is some ignorant shit right there. The most funny and ironic thing I have realized since I went flat 2.5 years ago is that the customary mockery that most do you are honestly only mocking yourselves. Flat earth is truth regardless of what jokes you want to crack. However from my perspective you all look/sound like the assclowns in idiocracy cracking jokes on the only intelligent character in the film. You will never get it I fear, you will fall for all the lies that ball earth is based on. I mean you folks came from monkeys 🐒 so really there is not much I can do other than help those that get it. I have converted hundreds and not one of them has ever come back to me and said yeah man you are wrong the earth is a ball.

       Guess what, I don't have to do experiments because literally millions of people have performed experiments and independently verified the FACT that the Earth is sphere like. Whereas you watched some videos from a bunch of nutjobs on youtube. You're what I like to call a youtube scientist. You don't even know what research consits of. You tell other people to do experiments yet you follow quacks on the internet like a little sheep that accuse everyone else of being. Congratulations! You're officially a gullible piece of shit and a detriment to society. I almost wish the Earth was flat so that when you die we could dig a hole deep enough to throw you through the bottom into space because the matter that you're made of should not even contaminate our soil.

       I have proven it nobody cares to even look at the evidence. Thousands of YouTube videographers have proven it. Water never bends. Polaris never moves. Perspucular rays prove it. Double rainbows prove it as the second rainbow is always inverted as it reflects off the dome. Oahu can be seen 90 miles away which would be impossible as the curvature would be a miles worth. Chicago skyline can be seen across Lake Michigan at 60 miles away. Horizons would not be flat. Googling earth from space one would see a real picture of earth. We would not have cartoons from weather channels but would see a realtime spin of the earth and everyone would watch the earth channel and see realtime weather patterns you could put an iPhone in orbit to accomplish this but you will NEVER see it because its impossible. I fly every week and take pictures at 7-8 miles high and never a curve to be found. So I speak truth to everywhere I go and have personally converted hundreds of people.  I don't do this for recognition I do it to free humanity from a tyrannical government who first lied to you in Kindergarten. Just spend an honest day researching it for yourself. Drop everything you think you know as Aristotle suggests and start like it was the forst day on this earth and realize your reality that's all I ask. I cannot prove it to you it must be proven by you. Don't look for debunking videos but rather proof videos. Flat earth proofs should be your search.

       Question; how would you expect the horizon to curve yet still meet up at eye level behind you on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       shape of earth? Geometry suggests that being this close to a huge ball will result in a flat horizon to the observer. I've never understood why flat earthers use this as 'proof' when nobody is saying otherwise.

       Literally nobody says that there is measurable curvature from ground level or even most commercial airline flights. That would be geometrically impossible this close to a sphere. I repeat the question; if the horizon curves, how do you expect it to meet up behind you at eye level?

       I don't believe or really believe the earth is flat and level I know for certain it is. You believe the earth to be a sphere because someone told you it was. I take truth as authority and you take authority as truth. You have committed a logical fallacy.

       I listed all the facts. You have been notified, my job is done you must research for yourself thats all I can tell you. I have wasted countless hours doing the old proof bit to just be argued to death on it. I don't debate anymore although I absolutely would love to devate Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye on a live coverage event on it that's the only people I would do it for as it would reach many but that will never happen. Tyson made possibly the worst rebuttal of any subject ever on the Daily Show mic drop and all, absolutely pathetic and misleading.

       Your points are numerous and can be infinite but they are all based on a wrong assumption as if YOU go out and measure with a green laser or telescope across water and compare with how much curve you are supposed to have you woll fond none. Citing bullshit is not science measuring and actually doing science is science. Either experiment for yourself or shut the fuck up as it's annoyingly painful hearing the same exact shit I bought and learned. I know ALL of the global models, fake distances to stars, fake planets, fake galaxies, their distances across. I was once a left brained scientism worshipper too. I have for the last 2.5 years dedicated my life to flat earth vs ball earth research. Ball earth is just pseudoscience that relies on assumptions and math. Math is a language to describe and predict reality it is not reality. I swear the dumbing down of America makes this impossible almost for people to figure out but from my perspective it's pretty simple.

       None of your points have anything to do with the flatness of the earth which I have measured. What Venus does has no bearing on measurable flatness. This is the part where you do not have the mental capacity to grasp. Certainly some of those things are still mysteries I have had 2.5 years versus scientisms 500 give me a break. MIT had a study that they measured Kansas and it was flatter than a pancake impossible on a sphere measuring 25,000 in circumference. What you aren't comprehending is no matter what weird shit happens in the sky has no bearing on the measured flatness that MIT and I have accurately measured and which I keep telling you to do. I think you are scared of what you might find or you are paid to do this. Seeing the amount of interest you have in debating with someone you find mentally inferior my bet is on paid shill you guys are like clones man always throwing the same exact pitches.

       The Belt of Venus has nothing to do with Venus other than the name, it's an Earth phenomenon which shows the shadow of the Earth opposite the sunset on the atmosphere.  Not possible on a Flat Earth.  The fact that you don't know this is troubling.  Please educate yourself.

       You sure do get aggressive when it's demonstrated that you have no clue what you're talking about, why are you getting so angry when you're so certain of something?  Why are you unable to explain how the Belt of Venus works on a flat Earth?  How did you not come across the Belt of Venus in your previous "research" and are now hearing about it for the first time?

       You are describing Infowars and Alex Jones.  His whole operation is an intelligence front.  They used to have contests and Alex would tell people to do certain things (put certain posters up around town, protests, etc).  They would then monitor the results and get an idea on how many people would do whatever Alex told them to do.

       Question; how would you expect the horizon to curve yet still meet up at eye level behind you on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       shape of earth? Geometry suggests that being this close to a huge ball will result in a flat horizon to the observer. I've never understood why flat earthers use this as 'proof' when nobody is saying otherwise.
