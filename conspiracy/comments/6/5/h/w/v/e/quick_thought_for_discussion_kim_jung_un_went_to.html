       Im just thinking that NK is controlled by TPTB, and they are bolding it as a Trump card, to be played when needed. The thought just came into my mind, so I havent dug up anything yet.

       You can't think critically, just because he went to a school does not mean anything and he's clearly a rogue actor. Read a foreign policy book or something. If all actors were working for someone then there would be some leak/hack or something. Obviously there are clear tensions and you fail to understand realism and conflict between states.

       Wow. This rabbit hole is getting DEEP! At age 17, il sung joinded an underground Marxist group. 3 years later joind the Chinese Communist party (bankrolled by Rothschilds)Here Kim met the man who would become his mentor as a Communist, Wei Zhengmin, Kim's immediate superior officer, who served at the time as chairman of the Political Committee of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Wei reported directly to Kang Sheng, a high-ranking party member close to Mao Zedong (Also funded by Rothschilds!)

       In 1940, after being chased out of Korea by the Japanese, he escaped into Russia, and joined the Rothchilds Red Army throughout all of WW2!
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on 8 August 1945, and the Red Army entered Pyongyang on 24 August 1945. Stalin (Successor of Rothschilds man Lennon) had instructed Lavrentiy Beria to recommend a Communist leader for the Soviet-occupied territories and Beria met Kim several times before recommending him to Stalin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, the Soviets preferred Cho Man-sik to lead a popular front government, but Cho refused to support a UN-backed trusteeship and clashed with Kim.

      <p>
       This has Rothchilds written all over it!

       That alone seems like looking into. Look at the Skull and Bones of Harvard. These elite schools choose the future leaders of the entire world. Even places like NK.

       I've thought for a while now that N Korea was a puppet enemy of the west, providing an excellent staging area for a land invasion of China. The whole 'crazy dictator with nooks!' persona presented on MSM is far too cartoonish to be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the play would be to invade N Korea in 'self-defense', move in land troops, then use that land area as another point to invade China.

       Im just thinking that NK is controlled by TPTB, and they are bolding it as a Trump card, to be played when needed. The thought just came into my mind, so I havent dug up anything yet.
