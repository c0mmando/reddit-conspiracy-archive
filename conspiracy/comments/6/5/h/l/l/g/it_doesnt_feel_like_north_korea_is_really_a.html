       Your limiting what I said to just NK. When I wasn't. I think it's just very dismissive to say " NK is run by a evil fat dictator" when in today's day in age we all know it's a bit more complicated than that. Also, we get so bothered when people come in here pushing a msm narrative. NK is bad is all you here on the msm.

       Are photos of NK doctored to remove vehicles and typical city activity?  What's the point of having roads when there are no cars to drive on them.  And if they are doctored why go threw the trouble of showing cities when it's just as easy to show impoverished villages.

       That is correct, and then to understand why they have currently been moved to the top of the hit list, one has to look into who they are allied with and are helping develop nuclear technology.  You guessed it, Iran, if NK gives Iran nukes then that puts a huge thorn in the side of plans for Greater Israel.  Trump is a Zionist puppet so hence he is picking fights with those who either directly or indirectly pose a threat to Israel and its plans of expansion.

       If NK had no relationship with Iran they would be left alone by Trump to do anything they liked.

       It's a weird pawn in the US/China thing, it's a good distraction for the masses and it's "unpredictable" so they can always get them to do anything drastic (without being blamed) if it came to that.

       Old world artifacts still buried. Might change the narratives of human beings and history once those things are destroyed. Like Isis destroying old world relics. The winners of conflicts get to rewrite history. Like 6 millions died before ww2 and still over 6 million Jews have died. Winners get to push any narrative they want.

       Modern nuclear weapons are extremely dangerous. The bombs dropped on Japan are only a fraction of the power as modern ones and an unstable dictatorship shouldn't be allowed to get to the point where they can deliver a nuclear warhead.

       A high altitude nuclear blast over the US could create an emp capable of destroying large sections of the power grid, in some areas even for years. The threat is even greater now since apparently they have submarine launchable ICBMs.

       Its Chinese 4d chess they get cooperation from America for dealing with NK - a non issue like you said they never do anything.

       China is made to look sensible and diplomatic telling Trump to tone it down

       NK does this crap every decade or so. Then we send them foreign aid money and they shut up for a while.
 If I'm remembering correctly last time we paid for a nuclear power plant to be built.

       Rebuilding, and capitalizing North Korea would be really profitable for China and the United States. Also from a Chinese point of view , without a North Korean threat the United States would no longer have a reason to keep a stabding force on the peninsula. Long term China would end up with deep ties with a unified Korea along its borders and likely shake out US influence.

       Because its a very delicate situation and difficult call to make. No one wanted to touch this. If you send in troops, the detonate the nukes. Either they detonate them in NK or SK. They also have artillery trained on Seoul. The instant you attack, they will fire that artillery into a major city center. Seoul is where my sister is stationed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, unless you do it right, millions will die. They need to take out the nuke sites and the artillery before NK has a chance to use either and that is easier said than done. Add to that, China does not want the US to be anywhere near them. If we invade NK and establish military operations, China will feel threatened we are on their doorstep. China is actually cooperating now, but never with previous admins on NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do nothing, NK might do what they say they were gna do. So its a big cluster fuck of a situation and a tough call for any president.

       American industry has been more or less gutted by multinational corporations moving production to countries where they can pay less. One of the few exceptions to this is the arms industry / military. They got kind of a neat scheme going on. Rich men spend a lot of money to get elected, or to buy politicans who will work for them. These politicians have control over a vast amount of revenue, and the great thing is very little of it is their own, it's tax revenue. They pump a few trillion into a war, no biggie. Now they've created demand for arms and military contractors. Guess who owns the arms manufacturers and contractors? You got it, the same rich men as before, or at least somebody from their peer group. Dick Cheney is probably the most known recent case of this. He spent trillions on war, and put millions in his own accounts.
Now, arms spending is such a large part of the American economy that they can't afford to stop making weapons. Problem is, if you want to keep pumping out more missiles you have to use the old ones up, or taxpayers start wondering why you're buying a few billion more dollars worth of missles when you already have billions of dollars worth just sitting there. So: War.
America is also feeling especially precarious right now because Russia intends to stop trading in USD and go back to a gold standard. If this is successful and other countries follow suit (the big threat being China) then suddenly the USD is worth half or a quarter or a tenth as much because it's no longer the defacto standard for trade worldwide, and America doesn't have enough going on domestically to back the USD.
I imagine that America will probably attack Russia in the next few years. It's a two birds / one stone scenario: keep the war machine rolling, and send a lesson to those who think to drop the USD.
