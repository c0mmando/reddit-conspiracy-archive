    <div class="md"><p>Seriously I&#39;m amazed the people in this thread are joyful about a woman being punched in the face. Bringing up her being a porn star is completely irrelevant to the event. The gif shows her putting her arms out to stop him and he runs in and hits her. I guarantee if the situation was reversed people in this thread would be yelling &quot;INTOLERABLE LEFT&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said I do think it&#39;s the same guy. Hair looks the same, just from different angles.  Same shirt. Same guys in the pic in background of the gif. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except being a pornstar doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s done anything wrong, or that she can&#39;t be a nice kind person. You&#39;re demonising sex (from the screenshot seems she&#39;s a solo cam girl anyway, not a pornstar) as immoral and using that to suggest she&#39;s not a good person.

    <div class="md"><p>I genuinely think you have a mental illness.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t able to see that was satire, not my personal opinion, and roleplaying from the viewpoint of traditional media. Than I can, do nothing to help you.</p>

<p>Also no, getting punched in the face is very difficult to justify.
I never said that wasn&#39;t wrong. I only said that he wasn&#39;t a fascist like the media will portray him to be. They are going to ruin his life for getting into a fight. It will no longer be a case that could be solved in a civil court, but now will get him either physically, mentally, or socially assassinated through the court of political social opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment pretty clearly shows I understood that? You said it&#39;s relevant she&#39;s a porn star because the media portrays her as a saint. I said I agree with the media because being a porn star has absolutely no relevancy on her character. Therefore being a porn star has no relevance in your post at all. </p>

<p>Also the guy might get called a fascist but assaulting a woman is what will ruin his life, not being called a fascist. </p>

What are people supposed to do? Lay down and take it because it&#39;s a woman? And honestly, not to be a dick, but with all the action and confusion going on I have a hard time even telling the men and women antifa apart. They&#39;re all dressed the same with hoods on, and the some of the men have long hair and dreds too. In the confusion, maybe the dude couldn&#39;t even tell it was a woman. </p>

I have also circled an image artifact caused by the camera due to the fast moving object not matching with the frame rate of the camera. Which partially covers the tattoo. But it is still visible</a></p>

<p>3.) The existence of the tattoo negates your hair arguement.</p>

<p>4.) After mentioning it, the tattoo says</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing as /pol are wanking themselves raw over this, figured it would show up here eventually. Your spin is just about textbook-- Nathan Damago is <em>most definitely</em> a fascist (Identity Evropa crown prince, do you think we&#39;re stupid?), and when the media mentions this they will be 100 percent correct. Also, this was a clear sucker punch of a woman caught off guard who he probably outweighs by a hundred and fifty pounds. Well done Nate, look how strong and superior you look. </p>

<p>By contrast, if the girl who got socked really is this Rosales chick, showing up to a brawl usually means you will get brawled. Please note that the &#39;Muh tolerant left!&quot; nonsense has zero credibility, everyone&#39;s out there provoking one another, fighting it out in the streets.

    <div class="md"><p>Sooooooo your point here is its alright to run up and sucker punch someone as long as they post videos of themselves naked on the internet? Trying to get the angle here. </p>

<p>the band of Hitler youth you got there holding up the sign sure is convincing.</p>

<p>She was dumb to go there looking for a fight and he was an asshole for blind siding her if your going to fight don&#39;t be a little bitch about it that goes for everyone aka don&#39;t kick someone on the ground. </p>

<p>Everyone sucks neither are angels both with praised/demonized by each others sides. </p>

<p>Though if your justification for her getting sucker punched is she does porn fuck off with your puritan bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously I&#39;m amazed the people in this thread are joyful about a woman being punched in the face. Bringing up her being a porn star is completely irrelevant to the event. The gif shows her putting her arms out to stop him and he runs in and hits her. I guarantee if the situation was reversed people in this thread would be yelling &quot;INTOLERABLE LEFT&quot;.</p>

<p>That being said I do think it&#39;s the same guy. Hair looks the same, just from different angles.  Same shirt. Same guys in the pic in background of the gif. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What argument? I said nothing of the sort. This is only a post listing facts in case shit goes down.</p>

<p>1.) Cool she is a pornstar. No fucks given.<br/>
2.) I didn&#39;t even notice the tattoo, but thank you. It is actually there.</p>

<p>2.a)<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ivn2NWJ.png">I have highlighted, that part of the image in a better contrasting color so you can see the tattoo. I have also circled an image artifact caused by the camera due to the fast moving object not matching with the frame rate of the camera. Which partially covers the tattoo. But it is still visible</a></p>

<p>3.) The existence of the tattoo negates your hair arguement.</p>

<p>4.) After mentioning it, the tattoo says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MARK (fucking) CUBIN!</p>
