        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Polanski&#39;s career and films parallel many of the same themes as Stanley Kubrick.</p>

<p>Polanski&#39;s life also contains many intersections with the Deep State.</p>

<p>Like Kubrick, Polanski has put many Deep State clues into his films.</p>

<p><strong>1939-1945</strong>:  Polanski narrowly survives the Holocaust in Poland from age 6-12.</p>

<p><strong>1968, June</strong>:  RFK is friends with Polanski.  They share dinner (with director John Frankenheimer) the night RFK is killed</p>

<p><strong>1968, June</strong> (one week later):  Polanski&#39;s <em>Rosemary&#39;s Baby</em> is released, which implicitly links Satanism with a New York Jewish apartment building.  (Recall that <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em> also alludes to a N.Y. Satanic cult whose member, played by Sidney Pollack, is a Jewish character).</p>

<p><strong>1969, August</strong>:  Polanski&#39;s pregnant wife is killed in Laurel Canyon, allegedly by the Manson Family, within 3 weeks of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing &amp; the countercultural &quot;love fest&quot; peak at Woodstock.  The Tate-LaBianca murders erase any Woodstock love buzz.  Los Angeles is in a Strategy of Tension for months before any arrests.  <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/inside-the-lc-the-strange-but-mostly-true-story-of-laurel-canyon-and-the-birth-of-the-hippie-generation-part-vii/"><em>Polanski&#39;s wife was the daughter of U.S. military intelligence Lt. Col. Paul Tate.</em></a>.  There was a covert military facility in Laurel Canyon called Lookout Mountain.  Most of the Southern California music scene also lived around Lookout Mountain.  Most of these musicians are children of parents who work for the Pentagon, including Jim Morrison, Frank Zappa, &quot;Papa&quot; John Phillips &amp; Steven Stills.  Polanski suspects John Phillips in the killings.  Phillips is later arrested for narcotics trafficking &amp; accused by his daughter of having a long-term incestuous relationship with her since her childhood.  1970s conspiracy theorist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhr-wPVvNOw">Mae Brussell claimed that U.S. military intelligence were the actual culprits of the Tate murder</a>, not the Manson Family.  Manson himself has a steep history of Deep State links.</p>

<p><strong>1974</strong>:  Polanski makes a detective movie (<em>Chinatown</em>) set in 1930s Los Angeles starring Jack Nicholson, an actor who has no birth certificate.  <em>Chinatown</em> is about <em>elite pedophilia, incest, institutional murder, doppelgangers, and many other conspiracy topics.</em>  The film&#39;s villain is played by John Huston, who was <a href="https://battleofearth.wordpress.com/2012/03/10/inside-the-lc-the-strange-but-mostly-true-story-of-laurel-canyon-and-the-birth-of-the-hippie-generation-part-xviii/">friends with a pedo &amp; Satanist serial killer</a> at the heart of Hollywood social circles.</p>

<p><strong>1976</strong>:  Polanski directs <em>The Tenant</em>, a small-scale conspiracy &amp; paranoia film.</p>

<p><strong>1977</strong>:  Polanski was arrested at Jack Nicholson&#39;s home for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey.  Victim&#39;s attorney arranged a plea bargain in which five of the six charges would be dismissed, and Polanski accepted.  As a result of the plea bargain, Polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of &quot;Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a minor&quot; and <em>was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at California Institution for Men at Chino</em>, one of the sites where MKULTRA was developed.   Upon release after 42 days, Polanski agreed to the plea bargain, his penalty to be time served along with probation. However, he learned afterward that the judge, Laurence Rittenband, had told some friends that he was going to disregard the plea bargain and sentence Polanski to 50 years in prison: &quot;I&#39;ll see this man never gets out of jail,&quot; he told Polanski&#39;s friend, screenwriter Howard E. Koch.  Polanski left the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>1988</strong>:  Polanski makes the thriller <em>Frantic</em> with Harrison Ford.    At the center of the thriller is a stolen nuclear trigger called a Krytron.  In real life, 810 of these Krytron nuclear triggers were smuggled on behalf of billionaire Israeli Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.  At the time of the film, this is not known.  Milchan&#39;s role as a <del>Mossad</del> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekem">Lekem</a> agent &amp; arms smuggler is revealed in 2011.  Regarded as a Hollywood liberal, Milchan claimed to have used intelligence connections to promote the apartheid regime in South Africa in exchange for it helping Israel acquire uranium for its nuclear program.</p>

<p><strong>2010</strong>:  Upon completion of the film <em>The Ghost Writer</em> (spoiler:  about a Tony Blair-style former British Prime Minister connected to CIA &amp; Halliburton who is going to be charged with war crimes), but before the film itself is released, <em>Interpol suddenly decides to arrest Polanski for his 1977 U.S. crime.</em>  The film contains a scene depicting CIA as being connected to a real life group called the Aspen Institute, a Colorado Neocon think tank involved in the Valerie Plame affair and linked to Cheney and Scooter Libby.  Much is made of CIA infiltration of politics &amp; theater &amp; universities internationally.</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong>:  Polanski tried to make a film with novelist Robert Harris about Pompeii, revisiting themes of <em>Chinatown</em> with conspiracy, water rights, and political power.  After this film project could not get financing, Polanski is currently preparing to direct <em>&quot;D&quot;</em>, a film about the notorious Dreyfus affair in the 19th century, in which one  of the French Army&#39;s general staff was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to the German Empire and sent to Devil&#39;s Island.  In other words, another Deep State conspiracy film.</p>

<p>No doubt, Polanski raped a 13 year old.</p>

<p>No doubt, <em>before it happened</em>, Polanski&#39;s wife was murdered surrounded by Deep State clues.</p>

<p>By all means, be disgusted by Polanski.</p>

<p>But there is a lot to learn from Polanski&#39;s film clues &amp; reasons for sudden Interpol arrest.</p>

<p>One more interesting question would be why Polanski, at age 83, is trying to return to Los Angeles.  Why now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in all seriousness (in the context of r/conspiracy) what&#39;s the deal with Jerry Seinfeld? I love his comedy but given his popularity I wonder if he&#39;s been co-opted or if he supports weird secret initiatives etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who knows? He was dating that knockout Shoshanna whateverhername is when she was like 17 and he was 40-something, right? And the Dakota is a notorious occult hangout, for sure. </p>

<p>I also remember that strange out-take from &quot;Rick &amp; Morty&quot; where they had a clip from an alternative reality&#39;s TV shows and one of them was a &quot;Seinfeld in Space&quot; comedy segment where that world&#39;s Jerry was doing a standup routine joking about killing underaged Hispanic boys and burying them in the backyard. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of the guy as a comedian, or at least his long-running TV series, or at least until Larry David left his TV show. I suspect he&#39;s probably as much murderer and fucker of underaged girls as any of the super wealthy celebrities/so-called &quot;elites.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t always agree with Mathis by far, but I thought his piece about the Manson Murders was pretty great...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what to make of Mathis, but I will say he&#39;s got two pieces that deserve wider readership: The Stephen Hawking one and the Lincoln assassination one. The latter builds upon Dave McG&#39;s work pretty well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read his Manson murders piece. I&#39;ve read most of this stuff, including the recent one where he claimed Trump only got 10-15% of the vote and the election was totally stolen from Clinton. A very curious and obvious....error? Lie? Delusion? Definitely undermined a lot of his other work with that one.</p>

<p>Anyway. Back to the Manson piece. Loaded with intriguing information and a lot of good points, but also some super dumb dot connecting, like the bit about the Brady Bunch bedroom being the same as the bedroom where the pix were taken of the murder scene.</p>

<p>Mathis uses photos a similar notch in the bedpost between a pair of bunk beds in each picture to claim that it&#39;s the same bunk bed set. Anybody who knows about bunk beds knows EVERY bunk bed set has that notch; it&#39;s where the two bedposts connect, held in place by a small medal rod. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to make of the guy. He&#39;s obviously disinfo, but he&#39;s also giving us some truth. The Stephen Hawking pdf seems totally on the money to me. </p>

As it turns out, Jack Nicholson has no birth certificate. Until 1954, by which time he was nearly an adult, he did not officially exist. Even today, the closest thing he has to a birth certificate is a ‘Certificate of a Delayed Report of Birth’ that was filed on May 24, 1954. The document lists John and Ethel Nicholson as the parents and identifies the location of the birth as the Nicholson’s home address in Neptune, New Jersey.</p>

<p>TIL Jack Nicholson didn&#39;t have a birth certificate until he was an adult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC Polanski also wanted Sharon Tate as the lead in Rosemarys baby and she even did some promo work for the film. Kind of an eerie coincidence that she was later killed while pregnant. Perhaps a blood sacrifice.</p>

<p>Manson also had MK ultra connections. I&#39;ve also wondered if he was being triggered by the Beatles album. If the Manson narrative is true then maybe he wasn&#39;t crazy, but just programmed that way. Much like the wind up toys we see today.</p>

<p>There is definitely more good stuff to the music scene back then. I can&#39;t remember anything in particular right now though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a podcast called &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; that did a 12 part series on Manson.  It goes into a lot of detail about Polanski, Sharon Tate, the White album, etc. etc.  A great place to start to kick off further reading.</p>
