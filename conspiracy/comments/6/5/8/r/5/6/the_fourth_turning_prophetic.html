       I was reading an article earlier today about Stephen Bannon and his affinity towards
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/06aiwL7.jpg">
        The Fourth Turning by William Strauss and Neil Howe.
       </a>
       I decided to give the book a shot and it is turning out to be very prophetic. Written in 1997 it purports that history is cyclical and comes in natural cycles, which we are in the fourth cycle of. The
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/aqD3iBW.jpg">
        first
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/B0SkVCC.jpg">
        second
       </a>
       pages mirror today's underlying feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further on it
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gscP3Z1.jpg">
        states that around 2005 there will be a spark that will set off the fourth turning. Which is clearly 9/11, the Afghanistan and Iraq invansions and the 2008 recession. It states that before 2025 an event equitable with the American Revolution, the Civil War, and WW2 will occur.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It purports, WINTER IS COMING. I find the basis of the book and its prophecies steeped in history fascinating. Has anyone read this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Written 20 years ago, it's blowing my mind as I sit here in 2017 reading it.
      </p>

       I believe the civil violence is true. A lot of people don't recognize social media as a huge form of what people are feeling and those sites are battlegrounds. It seems minuscule but as time and technology has advanced, this is an easier way to fight with each other.

       So true. Reddit itself has become somewhat of a cultural battleground. We are more connected as a people than ever before in human history but that also gives us ample opportunity for more cultural calamity and upheaval.

      <p>
       With all the recent talk about a possibility of WW3 given the situations in Syria and North Korea and the new era Russian McCarthyism hysteria I find us as a people barreling down the path to what Strauss and Howe label as equitable with great conflicts like WW2.

       I believe we're already in a "soft" civil war. This election has deeply divided people like never before. Then there's factions on the left that are further dividing people by things like race and gender, using identity politics. The internet is a readable form of our psyches, and I feel yah that empathy, and even basic concern for others outside those in one's "circle" or echo chamber is hitting a devastating low point. It's almost like it was all done by design...

       You hit the nail on the head. The book discusses that people have become too individualized and the sense of a collective or community has died away. People have become more partisan and don't hold near as much esteem for our once bedrock institutions and collective ideals.

       Jesus that is some fascist propaganda if I've ever seen it. Not to dismiss many of the points made, because the left is guilty of many of them, but the way that is presented is horrifying. "Clenched fist of truth." That was not about unity, that was about dominance.

       Yes, but the left has been corrupted and indoctrinated, and these protests and uprisings are being planned and financed. Then the "solution" from a group (likely controlled) on the other side is to arm yourself and fight back. I feel we are being programmed for civil war.

       In the book it states that Americans can overcome any potential trajectory and calamity and we can rise to the occasion, so to speak, ushering in an even better society. Nothing is set in stone but it gives numerous examples of history repeating itself.

       I didn't know that. I appreciate the information. However just because an individual is either loosely or closely tied with another shouldn't hinder their overall message, especially when it's a sound, reasoned one.

       Do you see the move here? It's a contingency plan in case they need a reason to crash the dollar and "move to sound money" (i.e. take all the gold they bought with paper and run away)

       I appreciate the appreciation for the message. This is one of the things I took from
       <strong>
        The Learned Elders of Zion
       </strong>
       , but when I gave it chance I felt the same way as you feel about this. Things just make sense when you read them and you realize that it matches what has happened and probably is going to happen. Really scary how people can be very perceptive of the future. There are probably books out there that perfectly describes future events at a small and giant timescale.

       Just keep on connecting with people and make them aware what's really happening without sounding like a tinfoil afficionado. Time will come where in the faces you see on Facebook comments will vanish, victimized by this well castrated war on terrorists planted by themselves. No more dank memes in the comment box for us if that ever happens. Fuck them hard before they hit us!

       (Note: I wrote this comment originally in another thread that was deleted by that OP. I'm cross-posting my comment here as it seems relevant to this thread. I've been looking for a place to discuss these concepts which I find fascinating and I look forward to any responses.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be great to see an article or review from a journalist that actually took the time to read and understand The Fourth Turning. I read it back in the late 1990s and a couple of times since and have discussed the concepts with friends many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one concept can capture or should be solely used to describe the complexity of the march of human events or to organize human history but the book does provide an interesting framework that can be helpful to understand the broad shifts that seem to take place in our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, my summation is that book's central premise says that blocks of generations are raised with certain common experiences which color their decisions as the generations each move into power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fourth Turning postulates this creates a four-part cyclical pattern which happens in roughly four, 20-year cycles. The book is clear that you can't set your watch by it and there has been at least one famous collapse of the US cycle (which resulted in the US Civil War) but they show examples of the cycles they call (First Turning) American High, (Second Turning) Awakening, (Third Turning) Unraveling and (Fourth Turning) Crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the current cycle we are in, the "Fourth Turning" also known as the "Crisis Era," started with the 9/11 attacks. That event would be described in the book as a catalyst event which completely changed the mood of the country and propelled the US into the Crisis Era. (Remember, the book was written in the 1990s.) You can see the dividing line if you look at all the attitudes and views of events that were different before and after 9/11/2001. The attacks didn't cause the crisis era, they were just a catalyst to release the built-up pressure for societal change.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, Trump is a product of the crisis era and a part of the crisis situation. The reaction to Trump, his policies and the corruption inherent in his administration may help precipitate a worldwide upheaval which should close the crisis era and send us into the next turning in about 2020 or so. Again, the timing is variable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the youth and others of today that are so stridently against Trump and his attitudes as the cap to this last 16 years or so. Their viewpoints and actions may be influenced by this time period for decades to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       The backlash against Trump's four years of power and the events during this time period may propel us into the next turning which would be the American High. While there may be relative stability and perhaps economic prosperity during this next era, this is a time of strong institutionalism and weak individualism. The rights of the individual may be sublimated as a reaction to the conclusion of the crisis era.
      </p>
      <p>
       For comparison's sake the book says last four turning's in the US were: 1. American High: about 1945 (end of WWII) to early 1960s 2. Awakening: early 1960s to about mid 1980s 3. Unraveling: mid-1980s to Sept 11, 2001 4. Crisis: 9/11/2001 to about 2020

      <p>
       You hit the nail on the head. The book discusses that people have become too individualized and the sense of a collective or community has died away. People have become more partisan and don't hold near as much esteem for our once bedrock institutions and collective ideals.

       Jesus that is some fascist propaganda if I've ever seen it. Not to dismiss many of the points made, because the left is guilty of many of them, but the way that is presented is horrifying. "Clenched fist of truth." That was not about unity, that was about dominance.
