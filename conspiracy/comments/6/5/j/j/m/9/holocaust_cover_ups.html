<p>My question stems from Spicer saying Hitler didn&#39;t use chem weapons on his own people.  I was talking to my buddy about it and he feels that he actually didn&#39;t.  He says it was cheaper and easier to just let the prisoners starve to death and that TPTB installed the chemical hardware in the concentration camps to make it easier to punish war Crimes.  I&#39;ve never been one to deny or even question the Holocaust and I know alot about traditional WWII history, but it did make me think.  And given the lies spewn from our current media and government it&#39;s becoming easier to believe.  </p>

<p>I guess ultimately my question is both what do you guys think of that idea, and does anyone have any evidence on either side?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zyklon B was used in the German prison camps to disinfect clothing and other materials from typhus-spreading lice and their eggs.</p>

<p>Its active ingredient is cyanide, but no autopsy ever revealed death by cyanide poisoning in one of the labor camps. Cyanide turns corpses pink, and walls blue. In the camps we do see blue walls, in the disinfecting rooms, but no pink bodies were ever identified.</p>

<p>Far from wanting the prisoners to starve to death, shaving their heads and gassing their clothing was part of an effort to keep them alive. Many died of starvation due to a lack of supplies and food, as the German railways were being saturation-bombed by the Allies.</p>

<p>Allied bombing didn&#39;t have much of an effect on Nazi rails until late into the warz after most of the killing had been done.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have much trouble moving men and materiel.</p>

<p>And strange that camp guards enjoyed rich meals with those &quot;ruined&quot; rails. Very strange indeed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Please do. You&#39;ll see the ICRC attesting to large scale murders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Red Cross was stationed at all Nazi internment camps throughout the duration of the war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>they weren&#39;t.   </p>

<p>The ICRC also readily attests to this. You can read their comments where they weren&#39;t allowed into specific camps and given handheld, guided tours of others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>.. The Red Cross recorded all deaths and cause of deaths.</p>

<p>They actually didn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest thing that people fail to understand about the Third Reich and the Holocaust is how big the whole thing was. People say &quot;Hitler&quot;, but he wasn&#39;t the micromanaging dictator. He spent most of his time in Germany while the SS operated camps. So, some camps were extremely harsh and brutal and others were less so. Only a handful had gas chambers: Sobibor, Treblinka, Belzec, Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and Chelmno. Those are the only ones discovered to have facilities for extermination and disposal of bodies. Hitler certainly knew about those, but there was a lot that he simply didn&#39;t know about. His subordinates in the SS did a lot of stuff under a kind of blanket blessing, but nothing specific. This really goes toward the complexity of the issue: the way it is taught in school is that the Reich was a well-oiled machine, but it wasn&#39;t. It was rife with power plays and deception - much harder to teach to the masses. </p>

<p>Someone mentioned the Red Cross making records and being stationed at all camps. In 20 years of researching this time period and these events, I have only ever heard of them being at Teresienstadt, sometimes called Terezin. Terezin was supposed to be a model camp. Inmates were supposedly treated better, families kept together, etc. The Red Cross checked in there, but I have never heard of them going to another camp. If someone has info on that, I want to read it. The Red Cross is supposed to be a neutral medical organization, but if you have RC reps going into camps, where were they coming from? If they were German, it&#39;s likely they would have been under Nazi control or influence. </p>

<p>I also wonder how people reconcile the massive amounts of starved bodies that we have evidence of, both from Allied and Nazi photographers. Where did all those people come from and why were they there, if numbers were so much lower?</p>

<p>As for Spicer, I think he&#39;s just dumb and flustered and didn&#39;t know what he was talking about. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I&#39;ll enjoy your downvotes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Birkenau and a couple of the others have been proven to have no gas chambers. I can&#39;t remember the names, I&#39;ll find them in a bit.</p>

<p>For now I&#39;ll focus on two of your points but I want to say this before: I DO NOT DENY THE HARMING OF HEBREWS, GIPSYS OR ANYONE ELSE. NOR DO I DENY THAT THE NAZI&#39;S WERE A TERRIBLE BLIGHT. NOR DO I DENY THAT HITLERS WAS A FUCKING PSYCHO PATH.</p>

<p>Like the election I feel like I need to get that out of the way as people assumed I was pro-Trump because I hated Hillary. Just like when you discuss this topic people assume you&#39;re a NAZI or Anti-Semite if you disagree with some of the mainstream propaganda we were exposed to as children. </p>

<p>1) Birkenau was proven not to have any one gassed there. In fact the actual sign at the site post-WWII says, and I quote, &quot;No one was gassed at this site.&quot; Directly under saying it was a gas chamber. It was also proven to be a fully functioning shower which makes the likelihood of it being a gas chamber next to 0%, while actual holocaust mainstream supporters have declared it completely false that there ever was a gas chamber. </p>

<p>2) Those bodies came from Allied bombing campaigns. Infact a lot of the video footage I was shown in the Canadian curriculum was a town that was bombed, while being portrayed as evidence of the holocaust. The bodies were blown apart etc... Yet I never asked that question as a child due to the well-made shock value of the clips. The classic video of the American driving the bulldozer pushing the bodies into a massive grave is one such videos. Those bodies all died from disease after supplies had been cut off to the interment camps due to allied advances. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are there any accounts from Allied forces that corroborate these points? So, who were those bodies - I was thinking of the bulldozer footage as well? Where did they come from - surrounding villages or the camps? If the camps, why where there so many people there, if not genocide and making dissenters disappear? </p>

<p>Also, what are some good sources on the gas chambers/showers? They did have working showers. Many people were out through the showers as part of the intake process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot of the videos and pictures we&#39;re actually shown to perpetuate the devastation are from Nordhausen. We bombed the fuck out of Nordhausen, and the classic pictures of bodies lined up and graves being dug are from Nordhausen. Which as we now know, never gassed anyone and had hardly any one killed until near the end of the war when supplies were cut off. Remember we were devastating all German infrastructure(kind of one of those necessary evils) so the Germans themselves were starving, chances are political prisoners like Poles etc... were not getting any of the little food they had left.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.rs/search?q=holocaust+nordhausen&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTtICM_qbTAhURahoKHW5rCXoQ_AUIBigB&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=662#imgrc=Wkbs0GiJ7rsxpM:">https://www.google.rs/search?q=holocaust+nordhausen&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTtICM_qbTAhURahoKHW5rCXoQ_AUIBigB&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=662#imgrc=Wkbs0GiJ7rsxpM:</a></p>

<p>Those images were shown to me in numerous videos throughout school, except with one minor detail. They left out it was Nordhausen, and usually used them after terms like Auschwitz etc.. </p>

<p>As to answer your question on why so many people were there, it was a city. Those are German civilians killed along with people in the camps. Most of the bodies we are shown in footage is from camps we definitively know had no gas chambers or were not death camps, and the civilians caught as collateral damage. </p>

<p>Well one that I find really absolutely disturbing regarding your question about gaschambers is that old lady who lied on the NBC video. She is an alleged holocaust survivor and her story is that they went down stairs into Auschwitz gas chamber and there was holes in the ceilings(for Zikon-3) and water came out of the showers. Then when she came out people hugged her and said &quot;you know where you were? a gas chamber&quot;. Now highly doubtful that some dude just pressed the wrong button, but completely possible. What really irks me about it is she lies about her time in the camps too, she says she was there for just under a month when records show she was there 2 days. This woman was given the award that&#39;s 3 ranks below Knighthood and no one ever addressed the fact she lied about how long she was in there. 
(found it)
Her name is Gina Turgel but used to be Gina Goldfinger</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/auschwitz-survivor-gena-turgel-walked-out-gas-chamber-alive-n293496">http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/auschwitz-survivor-gena-turgel-walked-out-gas-chamber-alive-n293496</a></p>

<p>They cut out in the white flash the part where she says the water comes out, which is kind of fucked up. Why cut that part out?</p>

<p>Anyways I have learned that I do question the extent of it now, which I hate and had to deal with a large part of my own cognitive dissonance regarding the subject.</p>

<p>Still searching for a link to the bulldozer video but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s from Buchenwald and those prisoners all died of Typhus. I&#39;ll keep searching</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to back off my statement for the death camps you named being wrong. It appears you&#39;ve labelled the ones that have yet to be proven otherwise. I apologize for that. </p>

<p>His rebuilding of Germany was financed by debt and looting other nations, always a solid sustainable strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What in the flying fuck has happened to this sub. I come back after a year and everyone has embraced fucking Nazi propaganda with a fervour that genuinely scares me.</p>

<p>And as someone who grew up around men and women who survived the holocaust and​ fought in World war 2, with the stories they told and the incredible losses they suffered.</p>

<p>Fuck everyone single one of you Nazi bastards. I hope you all someday experience even a fraction of the horror you&#39;re so eager to deny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, let&#39;s stop arguing about what happened between the Nazis and Jews prior to 1945.  Let&#39;s assume that Hitler and the Nazis did everything they were accused of.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had the Nuremberg trials, Wiesenthal hunted down many of the remaining war criminals, and history has recorded their evil deeds.</p>

<p>In 2017, Israel and the Zionism are the cancer today.  We should have never established Israel in 1948.  The vast majority of Jewish people had no interest in moving to Palestine.  The Zionists wanted this.</p>

<p>We need to be able to openly discuss that Israel and Zionism are the primary stumbling blocks to peace in the middle east.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I misunderstand the whole point of this thread, but the simple opening of discussion about historical facts does not make anyone a Nazi.  I highly doubt most of the people here sympathize in the slightest with Nazis, even if they didn&#39;t use gas.  If anything its more Nazi like to try to block an open conversation, like you are doing, that implying that the history we&#39;ve been taught may not be one-hundred percent true.</p>

<p>Do you have any sources to disprove me that aren&#39;t blatantly Jewish our reporting a number that was reported by someone else.</p>

<p>And trying to imply that the Shoah Museum states that just 300k died in the extermination camps. Oh boy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I am implying. I&#39;m implying the only people who even have the audacity to suggest it was 6 million are those who profit off the Holocaust such as the Holocaust memorial etc</p>
