       You guys in this sub seem to be the most against globalism of any sub I have come across. I just have one question: Why is globalism such a bad thing? Seems to me that it cannot be a good or bad thing at all. It's just a thing. Could you guys explain to me your side? I'll also be asking the inverse of this question in the most pro-globalism sub I can find.

       When there is more than one super power there is a sort of check in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, whenever there is only one superpower the people suffer as there is a monopoly in global power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be as if we were moving to a one store market where all goods had to be purchased from one store. That store would have all the pricing power as there is no competition to protect the consumers interests.

       I don't really think so; a lot of people on this sub would support the global brotherhood of man but use the term  "Globalist" to refer to neo-conservatives.

       Do you want more government or less government? With globalism you're getting a world government. So you'd better be sure you love more overreaching tyrannical government and are okay with being microchipped and deracinated. It takes the blind faith of a child and a love for authority to think that the elites are seeking to establish a world government because they want world peace or want what is best for the average citizen or whatever.

       Because the needs and culture of a person living in Texas are vastly different than those of a person living in Tokyo and 1 government with 1 set of laws wouldn't work. Also, world government = bigger government. I don't think it's any great mystery why people on here don't like the idea of the biggest government ever...

       It's the complete opposite of independence. It's interdepence. Time will tell if it can actually prevent war. The idea is making war too costly for any nation when their way of life is dependent on the other. One going war collapsing the system for all and affecting life within ones supposed borders. It's an idea young in the scope of the world but and the UN and international are supposed to be its functioning form of governance. The UN security council has few permanent members and grants power to few nations and disallows the permanent privilege to others. Permanent members of the UN security council recklessly violate international law. By far and alone the United States.  The UN meets in a permanent  location and has a permanent host. UN security council take seats amonest eachother primarily to disagree with eachother. The UN has few if any accomplishments. It's most noteworthy have been within the field of medicine and education if one must note positives , but the model is broken and will be severed in time by mankinds inherent nature to kill eachother

       Like a car that can be driven by a good hearted person running errands for the old people in his/her neighborhood or a maniac running down children in a schoolyard, I agree that "globalism" itself is not the problem. It's the people who are running it.

       Becase  if a government goes rabid, you need to be able to get away from it to somewhere else.

       The idea of globalism isn't bad. It is the implementation they are trying, and the intent behind it that I object to.

       It's essentially slavery, structuring the world like a big old plantation.

       Also, government means mind control (govern =control, ment =mental) and I kind of like being able to think what I want.

       Too early for globalism... I live in a first world country... globalism seems to take everyone's quality of life and average it across the entire world population. Which is great for 3rd world countries, but kinda sucks for the ones taking a hit on quality to bump up the others.

       Looking at another standpoint then political - look at it psychologically as well. 
The moving goal behind globalism is to make everyone the same. To get rid of diversity.
We can already see why this is terrible with todays youth. Nobody can deny this fact. 
There's a reason the most popular 'youtube stars' - movie stars - rappers and singers all sound the same and act the same.
The goal is to make everyone the same, but the same in a sense of ignorance + blank minded thinking. 
It is much easier to do whatever corruption you would like when the world doesn't know how to be individuals and ask questions.

       There is overlap between many different tendencies in opposition to 'globalism', but they are not talking about the same thing or providing same reasons.  There is the globalism which means different linguistic and cultural groups end up mixing. Some think this is a negative result.  There is a healthy suspicion to centralized power, and a global government is as centralized as you can get.  There is the opposition to the economic order that has emerged since the second world war.  Corporations have been deregulated and this deregulation was an international event allowing them to move freely country to country.  We had massive generation of wealth and productive gains, however all this wealth went to the top just to have corporations move elsewhere to exploit cheaper labor.   So there is opposition to this international order.

       That is not to say that international institutions and frameworks are necessarily bad. Most of this thinking goes back to Kant's seminal essay 'Perpetual Peace', where he gives philosophical preconditions for what it would take to have it.  It is still relevant.
