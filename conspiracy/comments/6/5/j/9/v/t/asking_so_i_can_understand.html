<p>Historically, whenever there is only one superpower the people suffer as there is a monopoly in global power.</p>

<p>It would be as if we were moving to a one store market where all goods had to be purchased from one store. That store would have all the pricing power as there is no competition to protect the consumers interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the complete opposite of independence. It&#39;s interdepence. Time will tell if it can actually prevent war. The idea is making war too costly for any nation when their way of life is dependent on the other. One going war collapsing the system for all and affecting life within ones supposed borders. It&#39;s an idea young in the scope of the world but and the UN and international are supposed to be its functioning form of governance. The UN security council has few permanent members and grants power to few nations and disallows the permanent privilege to others. Permanent members of the UN security council recklessly violate international law. By far and alone the United States.  The UN meets in a permanent  location and has a permanent host. UN security council take seats amonest eachother primarily to disagree with eachother. The UN has few if any accomplishments. It&#39;s most noteworthy have been within the field of medicine and education if one must note positives , but the model is broken and will be severed in time by mankinds inherent nature to kill eachother </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at another standpoint then political - look at it psychologically as well. 
The moving goal behind globalism is to make everyone the same. To get rid of diversity.
We can already see why this is terrible with todays youth. Nobody can deny this fact. 
There&#39;s a reason the most popular &#39;youtube stars&#39; - movie stars - rappers and singers all sound the same and act the same.
The goal is to make everyone the same, but the same in a sense of ignorance + blank minded thinking. 
It is much easier to do whatever corruption you would like when the world doesn&#39;t know how to be individuals and ask questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is overlap between many different tendencies in opposition to &#39;globalism&#39;, but they are not talking about the same thing or providing same reasons.  There is the globalism which means different linguistic and cultural groups end up mixing. Some think this is a negative result.  There is a healthy suspicion to centralized power, and a global government is as centralized as you can get.  There is the opposition to the economic order that has emerged since the second world war.  Corporations have been deregulated and this deregulation was an international event allowing them to move freely country to country.  We had massive generation of wealth and productive gains, however all this wealth went to the top just to have corporations move elsewhere to exploit cheaper labor.   So there is opposition to this international order. </p>

<p>That is not to say that international institutions and frameworks are necessarily bad. Most of this thinking goes back to Kant&#39;s seminal essay &#39;Perpetual Peace&#39;, where he gives philosophical preconditions for what it would take to have it.  It is still relevant.  </p>
