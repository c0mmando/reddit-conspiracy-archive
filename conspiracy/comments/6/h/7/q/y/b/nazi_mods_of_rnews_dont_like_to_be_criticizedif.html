       Following is my reply when a user asked me to back up my claim the larger subs are Controlled and Manipulated.  After I posted the below comment, the user then messaged the mods of r/news and r/politics asking them for comment.  r/news nazis instantly banned me (couldn't give a fuck since I haven't participated there in well over a year, when I was banned there for the first time).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       r/news banned me for simply posting links critical of the F-35...if you consistently post articles critical of the PentaCon they'll ban you, too.  Even if it's from a more MSM source like Reuters.  r/news also took down a post I made about James Blake being tackled by NYPD--I had posted the original article's title (plus a quote, which was allowed) as written by NY Daily News--mods took it down because it had NYPD in the title.  Then I posted a copycat article by the Guardian (which was sourced entirely on info from the NYDN article) --it stayed up and got got to #2 or 3 (because no mention of NYPD was in the title).  Original post would have most likely stood at 1 and stayed there for quite a while--so the mods essentially removed the post which had an actual quote by the victim, James Blake (former US tennis pro).
      </p>
      <p>
       In r/worldnews and r/politics I've experienced the comment section being Rigged--with my comments being slid down the comment thread (even though they were far above any other comments in terms of upvotes...and, yes, I know they change the top comment after a few hours via algorithm).  I also had a post rocket to #1 in worldnews and then stall out and begin falling quickly (I swear they  turned the counter off--the mods said they can't do that...but I think the admins Can and Do.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish there was a good way to compare the number of articles from various sources in worldnews over the past 5 years--I'm guessing the MSM sources have become much more dominant; and the truly independent sources have seen noticeable reduction.  One time I caught the Front Page of worldnews with 18/25 articles sourced from just 3 sites: BBC, independent &amp; guardian.  I also think I caught them upvoting an article to try to displace mine--I actually reported their post and it got taken down (hilarious...I forget what the violation was, but I saw it moving very quickly, reported it with an authentic rules violation and they had to remove it).
      </p>
      <p>
       r/politics was one of the most noticeable subs to begin scrubbing content -- mods would just delete the post and leave a removal comment with a bot's tag.  Last year they began removing posts even 3 months old--so people searching for info can't find the article/post.  Despicable.  Ironic that r/politics hosted a Jesse Ventura AMA last year--they won't be accepting his RT show (channel is banned from sub).  I'm guessing the AMA was a paid promo for Jesse to market his book (and good propaganda for the sub).
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 is practically
       <em>
        verboten
       </em>
       in those subs (only exceptions are Saudi lawsuit posts, health of first responders and 9/11 victims' family statements). One of the admins even got caught admitting in a comment thread r/worldnews was started to
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3tkyhn/til_the_worldnews_subreddit_was_created/">
        <strong>
         specifically exclude 9/11 material

       So do you have any evidence of these submissions and comments that allegedly got you banned?
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense, but in my experience, 95% of the time when people are complaining about being censored, the real story is that they broke the rules of a subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right or wrong, if you break the rules you get banned....

       Another user asked me for further confirmation that r/politics is removing content...have you ever seen this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had posts as old as 3 months removed via bots there. (don't visit that sub anymore--but actually removing posts via bot is pretty over the top as it makes it allows the mods to censor topics).

       ever since they only allowed approved/mainstream sources to be posted there.  No more self posts, and only mainstream titles can be used.  They can remove anything they want and do so for anything controversial.  It's not worth the time anymore.
