       I know it's totally normal for a workplace to have a league.  Co-workers need to relax and socialize with each other.  It's great.  But this is fucking congress.  They are literally sitting ducks if someone wants to start a civil war.  Why don't they realize that any kind of group gatherings without proper security is just a really bad idea?  What universe do we live in?

       okay, but there's a big difference between gathering inside a building with high security scanners that won't let anyone else in, and hanging out at the local baseball diamonds.  "It's okay, we've got Jimmy watching out backs" wouldn't really be enough for me while I'm hanging out with multiple potential targets in a wide open field.

       no..  that is a misrepresentation of what I'm saying.
I'm saying don't hang out together in large group, together, in a wide open field where security clearances don't even exist.  It's literally fucking retarded.

       Actually in a wide open space is probably the best form of security. Closed together, even with right security, is when the most casualties occur. Dude had an AK and landed a couple non lethal shots out of a ton of shots.

       then why have no shootings happen AT congress, if they are more vulnerable there "even with the right security".  I think you are underestimating the capabilities of what the "right security" actually does.

       Because shootings of politicians in general are just rare occurances. They've been doing this baseball game for decades, first time a practice was shot up, yet alone a game when way more congressman are present as players and fans.

       There hasn't been this much political tension for decades, though.  There are many people who think we are on the brink of civil war because of all the recent events, mock assassinations, false flag attacks, etc.  Lightning is a rare occurance too, but when we are waving a 10 ft pole around in a storm, "rare" does not equal "likely".

       I'd say during the depression when democrats blocked all aid bills specifically to get people to blame republicans for the lack of aid was a pretty tense time. Civil rights era was pretty tense as well.

       50 shots fired supposedly, and only 1 hit a person. That is the bizarre bit to me. Dude has the wherewithal to acquire an AR15, but doesn't know how to shoot? Seems like with that many rounds he would have hit more people just on accident.

       Nah. The north Hollywood shooters had AKs and hit 1 person despite having armour piercing rounds and using thousands of rounds. Bullets are small, its amazing how many bullets can fly astray and hit nothing of value.

       No, I don't find it strange that they have the league.  The only question I have would be why very little security.  The 2 guards were only there for Scalise.  If he wasn't there, would there have been zero security?

       if you had a full army of security for every time they want to throw a ball around, how would they justify the expenses?  This is their leisure time.. of course they're not going to have their regular security in place.  I'm not sure why people are so surprised by this concept.  That's why I think it's a bad idea.  Group gatherings + wide open space + no security clearance + no security = sitting fucking ducks.

       I agree with you.  They were sitting ducks.  debating on the expense is another thing.  I'd be open to it but that's not really the point.  I'm just saying that I don't find it strange that they have the league and since they do, why it's not more secure.

       It's good for Democrats and Republicans to have personal relationships outside of politics. This was even more prevalent before the 90s, one of the reason politics is so partisan now is because Newt Gingrich in the 90s got rid of some activities like this.

       This has been going on forever. I lived in DC and played on one of the teams. It was a fun and loose way to see professional political people in a different setting. I'm glad and relieved they still do it.
