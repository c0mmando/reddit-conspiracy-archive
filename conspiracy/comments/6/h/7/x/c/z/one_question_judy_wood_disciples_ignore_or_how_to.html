       Hope that you will give her work another
       <em>
        look see
       </em>
       as your time might permit. She's been horribly maligned, IMHO from the get go and her work is really quite extensive. She deserves mad respect for standing up, holding her own ground and doing the best she can to present her Theory against so many dissenters.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has taken my roommate years to independently finally look at the scope of her Theory. It was only about a year ago that he finally conceded that 9/11 was an Inside Job! He was a full blown 9/11 Hijackers and it has been a long slow road.
      </p>
      <p>
       We both worked in and around heavy construction, as well as energy related sites across the US. The Sunshine Skyway bridge demo and reconstruction in our collective scope! I bailed when it came time to move to the Big Dig in NY - this country girl had had enough city noise!

       Yeah - I hear ya! I didn't own a TV on 9/11 and hadn't
       <em>
        watched
       </em>
       TV long before that. I was supposed to be flying to Alaska for my Mothers funeral, my neighbor woke me up banging on my apt. door (she was gonna keep an eye on my teen daughter) and I was super disoriented but had no clear idea what I was seeing until she screamed at me that all flights were grounded and her husband, Air Force was
       <em>
        activated
       </em>
       ! Then she said, "Terrorists...they say it's terrorists!"
      </p>
      <p>
       What is very telling about Dr Wood to me is her flat statement that she has no
       <em>
        family to put at risk by speaking out and seeking Truth
       </em>
       that she knew she would risk her 'standing, academic credentials and reputation' (or something along that line...) but she 'knew others wouldn't or couldn't do the same'. That to me is pretty dedicated and selfless.

       My eyes. And I don't mean to be a smartass. I think the truth lies somewhere between Woods's theory and the timed explosives theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did 80% of the towers' mass atomize? Yes. 
Can a massive explosive wave of timed detonations be seen traveling down the towers during both collapses? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the explosive substance used to convert mass into pyroclastic dust is not public knowledge, but my eyes tell me explosive force
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       used.
      </p>
      <p>
       That steers me away from the use of an energy weapon that simply atomized the structures causing them to fall.

       Whew! There's a relief! I also argue that she gets far too strident and defensive if you mention
       <em>
        any explosives
       </em>
       . My eyes and senses
       <em>

       I'm very excited on a personal level that my roommate, of his own volition
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       watched any interview with Dr. Judy Wood and
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       he asked which video I recommended that he watch for her extensive
       <em>
        walk thru
       </em>
       of her Theory. We sat down last night and watched a 2 hour plus compilation of her first two presentations in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       My roommate was, to say the least very intrigued, sold before we watched the long video and quite apologetic that it took so long to
       <em>
        entertain
       </em>
       Dr. Judy Wood and her Theory!

       There were reports from the War Theater of
       <em>
        strange weapons
       </em>
       that didn't burn clothing, but shrunk bodies, took off arms etc and these were unconventional weapons that Rumsfeld was asked about in a press conference!
      </p>
      <p>
       There's allegedly video of the falling bodies that
       <em>
        atomized
       </em>
       as they fell to the ground - that only a very few people have seen. There's also one fireman body supposedly recovered at the scene where his clothing (helmet to boots!) was there but his person was jellied or rather not an intact corpse.

       So, if I'm reading you correctly, you believe that explosives and incendiaries were used as a matter of redundancy, but that unconventional weapons likely also played a part in the event?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the Rumsfeld press conference you're referring to. He and his general seem to get a little warm under the collar when asked about these weapons. Not to mention the speculation around his bandaged hand.
      </p>

       Yes, I believe Redundancy was vital and that DEW was used.

       There was a radio show call in from years back and the caller was cut off - I've never seen a specific link, or any confirmation and I never
       <em>
        heard

       For someone to be informed would entail buying her book, reading it's very extensive content and making an informed decision based on your own understanding of the evidence she puts forward.

       She does not investigate the bathtub. She merely states it wasn't damaged, which directly contradicts her claim of magical weaponry.

       And yet her book has an entire chapter dedicated to 'the bathtub'. Seems like a chapter devoted to a non-investigation might be a little strange?
      </p>
      <p>
       And why would the bathtub be dustified?  The only way you can conclude that is if you've fallen for the 'Judy Wood space beams' crap.  If you had read the book, you'd have noticed that her theory doesnt involve 'space beams'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'd read her book and understood her theory, you'd also understand why the bathtub remained intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many areas of Judy's theory that i disagree with (and many that i agree with).. but the bath tub is a non-runner. It wasnt damaged, she says it wasnt damaged and she explains why.

       Dustification stops at street level? See, this is the horseshit I'm talking about. She makes no mention of how dustification (a made up word by Judy herself!) stops at ground level. She tries to protect herself but ends up as a contradictory disinformation specialist!

       So instead of just disagreeing blindly, why dont you give us a theory on why the bathtub WOULD be dustified?
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you're thinking the weapon is a 'top down' type? Because anything used perpendicular to the towers wouldn't have affected the bathtub. If thats the case you should be aware that Judy doesnt make any claims on the direction of the 'shot' (for want of a better word).

       I do not subscribe to Woods's theory, but, to be fair, the debris pile right after collapse was far smaller than it ought to have been. The amount of time it took to illegally clear the debris at the crime scene isn't relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something converted the majority of the matter in the towers into a pyroclastic cloud. Do I think it was an energy weapon? No. there is an observable explosive wave that travels down both towers as they come down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the substance used is likely not public knowledge. That's how theories like Woods's tend to arise. They try to explain that which is a mystery to us.

       I'm not doublespeaking. I'm stating that I do not believe an energy weapon was used on 9/11. Explosives of
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       type were used along with incendiaries to weaken and melt the steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider for a moment the possibility that the aforementioned explosives and incendiaries are of a class not known to the general public, and have a damage profile that is unlike their conventional counterparts with which we're familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judy Wood attacks people who claim explosives and incendiaries were used.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not double speak. It's hypothesis based on observation, and you ought not to be so quick to attack it.

       Wood has a very scientific approach to the whole thing; a much more appropriate and responsible attitude than supporters of the official narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything she hypothesizes on is derived from observed data (or unobserved).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the remnants of the site were destroyed instead of openly shared among a larger scientific community, you'll never be able to prove her wrong.

       THE DIRECTED ENERGY COVER-UP TEAM

       Other examples of Directed Energy (not necessarily used as a weapon) are radio waves, cell phone signals, TV remote control signals, wireless internet signals...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who want to cover up the evidence of what happen often falsely claim that Dr. Wood is talking about a specific weapon and a specific location of it (e.g. laser beam from outer space, or "spacebeams"). This disinformation campaign was initiated by Steven Jones on 11/11/2006 in a presentation he gave in California (available in the internet archives), telling his audience that "Judy Woods (Dr. Wood) says it's a laser or maser from space" while showing how difficult it is to hold his hand like a beam from space. Not only does Dr. Wood NOT SAY THAT, she actually RULES THAT OUT. The mechanism of destruction of a laser beam would be from heat and produce a bright and blinding light. But we know the buildings were not cooked to death. The term Directed Energy is used because energy is directed to do something different then it normally does and it is directed to do this within a certain geographic zone. [As a mental example, think of directing the binding energy of matter to repel instead of attract. A solid object would turn to atomic-sized dust. Direct this to happen within the WTC complex and not across the street.]

       My eyes. And I don't mean to be a smartass. I think the truth lies somewhere between Woods's theory and the timed explosives theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did 80% of the towers' mass atomize? Yes. 
Can a massive explosive wave of timed detonations be seen traveling down the towers during both collapses? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the explosive substance used to convert mass into pyroclastic dust is not public knowledge, but my eyes tell me explosive force
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       used.
      </p>
      <p>
       That steers me away from the use of an energy weapon that simply atomized the structures causing them to fall.
