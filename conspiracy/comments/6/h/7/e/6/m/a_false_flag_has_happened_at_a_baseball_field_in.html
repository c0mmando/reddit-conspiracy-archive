This is obviously a false flag in an attempt by the Trump administration in partnership with the deep state to take away guns from the citizens.  Very brazen that a congressman would be in on it, any chance anyone can comment that was there?  Were the bullets real?  Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>We cannot let them get away with this, we have to keep our guns!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what they don&#39;t get, the reason the attackers usually don&#39;t have guns is because it is so hard to get them. I think many gun owners imagine that if they were in a &quot;attack&quot; situation they would be the hero and kill the terrorist or whatever but that just never happens and they would be shot by police if they would try.</p>

<p>It is not a thing you can really discuss because people are seriously invested into their gun love.</p>

They are already extremely available to anyone wanting to inflict harm.

    <div class="md"><p>Well according to the office for national statistics in 2015 there were 27,487 crimes involving a knife. Of these 188 were homicides.</p>

<p>In the same year  (according to the gun violence archive) there were 53,637 incidents  (including legitimate use in self defence, 1,367 and 1,963 unintentional shootings  (which really is a pretty bad reflection on America)).  There were 13,484 deaths, far higher than the  % in the UK from knife crime. </p>

<p>Also that doesn&#39;t include suicides  </p>

<p>Btw you may see people saying the UK has a higher violent crime rate but in reality this likely isn&#39;t the case due to how broad violent crime is defined here compared to the US (shoving someone could technically count as violent crime here but it wouldn&#39;t in the US</p>

<li><p>This is not my post.  Not sure what made you think it was.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve already said &quot;I didn&#39;t say it was. Also, I didn&#39;t say it wasn&#39;t&quot; so that would mean I&#39;m open to the idea that this was just a crazy man with a gun.  If I had to bet, I&#39;d say that&#39;s probably most likely.  But I&#39;m also open to the idea that there is more to it.  I&#39;ll wait and see.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think for some people this is not about searching for truth, it might be more about entertainment, for others it might be about meeting some psychological need they have, idk? I&#39;m all for having an open mind, but let&#39;s not let our brains fall out, like you say, let&#39;s try and keep it rational and logical, this helps not only in the search for truth, but it also helps the community&#39;s credibility which is important when it comes to action being taken by outside forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like this is turning out to be quite effective.  The planning that went into this is actually pretty damn clever if you think about it.  Instead of crisis actors, we are getting soundbytes from the actual members of the government as &quot;eyewitnesses&quot;.  Much more concise and on message than a normal false flag.  No waiting for statements from them, instead we get the media going directly to them to give their eyewitness accounts.  They can steer the story exactly the way it needs to be... gotta give it to them, this was very well thought out.</p>
