    <div class="md"><p>I read a post on here a while ago that to make, produce, and get pharmaceutical drugs through the regulations are very expensive and time consuming because of all the vigorous testing they do. </p>

<p>People are living longer than ever now, which is one of the reasons for the higher cancer rate, there was also less knowledge and tools to diagnose cancer back then.</p>

<p>Part of the reason why cancer hasn&#39;t been cured, not that it&#39;s really a surprise considering we haven&#39;t cured even a fraction of diseases, is that cancer is your own cells going haywire, how do you find a cure for that and leave your body intact?</p>

<p>The website linked for &quot;natural cancer treatments&quot; looks like one of those infomercial clickbait sites tbh, if there was such a treatment that is effective against cancer but doesn&#39;t harm you, it would spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how steaming or boiling foods shouldn&#39;t be done either? Frying and the such i get but it doesn&#39;t explain the reasoning behind that? Organic foods also use pesticides and chemicals.</p>

<p>Again if it was as simple as a ketogenic diet, it would be impossible to suppress nowadays, Ottoburg&#39;s theory explained a consequence of cancer not the cause of it.</p>

<p>For example, heres one thing: The Rockefellers and Carnegie Mellon essentially bought out medical schools through donations and planting their own people within the board of directors as universities. This allowed them to phase out all naturopathic, &quot;alternative&quot; functional medicine and nutrition focus and replace it with pharmeceutical-based treatment only</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consuming the concentrated Oil orally rather than smoking it has a much larger effect and has treated people before that already had Chemo fail them.</p>

<p>There is one particular anecdote about a guys Stomach cancer being cured after he had already tried chemo and everything they had. He gave up but heard about the oil from his wife and he started eating oil 3 times a day just the size of a rice grain and he became cancer free.</p>

<p>I believe the compounds in the oil trigger or mimic our own &#39;Endo-Cannabinoid&#39; system to produce results</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cancer isn&#39;t a single disease, it&#39;s a catch-all for tons of different diseases where cells go on a runaway replication spree. There will never be a comprehensive cure for cancer because there&#39;s no realistic way a single cure would work for the myriad, sometimes drastically different diseases that fall under the banner of &quot;cancer&quot;. </p>

<p>It would be akin to finding a cure for AIDS, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis all in one. </p>
