    <div class="md"><p>I think the idea is lizards came before mammalians on an evolutionary scale. Meaning that if evolution is convergent lizards might have evolved elsewhere in the universe or even on the planet earth and have been intelligent.
Humans evolved from ape like creatures which evolved from lizard like creatures.  If you look into &quot;Triune Brain Theory.&quot; that is where some of these ideas are coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not even close. Study the mythology. They were conflated with fairies and reduced into a cutesy Keebler form you see now. This was when I was young, before I knew what they were really like. They are tall and have long silver hair with silver eyes. They are also very dangerous. I&#39;ve encountered them three times. Modern brits have run into them. I read a recent account where some gentry were hunting in the blacklands and came upon dense fog. They wandered into it and met a being as I described. He told them this was not their territory and to turn back. The men were very scared and asked who or what he was and he told them he was one of the old ones. He stated &quot;we hate your kind and if not for the truce would&#39;ve wiped you all way long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>In actuality there are humanoid ETs who resemble many animal archetypes, as depicted in many ancient art works. Canine and Lion-headed people from Sirius... And of course the Blue Avians, authors of the Law of One - contacts of Corey Goode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course.  There were no physical words exchanged between the both of us.  The snake&#39;s face was about 1/2 the size of mine.  The snake was mostly sizing me up after I had purged from the plant medicine.  I remember inviting the snake to enter inside my mouth into my body but he acknowledged that this was not necessary since I was already on the right path.  I felt like a million $s after the ceremony and hallucinations were over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never felt threatened when I had seen the image of him.  Now if I had actually seen this same snake in my physical senses world, I would probably shit myself.  </p>

<p>It is know that people see more than snakes when ingesting the Ayahuasca.  The next morning our group got together to discus what others had seen.  We had people recount images of snakes, jaguars, owls, and even brown bears.  Each animal represents a certain characteristic of a human being and there were always messages behind the reason of seeing them.  Our Shaman had told us that the snake was the most common seen animal when under the Aya. </p>

<p>My interpretation of the entire experience is this.  We are all ONE and all interconnected to one another.  G-d-Stars-Earth-Water-Plants-Animals-Humans and everything in between, below and above.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with seeing the serpent and receiving any message from him whether it was good or bad.  We are all ONE. </p>

<p>The more information you receive from any source the more educated you are in making decisions in your life.  The powers at be could have made people believe that serpents aka reptilian&#39;s were this nefarious beings.  I personally didn&#39;t believe this even after my experience and I would say I am good hearted in nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes he did. But he also brought with him the new covenant which nullifies many of the commands of the old covenant including the Jewish law recorded in Leviticus. It&#39;s clear to me that your understanding of Biblical text is extremely limited so let me explain. The Bible is comprised of different kinds of texts including historical, doctrinal, metaphorical, parables, and more. Most of what people tend to quote in order to demonize Christianity like you have comes from uncontextualized Old Testament historical record of old covenant Jewish law and goes further to prove or own theological ignorance than your original point. This is not in fact doctrinal Christian teaching. Christians at the most basic level believe the path to salvation lies in Jesus Christ alone, not through works or acts or sacrificial rituals. Christians are called to believe in Christ&#39;s death and resurrection, accept his forgiveness, and spread the gospel of the good news to every corner of the Earth.</p>

<p>As religions claws get slowly yanked from every aspect of our lives more and more will see that they do not need to take part in these fantasies. Fantasies that if a child came up with, they would be at a therapist immediately.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that ayahuasca is more to do with the 3rd eye chakra whereas San Pedro is more concentrated on the heart chakra. I personally had a very introspective experience where I was able to look deeply within myself and see certain things that I was unaware of before. It also helped to confirm my spiritual beliefs which I had before but sometimes doubted and has given me a deeper connection to the universe. I was able to see the energy flowing around me and this was stronger around living plants etc. As I havent done ayahuasca I couldnt give you a comparison, but that was my experience. This was done with a tobacco healing as well. Someone I met who was an extreme sceptic of anything spiritual has had their view completely changed as well after having San Pedro.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It is one of Christopher Booker’s basic plots that’s of most interest to us. He called it overcoming the monster. Every overcoming-the-monster story, Booker explains, unfolds essentially as follows. The story begins with a peaceful community learning of some menacing threat. A hero is called upon to battle the forces of evil. As the hero comes face to face with the evil, it seems that the evil is much more powerful than the hero. The hero may fall into the monster’s clutches. But the monster has one fatal weakness. Just when it seems that all hope is lost, the hero is able to exploit that weakness and vanquish the monster. The shadow is lifted, and peace returns to the community.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen this pattern played out in Gilgamesh, Beowulf, Jaws, and Bond. And we saw it at the very beginning of the chapter, in David Icke’s conspiracy theory of reality. Icke’s grand conspiracy theory is a classic overcoming-the-monster story; it traces every twist and turn, from the peaceful golden age of humanity and the looming shadow of evil, to the climactic final confrontation and the promise of a return to peace. It’s a dramatic, ongoing saga, and it casts us all in the starring role. And Icke is not unique. All conspiracy thinking plays on archetypes of good overcoming evil. </p>

<p>The best conspiracy theories have all the trappings of a classic underdog story. The enemy is formidable. From the Elders of Zion to the New World Order, from the weapons-industrial complex to Big Pharma, the names given to the conspirators often play up their allegedly overwhelming power and influence. Like every villain, however, the conspiracy has one fatal weakness; if only their schemes can be exposed to the light, the enemy becomes powerless.</p>

<p>And the motive for the fight is noble. Christopher Booker notes that archetypal heroes act not to further their own interests, but on behalf of others. “David challenges Goliath because the giant is threatening his country, Israel; James Bond’s villains are threatening England, the West, all mankind; Darth Vader, in Star Wars, is threatening to impose his tyranny over the entire universe.” And according to conspiracy theories, the conspiracy is a threat to the freedom, liberty, and well-being of all mankind.</p>

<p>At first blush, it seems odd that someone would embrace a position of disadvantage. But as we’ve seen, there are upsides to being an underdog. Without conspiracy theories, people like Wakefield, Duesberg, Jones, and Garrison are just wrong. If there is an ongoing campaign to smear their reputations and discredit their findings, however, they become courageous heroes pushing the frontiers of science by selflessly battling a powerful, sinister foe on behalf of the unsuspecting public. Even more than making heroes out of a few renegades, though, conspiracy theories offer to make heroic underdogs of us all. A conspiracy theory is an invitation to join an enlightened but embattled minority—an elect few who bravely, selflessly speak truth to power.</p>

<p>As Joseph Vandello notes, our understanding of underdogs is “shaped by inspirational archetypal stories of odds overcome.” In the real world, underdogs are, by definition, unlikely to prevail. In the stories we tell, however, the underdog always wins; good always triumphs over evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I disagree in general with the instinctual fear concept. It&#39;s a bit difficult to see how the snake or perhaps an Alligator translates into a fire spewing walking/talking large Dinosaur like creature through imagination.</p>

<p>If we look at spiders who are surely an instinctual feared species like snakes there&#39;s no imagined transformed spider like creature at least I am aware of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes of course.  There were no physical words exchanged between the both of us.  The snake&#39;s face was about 1/2 the size of mine.  The snake was mostly sizing me up after I had purged from the plant medicine.  I remember inviting the snake to enter inside my mouth into my body but he acknowledged that this was not necessary since I was already on the right path.  I felt like a million $s after the ceremony and hallucinations were over. </p>
