       Maybe the UAF is a Psyop and is going to say that the only thing that could have brought that building down was residual damage from the WTC 1&amp;2 Collapses + Fire. I would like to see the final findings before making any grand proclamations.

       The WTC 7 conspiracy is 100% proven. It is an impossibility for all steel frames to simultaneously melt as they did in the so called office fires. Fire fighters who were putting out the flames at the base of the building recall molten hot lava like melted steel all over the place. Micro Iron spheres was found in every debris sample from the building and the 9/11 commission said they shouldn't investigate because it's unlikely it is there. These Spheres can only be created in very great heat- way hotter than office fires could ever create. And let's say the government had nothing to do with this at all, then they would investigate the fact that the building free fell for 8 seconds which makes a controlled demolition obvious and would look into the possibility of a terrorist planting these bombs in a wag but even then, this building was was pulled damn near perfectly by grade A experts

       I am totally on board with the 9/11 conspiracy, have been for over a decade. I am just saying, until I see the report, and more importantly the final conclusion "YOUR GOVERNMENT IS LYING ABOUT 9/11" I am going to be skeptical. The fact that this is being funded by A&amp;E for 911 Truth is the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Put out ANOTHER study "proving" WTC7 happened just as we were told AND discredit A&amp;E for 9/11 Truth in the process.

       Nope that is not it at all. The dude is hard core wtf wtc7. He knows the truth and he has built a model to test it and is going to just give out the data for everyone else to test. UAF has been going through some serious budget struggles recently and the government may not be super willing to help them out after this but I can assure you the information does not support the official story at all.

       It's a back page story, debunked before it's released; minimal coverage. If all else fails there is the ol' "well yes we blew it up cos it was damage and we'd seen enough loss of life...and we didn't want to confuse the public with a subtle narrative". They have a lie for everything. You think the truth will make a difference?

       I truly hope it is..but have we not proved it to be false? Remember one of the people that was part of NIST during the investigation who came out last year and said it was all bullshit? It didn't get MSM coverage of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a "twoofer conspiracytard" was the one who pointed out to NIST that they didn't mention the building fell at free fall speeda for over 2 seconds. Their final report had to reflect that after being called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am 1000% down to spread these results everywhere from this study. I'm just saying what is the best case scenario? They say fire could not have been the only cause? MSM won't cover it and hasn't this already been banned from all engineering subs and shit? So basically r/conspiracy, 4chan and a few youtube video comments will discuss it.

       That would indeed discredit the story. It's a good thing Jones abandoned 9/11 stuff years ago. All he's talking about these days is how great Trump is (and Israel and the Saudis). And how bad "communist China" and the muslims are. I'm sure he's pushing the narrative that muslims were behind 9/11, and that the buildings came down because the "fires were just too intense".

       According to the "official narrative" WTC7 collapsed due to a raging inferno and residual damage from WTC1&amp;2 collapse. If a study from a DOE Accredited State University puts out a study that scientifically PROVES the official narrative is wrong it is ammunition to challenge the entire narrative. If they are lying about one "fact" what other "facts" are being lied about.

       Hey I hear ya brother. But as I mentioned in another comment we have already proven NIST's report to be bullshit. A few months ago a guy who worked with NIST during the investigation said it was all bullshit. MSM didn't make a peep. "Truthers" were also the reason NIST was forced to state that tower 7 fell at free fall for like 2.5 seconds. It was a member of A&amp;E.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying the MSM won't cover this no matter whatever the results are. This study has already been banned in several subs on reddit from what I've heard. "Debunker" idiots who say they rely on science but actually ignore science will just say this study was only one universities opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't this study just a model of the collapse? Best case scenario is they say it was impossible for tower 7 to have fell in the way NIST said it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am excited for the study. Let's just not expect this to be a game changer. But I'm down to try to spread the word as much as possible when the results are out.

       Most likely, the NSA/CIA/FBI/DIA/DoD are reading the emails and hacking their computers to snatch the results of the computer modeling of their study (especially since it's peer reviewed).  Wouldn't doubt if military/CIA has infiltrated the students/staff at UA, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should save/send copies to as many outlets as possible--but not sure that would do any good--since our corrupt media has proven their willingness to hide info from the public again and again and again.

       Well..it's not like the Air Force sold the Alaska HAARP facility to the University of Alaska two months after the WTC7 Evaluation was announced.

       Oh...wait. They did. Well...it's not like a massive earthquake will hit Alaska right before the report is released.

       "Selling" it gives the government cover in any future operations, which can now be blamed on research or experimental errors made by grad students.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Selling" it to a government owned and government managed entity allows ultimate control of the facility to be retained by the government.

       9/11 was any inside job, and  WTC 7 is basically the smoking gun. There is a university in  Alaska which is digging in to the details of the collapse and could potentially expose the guilty parties,  in this case,  Bush and co.

       The WTC 7 conspiracy is 100% proven. It is an impossibility for all steel frames to simultaneously melt as they did in the so called office fires. Fire fighters who were putting out the flames at the base of the building recall molten hot lava like melted steel all over the place. Micro Iron spheres was found in every debris sample from the building and the 9/11 commission said they shouldn't investigate because it's unlikely it is there. These Spheres can only be created in very great heat- way hotter than office fires could ever create. And let's say the government had nothing to do with this at all, then they would investigate the fact that the building free fell for 8 seconds which makes a controlled demolition obvious and would look into the possibility of a terrorist planting these bombs in a wag but even then, this building was was pulled damn near perfectly by grade A experts

       Nope that is not it at all. The dude is hard core wtf wtc7. He knows the truth and he has built a model to test it and is going to just give out the data for everyone else to test. UAF has been going through some serious budget struggles recently and the government may not be super willing to help them out after this but I can assure you the information does not support the official story at all.
