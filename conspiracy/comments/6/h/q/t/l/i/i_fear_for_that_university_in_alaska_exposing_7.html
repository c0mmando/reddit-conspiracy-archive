    <div class="md"><p>The WTC 7 conspiracy is 100% proven. It is an impossibility for all steel frames to simultaneously melt as they did in the so called office fires. Fire fighters who were putting out the flames at the base of the building recall molten hot lava like melted steel all over the place. Micro Iron spheres was found in every debris sample from the building and the 9/11 commission said they shouldn&#39;t investigate because it&#39;s unlikely it is there. These Spheres can only be created in very great heat- way hotter than office fires could ever create. And let&#39;s say the government had nothing to do with this at all, then they would investigate the fact that the building free fell for 8 seconds which makes a controlled demolition obvious and would look into the possibility of a terrorist planting these bombs in a wag but even then, this building was was pulled damn near perfectly by grade A experts </p>

I am just saying, until I see the report, and more importantly the final conclusion &quot;YOUR GOVERNMENT IS LYING ABOUT 9/11&quot; I am going to be skeptical. The fact that this is being funded by A&amp;E for 911 Truth is the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Put out ANOTHER study &quot;proving&quot; WTC7 happened just as we were told AND discredit A&amp;E for 9/11 Truth in the process. </p>

He knows the truth and he has built a model to test it and is going to just give out the data for everyone else to test.

    <div class="md"><p>I truly hope it is..but have we not proved it to be false? Remember one of the people that was part of NIST during the investigation who came out last year and said it was all bullshit? It didn&#39;t get MSM coverage of course.</p>

<p>Also a &quot;twoofer conspiracytard&quot; was the one who pointed out to NIST that they didn&#39;t mention the building fell at free fall speeda for over 2 seconds. Their final report had to reflect that after being called out.</p>

<p>I am 1000% down to spread these results everywhere from this study. I&#39;m just saying what is the best case scenario? They say fire could not have been the only cause? MSM won&#39;t cover it and hasn&#39;t this already been banned from all engineering subs and shit? So basically r/conspiracy, 4chan and a few youtube video comments will discuss it.</p>

<p>According to the &quot;official narrative&quot; WTC7 collapsed due to a raging inferno and residual damage from WTC1&amp;2 collapse. If a study from a DOE Accredited State University puts out a study that scientifically PROVES the official narrative is wrong it is ammunition to challenge the entire narrative. If they are lying about one &quot;fact&quot; what other &quot;facts&quot; are being lied about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I hear ya brother. But as I mentioned in another comment we have already proven NIST&#39;s report to be bullshit. A few months ago a guy who worked with NIST during the investigation said it was all bullshit. MSM didn&#39;t make a peep. &quot;Truthers&quot; were also the reason NIST was forced to state that tower 7 fell at free fall for like 2.5 seconds. It was a member of A&amp;E. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying the MSM won&#39;t cover this no matter whatever the results are. This study has already been banned in several subs on reddit from what I&#39;ve heard. &quot;Debunker&quot; idiots who say they rely on science but actually ignore science will just say this study was only one universities opinion.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this study just a model of the collapse? Best case scenario is they say it was impossible for tower 7 to have fell in the way NIST said it did.</p>

<p>I am excited for the study. Let&#39;s just not expect this to be a game changer. But I&#39;m down to try to spread the word as much as possible when the results are out.</p>

Fire fighters who were putting out the flames at the base of the building recall molten hot lava like melted steel all over the place. Micro Iron spheres was found in every debris sample from the building and the 9/11 commission said they shouldn&#39;t investigate because it&#39;s unlikely it is there. These Spheres can only be created in very great heat- way hotter than office fires could ever create. And let&#39;s say the government had nothing to do with this at all, then they would investigate the fact that the building free fell for 8 seconds which makes a controlled demolition obvious and would look into the possibility of a terrorist planting these bombs in a wag but even then, this building was was pulled damn near perfectly by grade A experts </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope that is not it at all. The dude is hard core wtf wtc7. He knows the truth and he has built a model to test it and is going to just give out the data for everyone else to test. UAF has been going through some serious budget struggles recently and the government may not be super willing to help them out after this but I can assure you the information does not support the official story at all.</p>
