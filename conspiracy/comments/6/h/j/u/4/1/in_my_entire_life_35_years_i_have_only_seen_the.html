    <div class="md"><p>If Trump was in any danger, Hillary would be rotting in a jail cell right now.  Seeing as she&#39;s not, and neither is Huma, I&#39;d say Trump is perfectly safe from any sort of prosecution in the very unlikely event he&#39;s found to have actually done anything wrong.  </p>

<p>I cannot stress enough how much of a moot point Flynn is.  All of what he did was reactionary.  </p>

<p>Hillary got in obama&#39;s ear and got his help getting the Russian narrative going.  They slapped sanctions on russia without actually proving they were behind any alleged hacking.... and here comes Flynn.  Trying to hit the ground running, dealing with this cluster fuck the outgoing administration is handing them. </p>

<p>So... remind me again what they&#39;re investigating trump for?  There&#39;s an unproven allegation to do with russia for which a punishment was assigned, and this guy talked to somebody referencing it?  Yeah... I&#39;m not sold.  That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one forced Trump to &quot;punish&quot; Flynn. They did it because it was extremely sketchy for him to talk about the sanctions in light of the suspicious contacts with Russia and because he lied to Mike Pence about the conversations. No one has any &quot;evidence&quot; because there&#39;s an ongoing investigation happening.</p>

<p>Ask yourself. If the Russia story is all just a media scheme, why have multiple people on Trump&#39;s team been caught lying about their Russian contacts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Punish?  Again... that goes back to my point that it was reactionary.  Without Obama&#39;s knee jerk, Hillary in his ear russia actions that stuff never happens. </p>

<p>As of right now, there&#39;s no evidence of any collusion.  What we&#39;re seeing is Gotcha politics. You say hey, these are bad guys and then you look for any contact between anybody from there and anybody linked in any way to trump and you try to say GOTCHA!!! yeah, it&#39;s a fucking kids game.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why Trump is on twitter as president of the US openly saying it&#39;s all bullshit.</p>

<p>So... remind me again what they&#39;re investigating trump for? There&#39;s an unproven allegation to do with russia for which a punishment was assigned, and this guy talked to somebody referencing it? Yeah... I&#39;m not sold. That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using your words re:punishment, dude. If it wasn&#39;t a big deal that Flynn talked to the Russian ambassador about sanctions before he came into office, why did he lie about it and why did Trump fire him? If it was &quot;fake news,&quot; why wouldn&#39;t he have kept him on board?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence because it&#39;s an ongoing investigation, but Trump&#39;s refusal to just let this investigation run its course and absolve him (if you&#39;re correct in that nothing has gone wrong) leads me to believe that the real evidence is on its way. Guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. 100% inaccurate. The left paints itself as anti war. Want to know when that started? During Vietnam when US had a underground socialist movement who were trying to undermine the war effort. 
It dovetailed nicely with the hippie movement and they helped to organize the hippie protests. Google from &quot;Berkeley to Moscow, anti war protest&quot; </p>

<p>You can have fascist left or fascist right. </p>

<p>You can have anti war left, and anti war right. 
( see devout christians or priests) </p>

<p>You can have Marxism plus class struggle= Bolshevism/ Stalinism</p>

<p>Or you can have Marxism plus nation= Nazi. </p>

<p>Totalitarianism doesn&#39;t usually elect itself . It comes after war. Wars committed by, initiated by, the left. 
War in Vietnam= left. 
War in Russia and the soviet take over= left
War in Vietnam was Started by the Vietcong / communist takeover , against French Colonialism of the country with Soviet Union funding . The south Vietnamese wanted NOTHING to do with communism and fought back. Against war from left wing politics</p>

<p>. Unfortunately, the media campaign to paint the left as peaceniks has. Even successful. Unfortunately history shows that not to be true. 
I used to think this as well until I watched some histories/ documentaries .

<p>Furthermore their popularity as individuals does not represent a &quot;MSM&quot; narrative. So far the only talking heads i&#39;ve seen mentioned here are Rush and Hannity. That&#39;s two guys.

<p>Media consolidations of paper, print, and radio have vastly expanded the conservative reach into the homes/cars/computers of the right. They have as much, if not more, influence that is considered MSM than liberals. </p>

<p>So when people tell you not to trust the MSM maybe they mean Fox, Rush, Levin, Hannity, Alex Jones, Washington times, iHeart Radio and many local papers/stations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe because they&#39;re the only option for all conservatives whereas liberals have 3 major networks to decide to watch.</p>

<p>And with the loss of O&#39;Reilly Fox&#39;s ratings have started to fall.</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t believe what i&#39;m reading in this thread. For non Americans reading this, It&#39;s like conservative news networks are the majority of the message you&#39;ll see online, on tv, in print, on the radio.</p>

<p>This is simply not true. It is blatant that the MSM is ran primarily by neoliberals. Nearly every talking head and &quot;journalist&quot; that makes it to the national level is a neoliberal. Stop being dishonest because you&#39;re triggered by trump.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right to be careful about any news source but regarding the coverage of Trump I don&#39;t see how this is a surprise or unfair. He was controversial even before running for president so of course he&#39;s going to say or do things that are outrageous to many and get more (negative) coverage. If you look at Bush or Obama the attacks were far more about their policies than about their personalities because as people they were far less controversial.</p>

Bush, Cheney, and Limbaugh all got out of the draft. Bush senior made a call to the Louisiana Air National Guard and, even though about two thousand guys were on a waiting list to get in, his son got a position in pilot training. He didn&#39;t show up most of the time after the initial training, and the three pilots in the unit said they had heard he was coming, but he never did.

<blockquote>
<p>The Wall Street Journal’s top editor, Gerard Baker, called a staff meeting to address internal dissent. The paper is owned by conservative mogul Rupert Murdoch. Under Baker’s direction, The Wall Street Journal ousted opinion editor Mark Lasswell, after blocking him from publishing editorials critical of President Trump. The paper refused to run a story about white supremacist support for Trump. Business Insider reports Baker even tried to avoid highlighting that the seven countries included in Trump’s travel ban were majority-Muslim, instead suggesting to editors the nations be called &quot;terror hotspots.&quot;</p>

Maybe your parents and their parents are big Fox News fans, but the vast majority of younger generations don&#39;t turn that shit on ever, and overall trust in the media in general is at an all-time low, so expecting them to be the deciding factor in getting Trump or anyone elected is kind of silly.</p>

Obama’s British citizenship was short-lived. On Dec. 12, 1963, Kenya formally gained its independence from the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>He was legally a Kenyan citizen by virtue of his father. Kenya recognizes children of Kenyan&#39;s until they turn 23. Kenyan doesn&#39;t allow dual citizenship after that. So at 23 he was officially only an American citizen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s my point - the left and right are ignorant or useful idiots in this.  This divisive bickering between both sides only does nothing but serve to keep the distraction going longer while they implement their agendas, which are carried out regardless of who&#39;s in the power seat.</p>

<p>Not entirely true.  Libertarians and liberals alike share tons of common ground in that they believe that the State should stay the fuck out of people&#39;s affairs unless absolutely necessary, that we should get ourselves off of foreign interdependence, and that we need a government that is truly representative of the people and not the top 1% of elites.  If anything the election of Donald Trump has reinvigorated the anti-government side of the right wing.  We have a unified goal of freedom for all, only with different implementations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that Donald Trump is completely capitulated to the establishment.  The Syria strike turned out to be a whole lot of nothing and pretty much just a bone thrown to the media to satiate their bloodlust.  Tensions with North Korea settled down.  Trump talking tough to the EU and NATO and the UN is certainly not what TPTB wanted.  Pulling out of the TPP and the Paris Agreement were two huge lynchpins in their agenda that are now completely scuttled.  His push to build the wall and cut back on immigration are also two huge no-nos to the globalists.  It&#39;s important to note that nothing is really what it seems right now; there&#39;s a ton of subterfuge and fuckery going on behind the scenes on both sides, major battles are being fought outside of public view, and neither Trump or the media are trustworthy enough to take either of what they say at face value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am all for questioning everything but I see trump as an establishment billionaire with money tied up people who control the deep state. It was silly to assume that a corporate asshat would fight against the corporate overlords.The Syria attack was just to wag the dog much like korea.  The paris agreement was a good thing in my personal opinion.  I also don&#39;t understand the idea that globalists are bad?  Isn&#39;t it a good thing to have access to goods from other countries to drive our prices down.  I feel like cutting off the world just allows corporations to continue to pay us less while making more, and forcing us to pay for the welfare of their employees all while hiding their money in tax havens?</p>

<p>Democrats keep trying to pay the people more, increasing minimum wages, fighting for unions, taxing the rich and lowering taxes on the poor. On top of that, they fight for personal rights, such as abortions, legalizing pot, gay marriage.  I know people say they want to take your guns but not once has a law been introduced to take our guns.  </p>

<p>Democrats are not perfect but they at least fight for us rather than making laws that let corporations take advantage of people.  Removing dodd frank will hurt the little guy and help multi-billion banks that control this world.  And don&#39;t even get me started on private prisons and the war on drugs two things the repubs really want to make a reality. And immigration is an issue sure, by why are we punishing the people that come here instead of the companies that hire them.  Why not give them a path to citizenship so we can at least get them documented and taxed and that if they fuck around its easier to track them down.  I just feel like every choice the repubs make is anti-citizen and pro-corporate.  Even the citizens united bill was repub sponsored and exactly what you expect out of the deep state.  Same with voter suppression.  The less people that vote the easier they are to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the surface, I couldn&#39;t agree with you more.  It certainly looks in a lot of ways like Donald Trump is just another puppet in a long line of people doing the will of the unelected bureaucracy and corporate donors that put him in power.  His attack on Syria and seemingly bellicose language towards Iran, North Korea, and even Russia go back 180 degrees from his campaign promises.  His gestures towards Israel and Saudi Arabia are the biggest red flag for me that there are still neoconservative and neoliberal elements in government and the White House with Trump&#39;s ear, but with the recent marginalization of Jared Kushner in light of his many, many failings both public and private, I think this is a good reason why the establishment has picked up in their attacks against Trump - one of their major inside goons and leakers got exposed.</p>

<p>That&#39;s where you have to start looking between the lines and looking at what actually happened here.  Trump&#39;s election was unprecedented in the sense that it&#39;s fairly obvious that the media and establishment were not expecting him to win and certainly did not want him to win.  The amount of political, financial and personal capital that was placed on Hillary Clinton winning the election is truly astronomical.  Saudi Arabia and other terrible countries bet millions and millions on her to win.  It was a sure thing, just ask literally every single media outlet with a pulse!  And it backfired right in their faces.  That never really happens, not ever.  Even JFK got in because of his family connections to Anglo-American &quot;aristocracy&quot; and promises of loyalty to the Deep State made by his corrupt father, who he and his brother thankfully defied.  For the first time in American history since at least JFK, the Deep State&#39;s shadow government operation that had been running ever since George HW Bush, LBJ and Dulles killed JFK was shoved right out of power and disgraced.  This is obvious when you look at the sheer anger and hatred that comes out of these talking heads - themselves the paid propagandists of the Deep State and Elite - any time Trump is even mentioned.  The hatred is utterly personal.  <em>Why</em> is that?</p>

<p>That&#39;s where you have to look at how they treated every other President before Trump.  They don&#39;t even touch the levels of depravity they are hitting with some of their attacks on Trump.  There was at least a respect for the office and his title as President.  Not even Clinton at the height of the blowjob extravaganza got as much heat in the press, and his 70% approval ratings at the time reflected that with the public.  George W Bush did more horrible things than probably any other President in recent memory to set back social and political progress until Barack Obama told him <em>Hold my beer</em>.  Both presidents got metaphorical blowjobs from the press throughout their Presidencies every single time they bombed some brown people, invaded some countries, passed bills that gutted our constitutional rights, you name it.  So why is it that everytime Donald Trump sneezes the entire media calls for an impeachment?  As somebody that lived through all the presidencies I just mentioned, it&#39;s pretty fucking obvious to anybody who&#39;s been paying attention that Trump is Enemy Number One to the establishment <em>no matter what he does</em>, and that means I trust him more, even if that&#39;s the equivalent of me being able to throw Mt. Everest into the with sun my own hands vs. slam dunking a supermarket - unlikely to happen with either 😉</p>

I am just curious but why would trump be enemy number one when he fits perfectly in with what they are doing?  He is exactly what the leader of the deep state would look like in my mind.  Everyone around him is shady, he has deep ties to russia, and he has his hand in a lot of countries around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the republican party breeds a culture of criminality where people are encouraged to believe that &quot;when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal&quot;. This is why every 2 term republican president within the last 50 years has committed  some form of major crime. Nixon had watergate, reagan had iran contra, and bush 2 had torture/lying about wmds. The entire party creates a culture where they believe they are allowed to do whatever they want.</p>

<p>Invading Iraq was probably a conspiracy to commit war crimes - that&#39;s a conspiracy theory not just because it theorizes a conspiracy but because the establishment narrative rejects it and so there is a norm of treating it as somehow being a &quot;fringe&quot; belief.

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about?  &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; doesn&#39;t refer to any theory about a conspiracy.  We don&#39;t call every RICO case that goes through the courts a conspiracy theory.  That&#39;s not what the phrase refers to.  Conspiracy theory refers to a theory that about a conspiracy that is counter-hegemonic.  Hence the notion that Iraq had WMD wasn&#39;t a conspiracy theory while despite being very nearly proven and a rather obvious fact to the minds of most reasonable people, the theory that George W. Bush&#39;s administration set out to illegally invade Iraq and had the intelligence deliberately massaged is treated like some kind of fringe belief by the establishment and hence is a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Does the US Senate vote 97-2 to impose sanctions on a country based on a conspiracy theory? Yes what is Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was a vote for war, not sanctions. Iraq sanctions ended in May of 2003. The vote was 77 - 23. A far cry from 97 - 2. I disagree with the resolution, extending sanctions would have been a better idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does Trump fire 2 guys and have his attorney General recuse himself from a criminal investigation because of a conspiracy theory? Trump fired Flynn due to the media hysteria, he fire Commey cause he was incompetent as for the AG he recuse on his own choice, it was reported Trump was not happy about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Calling the Flynn investigation &quot;hysteria&quot; is about the dumbest thing i&#39;ve ever read. The guy was a foreign agent for an adversarial country, and Trump knew this before he hired him. Sorry, i couldn&#39;t find a Brietbart article for you to read: <a href="http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2017/04/29/source-trump-team-knew-michael-flynns-ties-turkey/">http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2017/04/29/source-trump-team-knew-michael-flynns-ties-turkey/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does Trump fire the guy investigating him because the mean media is reporting about the investigation? Trump had recommendation to fire Commey, the Democrats had requested Commey go and Trump was not being investigated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you not watch the Lester Holt interview? Or is this another one of those cases where you take the president &#39;seriously&#39; but not &#39;literally&#39;? Here&#39;s a link to the interview considering you clearly do not have the ability to simply google facts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wvuw_Zmubg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wvuw_Zmubg</a></p>

<p>Ya know, if you people actually put half the effort into objectively seeking facts as opposed to peddling your bullshit conspiracies about the evil MSM, this country would be a lot better off. But then again, who would be left to listen to Alex Jones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a vote passed on a lie, if it happened once it can happen again.
My point was he ask Flynn to resign due to the media hysteria of anything related to Russia, he could of waited for Flynn to be investigaed but every day it would of be more &quot;hysteria&quot; Flynn, Trump, Russia. 
Flynn lobbyed for Inovo, a Dutch firm linked to the Turkish president&quot; OMG!!!! He has 33 years of service, a United States Army Lieutenant General I think that reflects on  the type of charater he is. 
You said &quot;Does Trump fire the guy investigating him&quot; he wasn being investigated, I think you need to understand the situation better. Trump come to the descion to fire Commey over the Russia investigation but I would assume there were other factors that helped him come to that.
If you put some effort into finding out the truth instead of harping left wing talking point your probably wouldnt be so full of hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s your*</p>

<p>No, I was using humor to point out that all of their hysterical ravings about Trump and his supposed criminality always seems to circle around to more unsubstantiated Russian bullshit, with loads of allegations, personal anecdotes, strawmen arguments and partisanship being passed off as fact without even the least bit of due diligence.  I have no problem if you guys want to abandon all sense of fairness and honesty when dealing with Trump, it just makes your hypocrisy delicious considering the last 8 years of blatantly ignoring Obama and Clinton&#39;s crimes because he was &#39;your guy&#39;.  Now the left is even propping up <em>Bush</em> as a good guy with the most ridiculous revisionist history ever JUST because he&#39;s anti-Trump.  It&#39;s pathetic.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that regurgitating talking points from the TV shows you watch and the politicians you agree with is forming your own arguments. What is he saying other than regurgitating the same exact things that everybody&#39;s been saying for the past eight months that have led to literally nothing?  It stands to reason that if there was so much hardcore dirt on Donald Trump being a traitor and Russian lackey, some of it would have actually come out and incriminated him beyond a shadow of a doubt.  But we don&#39;t have that, do we?  No, we do not.  Even when James Comey himself has come out and stated on the record that Trump was never under investigation, this fact is <em>literally ignored</em> by the left.  That&#39;s some true derangement right there.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t stand to reason that if trumps campaign had secret channels to russia that they would be public record nor that if the fbi had any evidence they would leak it. That being said trumps use of people like manafort and his previous connections to russian oligarchs certianly casts a lot of doubt. </p>

<p>Most of the hysterical raving about trump that I have seen has actually surrounded his basic incompetence more than the allegations of personal collusion. </p>

<p>Presidents had secret channels all the time, even to Russia.  Was JFK a Russian puppet too?  Why would you <em>not</em> want Trump or our government to pursue friendly relationships with Russia?</p>

<p>Manafort had business ties to Russia over a decade ago.  So did Hillary and Podesta.  Are we investigating them too?  Are we going to investigate when Obama promised the Russians that &quot;I&#39;ll have more flexibility after the election&quot;?  And you&#39;re going to have to provide some proof and context for Trump&#39;s supposed ties to Russian oligarchs, because as far as I&#39;m aware, that&#39;s completely within the norms of running a massive billion-dollar company.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say Trump has done a great job either, but how much of that is due to obstructionism of nominating his cabinet positions, fighting him at every turn, and playing a 24/7 hit piece on every TV channel and radio station?  Not one President ever has had to jump through the hoops he has.</p>

<p>Nigga please.  Trump has been attacked since even before he started running, and his own government is leaking classified info like a sieve just to find any piece of dirt they can get on him.  Trump being incompetent is more a matter of opinion than anything.  Where did Trump overstep his legal bounds exactly?  If you can&#39;t see the obvious sabotage of the media and establishment towards Trump for what it is - a political hit job - and look past your partisanship for the good of our country and respect for the democratic process, you can&#39;t have an honest conversation here.  You are unwittingly supporting a coup d&#39;etat of the Deep State against elected officials.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cue the &#39;Fox was mean to Obama&#39; argument.  Yes, unsurprisingly the right-wing shitrag was mean towards Barack Obama and called him out frequently on his frequent abuses of power, and Republicans obstructed him on many things.  They were also marginalized, vilified and ridiculed by the vast majority of the establishment, media and public if you recall.  The other 95% of the media fucking <em>loved</em> Obama, and any sort of bullshit to the contrary is revisionist history or lies, straight up.  Compare that to literally the <em>entire fucking media, entertainment and political establishment</em> ripping Trump to shreds over anything they can get their hands on, including people in his own party, and the difference is night and day.  I was around during Bush and Clinton as well, and neither of them received anywhere near the amount of vitriol even during their worst abuses of power.  Why is that?  Maybe it&#39;s because the media will <em>always</em> back the establishment puppet regardless of their ideology so long as they do as they&#39;re told?  Why do you think they cheered when Trump bombed Syria but rip him to shreds on everything else?</p>

<p>Provide evidence of these connections, improper usage of these connections and the proper context.  Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little strange that after 9+ months this supposed Conspiracy Of All Conspiracies still has no hard proof of Trump or his campaign colluding with Russia?  Even swamp dwellers right in the pocket of the establishment like Comey and Clapper that fucking hate Trump can&#39;t substantiate their claims against him.  I wonder how many more times you guys can move the goalposts before you just give the fuck up and realize you got played by the DNC and the media to cover up their criminality and incompetence?</p>

<p>Fucking CRIMEA doesn&#39;t even want to go back to Ukraine.  The overwhelming majority of them identify as Russians and absolutely hated Ukraine.  I&#39;ll let Mr. Igor Shemyakin answer this better:</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you look closely, you&#39;ll notice that those against the referendum were mainly the US and her dependent countries. US&#39; goals are clear, since this has ruined their plan of throwing Russia out of Crimea, for instance. Others just follow either to show support, or out of fear.</p>

<p>Russian and Crimean officials had offered to invite international observers to, well, observe the referendum. But they refused to do so, and outright denied the plebiscite <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/self_determination_international_law">even though it&#39;s a procedure recognized by United Nations</a>. This brings us to a question of why supposedly democratic states have denied the most obvious manifestation of democracy. This doesn&#39;t make sense if &quot;Maidan revolution&quot;, or simply an armed coup d&#39;etat, was really the will of the people. But it fits quite nicely, along with numerous other things, into the version that the coup in Kiev was indeed staged by an external power - namely, again, the US - and that Crimean referendum somehow foiled those designs.</p>

<p><strong>Other points people often refer to:</strong></p>

<p><em>Ukrainian TV was blocked in Crimea, so people there did not know the &quot;true&quot; situation</em></p>

<p>First of all, trying to describe Ukrainian news as &quot;true&quot; is a joke by itself, a fact their media has been confirming for the past 2 years.</p>

<p>Secondly, people in Crimea were against Ukraine since its very appearance in 1991. They actually tried to hold a similar referendum in 1992 which was suppressed by Ukrainian military, followed by over 20 years of forced &quot;Ukrainization&quot;, a process that was not taken well by the majority of population. What this means is that Crimeans knew their true situation long before Ukrainian media, and this argument show the lack of knowledge about the people there.</p>

<p><em>Crimean referendum was forced to procceed quickly</em></p>

<p>While somewhat true, can those same people really say why it proceeded with haste?</p>

<p>A few obvious reasons are:</p>

<p>-Quick reaction allowed to blockade Ukrainian forces, thus preventing Crimea from turning into another bloodbath. Considering the rhetoric of Ukrainian politicians at that time, there was a very real risk of a civil war even more bloody than in DPR/LPR.</p>

<p>-It also denied any possible attempts from other states to interfere with the will of the people.</p>

<hr/>

<p>By the way it was the United States that funded and backed the coup to overthrow the pro-Russian democratically-elected government in Ukraine and replaced it with a Neo-Nazi right-wing government, not Russia.  And we have literally no proof that Russia interfered in our election or commit criminal acts on our soil.</p>

<p>since when does trump do anything because of media hysteria?</p>

<p>Sessions recused himself from the russia stuff, and comey said that was the right thing to do because of things he couldnt get into in a public setting. JUICY.  Of course trump didnt want sessions to recuse himself, he wanted sessions to hurry up and let all these unconfortable investigations go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am of the belief that there would be no investigation without the medias influence, which brings me to the question of whether the majority of the reporting has been in any way honest.  As you can deduce from the multiple testimonies given to Congress by everyone from the ex head of the FBI to the Attorney General, the medias reporting on these matters has had a huge influence on what, when and why they have been investigating.  If these investigations end up turning up nothing, I think the media companies should be held financially liable for all of the governments wasted time and money.</p>

<p>Likely, many people agreed with it. But since it got a ton of upvotes and <em>really</em> sets off the Shareblue narrative alarm, we see it get the usual 40% downvote after it started rising.</p>

<p>The Russia nonsense is very important to Shareblue&#39;s clientele. Posts that call it out usually get the downvote and concern troll treatment (i.e. &quot;What happened to this sub?&quot; &quot;This is Trumpland!&quot;) as we are seeing here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shareblue is a media manipulation company that used to be known as Media Matters.</p>

<p>During the Clinton campaign, they became a branch of her organization and called themselves &quot;Correct the Record&quot; to plant positive stories and commentary about her while brigading and naysaying negative ones.</p>

<p>Similar tactics are used by advertising companies to sell colas, astroturf message boards, manufacture viral hype, etc. </p>

<p>In the case of Shareblue, their product is neoliberalism and its attendant candidates and personalities.</p>

<p>Their tactics here are to refute, frustrate, and ridicule anyone who goes against their narratives and people. Also, they &quot;concern troll&quot;, saying things like, &quot;This sub went to hell, man.&quot; </p>

<p>Much of what they do is communicate with each other to plant and upvote brigade the occasional pro-neoliberal post. They do it FAST, so those posts are easy to spot.</p>

<p>The popular posts they <em>don&#39;t</em> like usually have hundreds of upvotes but they&#39;ll brigade it with around 40% downvotes and brigade it with negative comments they all upvote of each other&#39;s.</p>

<p>They are paid around $10 an hour to do this and usually during the week. Many of their accounts look legit, but were real ones that were purchased. But most of their accounts got made during the election.</p>

<p>Sometime recently, I heard they got a $40 million government contract but I&#39;m short on time right now to confirm.</p>

<p>You do realize that pretty much intelligence official has come out and said there is no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia, right? </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say that Russia didn&#39;t meddle -- of course they did. They have been, and they&#39;ll continue to. They benefit from the political chaos the media, and the Democrats, are creating. Putin wants this political and social unrest. It weakens America. </p>

<p>That is the only way &quot;Trump&quot; is helping Russia and the Media, the Democrats, and those who continue to push this shit constantly are only playing right into Putin&#39;s hand. </p>

Meanwhile hundreds of connections between the administrationand russia have been shown and proven.

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize that is kind of a dumb claim, though, right? The investigation consists of the special counsel wanting to ask Trump questions about that conversation. </p>

<p>By those standards, the entire government is under investigation. As it would be, and should be. That&#39;s the counsel&#39;s entire job -- to find the truth. He can&#39;t do that without talking to every single involved party. </p>

<p>And many of those connections are business connections. Why are we trying to vilify a global business leader for having business connections with foreign governments? OF COURSE he does. It&#39;s not just Russia, either. Nobody, except some here, seem to care about his business connections to Israel (for instance). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This feels an awful lot like &quot;Why would you care if the NSA is spying on you if you have nothing to hide?&quot; </p>

<p>From what I know of the conversation in question, he didn&#39;t actually try and obstruct anything. He merely asked his advisors what the legalities were of what he could do. Maybe he intended to, who knows. We&#39;ll never know. </p>

<p>What we do know is the obstruction <em>never</em> happened. There is an independent counsel handling the investigation, after all. An investigator, mind you, who is no friends of Trump and has close ties to a lot of anti-Trump people in the IC (Comey, as an example). </p>

<p>However, my point still stands. Why are we surprised the private investigator is investigating things? This is his job, and Trump would be under investigation whether he&#39;s guilty or not -- he&#39;s there specifically to investigate Trump and the administration. </p>

<p>It&#39;s literally a non story. First it was all about how Trump colluded with Russia and people are investigating it. That become &quot;no duh&quot; level apparent not everyone. Then Comey testified he wasn&#39;t. Now we find out he is, as would be routine, and suddenly it&#39;s front page news and it means he&#39;s guilty. </p>

<p>Somebody is being played here, and it&#39;s certainly not those who question the &quot;Muh Russia&quot; narrative. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask you to answer me two simple questions. </p>

<p>First - If Trump is guilty, why has everybody involved said 1) There is no evidence of collusion, and 2) Russia had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election? That&#39;s the hard answer to give, in today&#39;s political climate. If he colluded, why aren&#39;t they singing it from the roof tops? </p>

<p>Second - Why has over a year of investigations, including illegal wire taps, produced no solid evidence? Why is the evidence reduced to a list of &quot;this thing smells funny&quot;? I can make a list, just like yours, that (by your standards) would prove that Pizza is code word for children and Pizza shops are just a cover for child trafficking. Does that mean it&#39;s all true? </p>

<p>Maybe surprising to you, I don&#39;t disagree. I think the independent investigation is a good thing. If something is up, I want to know something is up. I just don&#39;t believe the hype. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to say I think Trump is innocent. I have no doubt he intended to obstruct justice. Just like Obama did with the IRS/Clinton, and Bush did with 9-11, and Clinton did with Monica, and Regan did with Contra, etc etc etc. </p>

<p>I also have little doubt that our government is littered with people who are working for foreign governments, either as public &quot;lobbyists&quot; or covertly. It&#39;s not anything new. </p>

<p>I just absolutely hate that only <em>now</em> does everyone suddenly care. I could make a list mile long of all the shady shit that&#39;s happened under past presidents and candidates. Nobody cared. But <em>now</em> we care? </p>

<p>We only care because TBTB are telling the masses to care. As I&#39;ve said, people are being played and I&#39;m not sure many realize that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far too early to try to put this kind of historical context to the Trump Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Also the fact that the majority of media covering it would imply either that it&#39;s not a conspiracy and is just news, or that there is a conspiracy among media outlets to push a Trump Russia conspiracy which gets a little meta.  I haven&#39;t heard a great explanation of what the motive is for them all to conspire and work together on this.  </p>

<p>You also have an occams razor situation going on here. If it&#39;s not covered like all of the other conspiracy theories you&#39;ve ever seen then the most likely answer is that it&#39;s not a conspiracy theory. Or at the very least not one like all of the other ones you&#39;ve ever seen. </p>

The way I see it is, what&#39;s more likely a out of control buiesness man / tv star got into some questionable buiesness deals or that almost every investigator and person who works for the government is in on a massive conspiracy against him. I honestly even considered a giant government conspiracy but trump has been so inept so stupid and uncontrolled that there is no choice but to believe the official story.

    <div class="md"><p>Shareblue is a media manipulation company that used to be known as Media Matters.</p>

<p>During the Clinton campaign, they became a branch of her organization and called themselves &quot;Correct the Record&quot; to plant positive stories and commentary about her while brigading and naysaying negative ones.</p>

<p>Similar tactics are used by advertising companies to sell colas, astroturf message boards, manufacture viral hype, etc. </p>

<p>In the case of Shareblue, their product is neoliberalism and its attendant candidates and personalities.</p>

<p>Their tactics here are to refute, frustrate, and ridicule anyone who goes against their narratives and people. Also, they &quot;concern troll&quot;, saying things like, &quot;This sub went to hell, man.&quot; </p>

<p>Much of what they do is communicate with each other to plant and upvote brigade the occasional pro-neoliberal post. They do it FAST, so those posts are easy to spot.</p>

<p>The popular posts they <em>don&#39;t</em> like usually have hundreds of upvotes but they&#39;ll brigade it with around 40% downvotes and brigade it with negative comments they all upvote of each other&#39;s.</p>

<p>They are paid around $10 an hour to do this and usually during the week. Many of their accounts look legit, but were real ones that were purchased. But most of their accounts got made during the election.</p>

<p>Sometime recently, I heard they got a $40 million government contract but I&#39;m short on time right now to confirm.</p>
