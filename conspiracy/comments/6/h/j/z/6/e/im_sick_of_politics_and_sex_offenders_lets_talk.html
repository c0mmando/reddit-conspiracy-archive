<p>I also saw something on this sub about the Smithsonian covering up and destroying evidence of giants back in the earth 20th century.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too! Part of me is still clinging to that story about the giant skeletons of the mound builders being suppressed by the Smithsonian and all the evidence destroyed in the turn of the century, because I want so much to be in a world where those massive bones, and all that possibility, could turn out to be true.</p>

<p>In much the same way that I absolutely want to find out that Erich von Daniken&#39;s books were all true, and those quite thoroughly debunking them were wrong/lying. I don&#39;t believe, but man do I want to. There&#39;s something exhilarating about having everything we thought we knew thrown up in the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called Fringe Theory precisely because the stuff there is an the fringe of what most people believe.</p>

<p>I created the sub because there wasn&#39;t any place for some of the stuff that gets posted here sometimes. Basically, it&#39;s a subreddit for stuff that challenges conventional belief, but doesn&#39;t necessarily have any element of conspiracy.</p>

<p>I wanted a sub for UFOs, aliens, giants, Atlantis etc. Something that would complement r/conspiracy instead of competing against it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This likely has some truth. The Urantia Papers says that&#39;s where Dalamatia is located here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Dalamatia — The City of the Prince</li>
</ol>

<p>66:3.1 (743.2) The headquarters of the Planetary Prince was situated in the Persian Gulf region of those days, in the district corresponding to later Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>66:3.2 (743.3) The climate and landscape in the Mesopotamia of those times were in every way favorable to the undertakings of the Prince’s staff and their assistants, very different from conditions which have sometimes since prevailed. It was necessary to have such a favoring climate as a part of the natural environment designed to induce primitive Urantians to make certain initial advances in culture and civilization. The one great task of those ages was to transform man from a hunter to a herder, with the hope that later on he would evolve into a peace-loving, home-abiding farmer.</p>

<p>66:3.3 (743.4) The headquarters of the Planetary Prince on Urantia was typical of such stations on a young and developing sphere. The nucleus of the Prince’s settlement was a very simple but beautiful city, enclosed within a wall forty feet high. This world center of culture was named Dalamatia in honor of Daligastia.</p>

<p>66:3.4 (743.5) The city was laid out in ten subdivisions with the headquarters mansions of the ten councils of the corporeal staff situated at the centers of these subdivisions. Centermost in the city was the temple of the unseen Father. The administrative headquarters of the Prince and his associates was arranged in twelve chambers immediately grouped about the temple itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By Andre&#39;s reckoning, the topic of conversation was almost always cricket. What I didn&#39;t know was that he had gigantism, which caused an excess of growth hormone, which led to acromegaly. I thought he only had acromegaly.<br/>
Speaking of acromegaly, has anyone heard or read Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s revisionist take on David and Goliath? It runs a little something like this (courtesy of The Guardian):  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our mistake is to assume it&#39;s a story about the weak beating the powerful with the help of pluck and guile and sheer blind faith. But as Gladwell points out, it was Goliath who was the vulnerable one. He was a giant, which made him slow, clumsy and probably half-blind (double vision is a common side-effect of an excess of human growth hormone). The only way he could have beaten David was by literally getting his hands on him – but David had no need to go anywhere near him. David had a sling.</p>

<p>Ancient armies contained teams of slingers, who could be deadly from distances as great as 200 yards. The best, like David, were lethally accurate, and Goliath was not a small target. Once David had persuaded the Israelites that single combat didn&#39;t need to mean sword versus sword, but could be any weapon you like, there was only ever going to be one winner. As Gladwell says, Goliath had as much chance against David as a man with a sword would have had against someone armed with a .45 automatic handgun.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t subscribe to <del>organized</del> religion, but I&#39;ve always enjoyed a good story about a triumphant underdog. </p>

<p>Mayans were 157cm on average for males. Andre was 224cm. I&#39;m sure if you met someone 40% taller than you, you&#39;d think they&#39;re a giant. And when you tell your kids you&#39;d be making it scarier and saying they were twice your height.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t matter. Your point seems to be that, because we are not currently enslaved to a race of giants (which apparently would happen by necessity), they must not have existed. No other reason comes to mind? People once saw dinosaur bones and said &quot;no way those are real, they would have eaten every person on the planet&quot;, without considering a million other factors that could explain why we were spared (in this case, by time).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that if they existed, they would be a dominant species that would have had little threats and still persist to today. But they haven&#39;t. The reason the dinosaurs don&#39;t still exist is because of a giant meteor/cataclysmic event. And yet, despite that, there is actually evidence of them--fossils, and a lot of them. There are even direct living descendants. There are neither of these things for giants.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence, and no footprints of them. There are both for dinosaurs. To say it&#39;s similar to dinosaurs is ridiculous. Very few would have asserted the existence of dinosaurs pre the discovery of fossils.</p>

Not everyone agrees on this, but I tend to believe in the evidence (stated above by <a href="/u/aStonedbear">/u/aStonedbear</a>) that the last great global deluge event was a massive and rapid melting of the already existing ice sheets and glaciers. We&#39;re talking ice that was up to two miles thick in some areas. That ice isn&#39;t around today, it&#39;s already melted in the oceans. The melting of ice sheets that exist today would result in a rapid and significant rise in sea level, but it would not be near the cataclysmic event that occurred in the younger dryas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, 12,800 years ago there was actually a giant flood. The younger dryas period. This is now main stream science. Look into the younger dryas boundary, actually alot of evidence for a comet strike then too.  Bringing credence to many nati r american tales of god getting mad at us and striking the ground with a stone dagger and causing flooding and black rain.     Im not a big atlantis guy but the date plato gives for the submergence of it is right at 12800 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, at least not in the shape and size of the many photoshopped archeological dig photos. </p>

<p>The reason is simple, the scale doesn&#39;t work. See : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law</a></p>

<p>When you scale something up like a skeleton, it gets heavy really quickly. To the point that if you just keep scaling it up, it will eventually collapse under its own weight. </p>

<p>So its bones would need to be a great deal stronger and thicker than that of a scaled human. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re into Bible prophecy, there&#39;s a good case to be made that the anti Christ will be a giant, or at least supported by giants rising from the Abyss where they are currently held.</p>

<p>This is corroborated in the stories of several other cultures as well, which teach of an underworld that holds giants and hybrid beasts like centaurs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second issue concerns the Smithsonian and the alleged conspiracy. As detailed in the book, I don&#39;t see the Smithsonian as being in a conspiracy in the true definition of the word. I see it as a sort of stupidity in the sense that they have ignored an aspect of their own findings that the public sees as intriguing. Instead of engaging the public, they alienate it. I also see that American archaeology resents all outsiders, resists all beliefs that go against their beliefs, and they utilize skeptics as a sort of police force to silence critics and others. From a psychological standpoint, they are doing battle with their own shadow. It is a battle that can&#39;t be won. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t &quot;just saying its not real&quot; they posted actual facts to show the article was false. The initilal WDNR article lists a fake archaeological association and cites a supreme court case that doesn&#39;t exist, among other things. </p>

<p>Denying these facts just because they are on a website you don&#39;t like is downright stupid, and displays that you aren&#39;t interested in pursuing facts and would prefer to live in your own echo-chamber. All media is biased in some way, you need to learn how to divulge actual facts from articles</p>

<p>And I asked if you disagreed with the snopes report in some way and if you agree with the article the OP referenced. I&#39;m going to go ahead and assume your answer is &quot;no&quot; since all you did was post an unrelated webpage that I have already read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an easy one. Ancient people were rather short. All scholarly research shows an average Roman soldier was around 5&#39;4-5&#39;5.  A woman were around 4&#39;9-5&#39;0. </p>

<p>Fast-backwards to the Tarim Basin, in Western china. There were mummies found there. They were all tall &gt; 6 foot. They were &quot;white&quot; and some even had red hair. These mummies I believe are dated 4,000 BC but I am probably wrong. </p>

<p>Anyone a foot taller than you would be a &quot;giant&quot;. I am 5&#39;10 and someone 6&#39;10  would be a giant towards me. </p>

<p>Logically, these giants were probably just a tall group of people. The fishing parable applies here (it was THIS big!!!). Someone probably encountered someone who was a foot or more taller than them and they became a giant in the folklore. </p>

<p>That is the likely scenario. </p>

<p>Getting to the conspiracy side, there is giant folklore around the globe of tall giants bigger than 8 feet. Some of these stories are outlandish such as these giants having two heads or one eye or two rows of teeth.  </p>

<p>You have David and Goliath, many native Americans with similar stories about Giants, there are Chinese stories about giants as well as Trolls in Iceland. </p>

<p>One funny thing to note, a lot of these stories the giant is white with red hair. Maybe it was Conan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think that its related to expanding earth (neal adams).  The earth undergoes stages of expansion/growth, thinning the crust and pushing out water, contributing to rising sea leves / great flood myths (peter woodhead).  Gravity is a function of volume, not mass - so as the earth expands the gravity increases (miles mathis).  Or if the earth is hollow the calculations are different and as the earth expands gravity increases (peter woodhead).  The increase in gravity aids in the wide-spread extinction of larger species (dinosaurs, megafauna, giants).</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a myth built from a collection of alt-science heroes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The arrival of the Prince’s staff created a profound impression. While it required almost a thousand years for the news to spread abroad, those tribes near the Mesopotamian headquarters were tremendously influenced by the teachings and conduct of the one hundred new sojourners on Urantia. And much of your subsequent mythology grew out of the garbled legends of these early days when these members of the Prince’s staff were repersonalized on Urantia as supermen.</p>

<p>66:4.2 (744.1) The serious obstacle to the good influence of such extraplanetary teachers is the tendency of mortals to regard them as gods, but aside from the technique of their appearance on earth the Caligastia one hundred — fifty men and fifty women — did not resort to supernatural methods nor superhuman manipulations.</p>

<p>66:4.3 (744.2) But the corporeal staff were nonetheless superhuman. They began their mission on Urantia as extraordinary threefold beings:</p>

<p>This is where I link our stories about the annunaki Sumerian culture and Greek mythology. </p>

<p>This is from the Urantia Papers: Paper 66.</p>

<p>The Urantia recognizes the devil, Satan, and Lucifer as 3 different personalities. Basically  what I&#39;m saying is that ancient sumerian, Greek mythology, and giants are all just muddied truth brought down through generations. 
Just wait until you read Adam &amp; Eve.</p>

<li>Derek Gilbert</li>
<li>Look up the Khandahar Giant story. I had this borderline confirmed for me by my cousin who was stationed in Army Intel close to that location at the time</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pulling several threads together here but... Atlantis and Giants!</p>

<p>There is documented proof of Giants on North American soil.  The Smithsonian cover-ups and the mounds are too much to ignore.  Different tribes of Native Americans share Giants in their lore (often red-haired, blue-eyed).</p>

<p>In a documentary about the unique languages of the Basque, Gaelics, and Berbers (more their looks), I noted they showed a person going into a CAT scan machine.... only the thing was massive.  It was the same type of Giant skeleton/remains seen in the myriad Smithsonian videos/pictures.  </p>

<p>Of note, the Berbers, Gaelics, and Basque have unique coloring for their regions... red hair and/or blue eyes.  And their languages are similar to each other, but different than their neighbors.  This suggests they developed earlier or otherwise separately from Irish, Spaniards, or Moors. </p>

<p>My thought:  Atlantis was a country of Giants.  After the flood, the Atlanteans scattered East to Europe and West to the Americas.</p>

<p>Curious aside, the Canary Islands would be a potential landing spot for Atlanteans.  The native dog of the Canary Island, the canario, is a massivemassivemassive killing dog, and the men of the Canary Islands were said to be large and masters of battle.</p>

<p>To insert the giant theory.. well. There is little evidence Mars would have had the gravity and ecosystems to sustajn giants of that size, less so for Earth unless you want to say they coexisted with dinosaurs.. But to assume they existed amongst men as gods in the early days, ancient Sumer, Egypt, etc then perhaps it is likely that they uplifted humans or genetically spliced them with other indigenous species and made them cultivate food, but eventually died out of age or lack of proer sustenance with sufficient energy values. </p>

<p>To connect that to the NWO I can only theorize a cult had formed around the first men who discovered this ancient history and as they grew in number and influence they eventually hijacked governmemt by government, believing they are restoring a forgotten mission of their giant precursors, which was to enslave mankind for their survival on Earth. </p>

<p>But, assuming they were war refugees, the victors of that war would be technologically advanced enough to observe Earth or ignore it altogether since we are so insignificant. Either way mankind is fucked.</p>

<p>Or we all just evolved from apes and no alien origins or giants. If we&#39;re just evolved apes we&#39;re still fucked. </p>

<p>What do you actually disagree with in the snopes article? And do you agree with the above user that &quot;The Smithsonian just admitted to destroying multiple 12-30 ft tall skeletons.&quot;? Please post a source if so.</p>
