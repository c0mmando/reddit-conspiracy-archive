        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Knowledge will not lead to intelligence. We accumulate a great deal of knowledge about so many things but to act intelligently about what one has learned seems almost impossible. Schools, colleges and universities cultivate knowledge about our behaviour, about the universe, about science and every form of technological information. These centres of education rarely help a human being to live a daily life of excellence. Scholars maintain that human beings can evolve only through vast accumulations of information and knowledge. Man has lived through thousands and thousands of wars; he has accumulated a great deal of knowledge on how to kill, yet that very knowledge is preventing him from putting an end to all wars. We accept war as a way of life and all the brutalities, violence and killing as the normal course of our life. We know we should not kill another. This knowing is totally irrelevant to the fact of killing. Knowledge does not prevent killing animals and the earth. Knowledge cannot function through intelligence but intelligence can function with knowledge. To know is not to know and the understanding of this fact that knowledge can never solve our human problems is intelligence.&quot; -J. Krishnamurti, Letters to the Schools - Vol. 1 (1978-1980), 1st November, 1978. <a href="http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=53&amp;chid=330">http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=53&amp;chid=330</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like good ol&#39; J. Krishnamurti. He is often lumped in with &quot;new age&quot; guru types, but he rejects that role and is much more complex. When you are dealing with topics in which words reach their limits communicating gets difficult. We seem to be able to find reasons and methods for killing and war, but we find it so difficult to find reasons and methods for not killing and ending war. </p>
