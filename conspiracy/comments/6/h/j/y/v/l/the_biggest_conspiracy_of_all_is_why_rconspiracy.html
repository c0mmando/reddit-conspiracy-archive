       Good point, it is very strange to see r/conspiracy defending the Presidency and Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court.

      <p>
       And calling those who are finding problems, a deep state attack.

       Yeah, because rather than domestic covert intelligence agencies with black box budgets, it's a whole lot more likely that an impoverished foreign country halfway around the globe controls American domestic politics.

       Israel is hardly impoverished and they do control and exert a great deal of pressure on our government and law makers. But I'm not sure if that is the country you were implying. It is a mixture of Israel and many foreign countries inserting people into our government with agenda's that do not put America as their priority. However, blackmail operations done by foreign and domestic intelligence agencies is a huge part of why American politics is the cesspool it is right now.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russia was among the hardest-hit economies by the 2008-2009 global economic crisis: the economy plunged 7.8% in 2009 as oil prices plummeted and foreign credit dried up. The economic contraction was the sharpest since 1994, but no long-term damage was caused due to the government and Central Bank’s proactive and timely response to ring fence key sectors of the economy, in particular the banking sector, from the effects of the crisis. As a result, Russia’s economy began to grow again and increased 4.5%, 4.3% and 3.4% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, before slowing to 1.3% in 2013 and 0.6% in 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Russian economy experienced two major shocks in 2014, narrowly avoiding recession with moderate growth of 0.6%. The first shock was the sharp decline in oil prices during the third and fourth quarter of 2014, exposing Russia’s extreme dependence on global commodity cycles. After fluctuating within a tight band near USD 105 per barrel from 2011-2013, crude oil prices ended 2014 at less than USD 60 per barrel. The second shock was the economic sanctions resulting from geopolitical tensions, which negatively affected investor appetite for Russian investments. Capital flights and high inflation compound Russia’s economic woes as the economy registered the steepest contraction since 2009 contracting 3.7% in the full year 2015.

       You know why ? Because of the context ... We know there is a media machine out there that is working for the Globalists. So when we see a candidate been ridiculed every single time he has run for president by all the corporate media and then this last time he actually won!! And after he won they still keep attacking and attacking . I would say something went terribly wrong. I personally don't like Trump but I respect his determination having the world tell him to quit that it's over  that he is a joke that he will never be president to stop making a fool of himself..... And against all odds he won... I fucking respect that.

       I don't think the the media is any harsher against Trump then it was media was against Obama.  And the attacks against Carter continued for 30 years after his Presidency, revenge for firing G.H.W. Bush and 500 hundred or so agents back in 1977.

       I lived through 6 presidents and I have never seen this much rage, anger and malice come from the mainstream media. Just look at Cathy G... Tell me did any mainstream comedian/actor/news personally did anything as bad as she did with Obama or Bush or Clinton or Bush Sr or Regan?

       Trump doesn't have it worse than Obama. Let me know when we crucify Trump over mustard or the color of his Suit. Trumps issues are entirely his own creation. If he wasn't an illiterate moron he wouldn't have all this bad press

       Are you sitting me?  This happens daily.  Did you miss the two scoops ordeal, or the chicken wing bullshit.  They have found the pettiest crap to attack him with.  Difference is that Obama got it from one outlet.  Trump gets it from the entire MSM cartel (aka CIA)

       I'm sure the media's opposition to him has nothing to do with the fact that he attacks the media daily.

       This is like 75% of the reason a lot of people like him. The mainstream media demonstrated their willingness to completely propagandize the masses during the last few years and many of us will never trust them again.

       sometime. You can't go 5 minutes without somebody calling him a Cheeto or some other "clever" attack on his appearance.

       It's the kind of "joke" that makes you want to roll your eyes and then you realize it's not even worth it.

       I got concerned when I started seeing "orange" jokes upvoted here on a regular basis. I don't expect us to agree about anything political, but we should definitely be above petty commentary on appearances in this subreddit.

       It's certainly the most concerted effort against a sitting president.  If you can't see the daily attacks, slanted reporting and even sacrifice of journalistic integrity to damage Trumps reputation by the entire MSM (yes sometimes even Fox) then you havent been watching (or are watching but not seeing).

       I'm far from the only person that thinks this way. You should be aware that if your goal is to attack Trump, your methods are pushing more to his side. Try to be persuasive rather than dickish. Good luck.

       I'm a long-time lurker and it's just Trump supporters. I'm assuming since

       and
       <a href="/r/news">

       were censoring DNC stuff during the election Trump supporters found refugee here... and decided to make themselves at home.

       Was the DNC stuff really censured?  Both those subs chase the story of the day at the detriment of a larger picture.  When the leaks became "old news" the story got buried.

       The most incredible thing to watch was the non-stop efforts of CTR to minimize the content of the leaks and "muddy the waters" as we famously read in the leaks themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't really read about it, you had to be there in the comments watching the discussions unfold in real time. The disinfo tactics were robust and only occasionally let up when big news dropped and the new strategies were being developed up top.

I came here during the DNC primaries because r/politics was overrun with pro-Hill posts from dubious provenance . Every fellow Bernie supporter knows this.

       It took ONE FRIGGING DAY. ONE, 1, I mean just only ONE day for r/politics to change from pro-Bernie and heavily anti-Clinton to being irredeemably pro-Clinton.

       I was there like many others. Yet shills and useful idiots still deny that r/politics and most of Reddit is just DNC propaganda for the groups that everybody knows.

       was a refuge for anyone with an opinion that didn't fit the official DNC narrative. Yes, that includes Trump supporters, but it also included a lot of Bernie supporters and third party voters. For the millionth time, being anti-DNC is not same as being pro-Trump.

       There is a constant attempt to paint as a pro Trump subreddit. There is also a constant attempt at shilling and creating division and fighting by turning the subreddits content extremely political as of late. Nothing gets people arguing like partisan politics. There are also legitimate Trump supporters, and the people who hold on to the hope that he has been lying to everyone and is slowly building a case against the Pedophiles, human traffickers, and other unsavory business that our government is engaged in.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I believe it to be division, distraction, and divide and conquer tactics and they are working beautifully.

       I think it's fair to question the holocaust on a sub like this.  I don't, but if you're asking a conspiracy sub to just shut up and accept events as they're reported, you're probably going to have a bad time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think questioning the holocaust is the problem, or the endless seth rich posts... it's the complete lack of Trump-Russia connection posts.  That's a big deal, but no one here wants to think about it?  Sessions says under oath that he can't remember a meeting we have pictures of, and no one wants to tunnel down through that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone here is so focused on Pizzagate, and no one wants to talk about the link between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem and I hope it's fixed.  The complete lack of good faith posts.  These people don't give a shit about stopping pedophiles, they just want to hurt Jon Podesta.

       People here have always supported certain government officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Kennedy, the founding fathers, and on and on down the list.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one but the anti-conspiracy liars have ever claimed that all Conspiracy theorists are anti government.  That's a scare tactic to associate Conspiracy theorists with anti government terrorist groups etc etc for the purpose of scaring normies away from reading an alternative opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't anti government, we are anti shitty government and anti secret government doing evil shit with our tax dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want government, I want my government as prescribed by the Constitution and as guided by the people.  I don't want some bullshit religious order taking over my government, or some hairbrained social revolution thought up by kids who are mostly still virgins.  I don't want a fake government being bought off by corporations, I want my fucking government as prescribed by the Constitution.

       The personality of this place is absolutely not truth seeking. It's completely partisan. I never see a damn thing thats anti-Trump on the front page. Any post that's bad for Trump gets downvoted immediately. We have a president under criminal investigation right now for o struction of justice and not once has the story hit the front page. In a fucking conspiracy sub. That's how over run this place has gotten with Trump cheer leaders that don't give a shit about truth. We'd rather mass around 4chan posts about how everyone is out to get Saint Trump who is the coolest god emperor ever.

Would you like to show me one post from the past month that hit the front page that was bad for Trump? Just one or two would be appreciated, thanks.

       its really common now literally every time i see something get debunked at least one person attacks account age going ever as far as to attack 9month old accounts, thats not even that young and its not like outside of bots shills are going to bother writing out actual responses on this sub, they use upvote / downvote nets and tend to focus on facebook where people are dumb enough to fall for it.

       In this specific case attacking account age actually makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start making sweeping statements about "what this sub is like" from a 9 day old account, then it is not unreasonable to assume that you might not have a great deal of knowledge about the sub.

       I got curious and looked through u/supersaggyballs history real quick. I might be wrong but it seems that almost all his/her posts are on r/conspiracy, attacking r/conspiracy. There might be something I don't get, but to me that is just odd.

      <p>
       This is your quote. Spelling errors and all. If you believe this and support and current ruling political party, even with a "lesser of two evils" bullshit excuse, you're a hypocrite or almost as bad,  a sincerely misinformed person who believes they know The Truth.

       Why do people pretend that only one side is "pro-government?" Seriously, this doesn't make any sense and I find it hard to believe that people actually have this position. Just think for two seconds about what you believe. Assuming you are taking a side, either pro-Trump or anti-Trump, you are "pro-government." You either support Trump and his administration (and some republicans), or you support the Democrats (and the other anti-Trump republicans), the mainstream media, the FBI, the CIA, and all of the other intelligence agencies (that is if you believe the leaks, the intelligence agencies' claims, and the media's reporting on Trump). There are many people in this sub who are pushing mainstream media narratives here, many times literally quoting anti-Trump media articles. If you are one of these people, then you cannot say that the other side is "pro-government" without also admitting that you are pro-government as well.

       I agree. I simply don't care about pro-Trump or anti-Trump content, because I see our system for what it is. Trump is simply another in a long line of Presidents that is beholden to special interests. No difference from Obama or Bush. Might as well be the Hillary Clinton presidency. Most of the attacks on Trump are superficial (he tweets bad things, says bad things) or still unfounded. Why anyone on Earth would believe intelligence agencies that say 'the evidence is there but we won't show you' is beyond me. I simply view Trump as a great distraction, which really is the ideal puppet. Everybody focuses on the puppet, so much so that the puppet Master ceases to exist in their reality. What's happening that isn't getting reported?

       Everything gets reported. It's about the frequency of what and how much you can distract people from certain reports with. And, whether your group has control of popular social media sites to direct narrative to direct people.

       The primary position of this subreddit is anti-"Deep State". The Deep State hates Trump with a passion. Therefore we tend to look past his many faults for the overriding theme that the deep state is a graver danger to the world.

       What the fuck is the deep state even? The people that want to keep the status quo? Lemme fill you in. Trump isn't some maverick. He's out to cut taxes for himself and his friends. He's out to sell billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia just like the last president and the one before him. He's out to give money to Israel like the last president and the one before him. What exactly makes him different from the "deep state"? because he shit posts on Twitter every day?

       So you're basically saying you're for the deep state co-opting the presidency and you support calls for mutiny against the elected officials of the country?

       You would rather have an unelected, shadow government that cannot be held responsible instead of somebody who attracts huge amounts of attention to his every action? Do you realize that the president cannot just pass whatever tax bill he wants? Do you understand how government works?

       On a conspiracy site and talking like you know anything but you dont know what the deep state is and acting like this is the first time it has ever been brought up in history. Bill Clinton lamented the Deep State back in 1994. Kennedy lamented the Deep State in 1961. Eisenhower warned of the powers of the Deep State in 1959. Read a goddamn book.

       The "Deep State" is not one entity. It only represents the political and financial figures who stay while the public-facing administration changes (like the Presidency). This group is comprised of the Military Industrial Complex, oligarchs, Intelligencia, and the Banking Elite. These people have shared interests, but that does not mean they are all buddy-buddy. Sometimes interests align and truces are formed. Other times different "cabals" war with one another. I think what we are seeing with Trump is the latter.

       This is a lie.  Pro-Trump messages barely get any traction here with any of the normal users, and as anybody knows the comments sections of any thread are what to look for, not who's actually posting bullshit articles because they are easily parsed out.  Go into any thread that even smells like it's being fair or balanced towards Trump and bet you the top comment will be something destroying the initial premise of the article itself, no matter how accurate it is.  Or you can just look at people like yourself, who are pushing a negative message and slandering the entire sub yet you're getting a hugely-disproportionate amount of upvotes that doesn't reflect the mindset of this sub in general, whereas comments calling for civility or trying to look past the political angles get downvoted to shit.  And that's because people like you come from r/politics, r/all and the other hundred plus anti-Trump subs to brigade the shit out of this sub, and then point the finger at TD when you get called out.  You do know we can check your profiles right?

       4 posts in less than a month with 650 points or more. How many Pro-Trump posts meet that same criteria? This is the only one I've found and it's debatebly pro-Trump:

       On an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       subreddit, of course you are not gonna find a pro-Trump post like 'OMG TRUMP IS DA BEST' so you aren't gonna get an obviously pro-Trump post.

      <p>
       What you get are countless posts day in, day out attacking his opponents (DNC, Democrats etc.) which are the standard fare on
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald

       You did not answer my question at all, you are just attempting to conflate posts that don't involve Trump but instead someone that might be a democrat and posts that are pro-Trump. This is a logical fallacy because they are two different things.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        news surfaced that the editorial team at Russia’s largest state-owned television media company, VGTRK, had been ordered by management - widely understood to abide by Kremlin instructions - to halt all coverage of Mr Trump, a move that appears to reflect Moscow’s frustration with the White House’s hardening line on Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea. In a comment piece published in Deutsche Welle, Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator on Russia’s last independent television station, Rain TV, wrote that a friend at VGTRK’s editorial team had received orders that “could be reduced to a short sentence: there will no more of Trump”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Moscow establishment was shaken by the resignation of the US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn earlier this week, who had previously been considered by the Kremlin has a reliably pro-Moscow voice in Washington. It was further rattled when White House spokesman Sean Spicer gave a clearly worded statement that Mr Trump expected the Russian government “to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea”, a position that was compounded when Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday: "Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?".

       Not that it is in any way relevant at all, but typically anthropomorphize is used in reference to representing a non-human being as having human qualities-say a deity, or fictional character. In large part regarding human form as well as other human attributes such as personality.

       Not that you are wrong, but often times when you are referring to a human attribute or power as being represented abstractly, that is without specific attribution of human form, you would use the word personify instead.

       But thats the exact same thing that is happening now. Senators and Congressman on both sides are still taking huge payouts from corporations and Trump is still receiving donations from outside entities and doing business with rich, terrorist funding Gulf states,  as well as using millions of taxpayer dollars on expensive golf trips every weekend. It seems like its the same problem, but with a different face that the mods have grown fond of for some reason, telling people to shut up and respect the president. That's not condusive to creating a space for freethinking, like the founders of this sub intended.

       Well, the Deep State (CIA) is in cahoots with the Washington Post it appears. They are one of the chief papers attacking Trump regularly. I don't have time to source this, but there are connections with Bezos' purchase of the Washington Post and contracts with the CIA going to Amazon. I go to the Washington Post to see what the CIA wants me to believe, not what is the news of the day. It's still useful that way. So I have to wonder why they are so against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence community (Deep State) keeps leaking things about Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be a concerted effort unlike any I have seen in my life to remove him from office.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am not a Trump supporter. I'm a Bernie fan. But Trump did run on draining the swamp. I don't know if that was just hyperbole. If it is was authentic though, the Deep State wouldn't like that.

       I'm a Bernie supporter too, and totally open-minded. The deep state is the permanent ruling establishment in the U.S., based in our "intelligence community," mainly the CIA, DIA, and NSA, as far as I can tell. They have enormous power, but far from total power (we're legalizing marijuana right under their noses).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Washington Post has a major history of CIA collaboration, going back to Katherine Graham. I'd be surprised if Jeff Bezos wasn't a CIA collaborator, and the expose of him in The New Yorker last year only solidified that for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where is this concerted effort to have him removed from office? Obviously, many liberals and progressives are trying the best. I assume you mean mainly the Russia probe? Comey is a representative of the deep state? But what if he's not? What am I missing? Trump seems to be working for the financial elite class very effectively. Tax cuts for the rich, didn't end up cutting drug war funding, threatening medical marijuana, conservative Supreme Court justice, privatization of education, more billionaires in his Cabinet than ever before- what about this does the Deep State not like, other than maybe killing the TPP?

       The conspiracy theory community is not necessarily anti-government, correct. In fact the conspiracy community doesn't really approach policy at all. People here are of all kinds of political persuasions, but we are commonly bonded by our disdain for corruption, collusion, unjust violence and war, and general fuckery at the behest of the elite that own this planet. Outside of that, the conspiracy theory community doesn't really have a place. I'd say honestly that this is largely to the detriment of society, because we should talk about policy. Without that conversation, this community will never be a movement. Perhaps that isn't a topic for this subreddit, but then again I would argue that reddit's entire structure subdivides spheres of knowledge to the detriment of society, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a more related note, despite the fact that the conspiracy community is not explicitly anti-government, it would be quite hilarious for members of this community to propose that the election of a president would have any meaningful impact on the broad systems responsible for the cabalistic power structure deeply rooted in our society-even if you are a trumpeteer. Even if you aren't anti-government. Change takes time. If your goal was to address these issues of corruption and collusion laid at our feet in this generation of man, you would need a multi-generational plan, and perhaps we do not have that time. If you genuinely, honestly believe our situation is in any way salvageable, you are living on a prayer my friend. I know I am. Humans are destined for extinction.

       People need to understand that 'r/conspiracy' does not support any president because the people who actually know what the fuck is going on understand each president is a puppet for the powers that be, all different trains to the same train station.

       Except when a candidate promises to destroy the deep state, promotes conspiracy theories, and is slandered by almost the entire MSM. We were told he had "no chance to win". He was never supposed to win. But he did. And here you are with your version of "the world is ending" on loop, not realizing that Trump is the supposed answer to solving the deep state and the erosion of rights. Trump is the best shot we've had since JFK, you're just too set in your ways to see it.

       How can they change the results of paper-ballots of the entire U.S? What if there's a recount? (which there was, which gave more votes to Trump).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was incredibly close anyway, if there was a deep state capable of doing so, I don't think it would be a reach to say that votes were changed, they were just too arrogant and sure of a win that they didn't change enough. There is evidence of voter fraud//vote manipulation as given by Project Veritas (which the media has kindly ignored)

       If there was this all powerful 'deep state', then what they would do is take all the votes, then lie about how many votes there were. I mean, according to your narrative, nothing could actually stop them from lying. This means that since Trump won, the existence of a deep state would require them to be entirely honest and open about things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, if they have so much control over the media, and all that other stuff, why would they allow Trump to become president when they could just lie?

       Do you know how many people it takes to count all the votes? Not to mention the paper votes are kept as so they can be recounted if need be (which they were in 3 states). They couldn't just take them all and make up a number.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm tired of entertaining your idea. It requires a huge stretch of the imagination/truth and is far less plausible than the alternative. If the deep state could completely rig it, Hillary would be president right now.

       Yeah this deep state kinda sucks if they couldn't even get their deep state president elected to keep power in the deep state. Or maybe the deep state is in the White House and you were all fooled by the deep state to vote for the deep state.  Trump did win with less votes sounds like a deep state rigged things to me. Maybe the deep state is a bunch of Russians that invaded America after the Cold War and trump was part of their deep state plan cuz he was forced to borrow money from them cuz the deep state of the 2000s crashed the economy and the new deep state took advantage of trump cuz he has dementia and they knew?!?

       Because nobody and nothing in this world is infallible. The rumor is that everything was calculated down to the precinct to give the election to Hillary by injecting custom vote-weighting code into voting machines in 11 key states. According to Alex Jones (I know, save it), DHS cyber-security people monitoring the election system blocked their intrusion in 6 of the 11 states just on or before election day, giving Trump the election. It's possible. The look of utter shock and desperation of talking heads on CNN was incredible. They were on the verge of having panic attacks as if they were caught in a lie and they had no idea what narrative to sell, as if there was no way this should have been possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody said the Deep State is all-powerful. That is a strawman you are creating to argue against. However, make no mistake that the Deep State is very real. It has been partially neutered under the new administration, but I have no doubt that they have multiple contingencies in motion.

       But I heard here the msm lies and shouldn't be trusted, which means they knew all along trump would win and helped him. And we shouldn't just the richest people, but yet again people here have backed away from that for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       From where I sit the man knows how to manipulate the weak minded and told them what he wanted to hear - then in front of next group changed his tune and told them what they wanted to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       He lies all the time and people won't call him on it here because they want to believe things. The man literally suckered millions of people with a faux anti-government message, but a message we know the russians love as they know they can't beat us in a war...so they have went after the government itself. Make people believe are own government is the most evil one on earth for generations and that we need to destroy it.

       And that has what has happened. Folks elected a man who had no morals, values, or principles and lied to their faces every single day. And now these same 'patriots' are hoping the united states will crumble to the ground. Who is gonna step in when that happens?

       Why is it that you've never posted in r/conspiracy until about a month ago and now you're posting almost daily anti-trump shit in here? Almost like a shill who's been called to come fight and spread discord in here....
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're a champion at posting in r/politics, r/worldnews etc. but those subs are already heavily anti-trump right? So time to attack more pro trump ones...

       I was posting here last year and iirc year before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was banned here for a time before the election for posting a photo of trump being helped by the secret service (front page here had one of hillary). Some mods didn't want me banned (and several left around that time, still talk to one off line) because I had been a contributor to this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been following conspiracies since around the time I was 11, about 40 years ago (ufos, kirlian photography, pyramids, bermuda triangle, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have interviewed people on them on the radio and done my own shows on them and am currently doing several investigations for future shows (which have been delayed since my son and nephew have moved in here, been busy of late).
      </p>
      <p>
       I look into conspiracies with the intent to find the truth and realize that it is hard work. Some things I look into don't pan out, which is fine because you look for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My oldest son and I have spent time debunking local urban legends here in Ohio (Bloody mary grave, Andrew hellman, etc) - we do so by trying to find the truth whereas others just repost the same lies online without investigating them at all (these things have come up while ghost  hunting).

       A better example was her "tweet your debt in 3 emojis" campaign, which might be the Gigli of efforts to become President.  Also "pokemon go to the polls".  I wonder if he saying that lost her the election.  Wouldn't that be funny?

       I wouldn't expect you to know, but it's actually progressing. You can't build a border wall in 150 days you know. Stepping stones. Plans drawn up and I think are submitted.

       Congrats, you found one thing that Trump was incapable of achieving. You shouldn't forget about all the obstruction and delaying the dems have been responsible for though, remember how long it took for Trump to get his team voted in?
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, it was never "defeat ISIS in 30 days", it was "to in 30 days submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.” A plan that was submitted around March 16th.
      </p>
      <p>

       I don't want to be rude, but I think you're really overestimating the importance of this subreddit by assuming it's a major target for opinion manipulation. I mean, the population is tiny. And what content there is not only spread out across dozens of not even tangentially related issues, but also often starts and stops with linking a youtube video or blog. There is very rarely even a real discussion where people link dissenting sources in any given thread.

       Except the 'deep state' isn't the boogeyman. It is part of we the people within government protecting it. Who do you think wants to bring down the united states from within the most? Our enemies - and they put on a PR show to turn people who was claimed to be patriots into american hating brain dead zombies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They chose conservatives to target because they are easier to sway and tend to be more gullible (look at they believe, without question the bible, stood by bush for eight years loyally, etc). You can manipulate them by pushing fear and hate because they lap they up - they see themselves as victims (even though they probably work, have a family, good life, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       We have seen the people who used to wave their flags, thump their bibles, and tell people who didn't like the US to get the hell turn 180. They were egged on during obama years and plied with conspiracies and fake news. They ended up seeing america as bad (as it got better and brought troops home) and needing to be destroyed.

       except he never promised that bull not that it would matter if his promises meant she, he only took up the drain the swamp chant according to him because people were already saying it and he kept saying it because he got a good reaction. Hes done sooo much exposing deep state in office too, giving blackwater founders family members department chairs and other corporate cronies like goldman sachs so drained.

       The US government classifies far too much material.  Most agencies bend over backwards to deny FOIA requests.  Trump hasn't addressed either issue and won't in the future.  He only does things that advance his personal agenda.  His comments about the "deep state" are in regard to how he's affected only.

       I don't know why, but part of me thinks that removing the death tax is doing something for someone other than yourself. If Trump's agenda is being a good leader, than I'm fine if he wants to advance that.

       The estate tax is good policy.  It's designed to prevent the rise of an oligarchy.  It only kicks in if the amount is over $5 million.

       Well we certainly can't benefit all of America if it means Trump's children will benefit, can we? Not to mention, I'm sure Trump will have no issues paying death tax, he is a billionaire and the president after all.

       And either you are deliberately being dishonest or you are just ignorant of the facts. Estate taxes start at anything over $10,000.00 at 18 percent and on up to 40 percent of a million dollars.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The estate tax rates in the chart only tell part of the story. There is also a lifetime exemption -- that is, an amount you can give your heirs that is excluded from taxation.
This lifetime exclusion amount is one aspect of estate taxation that has changed for 2016, up by $20,000 to $5.45 million. Note that this includes property you leave your heirs as well as cash, so items such as houses count toward the exclusion. It also includes taxable gifts you give while you're alive, not just the possessions you pass on after you die.

       being anti every government for the sake of being anti government is called being an anarchist, it has nothing to do with conspiracies

       Logical fallacy: Composition.  Saying being anti-government can't make a conspiracy when many conspiracy come out of distrust of government.  Just because you're an anarchist doesn't mean you don't have a valid conspiracy.

       Okay, valid attack on the precise wording of his comment, but it's also a illogical to say that a conspiracy theorist has to be an anarchist.

       If there is no hope of fixing this within the legal and political system, then America is truly dead, and I refuse to give up that easily.

The cia? The NSA? From where I'm sitting I dont see this sub defending anyone. However the trump talk is about 50/50 because no one is really sure whether trump really wants to drain the swamp or not

       He does want to drain the swamp. The Washington Swamp. He wants to replace it with his own swamp of rich elites who benefit from America business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reluctantly voted for Trump. Took me a long time to get on board. The reason? I believed he'd drain the swamp. I never expected him to
       <em>
        remove
       </em>
       the swamp. I knew there'd always be a swamp. But it was a value call.
      </p>
      <p>
       He'll drain the swamp of people who's benefit to themselves is not a benefit to the average American. Trump, however, seems to be draining the swamp of those people and putting in his own people who benefit (himself included) from American industry. That helps middle America, even if it's just as corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If my only options are corruption I can benefit from, and corruption I can't, I'll take the former every single time.

       hyperbole much. if you havent noticed regulations kill small businesses that can actually compete with big corporations. big corporations can afford regulations while the little guy cant and has to close shop or cant grow. however, i do believe the president needs to do some trust-busting in silicon valley.

       Yeah I agree, but then I come to the comments, and get very confused. Some of these retard shills think calling these MSM fabricated conspiracies with no proof out for the BS they are makes you a pro government shill. No, the theories are just baseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is obvious subversion going on in this subreddit. There is a large group focused on framing Trump to be everything that the stereotypical "conspiracy theorist" hates. Most everything devolves into emotional arguments targeted at Trump, his supporters, and his policies, with very little fact based reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally retards on here who think the deep state is a myth and that 2 planes knocked down 3 towers on 9/11 trying to tell us why we should care about obstruction of justice of a faux investigation.

       Yeah that's one attack I can't get on board with. I can see calling him cowardly for not standing up against the Clintons and any possible threats made against himself and his family. I can see theorizing that he was always "in on it" and playing controlled opposition (I don't believe it personally). But the lake house thing is stupid. People are really jumping the shark on that one. This would be a pretty measly bribe in the grand scheme of things.

       Defending the government from wild claims that lack any sort of hard evidence, and even have evidence pointing to the contrary does not mean one is pro-government.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to be bashing the government 100% of the time in order to be "anti-government". Case in point - I'm a huge anti current-feminism person. However, there are feminists I like and there are parts of the feminist doctrine that I think are accurate and valuable.

       Pro Trump or anti-Trump everyone can see the deep state and elites that have infiltrated our government and are in the middle of a soft coup.  I think that's why the topic is so popular in the sub it is one of the biggest conspiracies ever happening in front of our faces So Pro or anti Trump we should all use this time to identify enemies of the United States foreign or domestic because we can see the powers that be at work because even though Trump's Elite he's not part of their group

       I really think that is a big part of his strategy. He is forcing them to act first and expose themselves and they hate every second of it. If they call his bluff and let him act with the full authority of the presidency, they risk actual legal prosecution of their corruption and treason, something which was unthinkable even one year ago, something Trump knows they won't let him do without a bloody fight. They are locked in a balancing act, and Trump is holding onto them in a death grip while the people slowly catch on and finally wake up. Once the masses begin to understand the depth to which our republic has been compromised, it may be finally be possible to do something about it, and do it right.

       Part of it is astroturfing on both sides. Part of it is the arguments are weird now. Its hard to back Reality Winner because she didnt leak anything of value and she was like a characature of what past pres make leakers out to be.

       this one is easy:  There IS a cultural marxist conspiracy to implement communism through the back door in america.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you havent realized that by now then there is little hope you ever will on your own, short of someone literally spoonfeeding you the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       The historic reaction to a communist takeover of a country is reactionary nationalism.  Regardless of your position on nationalism, the pro government people didnt just show up out of nowhere.

       This place hardly ever has anti trump stuff on the front page, but I think the reason for that is that the entirety of mainstream society has become r/TrumpConspiracy. This sub serves a purpose of allowing conversation about alternative explanations to our worlds events. Right now, the alternative explanation is that Trump isn't doing terrible things. That's the conspiracy theory now.

       It's pretty simple, actually: a lot of people still think he's on their side. All he had to was put on a little red cap and make some abrasive statements, and suddenly he was seem as some kind of populist, anti-globalist, anti-PC savior. Him talking about banning Muslims and about Mexico "sending" their rapists was basically like that trope where the undercover cop does heroin to prove he's not a narc. After he said this kind of stuff, he was seen as "one of their own," despite being a multi-millionaire who flies in a literally gold-plated airplane. Despite his being a proven compulsive liar that would make Hillary blush, they see him as reliable because he "speaks his mind," or in other words, says what they want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have their heads so firmly buried in the sand that even when Trump inevitably does a terrible job as president, they'll just blame the Deep State instead of admitting that he was an unqualified candidate who was never on their side in the first place. They're so addicted to the idea of finally having "their guy" in the White House that there is going to be a lot of kicking and screaming before they wake up—if they ever do.

       On this sub, a lot a people firmly believe that the enemy of their enemy is their friend. So basically, they support almost anyone the MSM portrays negatively ("because that must mean they're good, right?") We've seen it with Putin, Assad, and even Rodrigo "Kill Drug Addicts" Duterte—all because they had MSM opposition. That was literally the only litmus test they had to pass. I half expect this sub to start cheerleading for Kim Jong Un if things continue this way.

       I turned pro government overnight for several reasons. Moreso a supporter of our president elect. The investigative committees of Congress have earned a newfound respect from me as well as the service of elected congressman.
      </p>
      <p>
       It begins with the current media assailing our president elect and attacking his legitamicy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton meeting with Comey on a runway
      </p>
      <p>
       Chairman Podesta and the frightening things he's connected to. The fact he controls the Washington Post and is behind a ruthless Democrat propaganda machine. The documented threats against promoters of Pizzagate
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything and anything to do with Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       The false media reports prior to the election predicting a landslide victory by Clinton being the same media demonizing the president elect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday Republicans among them a senator all being shot at a baseball game
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigative committee of Congress headed by Gowdy and his valiant pursuit of truth essentially operating at the front line of the American people to find truth in this mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently resigned Jason Chaffetz and his contributions amid rumors of his resign due to death threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispelled all my conspiracies and suspicions in regard to the left and right being one in the same etc and election being rigged. I now KNOW that the people still have power and I support our elected officials. &amp; regardless of what all the tinfoil says here America isn't all lost yet

       I think it's fair to question the holocaust on a sub like this.  I don't, but if you're asking a conspiracy sub to just shut up and accept events as they're reported, you're probably going to have a bad time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think questioning the holocaust is the problem, or the endless seth rich posts... it's the complete lack of Trump-Russia connection posts.  That's a big deal, but no one here wants to think about it?  Sessions says under oath that he can't remember a meeting we have pictures of, and no one wants to tunnel down through that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone here is so focused on Pizzagate, and no one wants to talk about the link between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem and I hope it's fixed.  The complete lack of good faith posts.  These people don't give a shit about stopping pedophiles, they just want to hurt Jon Podesta.
