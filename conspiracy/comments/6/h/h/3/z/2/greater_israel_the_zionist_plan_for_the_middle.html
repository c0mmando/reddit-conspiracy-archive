<p>&quot;Greater Israel&quot; is the real reason that the Mossad/CIA/MI6 created The Islamic State (ISIS) </p>

<p>The Zionist faction of the Illuminati needs terrorism in the middle east to clear out people off the lands they plan to settle with Jews. Jews that will immigrate from Europe which is why ISIS is spreading out into Western Europe to cause a kind of &quot;Reverse-Diaspora&quot; and make Jews living in Europe to not feel safe. I have personally witnessed this reaction from many Jews in my recent time in France and Spain who have begun to flee Paris in large numbers to Spain and other places. But soon nowhere outside Israel will seem safe to them and they will have to return to the &quot;safety&quot; of greater Israel (a euphemism for more stolen Arab lands).</p>

<p>The Infamous &quot;Oded Yinon Plan&quot;. Introduction by Michel Chossudovsky</p>

<p>By Israel Shahak</p>

<p>The following document pertaining to the formation of “Greater Israel” constitutes the cornerstone of powerful Zionist factions within the current Netanyahu government,  the Likud party, as well as within the Israeli military and intelligence establishment. (article first published by Global Research on April 29, 2013).</p>

<p>In recent developments, President Donald Trump has confirmed his support of Israel’s illegal settlements and his opposition to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which confirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.  </p>

<p>According to the founding father of Zionism Theodore Herzl, “the area of the Jewish State stretches: “From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.”  According to Rabbi Fischmann,  “The Promised Land extends from the River of Egypt up to the Euphrates, it includes parts of Syria and Lebanon.”</p>

<p>When viewed in the current context, the war on Iraq, the 2006 war on Lebanon, the 2011 war on Libya, the ongoing wars on Syria and Iraq, the war on Yemen, the process of regime change in Egypt, must be understood in relation to the Zionist Plan for the Middle East. </p>

<p>The latter consists in weakening and eventually fracturing neighboring Arab states as part of an Israeli expansionist project. </p>

<p>Bear in mind this design is not strictly a Zionist Plan, it is an integral part of US foreign policy, namely Washington’s intent to fracture and balkanize the Middle East.</p>

<p>“Greater Israel” consists in an area extending from the Nile Valley to the Euphrates. According to Stephen Lendman, “A near-century ago, the World Zionist Organization’s plan for a Jewish state included:</p>

<p>• historic Palestine;</p>

<p>• South Lebanon up to Sidon and the Litani River;</p>

<p>• Syria’s Golan Heights, Hauran Plain and Deraa; and</p>

<p>• control of the Hijaz Railway from Deraa to Amman, Jordan as well as the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>

<p>Some Zionists wanted more – land from the Nile in the West to the Euphrates in the East, comprising Palestine, Lebanon, Western Syria and Southern Turkey.”</p>

<p>The Zionist project supports the Jewish settlement movement. More broadly it involves a policy of excluding Palestinians from Palestine leading to the eventual annexation of both the West Bank and Gaza to the State of Israel.</p>

<p>Greater Israel would create a number of proxy States. It would include parts of Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, the Sinai, as well as parts of  Iraq and Saudi Arabia. (See map).</p>

<p>According to Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya in a 2011 Global Research article,   The Yinon Plan was a continuation of Britain’s colonial design in the Middle East:</p>

<p>“[The Yinon plan] is an Israeli strategic plan to ensure Israeli regional superiority. It insists and stipulates that Israel must reconfigure its geo-political environment through the balkanization of the surrounding Arab states into smaller and weaker states.</p>

<p>Israeli strategists viewed Iraq as their biggest strategic challenge from an Arab state. This is why Iraq was outlined as the centerpiece to the balkanization of the Middle East and the Arab World. In Iraq, on the basis of the concepts of the Yinon Plan, Israeli strategists have called for the division of Iraq into a Kurdish state and two Arab states, one for Shiite Muslims and the other for Sunni Muslims. The first step towards establishing this was a war between Iraq and Iran, which the Yinon Plan discusses.</p>

<p>The Atlantic, in 2008, and the U.S. military’s Armed Forces Journal, in 2006, both published widely circulated maps that closely followed the outline of the Yinon Plan. Aside from a divided Iraq, which the Biden Plan also calls for, the Yinon Plan calls for a divided Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria. The partitioning of Iran, Turkey, Somalia, and Pakistan also all fall into line with these views. The Yinon Plan also calls for dissolution in North Africa and forecasts it as starting from Egypt and then spilling over into Sudan, Libya, and the rest of the region.</p>

<p>Greater Israel” requires the breaking up of the existing Arab states into small states.</p>

<p>“The plan operates on two essential premises. To survive, Israel must 1) become an imperial regional power, and 2) must effect the division of the whole area into small states by the dissolution of all existing Arab states. Small here will depend on the ethnic or sectarian composition of each state. Consequently, the Zionist hope is that sectarian-based states become Israel’s satellites and, ironically, its source of moral legitimation…  This is not a new idea, nor does it surface for the first time in Zionist strategic thinking. Indeed, fragmenting all Arab states into smaller units has been a recurrent theme.” (Yinon Plan, see below)</p>

<p>Viewed in this context, the war on Syria and Iraq is part of  a process of Israeli territorial expansion. </p>

<p>The Zionist Plan for the Middle East </p>

<p>Translated and edited by</p>

<p>Israel Shahak</p>

<p>The Israel of Theodore Herzl (1904) and of Rabbi Fischmann (1947)</p>

<p>In his Complete Diaries, Vol. II. p. 711, Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, says that the area of the Jewish State stretches: “From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.”</p>

<p>Rabbi Fischmann, member of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared in his testimony to the U.N. Special Committee of Enquiry on 9 July 1947: “The Promised Land extends from the River of Egypt up to the Euphrates, it includes parts of Syria and Lebanon.”</p>

<p>from</p>

<p>Oded Yinon’s</p>

<p>“A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties”</p>

<p>Published by the</p>

<p>Association of Arab-American University Graduates, Inc.</p>

<p>Belmont, Massachusetts, 1982</p>

<p>Special Document No. 1 (ISBN 0-937694-56-8)</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>

<p>Publisher’s Note1</p>

<p>The Association of Arab-American University Graduates finds it compelling to inaugurate its new publication series, Special Documents, with Oded Yinon’s article which appeared in Kivunim (Directions), the journal of the Department of Information of the World Zionist Organization. Oded Yinon is an Israeli journalist and was formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of Israel. To our knowledge, this document is the most explicit, detailed and unambiguous statement to date of the Zionist strategy in the Middle East. Furthermore, it stands as an accurate representation of the “vision” for the entire Middle East of the presently ruling Zionist regime of Begin, Sharon and Eitan. Its importance, hence, lies not in its historical value but in the nightmare which it presents.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>The plan operates on two essential premises. To survive, Israel must 1) become an imperial regional power, and 2) must effect the division of the whole area into small states by the dissolution of all existing Arab states. Small here will depend on the ethnic or sectarian composition of each state. Consequently, the Zionist hope is that sectarian-based states become Israel’s satellites and, ironically, its source of moral legitimation.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>This is not a new idea, nor does it surface for the first time in Zionist strategic thinking. Indeed, fragmenting all Arab states into smaller units has been a recurrent theme. This theme has been documented on a very modest scale in the AAUG publication,  Israel’s Sacred Terrorism (1980), by Livia Rokach. Based on the memoirs of Moshe Sharett, former Prime Minister of Israel, Rokach’s study documents, in convincing detail, the Zionist plan as it applies to Lebanon and as it was prepared in the mid-fifties.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>The first massive Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1978 bore this plan out to the minutest detail. The second and more barbaric and encompassing Israeli invasion of Lebanon on June 6, 1982, aims to effect certain parts of this plan which hopes to see not only Lebanon, but Syria and Jordan as well, in fragments. This ought to make mockery of Israeli public claims regarding their desire for a strong and independent Lebanese central government. More accurately, they want a Lebanese central government that sanctions their regional imperialist designs by signing a peace treaty with them. They also seek acquiescence in their designs by the Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and other Arab governments as well as by the Palestinian people. What they want and what they are planning for is not an Arab world, but a world of Arab fragments that is ready to succumb to Israeli hegemony. Hence, Oded Yinon in his essay, “A Strategy for Israel in the 1980’s,” talks about “far-reaching opportunities for the first time since 1967” that are created by the “very stormy situation [that] surrounds Israel.”</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>The Zionist policy of displacing the Palestinians from Palestine is very much an active policy, but is pursued more forcefully in times of conflict, such as in the 1947-1948 war and in the 1967 war. An appendix entitled  “Israel Talks of a New Exodus” is included in this publication to demonstrate past Zionist dispersals of Palestinians from their homeland and to show, besides the main Zionist document we present, other Zionist planning for the de-Palestinization of Palestine.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>It is clear from the Kivunim document, published in February, 1982, that the “far-reaching opportunities” of which Zionist strategists have been thinking are the same “opportunities” of which they are trying to convince the world and which they claim were generated by their June, 1982 invasion. It is also clear that the Palestinians were never the sole target of Zionist plans, but the priority target since their viable and independent presence as a people negates the essence of the Zionist state. Every Arab state, however, especially those with cohesive and clear nationalist directions, is a real target sooner or later.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Contrasted with the detailed and unambiguous Zionist strategy elucidated in this document, Arab and Palestinian strategy, unfortunately, suffers from ambiguity and incoherence. There is no indication that Arab strategists have internalized the Zionist plan in its full ramifications. Instead, they react with incredulity and shock whenever a new stage of it unfolds. This is apparent in Arab reaction, albeit muted, to the Israeli siege of Beirut. The sad fact is that as long as the Zionist strategy for the Middle East is not taken seriously Arab reaction to any future siege of other Arab capitals will be the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends how much traction it gets. I just posted it at random to hit back at the hasbara trolls, tit for tat. I don&#39;t play defense and respond to each sniping comment. I will just go on offense and start a totally new thread. I know all their secrets. I could post a unique thread on them every hour and still not be finished telling what I know after a year. Their list of crimes is extremely long, but not longer than my photographic memory and researching them for 20 years. Their time is short and they know it. At least the people at the top do. What&#39;s funny is that it&#39;s their servants in the middle and lower echelons who don&#39;t realize it yet. When the general knows the battle is lost, he still does not tell the troops so they don&#39;t lose morale but the people helping the Illuminati (propagandists/assassins/journalists/bureaucrats et al) are in for a rude awakening when the elite collapse the economy through an EMP attack or whatever and there is no room in the bunker for them lol</p>

<p>The elite are going to screw you moron servants over dumbasses, but I guess expecting some of these dimwits to read up on &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; is too much to ask.</p>

<p>Good luck with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;d have to turn off the television, turn down the radio, cancel their newspaper subscription, stop going to the movies, stop going to their evangelical churches, avoid any &quot;history&quot; book sold through mainstream storefronts, stop listening to their political parties, stop watching presidential addresses... Have I missed anything?</p>

<p>In other words, this is not going to happen any time soon.</p>

Something far more sinister is behind that facade in my opinion, what it might be, a million thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s notr &quot;Israel&quot; as such. Israel is just a geocgraphic location filled with Millions of residents, 99.999% of whom have no clue about the Illuminati.</p>

<p>It must be understood that &quot;Israel&quot; is a Rothschild creation from beginning to end. It&#39;s the Rothschild&#39;s using Israel as a host, a shield, a base from which to operate on a State level.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered (though my critics constantly ignore it even though I say it time and time again) that there are other factions involved. I was born and baptized catholic, named after St. Christopher and I continually name the Vatican as well. Neat trick how I am somehow anti-semetic but criticize my &quot;own&quot; religion equally. I guess that makes me an anti-Semite and a self-hating (non-practicing) Christian.</p>

<p>Ahh, the mental gymnastics involved that these people must go through to twist things around. LOL. F&#39;ing hilarious.</p>

<p>I also name the British Royal family. I guess I am an anti-Anglophile as well. Sure, let&#39;s just add that to the list. haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a question for anyone doubting the veracity of my claim.</p>

<p>Muslims hate Israel right? Constantly talking about how they want to wipe it off the map, blah, blah, blah.</p>

<p>Yet somehow they are right next door never attack Israel.</p>

<p>Excepting the one time they did... and then apologized. LOL</p>

<p>C&#39;mon people really. Use your intuition and analytical skills here.</p>

<p>Does this sound even remotely plausible to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes back further... All the way to the roots of both religions. Islam and Judaism contradict each others existence. Abraham was the forefather of both religions. He had 2 sons, Ishmael (forefather of Islam) and Isaac (forefather of Judaism). He was told to sacrifice his chosen son to God. But in the end he could not go through with it. And because of this, we never knew who was the chosen son. If it is Isaac, then Ishmael is false and Islam doesn&#39;t exist. if it is Ishmael, then Isaac is false and Judaism doesn&#39;t exist. They contradict each others existence. Palestine is the holy land that both religions deem their homeland. Palestine was 90%+ Islam, 5% Jew before the Balfour declaration. Not it is closer to 50/50. Both religions have valid reasons to usurp the other. Now you going to tell me why the media controlled news spits hate on Islam?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not going to respond every time someone says this dumb shit. I will just put it as clearly as I can. I speak my mind.
