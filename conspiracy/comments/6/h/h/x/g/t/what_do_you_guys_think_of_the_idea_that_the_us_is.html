       Probably the biggest difference between America (early or current) and Rome, lies in the military.  Rome had a "professional" army, as historians call it, but what they often leave out is that in order to be a citizen of Rome, you had to have served a term of service.  All senators, and other public officials each were required to have served with the military.  What's more, while yes, you could gain citizenship in Rome through other means, there was a mandatory conscription.  (It's not like a draft.  With conscription, you're not trained. Just said "hey kid, you're in the army now. Here's a pitchfork. Go stabby stabby at the enemy with it. If you live, maybe we'll do that again tomorrow.")

       Ive started to research the Byzantine Empire, and am amazed by how much different it was compared to Wester Roman Empire. It lasted almost a 1000 years after the fall of the West. It even recruited Norse and Anglo-Saxon mercenaries too, which is something I didn't really think Eastern Europe would be involved with. Other than the Slavs meeting up with the Norse in the early days.

       Rome dabbled in mercenaries from time to time through their history, but they weren't treated as well as the Byzantines treated theirs. By all accounts, the Romans tended to treat their mercenaries as little better than slaves, and not equals.

       While it's true that you can't "win" wars where you're trying to occupy a foreign state while still maintaining any semblance of abiding by international law/the laws of armed combat, empires are trade, wealth, and influence-based, not "winning random bush/desert wars" based. The US and the rich folks managing the US have the largest naval force in the  world by far, the US can (and does) control international shipping lanes on the seas as well as 'satellite lanes' in space, and some pretty major markets and foundational tech industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the navy, no other navy has the global reach of the U.S. The U.S.  The navy has 288 battle force ships, of which typically a third are underway at any given time. The U.S. Navy has 10 aircraft carriers, nine amphibious assault ships, 22 cruisers, 62 destroyers, 17 frigates and 72 submarines. In addition to ships, the U.S. Navy has 3,700 aircraft, making it the second largest air force in the world. At 323,000 active and 109,000 personnel, it is also the largest navy in terms of manpower.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes the U.S. Navy stand out the most is its 10 aircraft carriers, which is more than the rest of the world put together. Not only are there more of them, they’re also much bigger: a single Nimitz-class aircraft carrier can carry twice as many planes (72) as the next largest foreign carrier. They control the most wealth and brute force/power and influence that any political or national body in the history of the world has.

       Well, from an historical perspective, the U.S. is very much different than the Roman empire in that, while both have thrived on their military, the Roman military was essentially split up by generals and those generals' soldiers essentially worked for that general specifically.  This is what caused so much internal violence within the Roman empire.  America, believe it or not, is much more cohesive in nature.  Sure, there's a great chasm between the left and the right for the foreseeable future, but during times of relative piece, we don't tend to completely tear the country apart.  This essentially makes us more dangerous than the Roman empire because we can use times of piece to reassert our dominance around the world.  There also seems to be a sort of inner circle politically in the U.S. that both ruling parties appear to respect, which is not true of the Romans.  Those motherfuckers would conspire and fucking murder people - no matter the amount of clout the individual had.  That has has happened arguably once in U.S. history with the assassination of JFK, but not nearly as often with the Romans.  You might say that he was the American version of Julius Caesar, but you'd be wrong.  Julius Caesar was a fucking baller of the highest order of whom only a few in the entire history of civilization could be compared.  JFK's just a footnote in history.  So, when you put it all in perspective, the U.S. is MUCH LESS VOLATILE and much more dangerous to nations/ideas that don't fit our national interests.  Not only that, but the U.S. is much more insidious.  There are obviously many other features which differentiate the two, but I'd say in summary that the greatest is the difference in our military structures, both in regards to it's internal functionality and how it relates to the branches of government.

       Awesome, thanks for the excellent response! I started researching the Byzantine Empire, and and fascinated by the fact that it continued to exist for almost a 1000 years after the Western Roman Empire had fallen.

       I think they were more what we call Balkans and southern Slavs today. It wasn't until they were conquered by the Ottoman Empire that the Muslims took over. At that point many of the educated people fled to Italy, which created the Renaissance.

       My friend thinks they can trace their bloodlines back to the noble families of ancient Rome.  As  recently as the collapse (1600s)?

       It would be cool if they could. I know that you can trace that paternal and maternal haplogroups back, but only if we know the haplogroups for the nobles as well as the individual. There is a great chance that my paternal haplogroup is the same as Constantine, since E-V13 is at the highest percentage in the Balkans.

       But it is!  We’re Rome’s grandchild.  We were born from England, and England was born from Rome...Same human mind for the past 3000 years, we’re just continuing their basic system with some modifications.
