       Seen a few posts / comments on yellowstone so figured id make a post.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        There is much concern to the yellow stone region recently  becoming active.
       </em>
       <strong>
        Yet little concern for that happening here and today.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said. Lets break down the earthquake's...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Yellowstone is a highly volcanic magma chamber. Its known for its geysers and topography.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        There are typically hundreds of earthquakes a year. Several in this range and they often come following seismic upticks.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       69 quakes is an effective 'uptick'. Yet its not really a shocking thing that we are witnessing it. There are often seismic swarms in highly volcanic areas. Yellow stone would 'not' be discluded in this phenomena.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Our date range is significant in the extent this volcanic activity is following a vast amount of solar activity
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://solarham.net/planetk.htm">
        We were in a kp5 solar storm last week. As seen in the kp index
       </a>
       A sunspot crossed the lens (2661) just last week which produced 2 C8 flares a c6 flare 2 c2 flares, and 2 b3 flares.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a pretty sizeable amount of flaring which I feel is deeply rooted to the production of seismic events on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">
        Just today were surpassing a coronal hole stream.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/images/geospace-1-day.png">
        This stream clocked a 600km/s solar wind stream. Creating a high velocity shift in the earth's upper atmosphere.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There was an unusually higher density and I feel this will lead to a heightened period of activity in earths volcanic regions. With the united states west coast now being more likely to produce a 5.8- 6.8 within the next 5 days.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Likely activity in japans south/eastern coastal regions at that range as well.
        <em>
         (1-3 days)
        </em>
        **Yet I feel California should be our main area of concern
       </strong>
       <em>
        (for the week)
       </em>
       <em>
        ("following this activity at yellowstone")...
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        'I consider the san lucas area' yet due to the ecuador Guatemala activity It gives me reason to consider a more northern location like sandiego or even as northbound as medford.'
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I feel the passing sunspot 2661 is what lead to this event here:
       </strong>
       6.9 magnitude earthquake 8 km from Tajumulco, San Marcos, Guatemala
a day ago
      </p>
      <p>
       UTC time: Wednesday, June 14, 2017 07:29 AM
USGS page: M 6.9 - 5km NNE of San Pablo, Guatemala
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.disclosurenews.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/schumann-resonance-june-11.jpg">
        The quake followed a significant schumann resonance in the upper atmosphere on the 11th of June
       </a>
       (which could be why the anomaly appears in the lower atmosphere on the model on the 12-13th).
      </p>
      <p>
       So we 'should've'
       <em>
        (in my opinion)
       </em>
       been expecting a temperature spike in the earths sub surface volcanic regions. (leading to seismic upticks like this/these one/'s)
       <em>
        @Yellowstone-
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       From my understandings solar weather is like a 'pitch' regulator for the earths seismic events.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Most caustic solar weather patterns are followed by increased seismic patterns. This all being documented in a sort of cycle for near 300 years.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The flights overhead are likely just precautionary flight's by usgs type's which record temperature increases in select volcanic caverns (sub level). Documenting any areas which show significant signs of expansion via past collected gps / elevation data. Its data hounding, and following such activity, its more so a compliment that we would take such data for future assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I do feel as always we are yet another day closer to a mega event which can do serious damage to our own (or in this case many) nations.
       </strong>
       <em>
        Yet I don't feel the small calibre of these specific solar instances are likely nor capable of enducing a sizeable instance.
       </em>
       <em>
        (were just not in that large a danger zone in that regard).
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Its always good to keep your eyes on the warning signs. 
Thats factually why I study the sun. (I feel its the only force massive enough to create such vast changes across the earth as a whole).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet to me this was more standard burping as magma expanded in more southern regions making Yellowstone slightly stir in her caldera. If anything its good for her and as the ground cools she will be a little more safe due to this recent spike in activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we begin to experience constant and more heightened solar activity, then I'd consider more of an extensive warning in the region. Yet the solar activity I witnessed was likely to produce a 7.0 I estimated this near ecuador. And we had a 6.9 in Guatemala.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think I am / it is, safe to say that it is just spilt milk this time around guys. Yet some adequate shakings coming to the west coast this week! We knew for a week+ a 7.0 level quake was to come last week and it did). Its hard to say if the northern trend will continue. I truly feel san lucas might suffice as they have been geo locked and likely felt a good period of resettlement post guatemala. Yet that quake was northern. So Its possible the activity could remain in that sequence.
      </p>

        Final thoughts
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently we've been laying out the first steps in building a model on the sub reddit
       <a href="/r/ParsingSol">
        /r/ParsingSol
       </a>
       So the theory may some day be ran by an actual computer and the actual mathematical formula xcould be far more exact then I am or ever will be . If you know bluemix that helps. Or have experience coding a program and want to help on a free project with a good cause please  Pm
       <a href="/u/julianthepagan">

       </a>
       and ty!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        We do need help!
       </strong>
       I have a pretty good written concept but its just really a volunteer position / for anyone to participate in. Its for a good cause... 
(Might lead to a paycheck some day)?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       So we are happily accepting to have help! Enjoy your week and thats my update-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        p.s.
       </strong>
       600km/s is mild. Eq should be too! Have fun in the sun!

       For the last 6 months Ive been posting about the recent solar wind upticks, and using them to assess when an earthquake will strike earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel due to a recent fluctuation in solar winds. Them traveling from 298km/s to 600km/s. (over a short amount of time) will cause earth to experience a wave of heightened earthquakes in areas which have remained dormant for a good measure of time. Sometimes with very accurate results. Sometimes with the opposite-
      </p>
      <p>
       Because california is one of these places which hasnt had its fair share of annual seismic activity.  I suspect it is likely to see a moderately large earthquake. (due to the increase of solar winds).

       Calis pretty prepared. This is a moderate quake assessment. Yet for that area I doubt much for any real structural damages or threats to life.

       Honestly I am really getting a grasp on this model project.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its a good idea and will design as functioned. 
I don't know what the end result will be. I am really hoping a million times more accurate then I can ever be. :)

       The positive reinforcement really helps...

       I wrote a theory. 
It basically argues that the particles coming from the sun interact with the earths magnetic field lines charging it. This is a recordable process weve been recording and it may be significant in predicting the more elevated seismic episodes on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       By using basic probability with a focus on incoming solar wind sheens we may be able to accurately predict the likelihood of an earthquake and assess it in advance. 
(by cross referencing the current 'incoming solar data' in real time and cross checking its past records which came prior to past seismic episodes on earth.

       So are you saying that concentrated electric particles heat magma chambers?
      </p>
      <p>
       But what about intermediate earthquakes in Japan from dehydration and embrittlement of the slab, or deep earthquakes in subduction zones, due to phase transformations. There is no interaction with a magma chamber, just the overlying mantle wedge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this theory only for magma chambers? Are you suggesting it works for both transform faults, fracturing in the crust, normal faults ect ect? If so, how?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the 6.9 earthquake in Guatemala, it was 110km deep. Magma chambers are relatively shallow, 1-10km deep. Are you saying the magma chamber expansion and cooling influenced rupturing this deep? Plus, at this depth the earthquake is considered intermediate and would have occurred as mentioned before, in the subducting slab due to dehydration. How would the sun impact this?

      <p>
       No I am saying that solarwinds are absorbed by the earths magnetic field lines, which deposits an electric discharge on the earths core. This absorved energy leads to heat buildup and causes volcanic chambers and magma to react violently.

       I feel seismology is important. The decaying sub surface environment isn't being ruled out due to this process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply feel that the solar events stimulate the largest subsurface changes which lead to many slips. Some earthquakes are not caused by solar interferences. 
Yet many are...
      </p>
      <p>
       I view solar activity as a 'pitch indicator' giving us a unique perspective on addressing the estimated values of seismic thrust a known seismic region will experience...

       No ive never felt all faultlines and features are consistent with this model. Factually I feel seismologists are far more advanced in identifying which regions are likely to becone active and are showing signs of expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       My focus is to design a pitch regulator which determines the amplitude of incoming plasma sheens as they make their way to earth (in real-time); Using usgs and noaa archives to compare past scenarios to current data.
       <em>
        In hopes that the system can locate select areas which follow a frequency and sequence which compliment the model.

I believe the activity that I am tracking is much deeper in range. Its merely a means to identify the pitch of the events. The seismological method defines the process taking place. I merely locate and track the estimated pitch of solar winds while attempting to assess its region of deliverance and amplitude...

       Its a harbinger... Like pressing a trigger acts as a force to release a pin which strikes a rounds blastingcap. This is merely the process which engages the sequence and raises the probability of an events fruitition.

       You are right to assess the geological conditions leading to this earthquake. You are failing to answer what cause lead to such a massive movement in the date range following a spike in solar activity. As well as failing to assess this instance as a harbinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been a slightly consistent phenomena, that I myself am attepting to do my best at documenting. With the begrudgingly argumentative process in which I have outlined.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel the earthquake was fueled by subsurface heat transmission caused by solar winds and storming.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact many earthquakes respond to this heightened 'pitch' leads me to speculate that there is indeed an identifiable process taking place.

      <p>
       At the depth of rupture, it would be embrittlement of the slab due to dehydration or frictional sliding..... Simply where frictional forces are overcome. Occurring, by chance, during the high solar activity. Just like all earthquakes in which slippage occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       out of curiosity, see if you can find high solar activity during Chile's 9.4 magnitude earthquake.

       I still don't understand how this would have any effect on earthquakes? Are you suggesting that this heightened dynamo (are we talking in the outer core?) 'speeds up' plates due to a larger heat transfer, therefore allowing more stress so friction can be overcome?

       Your asking great questions. 
Its aerial chemistry and environmental factors which create the conditions for the flux tubes to envelope our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       To prove were experience fluxes we can now photograph flux tubes as incoming solar winds are impacted. Taking a series of snapshots to time their speed as the energetic particles interact with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>

       </em>
       technically there are two periods which earth is in. Minima and maxima. My belief is there is both a resting and active phase to our planets magnetic field.
      </p>
      <p>
       A low sunspot number has little to do with comparative modeling in that extent. There are still coronal hole streams. Noting also that space weather acts as 'pitch' or as an amplifier to seismic events.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even if there is 300 sunspots per year or 1. The number of events wouldnt change the pitch of additional wind forces and when energy is regulated per velocity shift. 
(again noting cme's, coronal holes and cme's impact earth constantly amongst other cosmic static.
      </p>
      <p>
       as there less solar activity in 1960? 
I haven't particularly studies the past solar cycles in great enough detail to have an informed opinion. I study the current cycle in 'real-time' primarily. Quick google of the dates would allow you to find out if any events were documented on specific dates.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was before the internet so noaa's archive likely wouldn't be available but I am sure observatories took notes on events:)

       My impression on these mega quakes is that they are typically following solar upticks.

      <p>
       Once we have our comparitive algorithm up. I will personally know more. Being able to assess the specific event with greater confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will try to do what I can in the mean time to address this sooner though... Quakes in this scale are not common at all. (hence my theory lol)... ;)

       Let's make things interesting. I'll bet you that a 6.0 earthquake doesn't happen in California in the next 7 days. If i win you don't have to do anything except make a post that simply days Om Nom Nom in the title and not delete it. If you win I'll buy you reddit gold.

       No there's a difference and this isn't a field of anything yet. It'll be proven or disproven in less than a week. Atm it's complete gobbledegook. There's no backing or support or proof of anything he says from anyone else ever. So yes pretentious cock it is. I'll be the first to apologise if he's right but atm cock. You get it?

       I'm not putting together a research paper to change the mind of someone who talks shit without knowing the facts. It's honestly not worth the effort. Sorry you were uneducated and projected your pretentious cockery onto someone who is doing something potentially world changing.

       How?
      </p>

       Earthquakes occur when frictional forces are overcome along fault planes/fracture planes resulting in slip, which releases the seismic waves. How would solar radiation interact with this, considering strain and friction are the drivers of earthquakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Deeper earthquakes like in japan, occur due to frictional sliding of the subducting slab and brittle phase transformations. How would solar radiation be involved with this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The warming you mention occurring at shallow depths within the earth's interior due to incoming solar radiation, surely this would would reduce simple/brittle shearing and remote plastic deformation, thus reducing earthquake frequency/magnitude? Am I clutching at straws?
      </p>
      <p>
       How will you pinpoint solar activity as the smoking gun of earthquakes? How will you link it in with standard models concerning earthquake formation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The correlations have been studied before and no significant correlation was observed. therefore the authros concluded that there is no solar triggering of earthquakes.

       I still haven't really been told. I got linked a video which discussed undulating, concentrated solar wind. But then it stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask again: How does this have any, ANY, effect on earthquakes? If an accepted correlation is ever found, that is statistically significant, I suspect the exact effect on solar radiation will be glossed over.

       We are tracking plasma which holds electric particles that act as a conduit super conductor. These charges often interact with earths outer shielding. Causing a vector of growth to the planetary magnetic field stregnth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the tubes convey within the planet; the earths inner magma chambers recieve additional kinetic energy which leads to heat decay fueling the gyro circulating within. (Leading to boiling/bubbling with in the planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       As new magma chambers expand rapidly they begin to cool and collapse, leading to 'P' waves that make their way back to the earths surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       The correlation held enough significance to have had past tests conducted which complimented the instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've done most these studies well ahead of the processing and general strides we've made in predictive analytics. Finding any significant set of values in the seismic frequency and sequencing would likely be the beginning road blocks needed to address such a model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every value that is of significance is a data plug we can use to our advantage to predict seismic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is about todays technology. Ive proposed a method to test my theory and it holds relevant until it can be tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main points I have to make is that there very well are documented peaks of seismic intensity that followed these solar storms. However the process was likely compared by a direct cause to effect timeline. 
This process not accounting for the time dilation and process which is the excitement of magma, cooling and release (time dialation).
      </p>
      <p>
       Viewing the materials with new strategy tools and design could inherently lead to a working system in terms of a seismic predictive algorithm.

       There are on average 500 earthquakes a year in the range from 5.5-6.0. It's really quite common. And 5.6 is not a big quake by any stretch of the imagination.  You missed the magnitude by a factor of 125.
      </p>
      <p>
       And are you really claiming that the Guatemala earthquake was in the region? What is this 7.0 earthquake that you referred to if not Guatemala? Guatemala is 1500 miles away. That's not even remotely the same region. That's intentionally misleading and disingenuous.

       No. You were wrong. You predicted a 7.0 earthquake in a specific timeframe. Did it happen? No. That was a failed prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is one of many failures. How about the earthquake you tried to predict in March at Fukushima? It never happened during your timeframe even after you asked for a 48 hour extension.
      </p>
      <p>
       The model is far from scientific. If you were using the scientific method, you would have rejected your theory by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious, how did you choose California? What specific solar wind pattern lead you to that specific location? And why 6.0? Why not some other magnitude? What calculation did you perform to come up with that number?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to have credibility, I suggest that you make a follow up post of every prediction and impartially assess whether you were right or wrong. I would not delete or edit old posts or delete your account.

       People who don't believe in what you're doing can make their point and then GTFO. Nobody's perfect, you are certain in the ballpark more often than not. I don't think I've seen a full whiff on any call yet. Let's see what happens in Cali this week.

       It is when you named each location seperately with a high probability. Earth is a pretty big place.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am specifically tracking is the relationship of seismic activity to the suns solar activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel solar activity acts as a 'pitch' value to most of the earths seismic events. I am not a computer and I do my best to plot what I assume to be a trajectory seen within the process taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive never claimed to be doing anything other then assessing data. Compared to past data. The results in my eyes show a pretty constant correlation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit the general model needs fine tuning. Yet Ive done some pretty remarkable things in my short time here.

       You will see both mistakes and successes. 
This much I assure you.

       I am tracking the recent high speed velocity shifts in winds in comparison to elevated proton levels. Which I feel lead to heat decay within the earths magma chambers.

       This is due to seeding of the magnetosphere from solarwinds produced by the recent coronal hole regions that passed earth this week.

       For anyone here complaining about u/ParsingSol and his predictions, you need to calm the fuck down. He's just trying to make light of a higher possibility of a quake in a general location, with the magnitude being the most difficult to nail down.

       parsingshill is a shill there is no correlation as he speaks of. If there was he should have prepared this before hand not post reddit predictions. if he was real he would study earthquakes for a period of time and see how many he could get right then report on what he did in the past not try to predict the future.

       They do, but we're in solar grand minimum now, so they are not as big a threat. Coronal holes that face earth and planetary alignments will cause seismic activity however. Ben Davidson and Dutchsinse are the two big names as far as forecasting and predictions and are usually very accurate.

       it's not a matter of doing a better job, it's a matter of how gathering evidence to fit your hypothesis is not how research should go. of course it will seem valid when you can cobble things together at will to back your theory.

       That's literally what science is until the methodology is solved. You determine if there's any connection (or not) once you cobble the data together, regardless if it backs your theory. All you need to do is have your data/evidence for your theory and have it checked/reviewed by others to correlate and confirm.

       He has the habit of hyping things up way more than they should be for one example he used to post a list of things "strange", on of the strange things was a specific reading from the Sun which happens once every 2 to 3 days  on average.  That isn't rare and there was no need to scare people by leaving how common it was out of his list.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others don't like that he says he has spent years working on this but doesn't have the time to learn how to program it in something like Python.

       He may have something, not saying he doesn't, but his grandiose / hyped sales tactics he uses to get his ideas across tend to put a lot of people off.

       I dont know much about the eclipses and 'planetary alignments'. I think they correlate to a degree. I mean its mass and space. Different pressures in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I more just focus on the winds and their density and speed. Its probably a better question for a physics professional thats checked the math. 
I want to say it wouldn't be wrong to state its certainly a factor. I just can't really quote an estimate on it...
My guess is 'yes' but in a very very minimal if not negligible degree...

       Never failures when working with indigenes science. You are working with things that we don’t have true understanding yet on how they truly correlate. We know it does just not exactly sure why and how. Everyone starts some where. We thought everything in the universe relived around the earth for a long time. Took some time for us to find out that wasn’t true. Stick with it.

       an explanation built off of evidence isn't a hypothesis
      </p>
      <p>
       you make a hypothesis, then gather evidence, it either supports or does not support the hypothesis. if it supports, you refine and repeat until you get a plausible explanation based on the evidence making it a theory.

       While I appreciate your looking out for me. (which I do).

      <p>
       The research is opensource.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inclusion of others, is the only real potential I have at my disposal to create the foundation for this project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless where the user comes from?!? They did encourage a larger foundation and subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I admire their efforts regardless of their intent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only intent I have is to produce a seismic algorithm with more accurate results then I (a simple man) could ever deliver.

       Hey there :)
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know, no one has been able to predict earthquakes correctly. Solar weather currently has a limited impact on the current model of seismology, although recently, the community has begun to investigate the impact of the moon on fault lines, which if proven true, could provide credibility to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open minded, but I have to again mention that no one can currently predict earthquakes. While I encourage an effort, I also must warn against 'Earthquake warnings' so precise as this. This could cause a lot of worry and stress while also discrediting a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you live in California, you should be ready for a local 6-7.0 at all times. There are multiple faults that could go, all of which could be devastating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember though; Be Prepared, Not Scared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay Safe!

       Last time you posted one of these it was a miss.

      <p>
       Do you have any statistics of how many hit/miss you are running? The only one i have seen being statistically correct in these earthquake predictions is suspicious observer's ben davidson.

       We are tracking plasma which holds electric particles that act as a conduit super conductor. These charges often interact with earths outer shielding. Causing a vector of growth to the planetary magnetic field stregnth.

      <p>
       As the tubes convey within the planet; the earths inner magma chambers recieve additional kinetic energy which leads to heat decay fueling the gyro circulating within. (Leading to boiling/bubbling with in the planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       As new magma chambers expand rapidly they begin to cool and collapse, leading to 'P' waves that make their way back to the earths surface.

       Don't listen to the negativity unless it's helpful criticism. Scientists love to scrutinize each other but that just means your theory has to be even more perfect. Don't give up and keep working on it. Your prediction have clearly been above chance at this even if the accuracy is off. In science there are 10,000 incorrect ideas that lead to the correct one. At least you are trying to add to that.

       I wrote a theory. 
It basically argues that the particles coming from the sun interact with the earths magnetic field lines charging it. This is a recordable process weve been recording and it may be significant in predicting the more elevated seismic episodes on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       By using basic probability with a focus on incoming solar wind sheens we may be able to accurately predict the likelihood of an earthquake and assess it in advance. 
(by cross referencing the current 'incoming solar data' in real time and cross checking its past records which came prior to past seismic episodes on earth.

       You're getting a grasp on this model? What are you on about. You've not had anything you've said proved yet. If that happens then yeah you'll have a grasp but atm you're just rambling on as if you're already right.

       We are tracking plasma which holds electric particles that act as a conduit super conductor. These charges often interact with earths outer shielding. Causing a vector of growth to the planetary magnetic field stregnth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the tubes convey within the planet; the earths inner magma chambers recieve additional kinetic energy which leads to heat decay fueling the gyro circulating within. (Leading to boiling/bubbling with in the planet).
      </p>
      <p>
       As new magma chambers expand rapidly they begin to cool and collapse, leading to 'P' waves that make their way back to the earths surface.
