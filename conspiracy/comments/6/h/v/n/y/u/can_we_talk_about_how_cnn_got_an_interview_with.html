       From cancer, iirc. . But the movie " the men who killed Kennedy" talked about how the CIA developed a cancer used to try to assassinate Castro.  I'm guessing they used this on him when he couldn't be bought off

       At this point bin Laden was already well known in the media and conducting attacks against the US directly AND making threats so literally anybody could have picked up a newspaper made that prediction and it not been unreasonable - doesn't make you a prophet or party to some inside information. Presidents were mentioning by name directly to other heads of state and prime ministers. The FBI put him on their 10 most wanted in 1998. You don't go on there for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1999 the UN
       <a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/1999/19991015.sc6739.doc.html">
        security council demanded
       </a>
       that Taliban hand him over. This is nobody's friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US tried to kill him in at least 98 and 99 and quite possibly 00 (yay millennium bug).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all by way of saying that no shit bin Laden was on the horizon.

       It's kind of a joke going back 8 months or so when some WikiLeaks documents were released by WikiLeaks. CNN reported on the documents, 'watered down' the contents, then told it's viewers that it is illegal to download and read the documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       They basically tried to tell everyone their version of what the documents said and that we are not allowed to read them to see for ourselves lol.

       the reason AL-quada is called "the base" is because it was shorter and easier to say rather than "the database" in arabic.
      </p>
      <p>
       the database, of course, was the CIA's database of Islamic Militants they trained and funded, including one Osama Bin Laden.

       There's a whole spectrum of what's defined as kidney failure. I have one kidney removed and my left kidney was badly scarred by reflux and my kidney function is essentially normal (the only hint beyond the scars on my abdomen is my kidneys leak protein) - technically speaking I have kidney failure - and I came within inches of joining the RN where I would have probably ended up serving on subs, but for a civilian job offer I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it's plausible he could have had it though there's no official or reliable information that he either had kidney failure or if he did what sort of kidney failure and how serious it was. The kidney thing IMO actually
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a misinformation exercise aimed at sowing descent in the ranks and/or causing people to attempt communication and anybody who believes it has probably fallen for it too. Considering it came directly from known US sources it fair and reasonable to assume this was the case.

       They are referring to June July 2001 cnn interview, before 9/11. At that time obl was already most wanted for his 98 uss Cole bombing. Cnn found his secret hideout and interviewed him. He said he was gonna nail usa. So the question Op posed is based on Obl still being alive, as he didn't die until December of 2001. So how did cnn get that interview?

       Do you have a source for him dying in 2001? I'm not doubting you, but I just returned from Iraq when he was supposedly buried in the ocean and my commander made a huge deal out of it. I know the military and media lie, but I've never heard another date mentioned.

       Poor guy, that Osama bin laden. He had really bad luck.

      <p>
       First he

        died
       </a>
       in 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he died a second time in 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Obama got him singlehandedly in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media has given us numerous fake bin ladens over the years. The really chinky one with the fat nose is hilarious. He seemed to get younger as he got older.

       Researching Osama bin laden is what got me into this stuff. Its what brought me down into this rabbit hole. Most of the stuff I had found at the time is no longer available on the internet.

       The media need a boogeyman. ISIS is the new boogeyman, although Osama bin laden's son may become a new one.

       9-11 was what got me into this after I left the army. I was in 7th grade when 911 happened and it's why I joined the army. I thought I was defending our freedoms or whatever. Once I got to Iraq and started talking to patients and my interpreter I realized we were the invaders and they were just defending their home like I thought I was. Anyway, thanks for the info. Happy Father's Day if it applies to you!

       Based on my limited exposure to the term petrodollar, I'm assuming it is the fact that US presence in oil rich nations is to mine them of their resources and effectively put the nation into debt slavery because we give them US dollars (which is based on debt) in exchange for their natural resources. Since they have already rid themselves of their oil, they no longer have the means to pay off that debt and will, therefore, be in a perpetual debt cycle.

       I don't know much about the frequency of stuff like "we buried him at sea so fanatics wouldn't be able to pilgrimage to his grave" or whatever, but my interpretation has always been:
      </p>
      <p>
       No way do I believe that the USA would kill the man supposedly responsible for 9/11 and then not bring his body back to the US to examine and gloat about. So they spent a decade hunting him, and he'd killed many thousands of Americans and they didn't bring him home to record absolutely everything they could about him?

       Not a chance in hell. No way do I buy that. Not for a second.

       I 100% agree with that assessment. Didn't we hang Saddam on live tv? I assumed the same thing would happen to Bin Laden since he was supposedly the mastermind of the greatest psyop/ mass trauma in our history. I remember being shocked when my commander announced that they just floated him and gave him a Viking funeral or whatever.

       Yeah, it sounded nice as a kind of respectful gesture and not wanting to give him a particular grave that could become a site of interest, but it just doesn't fit with everything that the USA would typically do as far as I'm aware!
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I also expected that at least one of the people involved in either killing him or getting his body into that boat and wrapped up would have snapped a picture.

       If I recall correctly, he says he doesn't want to kill civilians and so saying he doesn't want to nail the US in the interview. He would have been lying as he was knee deep in 9/11 planning at that time.

       In the 1997 interview he said they are responsible but not a target. His words are also focused on the presence in the middle east but I'm sure that is clever misdirection. This is while they were sending people to train in the US or something.

       That's not the same. Snowden isn't hiding, he is protected. Bin Laden was a terrorist (supposedly, anyway) that the US claimed they couldn't find, yet CNN could find him? Why would the government not contact CNN and ask for the location? Why would CNN not report it? Why would CNN have the resources to find it but not the government? It doesn't add up.

       How is it obvious I'm a "MAGA troll"? I don't even like Trump! Fuck the guy! He filled his cabinet with elite Goldman Sach lobbyists. He's a conman! He was closely tied to pedo Epstein as well.

       Don't feed the trolls man, I'm guessing he belongs to some analytic group out of somewhere like Cambridge.

       You seriously just guessed that a random dink in here went to Cambridge? I assume everyone on the internet is a 25 year old virgin, and it's been fairly accurate thus far.

       Also, are we just reporting everyone who doesn't submit now? I agree that dude was off base, but saw nothing worthy of reporting.

       I'm very openly against trump, but that doesn't mean it should be talked about in a thread that has absolutely nothing to do with him.  And no I don't actually think he went to Cambridge, hahaha. Cambridge Analytica is very very far right Internet astroturfing/marketing ploy type things.

       Dude, there's been so much evidence over the past 8 months that if you're asking for proof, then you're too entrenched in your side to be receptive to having your mind changed. I'm not a Bible reading man, but I do like the parable about casting pearls before swine.

       Better question - explain away the DNI report. Explain away the law enforcement officials who've attested to Russia's meddling in the election. Explain away all of the connections between Russians and Trump's campaign team. Explain away the lies Jeff Sessions has been caught in and the photos exposing his lies. Explain away the reason Trump gave Lester Holt for firing James Comey.

       Sure but this journalist brought a government raid that lead to his arrest. Big OBL was that big of a terrorist why wouldn't the CIA or DEA or any other alphabet agency not care about this interview and the location of it? Because OBL was a CIA asset and scapegoat that needed to be free to support their agenda

       Pretty easy. Be a real CNN guy so everybody knows you are real. Put the word out on the Al Qaeda network that you wanna interview OBL. When you get a bite, go for the interview. Pray like hell that you will not be kidnapped.
