       LOL. As someone who doesn't go to that sub, I never noticed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, in the United States of America, we have a government monopolized by one party which has extraordinary power and is using it to take away health benefits, to give giant tax cuts to the oligarchs, to collect more of our personal data through ISP deregulation, to reduce the internet by ending net neutrality ....
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing to see there. All a distraction from the last people in office ...
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, those people who could be investigated and prosecuted by the current party in power ...

       Why should it when there is nothing to actually report on or discuss? I am still waiting to hear back from the DC police on my inquires (into number of detectives vs cases) but will probably be another week from the email the press dept sent me. When I get that will post a thread as it will be new info.

Subject: Looking for some basic information (not in annual report)
       </p>
       <p>
        to mpd.press 
I am looking to gather data from various police departments in the US:
       </p>
       <p>
        Number of Homicide detectives employed in previous year (or more if available) and, if available the number of homicides they are working on (caseload).
       </p>
       <p>
        The idea is to get a snapshot of funding and resources available and the impact in solving homicides (general overview).
       </p>

       In Washington, DC, autopsy reports are not public information. Other jurisdictions maybe different. Causes and manners of death are public information and is released to the public when requested.

       Seth's case isn't being treated any different than anyone else's.
      </p>

       The police, hospital, coroner have all been consistent. So are all the other cases conspiracies too?

       The police are investigating it and 64 other unsolved homicides from last year, and more the year before that and some this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       They only have so many people per homicide to work on these cases.

       People could donate to a fund the DC police have that pays for reenactments of crimes to be broadcast and put on youtube. No one seems interested in doing that.

       They have been ordered to stand down and they have shelfed the case and the evidence.  They can't even tell where Rich's laptop is--a laptop that has no relevance to a "botched robbery".
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were investigating they would be reaching out to the community for possible leads.  They would hold press conferences to draw attention, ask for information, and publicize the reward money for tips.

       My proof of that is that they have not given anyone any information at all.  The murder was a year ago.

       Dude...if you want to actually read what he wrote, he's saying that they are NOT investigating it because it's D.C. And they have more than 1 cold case in the file believe it or not. Just because you fell for 4chan/TD larpers doesn't mean the police should treat it at a higher priority than catching killers of all the other murders.

       Follow that up with a freedom of information request (for several of those cases, not just his). See if you get the same replies/information.

       No, I am delighted that they are consistent and not treating one person different than others, which is what people have claimed. And they have deceptively claimed so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is easy to rush about posting 'the cops are doing nothing, see they won't send me xyz' or 'the coroner office refuses to release their report on him!' when the fact of the matter is that is how every case works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a way to hook people and reel them in while really saying nothing at all. it is an attempt to convince them something is off/different so there must be a conspiracy. It is deceitful and wrong and also sad that so many are suckered in by it.
