       10 years ago a youtube user named "tanascheel" started making some really edgy videos about atheism, how stupid the average person and other social problems, always with an arrogant tone with Rammstein as the background music, wish somebody made some mirrors, this user quickly deleted everything and went AWOL, but by then we already knew her name was Alexandra de Scheel, a privileged, rich, highly educated and arrogant girl who once wrote her short autobiography
       <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:n9mxRTpgG14J:www.angelfire.com/celeb2/princess_alexandra/bio.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=mx">
        here
       </a>
       where she revealed "
       <em>
        She was born into the ROyal House of Reuss in Austria and was also part of the royal family of the Netherlands.
       </em>
       " No other biography of this woman includes that detail, all other biographies you can find say nothing of he royal family connection
      </p>
      <p>
       On a similar note, another youtube user called "Naturalselector89" was making even edgier, stupid videos about social darwinism, atheism and other social issues, here is a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3NvnsrCnJa3PL0utJjH9w">
        mirror
       </a>
       of his entire channel. Pekka Eric Auviden, the Jokkela High School shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, his edgelord windows movie maker rants came into the attention of "TheAmazingAtheist" who made
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq56CjUA0C4">
        this video
       </a>
       pretty much predicting this kid would end up like the columbine shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Tanascheel" and "Naturalselector89" became friends and exchanged lots of youtube messages, eventually, he became his internet girlfriend, "Tanascheel" got on the spotlight over it after the shooting then denied even being friends with him, she lied through her teeth about it, here's the evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       From an article in which she was interviewed:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I was making quite popular opinion videos on YouTube about politics philosophy and life. One of the people who watched had begun an obsessive harassment of me and when I told him firmly to leave me alone he ended up shooting up his school and killing 25 people which the media in part blamed on me. I ended up moving across the world back to America to be with someone I didn’t know well enough who used what happened to keep me from leaving by saying he would kill himself or others and playing to my guilt. Eventually I chose freedom over the risk and called his bluff…”
      </p>
      <p>
       Here Alexandra discusses Pekka Eric Auvinen. She discards the interaction as him harassing her and her shooing him away.
      </p>
      <p>
       SN: The death toll of the Jokela high school shooting was 9 people, including the perpetrator, and 13 injuries. Thank you to the anon who pointed me in the direction of this article.

       This women got in a silly internet relationship with an unhinged kid, she most likely knew this idiot would feel like life was now worth living, then cyberdumped his ass, causing him a catastrophic meltdown, why would some rich socialite bitch do this? It's really damn weird and nobody talked about it ever since.

       here's an interesting razor to ponder.  those who think it's ok for them to cause others harm (excluding immediate self-defense as a reason), and those who don't.  just look for the smells, 'cos they give themselves away.

       There's a case going on at the moment, a girl is being charged for encouraging her boyfriend to kill himself. Who knows whether this girl fucked with this guy enough and encouraged him to commit murders. It's entirely possible. Women are psychopaths and sociopaths as well.
