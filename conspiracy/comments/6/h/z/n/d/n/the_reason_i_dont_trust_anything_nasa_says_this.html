    <div class="md"><p>Okay, fair enough. That clip is far from the crux of my argument. </p>

<p>Let me just say this. If you are genuinely curious about the idea that NASA is faking many things, let me know what you think of this clip:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/CzyPN8-AbJQ?t=20m9s">https://youtu.be/CzyPN8-AbJQ?t=20m9s</a></p>

<p>Again, I would suggest muting the sound (and narrator) and just looking at the clip with your eyes. Thats really all you need.</p>

<p>And believe me, this particular footage is actually something that weighs on my NASA beliefs very strongly. Its not small change like that wire clip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the problem a lot of people have with your theory is that to me, it looks like the guy reaches for the pocket with his ring finger + surrounding fingers, but misses since he is still looking straight forward (wouldn&#39;t he look at the wire to make sure he doesn&#39;t hit it with his hand, making it entirely obvious), only connecting with his pinky, so it looks like he grabbed at something with his ring finger.  I&#39;m having a hard time seeing any clothing move until the pinky connects.  I also have a hard time believing if NASA is trying to fake this, then why would they have all 3 extras in the video operating wires instead of any number of people outside of the very tight shot.  I&#39;m not saying NASA doesn&#39;t fake anything since this is my first real inspection of anything from that list, but it seems like this isn&#39;t the best example to aggressively sell as an obvious fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it man. Two actors behind are also reaching for an invisible string. It&#39;s like they all check the strings at the same time. Also moment before man&#39;s hand gets near the pocket you see a tug at that area where the hand is reaching. I&#39;m with you, they fake this shit. The vids about the augmented reality imo, are even better evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it equally fascinating to hear from people who refuse to see it. Its amazing to me that someone can watch the same video evidence of something and mentally wish away the inconsistencies.</p>

<p>I mean, even if you look at my gif out of context, it is questionable.</p>

<p>Looking at in the context of the whole video. The other astronauts all start acting very strange as soon as the guy does the flip. Which he literally does after the &quot;totally neutral&quot; TV announcer says &quot;How do I know you guys are really in space?&quot;.</p>

<p>Like really, what a script.</p>

<p>The flip that he practiced a thousand times went a little south during the live taping and everyone gets into damage control mode and the USMC shirt fucks up and makes the decision to grab the cable (full screen, watch his ring finger pull the cable into his palm).</p>

<p>Another poster here is also trying to shame me for believing that NASA would have the means to edit out a wire. As if digital editing is some new and crazy field that NASA can&#39;t afford.</p>

<p>Now on to my favorite. I always look for this in the &quot;NASA USES GREEN SCREEN&quot; sections, because none of these flat Earthers care to verify the claims of their YouTube prophets.</p>

<p>In the video with Bush at NASA and the guy is up on the screen in front of a blue screen, that&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/iginxrFn3jg">this experiment on circular motion</a>, not a green screen.</p>

<p>Being a Freemason is not a proof of fakery. I could walk downtown right now, get a petition, and join the Freemasons tomorrow. If you seriously believe Freemasons have any semblance of control, I encourage you to attend a public meeting.</p>

<p>Don Pettis saying we don&#39;t have the tech to go back to the moon is a bit misleading and also misinterpreted. When Apollo was shut down, they closed the factories that were making the parts. They destroyed molds, older stuff got decommissioned, and the people who worked on them are gone now. The important thing to focus on here is that we do not have the technology <em>on hand</em> to get to the moon. It would take new materials, and new lander design, new rocket design..all of which is doable, but he&#39;s right in saying we don&#39;t have it right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, since I just happened to pick a link and am discussing it with another person in this thread. How exactly do you explain this:</p>

<p><a href="http://makeagif.com/i/Krd2UV">http://makeagif.com/i/Krd2UV</a></p>

<p>Here is one astronaut (wearing USMC shirt) grabbing an invisible cable to stabilize his buddy. NASA edited the cable out of the video feed which is something that any person in the digital editing industry will confirm is not a difficult thing to do.</p>

<p>How do you explain a person&#39;s hand gripping and tugging on nothing?</p>

<p>And here is the source of that gif. Like I told the other guy, just mute the video and let your eyes take in what they see. </p>

<p>Also, I have seen a lot of the other videos on this list before and many make a very great case against the Apollo missions. Strong enough that it brings the whole NASA organization into question.</p>

<p>You have to admit that its not like I am saying something crazy. Even if it is all just a coincidence, it is a piece of footage that could reasonably be called suspicious.

    <div class="md"><p>I am still researching the Flat Earth Theory. I don&#39;t know what exactly we live on, but at this point I highly doubt we live on a spinning ball. I understand your anger and frustration with the Flat Earth Theory. At first I laughed; then I was angry, and then I was shocked. The Flat Earthers don&#39;t have all of the answers to your questions. But they keep investigating and researching everyday. You have to give them credit for that. Tesla claimed that Earth is not a planet, but a &quot;realm&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wait so... do you guys believe in space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, I don&#39;t know. What is &quot;space&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that we&#39;re just a flat chip of rock floating around?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if we dug far enough, we&#39;d get to like an undiscovered underside?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know that, either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are all other &#39;planets&#39; also flat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t appear to be. Maybe Earth is unique, after all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the sun flat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sun is round, but beyond that, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or is outerspace a lie?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is what we are all trying to find out. We can&#39;t trust NASA, so people are now doing their own experiments to get answers. And, some of their conclusions are shocking. But, like I said, I don&#39;t know what we live on, but at this point of my research, I highly doubt we live on a spinning ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not as if NASA started the idea that the earth is round... Astronomers going back to antiquity believed the same thing, because the observational evidence makes it obvious. Even moreso today, with satellites, modern telescopes, and so on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really silly. Can you point me to someone who can answer my questions? Someone should at least have <em>imagined</em> what a universe with a flat earth could look like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe in everything about space that math and science can prove. As a matter of fact, I find that a good percentage of mature NASA skeptics are very knowledgeable about space because our very love of the cosmos is what led us to NASA. For example, I have a telescope worth a five grand.</p>

<p>What exactly is <em>happening</em> in space is a different story though. For all I know NASA is protecting us from the truth and it is a noble thing. I just cannot &quot;unsee&quot; the mountains of evidence I have personally sifted through (over 15 years) that show a very, very sketchy &quot;Apollo&quot; operation and a few other... lets just say <em>strange</em> &quot;coincidences&quot; and inconsistencies surrounding the entire NASA organization.</p>

<p>I personally believe in the ISS for example, because it can be tracked and seen. But what actually happens up there is something I am not sure I can trust at face value. Also, where the ISS flies is just barely &quot;space&quot;, its low earth orbit. </p>

<p>Beyond the ISS, I don&#39;t know how far I believe we have sent a MANNED mission. But thats another personal belief.</p>

<p>I guess my point is that many people are hardcore skeptical of NASA (an executive branch of the US goverment) but who also believe in mainstream science.</p>

<p>Belief in space is not the same as belief in NASA. Many people argue on the flawed idea that they are mutually exclusive concepts. They are not.</p>
