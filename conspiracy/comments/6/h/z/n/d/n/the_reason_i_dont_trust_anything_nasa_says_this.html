       I personally don't believe in any of the flat-Earth models and have my own opinions as to why that conspiracy theory exist. That being said....

       If you have the mental capacity to ignore the package (a flat-Earth subreddit) and ignore some of the more random "space conspiracy" stuff peppered into this list. This is seriously one of the best compilations of links out there and there are many different videos which deserve an explanation.

       Here is one astronaut (wearing USMC shirt) grabbing an invisible cable to stabilize his buddy. NASA edited the cable out of the video feed which is something that any person in the digital editing industry will confirm is not a difficult thing to do.

       This makes it even easier to see. Pretty clear to me that he's reaching for his pants and gets a pinky in his pocket. Which is why he gets a closed fist except for his pinky, and his pants pull right where you'd expect if this is the case.

       So I guess you are still refusing to watch his ring finger scoop a cable out of the air and then tug on it. His pants pocket is jutting out also because of the wire.

       Are you seriously acting like NASA isn't capable of editing out a cable digitally from a live feed?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shittiest video agency in Manhattan has that capability.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its fine, really. Now I have a perfect understanding of where you are at and how much you are willing to see, or in your case, not see.

       Okay, fair enough. That clip is far from the crux of my argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me just say this. If you are genuinely curious about the idea that NASA is faking many things, let me know what you think of this clip:
      </p>

       <a href="https://youtu.be/CzyPN8-AbJQ?t=20m9s">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I would suggest muting the sound (and narrator) and just looking at the clip with your eyes. Thats really all you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       And believe me, this particular footage is actually something that weighs on my NASA beliefs very strongly. Its not small change like that wire clip.

       I think the problem a lot of people have with your theory is that to me, it looks like the guy reaches for the pocket with his ring finger + surrounding fingers, but misses since he is still looking straight forward (wouldn't he look at the wire to make sure he doesn't hit it with his hand, making it entirely obvious), only connecting with his pinky, so it looks like he grabbed at something with his ring finger.  I'm having a hard time seeing any clothing move until the pinky connects.  I also have a hard time believing if NASA is trying to fake this, then why would they have all 3 extras in the video operating wires instead of any number of people outside of the very tight shot.  I'm not saying NASA doesn't fake anything since this is my first real inspection of anything from that list, but it seems like this isn't the best example to aggressively sell as an obvious fake.

       Thanks for the link.  I watched maybe 10 minutes from the point you linked and it was the first thing that got me to really reconsider what I know about our space program (which is the basics they teach you growing up).  Definitely needs more time/research on my part.  I started coming to r/conspiracy more frequently because of the enormous amount of bullshit spewing out of the elite's mouths lately and I do believe it is within their power to pull off this level of a hoax.

       I see it man. Two actors behind are also reaching for an invisible string. It's like they all check the strings at the same time. Also moment before man's hand gets near the pocket you see a tug at that area where the hand is reaching. I'm with you, they fake this shit. The vids about the augmented reality imo, are even better evidence.

       I find it equally fascinating to hear from people who refuse to see it. Its amazing to me that someone can watch the same video evidence of something and mentally wish away the inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, even if you look at my gif out of context, it is questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at in the context of the whole video. The other astronauts all start acting very strange as soon as the guy does the flip. Which he literally does after the "totally neutral" TV announcer says "How do I know you guys are really in space?".
      </p>
      <p>
       Like really, what a script.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flip that he practiced a thousand times went a little south during the live taping and everyone gets into damage control mode and the USMC shirt fucks up and makes the decision to grab the cable (full screen, watch his ring finger pull the cable into his palm).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another poster here is also trying to shame me for believing that NASA would have the means to edit out a wire. As if digital editing is some new and crazy field that NASA can't afford.

       Why did NASA lie? Flat plane, bruh. Its so fucking boring at this point. The only way it could be interesting now is if it's proven correct. Even then, I'll be like the and refute the proof saying otherwise.

       There are a ton of amazing links that really poke holes in the NASA narrative. They have fuck-all to do with "flat-Earth".

       I get that. And I appreciate your attempt to create such a discussion. I guess even having to preface as you did in the op is just a bummer. In such a short amount of time those theories dig their roots all the way back to the 16th century. Lol.

       I'll stop though as this defeats the purpose of sidestepping FE garage. I'll peruse and come back with something more relevant to the OP's purpose. 👾

       Not a flat earther either but in my opinion the best argument for it is that NASA is against it.

       Interesting point. My core belief is that the Earth could be round and exactly as is described by math and science and that wouldn't make NASA any less of a sketchy-as-fuck agency.

       Well, I'm obviously not going to watch every single one of those. I watched a few though. The guy Buzz Aldrin punched in the face (Burt something?) is extremely disrespectful, and I probably would've hit him too.

       Now on to my favorite. I always look for this in the "NASA USES GREEN SCREEN" sections, because none of these flat Earthers care to verify the claims of their YouTube prophets.

       In the video with Bush at NASA and the guy is up on the screen in front of a blue screen, that's
       <a href="https://youtu.be/iginxrFn3jg">
        this experiment on circular motion
       </a>
       , not a green screen.

       Being a Freemason is not a proof of fakery. I could walk downtown right now, get a petition, and join the Freemasons tomorrow. If you seriously believe Freemasons have any semblance of control, I encourage you to attend a public meeting.

       Don Pettis saying we don't have the tech to go back to the moon is a bit misleading and also misinterpreted. When Apollo was shut down, they closed the factories that were making the parts. They destroyed molds, older stuff got decommissioned, and the people who worked on them are gone now. The important thing to focus on here is that we do not have the technology
       <em>
        on hand
       </em>
       to get to the moon. It would take new materials, and new lander design, new rocket design..all of which is doable, but he's right in saying we don't have it right now.

       Okay, since I just happened to pick a link and am discussing it with another person in this thread. How exactly do you explain this:

       Here is one astronaut (wearing USMC shirt) grabbing an invisible cable to stabilize his buddy. NASA edited the cable out of the video feed which is something that any person in the digital editing industry will confirm is not a difficult thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain a person's hand gripping and tugging on nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is the source of that gif. Like I told the other guy, just mute the video and let your eyes take in what they see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I have seen a lot of the other videos on this list before and many make a very great case against the Apollo missions. Strong enough that it brings the whole NASA organization into question.

       Dude, he reaches for the pocket (blind I might add, he's not looking in his direction), and it's pretty clear that you can see his whole fist close except for his pinky. His pants then pull to the right with a rounded apex, which indicates a finger to me. How is that harder to believe than wires?

       At the exact same time you say he's "grabbing a wire", you can clearly see his pinky finger right where the opening to his pocket would be, and when he pulls, the pocket pulls to the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing I don't buy about wire harnesses, why would it be attached to the clothing and not to something underneath? Clothing tears, especially during what would be a parabolic flight. If the harness is indeed under the clothes, why does his pocket get pulled to the right?

       You have to admit that its not like I am saying something crazy. Even if it is all just a coincidence, it is a piece of footage that could reasonably be called suspicious. It doesn't necessarily mean foul play is happening. But admit that is does, if fact,
       <em>
        look

       very suspicious.

       I'm not claiming your crazy man, I understand the wire harness theory, I just don't think this is a good example of that. The video may be suspicious in nature, but if we're focusing on that pulling motion, I believe that is explained by a pinky in the pocket.

       To me it looks like his pinky gets ahold of his pocket but the ring finger looks like it grabs something right before the pinky gets to the pocket. Maybe the wire runs into his pockets?

       I don't discount the Flat Earth Theory. Everyday there is more and more evidence being presented that we don't live on a spinning ball; that we live on a Flat Earth. Get used to it. The Flat Earthers aren't going away. Their numbers are growing exponentially. One day, someone, or a group of people, will settle this whole debate once and for all.

       But I specifically made this thread to talk about NASA being sketchy. My only point is that flat-earth is not necessary for that discussion to be valid.

       Wait so... do you guys believe in space? Are you saying that we're just a flat chip of rock floating around? And if we dug far enough, we'd get to like an undiscovered underside?

       This is hilarious, but I'm also genuinely intrigued. Are all other 'planets' also flat? Or is outerspace a lie?

       I am still researching the Flat Earth Theory. I don't know what exactly we live on, but at this point I highly doubt we live on a spinning ball. I understand your anger and frustration with the Flat Earth Theory. At first I laughed; then I was angry, and then I was shocked. The Flat Earthers don't have all of the answers to your questions. But they keep investigating and researching everyday. You have to give them credit for that. Tesla claimed that Earth is not a planet, but a "realm".

       That is what we are all trying to find out. We can't trust NASA, so people are now doing their own experiments to get answers. And, some of their conclusions are shocking. But, like I said, I don't know what we live on, but at this point of my research, I highly doubt we live on a spinning ball.

       It's not as if NASA started the idea that the earth is round... Astronomers going back to antiquity believed the same thing, because the observational evidence makes it obvious. Even moreso today, with satellites, modern telescopes, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really silly. Can you point me to someone who can answer my questions? Someone should at least have
       <em>
        imagined
       </em>
       what a universe with a flat earth could look like.

       I personally believe in everything about space that math and science can prove. As a matter of fact, I find that a good percentage of mature NASA skeptics are very knowledgeable about space because our very love of the cosmos is what led us to NASA. For example, I have a telescope worth a five grand.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly is
       <em>
        happening
       </em>
       in space is a different story though. For all I know NASA is protecting us from the truth and it is a noble thing. I just cannot "unsee" the mountains of evidence I have personally sifted through (over 15 years) that show a very, very sketchy "Apollo" operation and a few other... lets just say
       <em>
        strange
       </em>
       "coincidences" and inconsistencies surrounding the entire NASA organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe in the ISS for example, because it can be tracked and seen. But what actually happens up there is something I am not sure I can trust at face value. Also, where the ISS flies is just barely "space", its low earth orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond the ISS, I don't know how far I believe we have sent a MANNED mission. But thats another personal belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is that many people are hardcore skeptical of NASA (an executive branch of the US goverment) but who also believe in mainstream science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Belief in space is not the same as belief in NASA. Many people argue on the flawed idea that they are mutually exclusive concepts. They are not.

       If they are idiots, then let them be idiots. Why do you care? It obviously upsets you. People believe in shape-shifting purple polka-dotted lizards that eat humans. I don't get upset. That is why this is a conspiracy sub. People are permitted to think outside of the box.
