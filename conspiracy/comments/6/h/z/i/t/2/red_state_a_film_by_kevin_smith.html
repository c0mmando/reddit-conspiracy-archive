       If you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend it. I think it offers a well pictured look at not only religious extremism in the United States, but the
       <em>
        cough
       </em>
       perceived willingness to do "whatever it takes". I recently listened to "Behold a Pale Horse", and it frightens me how dead on he was even thirty years ago. I mention this because the official story of Cooper's death, Waco, and events in the film I mentioned above are leading me to serious doubts about the veracity of such claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       ASIDE: Sessions claimed the FBI has at least 35,000 employees. Idk about where you live but that could fill my town seven times over. Funny how the idea that a few hundred, maybe even a thousand people couldn't pull off some grand plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       ASIDE #2. On more conspiracy related news I've been convinced for the last several years that all major hollywood productions are mass programming platforms which are filled with intelligence agents (the actors) to control and promote anything from certain types of behaviors and thought processes to nationalist pride!

       I'd love to just sit down and have a conversation with Kevin Smith. He seems like a very aware guy. Jay and Silent Bob are pretty iconic but the premise behind Dogma was incredibly interesting, I bet he has a lot of interesting thoughts.

       He has MANY podcasts. I really enjoy "Smodcast" where he and his longtime producer Scott Moser just shoot the shit. It's actually responsible for the movie "Tusk" and "Yoga Hosers". I also really like his "Fatman on Batman" with Marc Bernardin where they break down all the comic book news of the week/month when they can. Really fun stuff. He's coming to Raleigh pretty soon to do some stand up which I'm really looking forward to. Hope you dig the podcasts.

       He really doesn't seem very aware.  If he did he'd be putting out far more eye opening movies than his self indulged dialogue driven lackluster movies that barely dive into anything remotely interesting.

       It isn't true anymore.  I mean, there are movies that are pro-government, anti-government, the same for war, crime, pretty much anything.  Hollywood is pretty liberal, and I think the major studios control the message more than anything else - certainly not the government.
