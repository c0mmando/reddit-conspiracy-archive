        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look, I know this has been done to death here, but this dialogue is insanely dumb. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Trump one iota. I&#39;m also able to recognize that he has really done more to mainstream conspiracy ideas than any other public figure. </p>

<p>There&#39;s room for nuance here. We can recognize that super pro-trump people are at risk of getting &quot;Obama&#39;d&quot;, that Trump may be lying about his hopey changey crap in order to pander to people who watch things closely. This is still a victory for us. Perhaps a phyrric one, but it&#39;s still worth it to make politicians lie. Politicans shouldn&#39;t just be able to say &quot;rape the poor&quot;. They should have to make promises. </p>

<p>Trump has made many promises. I don&#39;t care about any other than drain the swamp. That is the one where I want to hold him accountable. Thusfar, he&#39;s done a middling job doing so. I don&#39;t think hiring millionaires is really failing to do so. People elected Trump because he couldn&#39;t be bought. Trump appointed his cabinet for the same reason. I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, but I can understand the narrative, and it&#39;s not inconsistent. In the worst case scenario, he&#39;s just cutting out the middleman. The billionaires already run everything.</p>

<p>At the same time, I understand that &quot;draining the swamp&quot; takes time and energy and strategy. Thusfar, I think Trump is being largely vindicated by the massive PR campaigns against him. And of course he is certainly sowing and provoking those reactions to him, so they must be taken with a grain of salt. In addition, I believe people like Louise Mensch are controlled opposition. </p>

<p>I hope HRC goes to jail. At the same time, I think locking her up right at the beginning of the administration would have been a catastrophe for the United States. I&#39;m also pretty aware that pro-Trump propagandists are advancing the Human Trafficking / Seth Rich narrative. For example, this last Seth Rich push with Hannity and Kim Dotcom and Rod Wheeler was pretty much entirely fake news.</p>

<p>So lets work together to understand everybody. We can understand those who support Trump, and we can understand those who are against Trump. There are trolls and shills and genuine supporters on both sides. </p>

<p>How can we reconcile those narratives?</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out how we can support the positive aspects of Trump while holding him accountable for the negative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I was addressing a supposed Stein supporter so I don&#39;t think that &quot;abolishing the departments&quot; is high on his values list.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not in the slightest. It works only in the sense that FedEx works better than USPS. Of course a school will show better results if you let it cherry pick its students. School choice funnels money away from the only schools that must accept all students - making them even worse options.</p>

<p>They also serve a completely different mission. If a charter school was forced to accept every student, it would do worse than a public school in most cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop giving tenure to teachers and fire them based on their merit. Teachers in low income neighborhoods are shitty teachers they don&#39;t have a 10% pass rate because the kids are stupid it&#39;s because their family structure and schooling structure has failed them. I agree it is fucked up atm, but more regulation and giving Washington more power is not the way to fix it us as communities need to fix our problems not rely on more government. Less government more communities caring for each  other is the solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read that at all. I read something that was designed to attract pro-trump people, and to get people not rabidly anti-trump interested enough to read all the way through to the last bit to discredit inquiry into Seth Rich. And to make you feel unreasonable for not feeling the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Seth Rich merits investigation, and is extremely suspicious. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think Hannity, Kim Dotcom, or Rod Wheeler are valid sources. I think the <em>entire</em> latest volley of Seth Rich evidence was largely fake news. There were some details that came out from independent investigators that were valuable, but largely nothing.</p>

<p>Kim Dotcom can&#39;t just say &quot;I am the source&quot; and leave it there. If he has evidence, lets see it. Anything else is larping. He knows a US jury will never ever ask for his testimony, and even if they do, I think he&#39;s more likely to flip as part of a bargain than he is to stay on the right side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its great because it was one of those unexpected laughs (and i sound like the damn CryptKeeper when i laugh) and i never laugh. I literally got the nickname Wolfman in the office because i just walk around and look like im stalking pray. So for them to hear me burst out laughing when no one is talking is odd. Especially because its the 1st time in the 8+ years ive been here. BTW, you might have just destroyed the persona i have been developing for damn near a decade.... :/</p>

<p>Trump has made many promises. I don&#39;t care about any other than drain the swamp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was classic Trump though, promise something that means something different to every supporter.</p>

<p>What <em>exactly</em> did you think it meant when he made that promise?</p>

<p>From where I sit it was a PR phrase designed to get people exactly like you on board without having to promise them anything concrete.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a feeling, not a function.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was going to say this too. I feel I should emphazise that it isn&#39;t specific to Trump but rather is the basic foundation of populist politics; Deliver engaging speech on divisive subjects, promise <em>very</em> vague results that ideally have impossible to measure outcomes.</p>

<p>Trump is ofcourse <strong>very</strong> guilty of lying about nearly everything, but this particular mode of lying is not just classic Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop giving tenure to teachers and fire them based on their merit. Teachers in low income neighborhoods are shitty teachers they don&#39;t have a 10% pass rate because the kids are stupid it&#39;s because their family structure and schooling structure has failed them. I agree it is fucked up atm, but more regulation and giving Washington more power is not the way to fix it us as communities need to fix our problems not rely on more government. Less government more communities caring for each  other is the solution. </p>
