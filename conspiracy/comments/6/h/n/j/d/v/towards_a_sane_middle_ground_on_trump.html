       Look, I know this has been done to death here, but this dialogue is insanely dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust Trump one iota. I'm also able to recognize that he has really done more to mainstream conspiracy ideas than any other public figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's room for nuance here. We can recognize that super pro-trump people are at risk of getting "Obama'd", that Trump may be lying about his hopey changey crap in order to pander to people who watch things closely. This is still a victory for us. Perhaps a phyrric one, but it's still worth it to make politicians lie. Politicans shouldn't just be able to say "rape the poor". They should have to make promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has made many promises. I don't care about any other than drain the swamp. That is the one where I want to hold him accountable. Thusfar, he's done a middling job doing so. I don't think hiring millionaires is really failing to do so. People elected Trump because he couldn't be bought. Trump appointed his cabinet for the same reason. I'm not saying I agree with it, but I can understand the narrative, and it's not inconsistent. In the worst case scenario, he's just cutting out the middleman. The billionaires already run everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I understand that "draining the swamp" takes time and energy and strategy. Thusfar, I think Trump is being largely vindicated by the massive PR campaigns against him. And of course he is certainly sowing and provoking those reactions to him, so they must be taken with a grain of salt. In addition, I believe people like Louise Mensch are controlled opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope HRC goes to jail. At the same time, I think locking her up right at the beginning of the administration would have been a catastrophe for the United States. I'm also pretty aware that pro-Trump propagandists are advancing the Human Trafficking / Seth Rich narrative. For example, this last Seth Rich push with Hannity and Kim Dotcom and Rod Wheeler was pretty much entirely fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets work together to understand everybody. We can understand those who support Trump, and we can understand those who are against Trump. There are trolls and shills and genuine supporters on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can we reconcile those narratives?

       That's a load of horse puckey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to figure out how we can support the positive aspects of Trump while holding him accountable for the negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I supported Obama's Hope and Change too. And then he fell through on that. Just because politicans fail us doesn't mean we can't support the things they stand for.

       Where's the part about holding him accountable for anything? Everything negative you say is immediately followed by "here's why I give him a pass on this".

       I know what he's trying to do, but he's trying to do it in a very one sided way. It's the typical Trump supporter story - "We won! Now, can we all just stop fighting, get along and come together in lockstep support of our Dear Leader"

       I did appreciate that his propagandists broke rank with him when he dropped bombs. The Bush and Obama cheerleaders never did that.

       Demolishing the departments would be great, but that is probably not what they are going to do. They will continue to accept lobbyist money and the department will remain corrupt and the left and right will continue to play their socially engineered role of "we need to let christians teach in school and the left saying we need the department of education because government is good" when free choice schooling has been proven to work. Also adhom attacks and assuming just he voted Trump is a great way to not be taken seriously and proves your still buying into the two party system as if your vote fucking matters

       Yeah, I was addressing a supposed Stein supporter so I don't think that "abolishing the departments" is high on his values list. If you don't see the importance of a strong Federal government, you're not likely find anything you like in any of the progressive candidates.

      <p>
       Not in the slightest. It works only in the sense that FedEx works better than USPS. Of course a school will show better results if you let it cherry pick its students. School choice funnels money away from the only schools that must accept all students - making them even worse options.

       They also serve a completely different mission. If a charter school was forced to accept every student, it would do worse than a public school in most cases.

       I'm far less worried about government propaganda and conspiracies than I am about the corporate/capitalist takeover over America. The common American is losing and it's not because of government waste.

       yes it is because of government waste and it all comes back to economics and the fed I cant even have this conversation with you if you don't realize that. "lets keep dumping millions of dollars into the Department of Education while it bureaucratically siphons money from the tax payers and the kids get worse and worse education. Also a charter schools shouldn't be forced to take every child that's what your beloved public schools do if you wan't your kid to have a good education home school him or get him into a good school.

       Stop giving tenure to teachers and fire them based on their merit. Teachers in low income neighborhoods are shitty teachers they don't have a 10% pass rate because the kids are stupid it's because their family structure and schooling structure has failed them. I agree it is fucked up atm, but more regulation and giving Washington more power is not the way to fix it us as communities need to fix our problems not rely on more government. Less government more communities caring for each  other is the solution.

       For his faithful, you're right. But in your original post and since you claim not to be a true believer. Yet you said
       <strong>

       see appointing billionaires who reject the mission of their departments as not reneging on his promise to drain the swamp.

       You're technically correct - it is the logic he used - but it was illogical logic to begin with given that attacking Goldman Sach's was a major campaign talking point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, Trump saying "I hate X! I love X! X is the most important unimportant part of making America great, so we must destroy it!" is his signature logical approach, but that doesn't mean it should be acknowledged as valid reasoning of any sort.

       Well, using that logic "you must be a Hillary Clinton supporter still upset you lost".
Look, this isn't a game. Stop pretending like there's two teams against eachother and anything anyone has to say is in direct correlation to one of these team's way of thought. Its all an illusion anyways propagated by televised and social media which is only effective if you give in. Just listen objectively and we might actually become an intellegent country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself don't support trump. He's just a person doing his job, same reason I don't support you. But I do support our country and it's people collectively. I can get behind some ideas of his, others are completely new and have yet to be understood. But that doesn't make me a Democrat. Gosh, just labeling ourselves this way is so anti-patriotic and illogical. I haven't met anyone from any part of the political scale that I agree with completely and I feel as if most of us can relate to this idea. If I were to give on a label myself, although my mind is always evolving ideas, I would say I'm a libertarian.

       I don't care who you support and what your party is or what team you're on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I care about is listing Trumps ideas in two buckets: ones you can "get behind" and ones that are "unproven". Where are the ones you can't get behind?
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every direct action taken by his administration so far has resulted in the increase of wealth and power for the elite and nothing positive for the common American.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy to give him props when deserved - eliminating "Y2K preparedness"? Score one for the Trumpster, that was clear Government waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the vast majority of his actual actions - I'm not talking about his tweets or anything said by the media - have only hurt America and strengthened the Elite.

       I didn't read that at all. I read something that was designed to attract pro-trump people, and to get people not rabidly anti-trump interested enough to read all the way through to the last bit to discredit inquiry into Seth Rich.

       I think Seth Rich merits investigation, and is extremely suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think Hannity, Kim Dotcom, or Rod Wheeler are valid sources. I think the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       latest volley of Seth Rich evidence was largely fake news. There were some details that came out from independent investigators that were valuable, but largely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim Dotcom can't just say "I am the source" and leave it there. If he has evidence, lets see it. Anything else is larping. He knows a US jury will never ever ask for his testimony, and even if they do, I think he's more likely to flip as part of a bargain than he is to stay on the right side.

       its great because it was one of those unexpected laughs (and i sound like the damn CryptKeeper when i laugh) and i never laugh. I literally got the nickname Wolfman in the office because i just walk around and look like im stalking pray. So for them to hear me burst out laughing when no one is talking is odd. Especially because its the 1st time in the 8+ years ive been here. BTW, you might have just destroyed the persona i have been developing for damn near a decade.... :/

       it will be tough because most people treat Politics as the new Religion. So we might honestly be asking people of warring "religions" to start getting along

       This was classic Trump though, promise something that means something different to every supporter.

       What
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       did you think it meant when he made that promise?
      </p>
      <p>
       From where I sit it was a PR phrase designed to get people exactly like you on board without having to promise them anything concrete.

       It's a feeling, not a function.

       Was going to say this too. I feel I should emphazise that it isn't specific to Trump but rather is the basic foundation of populist politics; Deliver engaging speech on divisive subjects, promise
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       vague results that ideally have impossible to measure outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is ofcourse
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       guilty of lying about nearly everything, but this particular mode of lying is not just classic Trump.

       Public schools get more funding and preform worse than charter schools or private schools. Also why do you wan't the government teaching your children propaganda and lies for 7 hours a day based on what they want you to learn?

       Stop giving tenure to teachers and fire them based on their merit. Teachers in low income neighborhoods are shitty teachers they don't have a 10% pass rate because the kids are stupid it's because their family structure and schooling structure has failed them. I agree it is fucked up atm, but more regulation and giving Washington more power is not the way to fix it us as communities need to fix our problems not rely on more government. Less government more communities caring for each  other is the solution.
