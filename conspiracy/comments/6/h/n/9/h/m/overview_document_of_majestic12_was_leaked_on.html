<p>Article about the document leak here: <a href="http://exopolitics.org/majestic-document-reveals-us-diplomatic-relations-with-extraterrestrials/">http://exopolitics.org/majestic-document-reveals-us-diplomatic-relations-with-extraterrestrials/</a></p>

<p>There are so many bombshells in this document I haven&#39;t even gotten to them all yet. To give a brief summary, we have the famous Roswell crash happening in 1947, and in the subsequent years the US military was able to recover 7 craft with 21 dead ET bodys. It goes on to detail the types of lifeforms known to the government:
Human-like, &quot;greys&quot; (ie drones controlled psychically by their creators), non-human like (reptilian, for instance), and &quot;extradimensional&quot; (they can travel with their mind and channel their energy to create whatever form they wish to appear as). </p>

<p>An interesting thing that I didn&#39;t know: Steven Greer talked about how the USG shot down the Roswell craft using directed energy weapon that tesla pioneered. From this document it seems that what actually happened is in 1899 Tesla did a huge experiment where he actually used the Earth&#39;s magnetic field to generate signals into space to talk to &quot;whoever was out there&quot;. This apparently wreaked havoc elsewhere, which prompted some ET&#39;s to respond via binary signal:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The extraterrestrial intelligence (EI’s) attempted to respond to his transmissions in a form of binary code that they routinely use for long range communications (evidently these energies act instantly at a distance and are not limited to the speed of light) and ask that he cease sending. Of course, Tesla had no way of understanding the message he received back from space. Fortunately, the anger of local residents at the side-effects of his research forced him to shut down the Colorado Springs experiments in the same year he began them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me highlight this part for you.. &quot;instantly at a distance&quot; &quot;not limited by the speed of light&quot;. They even refer to the 20th century in this document as the &quot;saucer century&quot;. So in the minds of people in the know, the 20th century was the century of the most advanced progress in recorded history, and yet we are still driving combustion engines and flying using jet engines developed 100 years ago... Talk about a conspiracy... Now when people talk about how the 20th century was upside down from every perspective (intelligence infiltration and corruption of science, art, philosophy, etc), well now you know why.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve barely scratched the surface, enjoy the document everyone! Full disclosure is just on the horizon, soon there will be too much evidence to keep denying. </p>

<p>EDIT: included the original (non-rotated) document </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think someone took a bunch of UFO related conspiracy theories and cooked up an old looking document to verify them all... I read a lot of declassified files and this one is pretty well presented, but doesn&#39;t really fit the DIA&#39;s writing styles at all. This document seems to be a lot of narrative driven story telling instead of cross referencing... DIA info is always presented in cold hard facts... this reads more like a fanfic... it looks nice, but is tonally off key for the originating agency.</p>

This particular ETI straight up sounds like a hippy in a van that just drifts around space to check out whatever amuses it.</p>

<p>End of the day its either completely and my years of reaching the world view that I currently have is in the right direction or its a fake made by someone who is well researched into many times.

    <div class="md"><p>Well the new age types seem to have largely come about due to the information channelled from these beings. Check out the brown notebook channelings in the 1950s.  The message is always the same; self-empowerment through internal practice and practising good thoughts and deeds in society. This allows us to &quot;level up&quot; spiritually and eventually we can become an intergalactic society when we&#39;ve matured to not destroy or claim any rock that we come across as ours. </p>

<p>Alternatively its all part of a giant psyop that people have been LARPing for or shilling for for decades... all to make us believe aliens have landed instead of realizing we have super advanced tech that has been hidden? What other possible explanation for so much fakery? People just bored and invent documents and mind control people into thinking they&#39;ve been abducted / contact aliens? </p>

<p>Maybe the good aliens are like space hippies, and the bad ones we havent really survived to tell the tale of the encounter... or they just aren&#39;t allowed to come to our &quot;neck of the woods&quot;. There have been several accounts of a quarantine set up to keep aliens from just showing up and blasting us out of the sky. </p>

<p>Imo the reason you keep seeing the same message is because it is an eternal message that unites all life regardless of where in the universe it evolved. We all share a common origin, and ultimately its alot easier to look out for yourself and your fellow man, because helping another is also helping yourself; so the effort has a doubling effect compared to doing something solely for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Former intel here I had to go google other released documents but yes even in 1947 classification was on the top and bottom of documents, that is mandatory but this &quot;ultra top secret&quot; document is allowed to have less classification markings than a confidential document?</p>

<p>Also ultra top secret doesn&#39;t exist, this sounds like something we&#39;d see in a comic book but we have a compartmentalizes system, they don&#39;t go over top secret they just just special caveats to restrict he access.....</p>

<p>The 1948 crash in Aztec, New Mexico was investigated by several top scientists, notably John Von Neumann, who&#39;s work understanding the computer on the craft lead to the &quot;binary computing language now used in all modern computers&quot;. Also of not e is Marle Tuve who develped the principles of laser light physics as a result of this study of the craft and Horace van Valkenberg who held over 30 patents in materials science and developed x-ray crystallography, crystal holography, and electron microscopic metal analysis due to his study of the craft.</p>

<p>hmm..not sure Von Neumann invented this..the creation of a binary arithmetic system (and then the subsequent encoding of symbols using numbers, and then symbolic expressions, etc) is almost a trivial act.  it&#39;s something that can be done by first principles.  i reckon it&#39;s been done well before Von Neumann, given that the principles in play are used in the abacus and smells of the encoding of language date back to ancient hebrew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THe problem with quantum entanglement for communication is you have to send a signal to say which observable you measured, otherwise you don&#39;t get any information from it. So it is still limited by light speed. I think what they are referring to is actually a form of energy (Greer calls it &quot;scalar&quot; energy) transmission that is unknown to science. I am having trouble finding info on it atm but this website talks about it: (I havent read through it much though so use discernment as always) <a href="http://members.iimetro.com.au/%7Ehubbca/scalar.htm">http://members.iimetro.com.au/~hubbca/scalar.htm</a></p>

<p>Majestic 12 In 1988, two FBI offices received similar versions of a memo titled “Operation Majestic-12…” claiming to be highly classified government document. The memo appeared to be a briefing for newly-elected President Eisenhower on a secret committee created to exploit a recovery of an extra-terrestrial aircraft and cover-up this work from public examination. An Air Force investigation determined the document to be a fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious if this is related to the big announcement that Tom Delonge kept mentioning. He originally promised in February of this year that something very big was coming in the next 60 days or so. However, he later clarified that the release had been pushed back somewhat due to the complexity of the situation, and that it would happen sometime this summer.</p>

<p>He then tweeted out on June 13th (the day before this MJ12 release), that &quot;it&#39;s coming.&quot; But he hasn&#39;t made any mention of this document since it&#39;s release, so maybe I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>What I really want to know is whether this is a legitimate leak or a controlled leak. If it&#39;s controlled, then is this part of a partial disclosure with a hidden agenda? I really hope this sub will get some discussion going on this news, because it&#39;s very important.</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#39;m also curious if this has anything to do with the attacks on this sub. If these people really are moving forward with some form of disclosure, then I&#39;m sure they anticipate many average people will go to conspiracy forums to learn more. Perhaps that explains the new &quot;interest&quot; in this sub and the efforts to control the narrative. They&#39;re just preparing for the inevitable influx of new users</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They definitely want this sub to be filled to the brim with BS (ie typical left vs right political hogwash). We are quickly awakening to our true history and the suppressed technologies; the frenzy at which the media is reporting on nonsensical matters is a testament to their desperation. Meanwhile you are seeing soft disclosures all over the place, with tabloids in the UK talking about how the solar system is teeming with bacteria for instance. </p>

<p>I think you are correct about Delonge&#39;s tweet, this must be the document. And if not, hey, even more documents to read soon!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, dont feel bad. i questioned myself a couple of times as well. i think you were perhaps thinking of 115 millennia? </p>

<p>i love this post because it really is up to the reader to decide for themselves whether they believe it to be valid, and if so, how valid (e.g., some perts seem entirely plausible, others perhaps not as much). these types of things are fascinating if even just from the perspective of US intelligence methods and capabilities at the time this happened and at the time this was written. The alien dude does sound like a big old hippee, but we&#39;ve also been conditioned to react in a certain way to concepts that go against the narrative. Similarly, disinfo can be used in all kinds of ways - so, there are people who will think this is 100% real as is; others will think it&#39;s all bunk, and still others will contemplate the possibility that something like this might have nuggets of truth and nuggets of disinfo intended to create plausible deniability on he part of the govt. It could be a hoax document in and of itself, but it could also be a &quot;fake&quot; document with factual content, perhaps written by someone who wanted the info to get out before they died or whatever, but needed to create enough of a cover that it couldn&#39;t be connected back to the person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the well thought out reply. There really is so much to consider when pouring over something of this nature. So often things are peppered with disinfo like you mention. Ever seen the movie Mirage Men? </p>

<p>And further, there&#39;s the whole angle of peppering with tiny truths in a largely misdirected narrative with respect to soft disclosure. Soft disclosure manipulated to gain advantage of the disclosees of course.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Isle of Pines, New Caledonia is spangled with about 400 large tumuli or mounds, ranging from 30 to 165 feet in diameter. Their heights are 2 to about 15 feet. All of the material making up the mounds seems to come from the immediate surroundings: coral debris, earth, and grains of iron oxide. The larger tumuli enclose a block of tuff, about 5 feet high and 6 feet in diameter, comprised of tumuli material held together by a calcareous cement or mortar. Some who have investigated these mounds believe that the presence of cement, presumably man-made, is proof-positive that the tumuli are the product of human activity. Other archeologists doubt this because the early settlers of New Caledonia did not use cement. Besides, there seem to be no other signs of human involvement. This has led to the hypothesis that the mounds were built by huge, now-extinct, flightless birds for the purpose of incubating their eggs. Some birds do indeed incubate their eggs in mounds today; and some 5,000 years ago New Caledonia did boast a giant bird (Sylviornia neocale doniae), which was 5-6 feet tall. The authors of the present paper feel that the giant bird hypothesis is just as reasonable as the theory that these mounds were built by ancient humans who knew how to make cement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Mourer-Chauvire, Cecile, and Poplin, Francois; &quot;Le Mystere des Tumulus de Nouvelle-Caledonie,&quot; La Recherche, 16: 76, September 1985. Cr. C. Mauge.)</p>

<p>Comment. We find in our Handbook Ancient Man an article by A. Rothovius entitled: &quot;The Mysterious Cement Cylinders of New Caledonia.&quot; The 1967 article covers much the same ground as that in La Recherche, but sans the giant bird theory. Rothovius states that the cylinders inside the tumuli:</p>

<p>&quot;...are of a very hard, homogeneous lime-mortar, containing bits of shells which yield radiocarbon dates between 5,120 and 10,950 B.C. -- even the lowest date being some 3,000 years earlier than man is believed to have reached the southwest Pacific from the area of Indonesia.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to say bullshit. 
EBE&#39;s dialog is not very alien.
EBE speaks like they written by story teller.</p>

<p>All of the questions and answers are answered perfectly like it&#39;s a script:
Some of the points the alien EBE brings up:
- they like trees, 
- miss the indians that white people killed,
- salem witches, killing cats = bubonic plague
- white people killed the jews (western civilisation)
- they tried to contact us back
- these aliens built shit (pyramids) on our planet with humans help
- don&#39;t lets elites rule you, work on consensus style living
- 1899 tesla contacted them (unintentionally) with earths magnetic field
- telsa was a fluke, until we understand lasers we won&#39;t duplicate his work
- our culture sucks so we are isolated</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, we are a wildlife preserve for a bunch of aliens.  Interesting about the binary language that occurs.  My guess is that it involves quantum mechanic&#39;s unsolved thing where a photon will show a particle if observed and a wave if not observed. The binary is likely like morse code where the wave that Tesla did but in certain waves.  My guess though is that they could turn it into something like a webpage if they did it right.  Maybe they already have and it is reddit......</p>

<p>Though there is not too much validity to this though.  This is what I look for when I look at this.  To me Earth&#39;s likely scenario would be some kind of wildlife reserve.  Culturally they would be right in their current alliance with us.  It is an interesting read nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly possible. It will be interesting to see what Dr. Salla and co find in their quest to verify this document. </p>

<p>One thing I will say is that if I were creating documents for &quot;off the books&quot; type stuff (ie unacknowledged specical access projects) I would not use the typical format for even the highest security clearances. That way if it ever did fall into the wrong hands it could easily be passed of as a fake. However, thats not an adequate reason to believe that its real of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I though</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this document probably is a hoax the more I read about it. However, I do think there was a group assigned to investigate the Roswell incident, or maybe the Roswell incident is a nothingburger designed to distract from the real incident. Either way I suspect whoever leaked this was doing it to raise awareness that some incident like this occurred in the past. Maybe not the exact details as are in this document but this gives the gist of it. </p>

<p>Its just speculation, though. I haven&#39;t read any convincing arguments either way for this being real or fake. The best people have given for it being fake is that the markings don&#39;t look like any known classified document thats been released, but that argument doesn&#39;t convince me because its likely if the info is sensitive enough and its detailing an &quot;unacknowledged&quot; project, there would be an incentive to not use the formal markings. On the other hand, the best I&#39;ve seen for it being real is the corroboration of the Pine island anomaly that is discussed by the EBE in the interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the well thought out reply. There really is so much to consider when pouring over something of this nature. So often things are peppered with disinfo like you mention. Ever seen the movie Mirage Men? </p>

<p>And further, there&#39;s the whole angle of peppering with tiny truths in a largely misdirected narrative with respect to soft disclosure. Soft disclosure manipulated to gain advantage of the disclosees of course.</p>
