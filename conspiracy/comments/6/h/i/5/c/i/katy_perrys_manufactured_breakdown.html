    <div class="md"><p>Nah, she is a fragmented person. Who knows how many alters she really has but she won&#39;t ever really know who she is now. It&#39;s part and parcel of being in her position. She has to perform and do what she is told and in order to have her always in that mindset they have to keep her there. Doctors , or mind splitters are a tool of the business. Doctors and illuminati are working together to produce things for people&#39;s attention and when their attention is on their production they can program the minds of the people watching. Or they try to.  Try to get people to like whatever the famous person is into. Which is what:</p>

<p>-Being watched- surveillance</p>

<p>-Not knowing their identity, or the need for psychiatric help</p>

<p>-normalizing their symbolism. Basically most their symbols are blasphemous. So they are normalizing the blasphemy of creation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the reason why they mentally destroy and manipulate famous people is very simple, control. Katy perry is a product, like Pepsi, celebs who try to use their brand for their own means are often thwarted or killed.</p>

<p>perfect example; Dave chappelle, look at his &#39;fall and rise&#39; as the rise is now happening, and why? cause he said fuck it and sold himself to the same group that is playing katy like a fiddle.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Dave chappelle did something be back in the scene. I didn&#39;t see him go down on an exec in the business but it happens to a lot of them. They are first degraded and blackmailed. Katy Perry was a willing sacrifice of her real self for this fake bullshit she is now. It&#39;s more like going to a freak show at a circus when you watch pop music.</p>

<p>I told someone else this but they also encoded rh blood in her name</p>

<li><p>also she is a cat, or more ultra kitten:  KATy perry</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>In chappelle&#39;s case, he was offered a ton of money to do a few stand-ups, he admitted as much. Netflix knew they would get tons of viewers, they paid him accordingly. He hasn&#39;t worked much. I don&#39;t see any conspiracy in this case. He makes a living doing comedy, he isn&#39;t pushing agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a sense. </p>

<p>The world is a duality. That is a fact. You cannoot just have good. That&#39;s why this illusion of the future where we topple tptb and a true revolution. Yes that will be awesome and I can&#39;t wait. But there will still be bad shit that will happen. It&#39;s a duality. There won&#39;t be good only and happily ever after.</p>

<p>Even if there was an earthquake, let&#39;s say it wiped out a whole country. That countries government will be altered by a bad thing but it would be good in a way because they would be released of its hold.</p>

<p>This would be taking to an more ultra subject being shocked out of an alter and back to their real self.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She has collapsed on stage during this song before...
As much fun as MKUltra night sound.
I have a crazy theory about why she always has this episode during her song &quot;I kissed a girl and I liked it.&quot; </p>

<p>I believe she does it in order to distract any children in the audience from the message of the song and move them to a mindset of wondering wtf just happened to her.</p>

<p>That way they aren&#39;t negatively influenced and the parents don&#39;t have to be mad about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>uhhh.. no. </p>

<p>sorry but no. </p>

<p>the whole purpose of that song is to degrade gender differences and promote sexual fluidity. If you go lyric by lyric the whole song is fucked, &#39;kissed a girl and I liked it, hope my boyfriend don&#39;t mind it&#39; </p>

<p>oh that you&#39;re going around kissing people? nah I guess it&#39;s cool cause you only kissed another woman /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so true. I really think and it&#39;s probably not a conspiracy, but I think they craft songs so that before or after the &#39;catch&#39; lyrics, the slip in questionable shit. </p>

<p>like sooo many songs from the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s are straight up creepy when you strip the music away and just read the lyrics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes... I have seen a couple videos of her collapsing during that song (and some guy rushes out to help her up.) 
I just can&#39;t make sense of it and I know I&#39;m reaching.
Maybe she&#39;s just sick of that song because it&#39;s her first big hit and she feels like her brain is fried every time she sings it.</p>
