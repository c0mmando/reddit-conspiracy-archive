        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We have video footage of a building collapsing in freefall without resistance and we&#39;re told by the government that it collapsed in freefall without resistance, due to fire. We have side by side comparisons with controlled demolitions (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Rm6ZFROmc</a>) yet possibly the majority of human beings still believe the official story (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2008/11/nist-releases-final-wtc-7-investigation-report">https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2008/11/nist-releases-final-wtc-7-investigation-report</a>) that was on the news and in all the papers and told to us by our elected and trusted leaders.  Unlike the twin towers, Tower Seven was not hit by a plane. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, based near Washington DC, concluded in its long-awaited report in 2008 that ordinary fires caused the building to collapse. That would make it the first and only steel skyscraper in the world to collapse because of fire (<a href="http://www.serendipity.li/wot/other_fires/other_fires.htm">http://www.serendipity.li/wot/other_fires/other_fires.htm</a>). Larry Silverstein owns all WTC buildings. Larry Silverstein told us that he designed a new WTC 7 in April 2000 (<a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/03/15/bombshell-larry/">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/03/15/bombshell-larry/</a>). The same man, admits he told firefighters to pull the building due to terrible loss of life, long after the people who could be evacuted were (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuFJbombRDk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuFJbombRDk</a>). The insurance policies for WTC1, WTC2, WTC7 and WTC5 had a collective face amount of $3.55 billion. Silverstein sought to collect double the face amount (~$7.1 billion) on the basis that the two separate airplane strikes into two separate buildings constituted two occurrences within the meaning of the policies. Silverstein has said in interviews that he usually spent his mornings in breakfast meetings at Windows on the World on top of the World Trade Center North Tower, and with new tenants in the building. However, the morning of September 11, 2001, his wife insisted that he attend a medical appointment. Due to the appointment, he escaped almost certain death. All of the buildings at the World Trade Center, including buildings 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were destroyed or damaged beyond repair on September 11, 2001. After a protracted dispute with insurers over the amount of coverage available for rebuilding World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, 4 and 5, a series of court decisions determined that a maximum of $4.55 billion was payable and settlements were reached with the insurers in 2007.</p>

<p>I think WTC 7 is important, it is a massive mistake made by the people responsible and we need to push to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>that doesnt prove anything. when a building is brought down with explosives, the core support of the building is taken out, then if falls. if the core support of building 7 gave way due to fire, or explosives, its going to fall the same rate no matter how its core support was destroyed. </p>

<p>steel many buildings have had floors collapse due to fire. building 7 had much of its structure strength dependent on its outside wall. when the towers fell, its outer support was damaged.</p>

<p>building 7 and the two wtc centers were designed differently than your common steel building. they had big pen floors, this design was its flaw.</p>

<p>show me a building designed like those 3 towers that has caught out fire and received damage from its core support from debris or from a commercial airline traveling plus 500mph and then we can talk. </p>

<p>until then, you are comparing apples to oranges. </p>

<p>a side by side comparison of two buildings with structures that have completely differnt designs falling down doesnt tell you anything. </p>

<p>Newton&#39;s second law of motion can be formally stated as follows: The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.</p>

<p>it doesnt matter if the building was taken out with explosives it collapsed due to fire, if the structure support gives way, that building is going to fall at the rate the laws of physics allows. depending on the mass of the building at the net force( gravity and resistance) determines how fast it will fall. </p>

<p>it you have a building standing up, how you blow out the first floor with explosives, its going to fall down the same speed as it the first floor gave way due to fire, or it gave way due to pulling it with cables, or it gave way because a truck drove it into. you cant ignore the laws of physics on this one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Top physicists are saying it was a controlled demolition. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>physicists are not demolition experts, not are they structural engineer experts. some physicists are saying it was a controlled demolition.. thats some peoples opinon. there are other engineers, demolition experts, architects who agree with that report. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#39;t it fall left or right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you actually do your research, you will find plenty of videos that show the center of building 7 giving away first. like i said, building 7 had a inner and outer support structure. if you watch those videos all over youtube, you can see the penthouse on the roof falling before the rest of the building. the center support structure gave way the pulled the rest of building ontop of it.</p>

<p>buildings tend to fall straight down unless they have something pushing it over or the structure gave way in a certain way that would cause it to fall down at an angle. </p>

<p>buildings have partially collapsed due to fire. let me rind you, this building had its out core support damaged by the debris from the twin towers. you keep ignoring this. </p>

<p>you should try watching all the videos of building 7. the pent house ontop falls down first because the center collapses in it self then pulls the rest. </p>

<p>you are very ignorant of what actually happened and you are just repeating stuff you heard someone else say. </p>

<p>you have not done real research into this. you need to educate yourself on what actually happened to building 7 because you have no idea what oyu are talking about. </p>

<p>9/11 was a inside job, but that doesnt mean explosives were used.</p>

<p>where is your evidence that is a standard term to bring down a building? do you have old books stating this? any videos of demolition experts saying this? or are you just saying that was a term used to bring down a building because you heard someone else saying just that?   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your repeating your information for the NIST report, I&#39;m using my own eyes and brain to try and piece this together. WTC 7 had already been completely evacuated, with no loss of life, prior to him saying pull it. Pull it refers to when the demolition crews actually pull down the building. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJI6YvK_TK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJI6YvK_TK0</a>. Evacuations were already taking place, without him having to give the go ahead. There is clearly 2.25 seconds of freefall, I can see it with my own eyes. Can you show me evidence of these &#39;thousands&#39; of architects and engineers who agree with the official story? Buildings may have partially collapsed due to fire, but to become the first building in history to be brought completely into its own footprint with the primary cause being fire and all steel structural supports failing at the same time thus allowing 2.25 seconds of freefall, that you can cleary see with your own eyes. If your saying buildings have partially collapsed due to fire and are comparing that to WTC 7 your comparing apples with oranges.</p>
