    <div class="md"><p>I think they gave him the &#39;Nobel Peace prize&#39; to try and influences everyones opinion of the man. They made him look like one of the most peaceful presidents in history all the while behind closed doors he was gearing up for massive attacks on numerous countries, but the population, over the coming years, ignored it all because of how he was portrayed in the media. Read the third article on my post, the Nobel secretary said they &#39;didn&#39;t achieve what they hoped&#39; by giving him the prize, some people still saw through the rose tint they had draped all over Obama. </p>

<p>I strongly remember him running on a promise of winding out of the middle east. <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/subjects/iraq/">And even found some documentation of that in regards to Iraq</a>. I cannot find any campaign promises saying he would &quot;re-expand&quot; any wars. Would be odd since liberals claimed to be anti-war in &#39;08 and blasted Bush for it. Weird how things changed in that regard... </p>

<p>Based on your post history, you seem to be spreading misinformation intentionally. Perhaps trying to re-write history. Calling you out until you can prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Even if we assume all of this is true, it isn&#39;t at all relevant to what I said before. All I stated was that he won the Prize early in his presidency, before he did any of this stuff you&#39;ve listed. I didn&#39;t make a statement about what he did during his presidency. You saying he won the Prize despite all of the stuff you listed is incorrect because he won the Prize before he did any of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A gameplan doesn&#39;t mean knowing how a war is going to progress... Even powerful people can&#39;t simply orchestrate global events with enough precision to follow an eight year military plan involving countries and groups that weren&#39;t involved or didn&#39;t exist at the beginning of the plan. You REALLY want to believe in conspiracies if you think that he was planning at the beginning of the 8 years for Iraq to look anything like it did at the end. And you have to totally ignore the fact that it looks like Obama failed fairly pretty spectacularly there. But that was probably just for appearances and all part of the conspiracy, huh?</p>

<p>Just so not true. Everyone that assumes the presidency has been equally good or bad? Jackson was equal to Carter? Nixon was equal to Roosevelt? It&#39;s one thing to recognize that both sides are corrupt but there is no question that there are degrees of corruption, and that some presidents are highly preferable over others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also one thing to recognize that being the President does not grant ultimate power... sure, Nixon, Carter, Reagan and Obama are not comparable personality-wise or how they&#39;re portrayed. My point is that they are not the only ones being portrayed and the way our government has been for the past 50+ years is absolutely corrupt and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to put that on one specific person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wouldn&#39;t put all the blame on one person for sure but the President does in reality have a lot of power. He really can unilaterally launch nukes, for instance. And various presidents have used that power in pretty sweeping ways - In committing troops, for instance. Or in executive orders. These things really are ultimately executed by one man, with help obviously, but he is the switch on which these decisions turn. And some presidents have made clearly bad, selfish, devious decisions, and some have made more virtuous ones. That&#39;s not all the system they&#39;re in, that really is them. We really did go into Iraq and Vietnam on the orders of one man.</p>

<p>Have you wondered why no bankers got charged for the market crash in &#39;07-08?</p>

<p>Because there was no actual criminality in what they did. You have to break a law to be charged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He chose his cabinet based off of a list given to him by Citi Bank of their approved candidates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blatant misinformation. Mike Froman was Deputy National Security advisor under Clinton, and worked for the Treasury department for a time, before moving to Citigroup during Bush&#39;s administration. He was friends with Obama since Harvard, and was even a foreign policy advisor during his 2004 Senate run. <strong>When Obama won in 2008, Froman left the private sector to join government again, and was a member of Obama&#39;s transition team</strong>. The lists he passed along were potential diversity hires.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same types of bankers that crashed the market picked his cabinet..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Froman is a lawyer, not a banker. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t listen to zerohedge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AND that was the purpose.  &quot;The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is a program of the United States government to purchase toxic assets and equity from financial institutions to strengthen its financial sector that was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008. It was a component of the government&#39;s measures in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis.&quot;</p>

<p>so you still saw bankers continuing to do crimes even AFTER the biggest issues were thought to be addressed.  But then again Iceland may not count, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, quit moving the goalposts.  I discussed TARP because that was the resolution imposed by Bush and followed by Obama to resolve the issues with the banking frauds.  Bankers got arrested for that.</p>

<p>And ICELAND actually put bankers in jail for their 2008 fraud.  Did you not read that article.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they gave the award to the American people, then why is Barack Obama credited with it?    </p>

<p><strong>The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Barack Obama for his &quot;extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples&quot;. The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama&#39;s promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a &quot;new climate&quot; in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world.</strong>   </p>

<p>The committee award it to him in the hope it would strengthen him. The Nobel secretary Geir Lundestad told the AP news agency that the committee hoped the award would strengthen Mr Obama.    </p>

<p>They gave it to him in the hope it would lead to people blindly loving him and believing every word he says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand this, my comment was in reference to government, but since we&#39;re here... </p>

<p>Media, you can change the channel, the narrative that fox pushes is the same concept just a different angle, their not fair and biased. No media source is. All media is corrupt and has an agenda, no media source is better than the other. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the liberal influence in universities, I took a different path in life. I&#39;d like to hear more. </p>

<p>If people are believing and falling for the BS that&#39;s happening on social sites and the agenda they push, then those people are not thinking outside their own world and refuse to accept a different perspective. That works for both sides, the majority of my family is conservative and supports Trump, the majority of things I see them share are just blatantly false. Same goes for both sides, each side is using the same tactics because it works. </p>

<p>How they all win and we continue to lose, is they don&#39;t want any side to prevail, keep the status quo. Obama didn&#39;t just decide &quot;hey Americas Gays have rights too&quot;, Americans petitioned and fought for that right for many many years. Obama was just president during the largest outcry and knew it was what the people wanted so he &quot;allowed&quot; it. Obama isn&#39;t a hero, he just saw that the majority of Americans wanted this right, so he passed it. 
If people weren&#39;t fighting for it, there would t be the need to change it. </p>

<p>They want us to continue fighting each other, as long as we do that, all they have to do is sit back and enjoy life while we make fools of ourselves. </p>

<p>I want free healthcare
I want free tuition to colleges
I want everyone to be able to access the same opportunities and I don&#39;t want wealth, race or religion to dictate how well I do and how hard I have to work to &quot;make ends meet&quot;. 
NO American or human, should have to work 2 jobs to feed their kids, no human should have 5 kids if they can&#39;t afford them, I grew up in very conservative areas as well as liberal ones, and know that this is all sides of the spectrum. No party is excluded. </p>

<p>I want a kid in the ghetto or rural area to have the same opportunity as the kid from a rich family in a wealthy city. </p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of seeing us eat each other alive while dough bags tell us we&#39;re different and we don&#39;t want to the same things in life. </p>

<p>Have your guns 
Have sex with and marry whoever (consenting)
Believe whatever religion you want
Change your gender 
Pay your taxes </p>

<p>As long as you support your fellow American and do no harm, why should I care how someone loves their life. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I live in the mountains and do get to discuss this that often. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Media, you can change the channel, the narrative that fox pushes is the same concept just a different angle, their not fair and biased. No media source is. All media is corrupt and has an agenda, no media source is better than the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fox News is a bad example as it is very similar to the other sources of news. Many on the Republicans are RINOS (Republican&#39;s in name only). They are as much as part of the problem as the Democrats and the rest of the MSM. The only true conservative or Republican sources of news are all alt news sources. I agree, all media has an agenda though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know enough about the liberal influence in universities, I took a different path in life. I&#39;d like to hear more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s fucking atrocious. Nearly all your professors are communists. Universities are indoctrination centers now, not institutions of learning or debate. The administrations are all leftists and often deny conservative speakers or groups places/spaces to speak. The University&#39;s now serve as the experimentation chambers for all the crazy social agenda&#39;s of the left. If you are male and get accused of sexual harassment on campus, kiss your ass goodbye because it&#39;s very unlikely you will get a fair hearing or be allowed to stay, regardless of guilt. I know of more than one young man that was falsely accused, proved their innocence in courts and were still kicked out of school simply because a female made a complaint. It&#39;s a really sad state of affairs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama was just president during the largest outcry and knew it was what the people wanted so he &quot;allowed&quot; it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FYI, Obama didn&#39;t have anything to do with it. The Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage was a right. If I&#39;m not mistaken, Obama didn&#39;t even change his mind about the issue until 2011, just in time for the 2012 election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They want us to continue fighting each other, as long as we do that, all they have to do is sit back and enjoy life while we make fools of ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is some truth in there, but it&#39;s also true that there is a real fight going on within society about what should and should not be allowed. As an example, I don&#39;t care anything about the gay issue. Be whatever sexuality you want to be and have sex (or don&#39;t) with whomever you like (as long as they consent). However, many of the same people that pushed for gay rights are now pushing for so called trans rights that will put grown men in bathrooms with little girls. It&#39;s fucking absurd and disgusting and that shit has to be fought. We have more sex offenders in this country than we do trans people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want free healthcare I want free tuition to colleges </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing in this world that is free. When you say you want something for free, all you are really saying is that someone else should pay for it. No one should be forced to pay for anyone else. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want everyone to be able to access the same opportunities and I don&#39;t want wealth, race or religion to dictate how well I do and how hard I have to work to &quot;make ends meet&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is unrealistic and ignores all of human history. What you are asking is for humans to be something else besides humans. I bust my ass everyday to make sure my kid has everything they could ever want. Why should a kid with parents that didn&#39;t do that benefit from all the other parents that do? If the parents are taking care of their children and they lack opportunity, that is sad for the child. However, demanding that others pay the way for a child they never had is not viable either. What are you asking for simply isn&#39;t possible in a human system. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>NO American or human, should have to work 2 jobs to feed their kids, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absurd. Not all work is equal and people do not value everything the same way. Not all people are created equal in their capabilities. Those with better capabilities will be paid more. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>no human should have 5 kids if they can&#39;t afford them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then none of us would be here. Through history, people have more kids the less able they are to afford them, precisely because they need to generate more money and the only way to do that is to add to the family labor pool. Highly developed nations have less children for exactly this reason, the labor just isn&#39;t needed by the family. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want a kid in the ghetto or rural area to have the same opportunity as the kid from a rich family in a wealthy city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See above. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have your guns Have sex with and marry whoever (consenting) Believe whatever religion you want Change your gender Pay your taxes
As long as you support your fellow American and do no harm, why should I care how someone loves their life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. I&#39;d only add that people should not grub about after other people&#39;s money either. </p>

<p>Democratic and Republican congressmen have gone on the record to say there is no evidence of any collusion. So tell me, given the fact they have a security clearance to add, what&#39;re they missing that you and the top minds of Reddit seem to have all figured out?

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not interested in trading links so that you can diatribe about how this is just reddit&#39;s top minds thinking and not anything that counts as evidence. My point that Trumpers are brainwashed stands. You&#39;ve done nothing but repeat what the Trump media has pushed and you&#39;ve repeatedly denied that there&#39;s even a shred of truth to what the media of the entire rest of the world is reporting. That demonstrates how insulated your information source is. You take a small instance of congressmen with security clearances saying they don&#39;t have evidence and ignore all the intel services saying there&#39;s reason to pursue and investigation, and all the congressmen that do want to pursue an investigation, and all the, again, international pulitzer prize winning journalists that continue to report circumstantial evidence. But because there&#39;s no particular email that&#39;s been produced already, it must all just be a hoax perpetrated to persecute Trump and everyone that wants to pursue an investigation is brainwashed! </p>

<p>How you don&#39;t see that this is heavily motivated (biased) thinking, I&#39;m not sure. The main function of saying &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot; isn&#39;t actually to describe the real world--we KNOW there&#39;s evidence, Trump called for the Russians to hack more of Hillary&#39;s emails on international television. That alone, without all the other copious amount of shit (his cabinet member illegally communicating with them, firing the person leading the investigation), should make any American say, &quot;Huh, why does this person want a foreign power to meddle in our election?&quot; </p>

<p>You yelling &quot;no evidence&quot; isn&#39;t a description of the state of the case, it&#39;s an attempt to absolve Trump of any wrongdoing. We have assloads of reasons that have been amassing for the last year to at the very least question if this man is truly putting country first, and that alone should warrant an investigation from anyone that is promoting country over party. But that&#39;s why Trumper&#39;s are brainwashed... When you say there&#39;s no evidence, what you&#39;re saying is, I don&#39;t want Trump to be guilty. When you speak, when you argue political issues, you&#39;re not doing it from the perspective of someone looking at the evidence and drawing conclusions from it, you&#39;re looking at what Trump says is true, and then picking your evidence from that.</p>

<p>And obviously majority opinion is not any kind of standard, but just consider why literally the whole world except Trump supporters and people loyal to Russia agree more or less with what I&#39;m saying and think that you guys are dead wrong. That maybe should give you pause, that the uk and germany and france and canada and china and australia and india and sweden and costa rica and brazil and japan and south korea and etc and etc and etc agree that you guys and your breitbart echo chamber are no longer speaking about the real world.</p>

<p>How in the fucking world do you think Congressmen, more specifically people in intelligence committees saying there is no evidence of collusion is a small instance? You don&#39;t think that&#39;s bias thinking? That&#39;s huge. You and your political beliefs don&#39;t get to decide if Trump&#39;s guilty or not. We have a governmental process and people that have insider information with security clearances to deal with sensitive information. Those same people say no evidence has been found so I&#39;m going to take their word over it than the NYT stating &quot;person X&quot; from 10 years ago contacted a Russian official. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not repeating the Trump talking point, I&#39;m &quot;repeating&quot; the facts. The fact is that there was no collusion because absolutely no evidence has appeared forth. </p>

<p>An email, a phone call, a tape recorder, literally anything. This has been investigated for months, and so far it&#39;s been nothing but anomalies that you&#39;ve tried to pin as evidence.

<p>And obviously majority opinion is not any kind of standard, but just consider why literally the whole world except Trump supporters and people loyal to Russia agree more or less with what I&#39;m saying and think that you guys are dead wrong. That maybe should give you pause, that the uk and germany and france and canada and china and australia and india and sweden and costa rica and brazil and japan and south korea and etc and etc and etc agree that you guys and your breitbart echo chamber are no longer speaking about the real world.</p>

<p>Ironic you talk about brietbart when you have buzzfeed and their famous dossier which I just so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5nv73m/former_mi6_agent_christopher_steeles_frustration/dcenmju/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">happen</a> to call bullshit the moment I heard of it. Would ya look at that. Many months later I&#39;m still right. No evidence shows that dossier was verified. Small tidbits of the 30 page document were verified while the flashy headlines it produced were completely fabricated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the Russia collusion story will be right up there with the dossier soon because the track record of bull stories making the top page of Reddit while you naive arm chair investigators eat all the shit up tends to fairly bad.</p>

<p>I was going to say this earlier but I didn&#39;t think it&#39;d be worth it because I thought it was just pointless filler, but no, I don&#39;t at all use Brietbart. The last time I visited their site was probably 5 months ago when another user linked it, but that&#39;s besides the point. You can check my posting history on it. I don&#39;t read it, use it as sources, reference it, or post on threads that link to Brietbart.</p>

<p>So, enough of this nonsense because you&#39;ve referred to it now multiple times. I use Buzzfeed as one example because I know for a fact you were salivating when the dossier story broke, and therefore you classified buzzfeed as a credible source. I called bullshit on the story the moment it dropped and I was proven right. You, on the other hand, were proven wrong. So it&#39;s not like your track record is very good on calling bullshit stories.</p>

<p>I use the entire media to stay informed. What I don&#39;t do is play games and cherry pick what to believe, find out something might be wrong, then just forget about it like it&#39;s nothing. That&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re doing, though. You just forget the countless stories that turn out to be wrong because the MSM will just harp onto another story like its nothing. It starts from rape allegations, goes to hookers, and now we&#39;re at Trump colluding with Russia. You probably are all fine and dandy with it. But for me, it leaves me skeptical of most things that are plastered in the media. Again, right now we&#39;re at Trump colluding with Russia which initially raised some alarm in me, but after months of hearing no evidence over and over again, it&#39;s not hard to realize that the entire MSM is just milking the story, while certain organizations just use it to push their agenda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, you&#39;re ignoring the congressmen and intel services who do want to pursue an investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think this qualifies something? You think this means his guilty? Those congressmen are literal democrats who <em>of fucking course</em> would want an investigation. They&#39;re playing games of politics. Were you not around for the last decade where this happens all the time? I&#39;m mind blown you even make a point like this because it&#39;s obvious why people would want an investigation that deviate from getting to the bottom of whether or not Trump actually did collude with Russia, but more so involve party politics. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what a &quot;intel services&quot; is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they outnumber the ones you&#39;re talking about. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, really ridiculous point. This isn&#39;t about numbers here. Numbers does not qualify anything. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the reason the investigation is going on is because they think that the evidence that has emerged is more than &quot;anomalies&quot; and a &quot;political witch hunt.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t know this for jackshit. You don&#39;t know why their continuing the investigation at all. What it looks like at this point is a political witch hunt involving party politics because they&#39;ve failed to produce any evidence of collusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not you post on t_d, Trumpers are the only ones that don&#39;t count all this obvious evidence as evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me explain something simple. You have a claim that Trump colluded with Russia. Fine. Trump has denied it, so the burden of proof is on you. If you believe Trump colluded so strongly, where is the evidence that he did? You need evidence to prove your assertion. Not &quot;he said she said person X went to Russia a decade ago something something Michael Flynn&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the same tactic OJ&#39;s lawyers used, they convinced the jury that you had to have absolute proof to convict someone in a murder trial. But that&#39;s not how the world works, or law, or politics. You&#39;re not always going to have a tape and you can&#39;t demand that as the only standard or a lot of murderers and terrorist go free. In most cases you go with the most likely explanation for all that&#39;s happened, and you know what? A lot of people think collusion connects all those dots. But you&#39;re probably right that they&#39;re all anomalies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrelevant filler. I bet you felt so clever trying to compare this to the OJ simpson trial but honestly they&#39;re not at all similar and it&#39;s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as we&#39;re critiqueing each others responses, you really like to show one instance where you can refute something I&#39;ve said and act like it refutes the whole thing.

I name 10 countries, the most powerful in the world other than us, that think you guys are off your rocker...and your respond by slamming buzzfeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, I can really get the vibe where you seem extremely young and naive because you think this is a game we&#39;re having and it&#39;s about &quot;sides&quot; rather than an actual discussion/debate. Multiple organizations that &quot;agree with me&quot;. Yeah I&#39;m sure those new orgs really &quot;agree&quot; with ya. Sure are on your side.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;ve explained above about why this Russia story is total garbage above, and why there is reason to believe there is. </p>

<p><strong>Also, I&#39;m not going to even read what you say next unless you individually quote chunks of text then refute the points individually because it&#39;s consuming way too much time to decipher what part of my response you&#39;re replying to when you don&#39;t do that</strong></p>

<p>So if you&#39;d like to end it here just type out one giant ass paragraph because I won&#39;t read it.</p>

<p>The MSM are open Democrats/Liberals they even say so themselves. There&#39;s one channel on the right and that&#39;s Fox. On top of that all the major newspapers. Then you have social media Twitter, Facebook are openly left so is reddit. In Hollywood you literally have to hide that you&#39;re a conservative if you want to work.</p>

<p>What is wrong with not wanting ILLEGAL Immigrants to enter the country? There&#39;s a reason we have countries you know. The really bad immigrants are Muslim. Statistics show Muslims do not assimilate(look at Europe) and you risk letting terrorists in. This isn&#39;t fearmongering this is the truth based on facts. </p>

<p>Cops are killing black people, Conservatives are evil/Hate gays/racists, Far right is violent, Trump and Russia will kill us all. This is fearmongering because these are lies based on nothing.</p>

<p>The question is can you comprehend the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m claiming that Obama was painted as a Saint by the media, even going as far as getting the &#39;NOBEL PEACE PRIZE&#39;. Obama then knows he can do whatever he wants as president, with little to no backlash for the millions of voters that voted for change. Nothings changed, Obama led us into more wars in the middle east and didn&#39;t stop dropping tens of thousands of bombs on countries. I&#39;ve answered this question so many times, if you look you&#39;ll find my reply. My turn for a question, why do you feel the need to blindly defend Obama, and agressively question me, when it&#39;s Obama who was killing thousands of peoples? The media decides who we like.</p>

<p>Look at he title of your post . &quot;Obama one the novel peace price <strong>despite</strong> being at war...&quot; </p>

<p>No, this is wrong. He won the novel peace prize, <strong>then he was at war</strong>, he did not win it &quot;despite&quot; being at war, he won it before he was at war. </p>

<p>But of course this doesn&#39;t fit your agenda. It sounds alot more nefarious if you make it sound like he won the award after being at war for 8 years, so of course that&#39;s what you say. Truth doesn&#39;t matter to you to partisan hacks like yourself. </p>

<p>But the award was given to him from his

<p>How did the media do this? Can you show me a <em>specific</em> instance where the media excused Obamas actions by saying &quot;oh he&#39;s a nobel peace prize winner, it&#39;s fine&quot;.

<p>No I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong, because there is no alternative. Nobel peace prizes can&#39;t be taken back. That is a fact. Bitching about it wont change the fact. He won an award, then he seemingly failed to live up the thing that award praised him for. What a surprise, he&#39;s just another politician. He also isn&#39;t in power anymore so who the fuck cares.

    <div class="md"><p>No, we are not on the same side. I&#39;m not on anyones side, especially not yours. There are plenty of things to hate Obama for, making up lies about him like you are doing is not necessary and actually hurts any opposition towards government corruption. Don&#39;t lie. Stick to facts, truths, and be specific. </p>

<p>I just read through this thread. I&#39;m hardly the only one to take offense to your obvios misinformation. you are having this same argument with multiple people ATM. why don&#39;t you just admit you were wrong? Why can&#39;t you just admit you are attempting to spread misinformation about Obama? You even edited your post to &#39;clarify&#39; your point after you&#39;ve were called out on all the falcities. That&#39;s not &quot;clarifying&quot;, it&#39;s backtracking</p>

<p>Im arguing with you for a reason. I see posts like this all the time about politicians who deserve to be hated. Posts like these do not help because they are based on a lie, so people see this post and think &quot;oh look, another Trumper hating on Obama for something he did not do&quot; and forget about the <em>real</em> war crimes Obama committed. You, by making this post, are  helping the media paint Obama in the good light because this post is just straight up false, and people recognize that,so they think &quot;oh look, more lies about Obama. He probably wasn&#39;t even that bad&quot;.</p>

<p>I believe this? Why are you bringing up 9/11? Can you quote me where I 9/11 went down the way government said, or is this more of your disinformation and lies? </p>

<p>Because your entire argument is based on  lie that he won the award after he was at war. You invalidated the rest of your points the second you told that lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>340 million is not wealthy in terms of real wealth, I was referring to the comment that &quot;all the wealth in the country is concentrated&quot; this is so false. The royal family is not even the wealthiest family in country, like you said, there is 301 people more welathetier than the Queen. This is not an example of &quot;concentrated welath&quot; like OP was implying. He implied most of the wealth in the UK is controlled by the royal family. Context is important, you know. </p>

<p>That&#39;s funny, your entire post hisotry is you rabidly defending Trump at every chance I get. </p>

<p>Dude, read the fucking conversation. You are taking me words out of context, I didn&#39;t make a reddit post claiming the Queen was wealthy, I was responding to a comment that stated all the wealth the UK is controlled by the royal family. This is ridiculous, and when compared to the wealth within the UK the Queen doesn&#39;t compare, not by a long shot. And it certainly is not concentrated. That&#39;s what I was replying to. So, like I said, most of that Wealth is tied up in property controlled over government, so they have no access to it. </p>

<p>Do you actually think anyone who disagrees with someone else about a public figure is supporting that public figure? I&#39;m not going to agree with someone who says &quot;all the wealth in the UK is concentrated in the royal family&quot;, and me disagreeing with this person does not make me supportive of the queen. </p>

<p>&quot;Black Lives Matter and other groups forced the shutdown early Friday morning of at least two inauguration security checkpoints, including the one where Sollars said she was attacked — as demonstrators followed through on threats to disrupt President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremonies.
The Black Lives Matter protesters at first started chaining themselves to fences in front of a checkpoint near the Capitol, after which the Secret Service closed the gates and shut down the entrance.</p>

<p>“We are here to let people know this presidency is not legit. It goes against hundreds of years of democracy — black lives matter,” BLM DC’s Tracye Redd told FoxNews.com.</p>

<p>At one point, the activists repeated the cry, “Shut it down!”</p>

<p>Officers afterward directed spectators to other entrances, though both checkpoints were later reopened. The efforts were part of an operation apparently under the umbrella of DisruptJ20, which vowed to blockade and shut down security checkpoints&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of these images show a direct comparison.  The Mall is very long, so from the point of view of the shots you included it would look much more full than a rear aerial shot.</p>

<p>I mean 800,000 people is still a whole hell of a lot of people, just not enough to fill the same amount of space as 1.7 million people.</p>

<p>If you watch this timelapse you can see the actual inauguration in it, which the you claim PBS one cuts out, and you can still see those large white spaces in the crowd that the aerial shot shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the last funding cuts during sell out Bill Clinton&#39;s term, NPR only receives about 25% of its funding in tax money that means the conservative think tanks took up the slack and also of course demanded content control.  I don&#39;t know if you listened to them in the 90s versus now, but they are not the same beast.  </p>

<p>If you listen to them their &quot;experts,&quot; are all from conservative think tanks and they have fired nearly all the former talkers and the ones they kept are revolting.  I can&#39;t listen for even 10 mins it makes me want to puke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just believe that you copied the wrong link and aren&#39;t actually thinking of the transcript you actually linked to. This was a speech at an anti-war rally during the run up to the invasion of Iraq.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I supported this administration&#39;s pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. I don&#39;t oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.</p>

<p>Source and methodology? Also, a simple numeric count is going to be misleading, since (1) many presidents didn&#39;t serve a full 8 years and (2) the scope of the US&#39;s involvement has varied widely across conflicts. Putting the Vietnam War or WW2 on the same level as US involvement in the Libyan Civil War is just silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Dream act had absolutely nothing to do with Obama. It was first submitted to Congress in 2001 as a bipartisan initiative to overhaul immigration laws. Immigration is a fairly contentious issue if you haven&#39;t noticed, which is why there hasn&#39;t been major reform for decades. When Obama wrote the EO regarding the EPA the dems were the minority party in the legislature and the Dems are not some monolithic party. A Dem from W. Virginia isn&#39;t going to vote for something that is going to be incredibly unpopular amongst his constituents, especially environmental protection laws. There was no Obama &quot;water bill&quot;. That&#39;s not how government works. I don&#39;t read any left-wing blogs and I was alive and engaged with the world around me when these events took place, I remember what happened. I lived it. I don&#39;t have to Google shit. Being that I witnessed these things happen it seems to me that YOU are the one who is googling bullshit and repeating things that you find that are meant to rile up the rubes. You have no idea what you&#39;re talking about and are making a fool of yourself. </p>

<p>Yeah I don&#39;t think counting like that really makes sense, considering the death toll for said conflicts is far far less than those engaged in under other presidents. And the troop commitment number.... And half the conflicts were ones we were already in.</p>

We can&#39;t break down that sentence to see what each of those words are actually referring to in the real world, we just have to take that sentence at face value and then agree he must have been the most warmongering president ever.

<p>We use our ME wars for fun and profit (and I know Russia enjoys creating new refugees to put pressure on the EU). A guy like Obama was never going to be able to stop it, if he even wanted to.

<p>Obama standing up onstage, proudly saying &#39;I killed Osama Bin Laden&#39; to hysterical cheers from the crowd, when in reality he was sat at a desk ordering drone strikes on innocent civilians, really made me dislike him, even though I started as an Obama fanboy. Looking into things more, the guy was just as bad as anyone else has been, probably worse than Trump right now but the media is a powerful tool. That&#39;s my main point, they can make us hate people or love people and they do that by giving out awards and controlling the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s called &quot;disappointment&quot;. That usually occurs when expectations are too high, e.g. after the media overhyped something. Happens all the time. Maybe the journalists also had high hopes and wrote about it. There was a wide euphoria in 2008. Groupthink or something, an overall hysteria. Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Maybe you shouldn&#39;t accept the <em>opinions</em> of the press and think for yourself next time. &quot;Media manipulation&quot; lmao. Just read reports instead of opinion peaces if you are so easily &quot;manipulated&quot;. It&#39;s only a conspiracy if it&#39;s planned and controlled by a small circle of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m getting at here. I can see through their opinions, maybe other people can&#39;t. I&#39;m just trying to expose the government and media here. Do you really think that invading Syria and drone strikes on the middle east weren&#39;t in the plan when he was receiving this award? Bush started the war, the people weren&#39;t happy so they elected a Muslim leader who coincidentally just won the nobel peace prize and then Bush&#39;s legacy was allowed to continue. The government has no sides, they all sing from different sheets during the election but in reality they pick up where the last president stopped and continue in the same vein.</p>

Unless you&#39;re Trump, then you prioritize Russian lives over American lives.

<p>You have to remember that the peace prize is decided on by a collection of Norwegians so it is going to be inherently eurofocused.</p>

OTOH, the prize was awarded in 2009; I&#39;m pretty sure the Nobel committee did not take his 2016 airstrikes into account and I&#39;m not sure what OP is hoping to prove by putting it out there now. Effectively the title should be &quot;Obama awarded Nobel prize despite the fact that he went on to become....&quot; which, though more accurate, admittedly doesn&#39;t have the emotional punch of OP&#39;s original title.</p>

<p>Honestly the way you phrase this shit it sounds like they handed it to him after being at war for 8 years, which is untrue. The rest is true, but it just undercuts the point you&#39;re trying to make by getting basic dates completely wrong.</p>

Even if he had managed to end the wars in the Middle East by the second year of his presidency, it would&#39;ve been after the prize was awarded.</p>

<p>As for drone strikes, yes they increased during his presidency, even in 2009, but he also called for leaving Iraq as early as February 2009, and draw-down operations began in 2010.</p>

<p>The big conspiracy theory of today is information.  </p>

<p>People are becoming brain washed from &quot;news&quot; that is just infotainment.  Very little real journalism exists anymore.  Conspiracy used to be about seeing the bigger plan, but we are being bombarded from all sides now with politic news, and it&#39;s making a box for us.  The &quot;russia scandel&quot; is taking all the oxygen out the room at the same time.</p>

<p>The MSM are open Democrats/Liberals they even say so themselves. There&#39;s one channel on the right and that&#39;s Fox. On top of that all the major newspapers. Then you have social media Twitter, Facebook are openly left so is reddit. In Hollywood you literally have to hide that you&#39;re a conservative if you want to work.</p>

Your just on the internet to argue with strangers and try and &#39;feel&#39; smart, that&#39;s your agenda.

We&#39;re on the same side but one day you&#39;ll realise blindly arguing or posting far our conspiracys that no one understands isn&#39;t helping, we need soft material thrust into public eyes first to open minds, then reveal the deeper issues like the deep state etc. You qouted he should be charged with crimes, not stripped of a meaningless award and publically humiliated, YES!
