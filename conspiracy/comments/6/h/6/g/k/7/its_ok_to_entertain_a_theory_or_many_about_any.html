       It's more than OK, it's crucial. Never close your mind to possibility. To concede something is possible doesn't mean you also have to say it's probable. Learn something everyday. Good post man, upvoted.

       Thanks. I just dont get why more people cant entertain multiple possibilities and evolve their theories over time. They just want to believe and know all the answers (that are usually spoon fed bullshit via bullshit artist youtubers) - all the smart ones are like... quiet o.o DMing me with all kinds of useful shit.

       Because I'm right and you're wrong. An intelligent person who connects the dots is never wrong. Problem is, they/I might not have enough dots to get to the Truth. Fun to watch.

       That's why crowdsourced investigating is great. I know a lot of great researchers online who do great work,  I guess it's just the ones who follow the latest bullshit messiah around blindly that bug me, lol.

       I've been thinking alot about why people are so stuck in there ways and stubborn alot lately.  It's probably a combo of things. The "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," mentalitlty. Social conditioning is a big factor too. We R taught math or languages and there are only so any deviations from the accepted formulas that can yield a correct answer.  After learning this way for our entire childhood education,, its not so surprising we expect the rest of the world to work that way after we get into the working world. We're also taught that the mysteries of God are essentially unanswerable, so when we encounter problems in real life we attribute the best answer to it we can as fast as possible so as not to go down the path of never being able to answer the question at all.

       Well some things can be worked on and put aside until later, when they can be solved (or maybe never solved). I like a good mystery but can't stand to accept a bullshit "sounds about right" answer on something I'm actually interested in enough to keep digging

       Thanks for posting this. It is something that we should remind ourselves to do with every new story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one part of the mainstream that I see truly permeating this sub is the political zealotry that has become all too common place in the MSM. If we want to think of ourselves as critical thinkers we need to be willing to accept that our old notions were wrong upon more evidence coming to light.
