    <div class="md"><p>I think its worth adding to your statement. And I will try to keep it short..
When they did scientific studies on the tribes in africa who used drums and music in their rituals, they found people are put into a low alpha brainwave state during these events, and as it turns out that people are more suggestible to things as well as being more susceptible to subliminal messages.
So it turns out people who are watching tv? they also go into this highly suggestible/low alpha waves state.
So coupled with the decades of experience advertisers have on preying on basic animal function, like sex, acceptance, etc... and without the basic knowledge to know this, your subconscious process&#39;s it and you have no idea what is going on.
But once you do know whats going on, truly, like I said its a multitude of factors, you have to know about how the basic subconscious works and how to appeal to people&#39;s basic animal needs, for some odd reason your mind can defend against it.</p>

I met them through parenting, school, sports.  I am surrounded by gifted kids and millionaires.  It skews my thinking. I thought I was pretty bright up until I had my first child and sent her to an elite pre school.  I was the least accomplished mother and she was the least accomplished 3 year old.  These people are diehard liberals.  Driving their $140,000 Teslas with their young daughters to the pussy march liberals.  They love Rachel Maddow.  They are smarter than me, iq wise.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this for the past few months, and haven&#39;t reached any positive conclusions yet. It doesn&#39;t seem to be directly tied to IQ, though higher IQs do seem to help. One connection I&#39;ve found (though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only one), is if someone has been gaslighted and abused early in life, and then recovered from it, come to an understanding of it, and developed a hard shell against it. They become skeptical of everything and shine a bright light of analysis on everything and much more selectively decide what they believe reality is, regardless of external influences. I see through brainswashing in media instantly, but also grew up in a fucked up environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had saved this comment I saw a while back. I like cannabis, use it a lot, but also I had scoffed at the idea that it makes you more perceptive or anything like that, in fact in my experience I&#39;ve seen many stupid people who only seemed to get dumber after partaking.</p>

<p>But this person was commenting saying that it does give you more of a tendency to judge the content of what is being said, or to see through lies and deception. Just the way it makes you notice people&#39;s cadence, or specific wording, or tone, almost gives you a little boost to your bullshit detector. And I can actually somewhat agree with that.</p>

<p>Wish I had saved the comment. Can&#39;t remember the way he was saying it but it made sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking about something my liberal mother told me.  First, when I got my first job and commented on the taxes being taken out, she said, &quot;Never look at your gross pay.  It will only annoy you so just ignore it.&quot;  Recently I looked into a private school for my child.  It is $30,000 a year.  Half of the kids are on scholarship.  The rich and poor.  The rich have no income because they live off of their trusts and parents.  Therefore they qualify for scholarships while living higher than I could ever imagine.  The poor go on vacations and have family dinners too.  My husband works 14+ hours a day every day.  We have never been on a vacation.  Ever.  He has never taken a week off of work.  He works for himself.  We will be expected to pay full boat.  I said I can&#39;t do it.  My liberal mother told me, &quot;not to think about those things.&quot;  She ignores what infuriates me.  She also makes $2,500 a month on social security and says she deserves it.  She has a pension too.  She cries poor every single day.  </p>

<p>TL;DR Someone might look smart to not listen to TV, but they have also been quite likely &#39;brainwashed&#39; by the sites they visit into thinking certain thoughts. Example: r/conspiracy users who don&#39;t watch TV yet eat up anything Alex Jones says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is a gatekeeper to the truth. The reason he isn&#39;t dead is because he leads his followers on by throwing them a bone of truth (such as big pharma&#39;s immense corruption of scientific data) but will then lead you off by making you paranoid of an enemy that you will never be able to see. Alex Jones is Smart and you can look up all the information he says but I am skeptical of everybody despite being a flat earther, holocaust denier, racist, and eugenicist. </p>

<p>Some people can&#39;t accept the pain that comes with breaking free from the brainwashing. When I really broke through, a couple years ago, it made me physically ill and despondent for nearly three weeks. I wasn&#39;t suicidal, but I did pretty much stop eating and working. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my circle of friends I have found that the big &quot;sports fans&quot; seem to care about social issues. Whether it is just indict I&#39;ve of these types or a causal effect I am not sure. But it is nearly 100% accurate.</p>

<p>My father would watch paint dry if it was on the sports channel and any conspiracy or alternative discussion bores him to death. </p>

<p>&quot;Why worry about uncontrollables&quot; he says. Yet he yells at the TV like he is the coach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And people wonder why I hate watching sports.  Back in the day when people only had one TV,  if Dad was home Saturday... no cartoons! Gotta watch curling or women&#39;s bike racing or anything labeled a sport and listen to him yell at the TV.  Still get flashbacks if I am in a sports bar and people get too excited. I may have PTSD.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about something my liberal mother told me.  First, when I got my first job and commented on the taxes being taken out, she said, &quot;Never look at your gross pay.  It will only annoy you so just ignore it.&quot;  Recently I looked into a private school for my child. <a href="https://www.resavr.com/comment/does-tv-brainwashing-work-9066233">[Continued...]</a></p>
