       Let's do some economics:
      </p>
      <p>
       PRODUCTION
      </p>
      <p>
       Raising wages places more money in the hands of consumers. Wage earners are more likely to spend a greater portion of increased income than are wealthy people. Increased wages induce spending. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. More jobs means more spending. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs...
      </p>
      <p>
       INFLATION
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher wages are costs of inputs to producers. Producers will pass on
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of these higher costs. This increases pressure on prices. Prices rise a
       <em>
        portion
       </em>
       of the increased cost of inputs. The portion that does not go to increased prices benefits consumers. Then, it follows from this too that .... Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs...

       This is just nonsense.

       Higher wages: bigger black market, more automation, more overseas manufacturing. Fewer jobs, more welfare, corporations lobbying US government for their foreign enterprises, not for the US market.

       Standard macroeconomic theory.

      <p>
       Economic growth and the well-being of the median population was better when the real minimum wage was higher. The macroeconomic rules I presented have been demonstrated to work though history. :)

       No one is demanding it be implemented all at once.  Here is California's $15 minimum wage law.  We are currently at $10 it is set to go up to $15 over several years, not immediately.

       Most large companies will not be forced to pass the costs down to the consumers because they already make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, so they can afford to pay their employees more and still make piles of money selling their products at the same price. The problem is they are greedy, if profits are the only goal then who cares if their employees are struggling to feed their kids on $7 an hour.

       Agreed, corporate profits are outrageous and no company will be 'forced' to pass along higher wage costs, but they most certainly will do it.  A much better way to truly enrich people is to focus on free education and universal healthcare, affordable housing, etc.

       I think one of the biggest problems people face is they are in over their heads with all kinds of debts like medical, school, credits, loans, and they are literally stressed out all the time just trying to make ends meet, working 40+ hours a week and still not able to get ahead or break free. This is where a higher minimum wage would help, it will give people some financial freedom to actually have the mental clarity to enjoy life without living in mental slavery.

       I know it's a very attractive concept and I don't blame anyone for wanting to make more money in their minimum wage job, however I do believe it simply validates the very socioeconomic system that has trapped them in the first place.

       A lot of companies could potentially make more money due to sales volumes without the need for huge price hikes. This article about why the Wetzel's Pretzels CEO went from opposing to supporting a minimum wage increase. Demand-side economics. Trickle-down is a fairy tale.

       Here is one reason the inflation excuse is the sorriest excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying people more does give them more money to spend, but they don't all spend it on the same thing so the purchases are spread over a broad choice of goods and services and no single product or service is subjected to an excessive demand and price pressure.

       This has been so sadly twisted by a "conservative" long game but it's actually a very simple math problem.  Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <p>
       When demand is high, supply must rise to meet it.
      </p>
      <p>
       wages = demand
supply = jobs

       Well it can't be any worse than the current minimum wage at creating wealth so better to try something like this out than sit around while people need to work multiple minimum wage jobs to barely scrape by.

       The economy is rigged, I believe everyone can agree on that. Raising minimum wages is the equivalent of putting a band aid on an infection and pronouncing it cured. It will not resolve the real issue. The economy is set up to enslave us with debt, using a scarcity theory. Raising a minimum wage will not change the scarcity model, or the debt system. The rules were made to enslave, stop thinking along the lines of the system they set up.

       When I left school, I was getting paid around $8 an hour which was 70%(?) of the adult Minimum Wage (it raises every year until 21). That was 25 years ago, during the "recession we had to have". Minimum Wage is now over $17 and Australia has had 26 years of "unbroken" economic growth. We also have universal healthcare, "free" education, and a social security system that pays around 50% of the minimum wage to the unemployed. Just in case you missed the math, unemployment benefits work out to about $8 an hour. Our unemployed get about as much from Social Security as an American working a full-time job on minimum wage, and we haven't had a true recession for almost three decades.

       Customers without cash cannot consume. I think a strong case for a $15 Minimum Wage
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       a $7.50 'Basic Income' can be made for the US.
