    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do some economics:</p>

<p>PRODUCTION</p>

<p>Raising wages places more money in the hands of consumers. Wage earners are more likely to spend a greater portion of increased income than are wealthy people. Increased wages induce spending. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. More jobs means more spending. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs...</p>

<p>INFLATION</p>

<p>Higher wages are costs of inputs to producers. Producers will pass on <em>some</em> of these higher costs. This increases pressure on prices. Prices rise a <em>portion</em> of the increased cost of inputs. The portion that does not go to increased prices benefits consumers. Then, it follows from this too that .... Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs. Spending increases demand and increases production. Increased production means more jobs...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I left school, I was getting paid around $8 an hour which was 70%(?) of the adult Minimum Wage (it raises every year until 21). That was 25 years ago, during the &quot;recession we had to have&quot;. Minimum Wage is now over $17 and Australia has had 26 years of &quot;unbroken&quot; economic growth. We also have universal healthcare, &quot;free&quot; education, and a social security system that pays around 50% of the minimum wage to the unemployed. Just in case you missed the math, unemployment benefits work out to about $8 an hour. Our unemployed get about as much from Social Security as an American working a full-time job on minimum wage, and we haven&#39;t had a true recession for almost three decades. </p>

<p>Customers without cash cannot consume. I think a strong case for a $15 Minimum Wage <em>and</em> a $7.50 &#39;Basic Income&#39; can be made for the US. </p>
