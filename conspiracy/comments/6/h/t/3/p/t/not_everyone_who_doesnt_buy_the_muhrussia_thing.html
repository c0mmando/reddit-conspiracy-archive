&quot;Seeing more and more journalists just deciding to label people far right or &quot;alt-right&quot; without merit.&quot;</a></p>

<p>– Tim Pool</p>

<p>This one is more complex and becomes an interesting PR gambit.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RubinReport/status/875791519298592774">&quot;Hey @joshharkinson, your article is outright libelous about me. Expect a public retraction from you and @MotherJones.&quot;</a></p>

<p>– Dave Rubin</p>

<p>We know rule 10 applies to calling out shills. If you get accused of being a fascist, an alt-right extremist, or a Putinbot or whatever, use the report feature. They are calling you a shill for not buying into Hillary&#39;s, and the deep state&#39;s lies. Have a great weekend.</p>

<p>What does this confirm?  I bet Rosenstein, and shortly thereafter Meuller, are going to either resign or recuse because of that single tweet.  I guess it confirms that Trump knows what&#39;s going on...</p>

<p>Many, not the least of which beating the established and corrupt Hillary government, and finally removing that dynasty from political discourse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you feel about the blatant lying - like his inauguration crowd size?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inauguration size?  We both know what happened there.  He has marketing people that gave him false information.  I don&#39;t consider it a lie, I don&#39;t think he intended to lie.  Someone told him something that he repeated.  I don&#39;t know of any other &quot;blatant lying&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement and TPP.  Currently he is changing welfare to require people collecting benefits to work (in some cases).  I have loved the stock market since his election which is a reaction to Trump (not necessarily something he did).  I like that he is un-apologetically pushing back against the legacy media which has grown into a powerful tool of propaganda and have left behind the ideals of journalism.  I love how inclusive he has been towards minorities and LGBTQ groups and people.  I believe in what he is doing in his continuing attempts to build a working relationship with Russia, including sharing information on possible terrorist threats.  I am proud that he is negotiating with multinational corporations representing the needs of the American people as opposed to the needs of the corporations like most politicians today.  I agree with the scaling back of regulation, as the bureaucracies built around the regulation of day to day business by the Federal government has become a bloated and ineffectual money hole.  I totally agree with the firing of Comey.  Comey should have publicly stated that Trump was not under investigation the first time there was a leak from his office that could be used to fuel rumors that he was.  </p>

<p>I could go on all day.  He represents me pretty well, and I am happy I voted for him.</p>

<p>No other questions. If you agree with his politics, then I can&#39;t fault you for still supporting him. I personally disagree with essentially everything he&#39;s done to date, aside from the handful of things like the photo op you mentioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No point in arguing with MessisTaxAccountant. I was arguing with him because he was arguing with a previous poster over the meaning of the OPs post. This guy kept claiming that OP was stating the literal opposite of what he said. So I asked him to show me how he&#39;s getting the opposite message from the text and where in the text he sees that message. After that, he stopped trying to argue and would say &quot;I already said so earlier.&quot; On top of it, he said I was stalking him. Which is funny because his comments are all public and viewable on his profile, so it&#39;s not hard to catch him in a lie.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/6iddfw/the_sjws_are_cancer_starter_pack/dj6dquy/">Here are links to my comments where I call him out and prove he&#39;s a liar, and he still claims my post &quot;only proves him right.&quot; You can decide for yourself if someone this adamant at being wrong is worth your time.</a></p>

<p>So literally your situation. He just makes something up and claims this is what you said and meant. He totally will ignore everything else.</p>

<p>Anyways thought I&#39;d at least give you the heads up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Covering their celebration or &quot;celebrating with&quot; is not the same as celebrating the Proud Boys. I think it&#39;s disingenuous to extrapolate that much from an ambiguous title.

But the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.</p>

<p>This video if you watch it, really doesn&#39;t show bias and this one video doesn&#39;t support that Tim has a bias for the alt-right. Tim if anything has expressed a disdain for labels but has said he has always leaned left/liberal. He has explicitly numerous times clarified his opinions on the alt-right and why he doesn&#39;t feel they are a useful or productive group or one to associate with. I&#39;ve watched a fair amount of his content from even back to Standing Rock and the Occupy Protests and I don&#39;t believe you can say he&#39;s firmly alt-right. I think you are trying to make this into something much greater than it actually is.  I&#39;ll ask pretty much the same can you show where Tim has been approving of alt right beliefs or identifies with them?</p>

<p>Clearly you didn&#39;t watch the video. Watch it and tell me if you think he doesn&#39;t like the Proud Boys.</p>

<p>This seems to directly fly in the front of your earlier claim that:</p>

<p>So in this case, I will take absence of evidence as evidence of you making something up earlier.</p>

<p>If you have watched his coverage, than you have seen about the same things I have, a man playing a liberal concern troll. If you want ask me for evidence on Monday when it&#39;s not the weekend and i&#39;ll watch some tim pool to send you.</p>

<p>The easiest way to understand it is this.   The majority of posters here mocked the MSM and were worried about the globalists intentions for the average American long before Trump became a political figure.

<p><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/02/wordpress-password-security/">6 Million Password Attacks in 16 Hours and How to Block Them</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. Any good server admin running internal use only environments like DNC/DCCC will BLOCK entire country wide IPs from even having ability to have any access at all.  SO they would have used a VPN from another country if in fact it was Russian govt. based hackers.</p>

<p>2.Comey.  He did not have any forensic evidence reviewed by FBI hacking experts or engineers. Totally discount his testimony because he used PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY to promote the Russia hack. What does that mean?  By having a private company do the investigation, he can not compel them to testify or give up to the public through FOIA requests any findings. Brilliant! but totally deceptive and unreliable.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Graham - His &quot;vendor was hacked&quot; ok so what? That doesn&#39;t mean his server/email was.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chicago Tribune piece is a total false.  No Republican emails were hacked or released to the public or wikileaks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ask yourself.  Why did these emails wind up in the hands of wikileaks anyway?  Wouldn&#39;t the Russian Govt rather have kept them secret and use the info for blackmail purposes against Hillary. </p>

<p>And why hasn&#39;t the Weiner laptop been hacked or leaked either if the Russians got into the DNC/DCCC servers? Wouldn&#39;t they also have been able to hack Hillary&#39;s &quot;home brew&quot; server just as easily.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t The Russians release the 650,000 Hillary Sever emails on Weiner&#39;s laptop assuming they were able to hack Hillary&#39;s server since it was much less secure than the DNC or DCCC?????  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. Any good server admin running internal use only environments like DNC/DCCC will BLOCK entire country wide IPs from even having ability to have any access at all.  SO they would have used a VPN from another country if in fact it was Russian govt. based hackers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look dude I&#39;m just saying Republicans were targeted by cyber attackers. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re Russian, but according to Rubio and Graham, someone tried to illegitimately gain access to their info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.Comey.  He did not have any forensic evidence reviewed by FBI hacking experts or engineers. Totally discount his testimony because he used PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY to promote the Russia hack. What does that mean?  By having a private company do the investigation, he can not compel them to testify or give up to the public through FOIA requests any findings. Brilliant! but totally deceptive and unreliable.</p>

<ol>
<li>Graham - His &quot;vendor was hacked&quot; ok so what? That doesn&#39;t mean his server/email was.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>He was a Republican that was targeted. That&#39;s why I brought him up.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The Chicago Tribune piece is a total false.  No Republican emails were hacked or released to the public or wikileaks.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That isn&#39;t the claim of the article lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ask yourself.  Why did these emails wind up in the hands of wikileaks anyway? Wouldn&#39;t the Russian Govt rather have kept them secret and use the info for blackmail purposes against Hillary. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There wasn&#39;t even anything blackmail worthy in the emails.</p>

<p>Remember how you were talking about crowdstrike being unaccountable? Wikileaks is similarly unaccountable. You can&#39;t place sanctions on Wikileaks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why hasn&#39;t the Weiner laptop been hacked or leaked either if the Russians got into the DNC/DCCC servers? Wouldn&#39;t they also have been able to hack Hillary&#39;s &quot;home brew&quot; server just as easily.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t The Russians release the 650,000 Hillary Sever emails on Weiner&#39;s laptop assuming they were able to hack Hillary&#39;s server since it was much less secure than the DNC or DCCC?????   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look dude I can&#39;t answer all of those questions, who the fuck knows. Maybe the Russians did get into all of those things and chose not to release the emails on Weiners computer. Maybe they did hack the home brew server. </p>

<p>Shit, maybe <em>those</em> are the emails they&#39;re holding for blackmail. </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with relying on a private company for analysis the feds do it all the time, it&#39;s not uncommon. </p>

<p>The FBI has confidence that the russians have meddled in the election on a number of fronts via sophisticated methods. This is not a single hack this is a mosaic of many attacks targeting many organizations. The post by <a href="/u/feedmesources">/u/feedmesources</a> mentions attacks against republican servers, there&#39;s also the NSA report detailing hacking attempts / success against local election officials right before the election.</p>

<p>Much has been said to try to discredit crowdstrike&#39;s analysis since the FBI did not do the first-level analysis of the system. However every piece of information coming out since that has only corroborated and strengthened crowdstrike&#39;s conclusion. This is not a partisan issue. Russia meddled in the 2016 election including targeted cyberattacks. This isn&#39;t really up for debate anymore we see new evidence of this all the time. </p>

<p>The DNC was hacked. The DNC hired CrowdStrike to give an assessment. The DNC refused to let the FBI and government to independently verify the hack. The FBI relied on the findings of an entity, CrowdStrike, that was paid by the DNC. That doesn&#39;t look good.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is actually common. I understand that you&#39;d feel better that the FBI did the analysis directly but they work with other private third parties all the time. The FBI does not have a monopoly on competent hackers, far from it you make more in the private sector, just like any other industry. </p>

<p>In the world of attribution the type of tangible proof that I suspect you are looking for doesn&#39;t exist. The crowdstrike report speaks to the sophistication of the attackers, the tradecraft they describe already narrows the field of suspects to a few state actors, the tools they used and the specific way they operated within the systems narrows that field further. This is how attribution is done. You don&#39;t find a jpg of Putin with a note saying &quot;I did it.&quot; Anyone that is still skeptical is likely to stay that way because amateurs don&#39;t understand how it works and often have an expectation that is very different from reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crowdstrike report actually doesn&#39;t say that and their analysis is based on the behavior and sophistication of the attackers along with the tools that these groups use to infiltrate targets, and operation handoff details also consistent with this group. False attribution is a thing but magic isn&#39;t real and there are limitations of when and how that&#39;s possible but that&#39;s a long convoluted post all by itself. </p>

<p>It&#39;s evidence; You don&#39;t want it to be and you can&#39;t understand it so you just say it&#39;s not evidence, but it is. You have no background or knowledge to even make such a distinction so the fact that you would just dismiss it exposes your bias for all to see. You don&#39;t care about the evidence you care about maintaining your worldview. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in the truth I don&#39;t care about the narrative, that&#39;s your focus, not mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way of knowing how deep that rabbit hole goes. I compare the demographics of reddit, compared to the polling of political views for politics. If that were true reddit would still be a Sanders circle jerk. The minority view (neoliberals) turned into the super majority. That information says a lot to me on just how many there are.</p>

<p>Covering their celebration or &quot;celebrating with&quot; is not the same as celebrating the Proud Boys. I think it&#39;s disingenuous to extrapolate that much from an ambiguous title.</p>

<p>Clearly you didn&#39;t watch the video. Watch it and tell me if you think he doesn&#39;t like the Proud Boys.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of an example where he has been explicitly critical of the Proud Boys but still that is not evidence that Tim Pool is in any way alt-right. But the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.</p>

<p>This seems to directly fly in the front of your earlier claim that:</p>

<p>considering how many other times he&#39;s expressed his opinion and distaste for their views.</p>

<p>So in this case, I will take absence of evidence as evidence of you making something up earlier.</p>

<p>If you have watched his coverage, than you have seen about the same things I have, a man playing a liberal concern troll. If you want ask me for evidence on Monday when it&#39;s not the weekend and i&#39;ll watch some tim pool to send you.</p>

<li>Marco Rubio/CNN. That is a good point. But here&#39;s the thing. When you just have a unsuccessful attack there&#39;s not much in the way of server based information you can detect. A targeted attack from IP addresses really doesn&#39;t tell you much because so many of these are launched using VPN&#39;s anyway and if unsuccessful you can&#39;t do forensics on the activity of the hackers while in the servers.<br/></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>targeted by IP addresses with an unknown location within Russia,&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever had a wordpress site? There are literally millions of Russia based IP address attacks daily.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one article about specifically targeting emails: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/02/wordpress-password-security/">6 Million Password Attacks in 16 Hours and How to Block Them</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing. Any good server admin running internal use only environments like DNC/DCCC will BLOCK entire country wide IPs from even having ability to have any access at all.  SO they would have used a VPN from another country if in fact it was Russian govt. based hackers.</p>

<p>2.Comey.  He did not have any forensic evidence reviewed by FBI hacking experts or engineers. Totally discount his testimony because he used PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY to promote the Russia hack. What does that mean?  By having a private company do the investigation, he can not compel them to testify or give up to the public through FOIA requests any findings. Brilliant! but totally deceptive and unreliable.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Graham - His &quot;vendor was hacked&quot; ok so what? That doesn&#39;t mean his server/email was.</p></li>
<li><p>The Chicago Tribune piece is a total false.  No Republican emails were hacked or released to the public or wikileaks.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ask yourself.  Why did these emails wind up in the hands of wikileaks anyway?  Wouldn&#39;t the Russian Govt rather have kept them secret and use the info for blackmail purposes against Hillary. </p>

<p>And why hasn&#39;t the Weiner laptop been hacked or leaked either if the Russians got into the DNC/DCCC servers? Wouldn&#39;t they also have been able to hack Hillary&#39;s &quot;home brew&quot; server just as easily.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t The Russians release the 650,000 Hillary Sever emails on Weiner&#39;s laptop assuming they were able to hack Hillary&#39;s server since it was much less secure than the DNC or DCCC?????  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The head of the FBI has expressed in no uncertain terms that it&#39;s happened. The NSA has released independend evidence of Russia hacking attempts for local elections officials. Prior to all of this an independent 3rd party company said Russia hacked the DNC, and they  have been maligned by the right ever since. However, every other piece of evidence that comes to light from the 3 letter agencies agrees with their original conclusion. </p>

<p>Yeah at this point, there is evidence, and it points to the Russian government. For some people that&#39;s not a convenient narrative, for others it is, whatever. The fact remains that&#39;s where the evidence points. </p>
