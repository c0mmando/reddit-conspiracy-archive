        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This would eliminate the problem with people being to busy to protest since their job would be to protest. </p>

<p>We would be able to run 100 protestors every day for about $10,000 a day if we pay them $11 - $12 an hour. This includes money for water, food, and signs. </p>

<p>We can easily afford this if many people donate to a central fund to get this going. GoFundMe is a massive fundraising source for the public at:</p>

<p>gofundme.co</p>

<p>This would cost $300,000 a month so we would need to raise about a million to keep the protest going for at least 3 months. We can also continue to fund raise during these 3 months for the 4th month and on. </p>

<p>The 100 protestors would be the nucleus of our march on DC. This nucleus of paid protestors will attract many more free protestors who want to join the cause simply for the cause itself. Our 100 paid protestors will not only jump start the march, but it will also prevent the march from dying out in its early phases when it is most vulnerable. </p>

<p>1 million may sound like a lot of money but its doable and it would buy us our first 3 months. This will give us enough time to strategize for long term goals as we see the progress we make with this strategy. </p>

<p>All we need is 1 hero with enough time to dedicate themselves to this project. This will start a domino effect that will lead us into a new planet of peace. Times have changed because the world woke up a year ago. A serious march on DC will be seen in all 4 corners of the world and it would trigger insane amounts of motivation to all the frustrated citizens of the world. That motivation will lead to positive actions randomly across the world which would further the cause. </p>

<p>All this attention we draw by marching on DC will set off the next domino and the rest of the dominoes will pretty much take care of themselves and we would win. </p>

<p>Human beings have done many amazing things including sending people to the moon, building freeways across the world, ect... I&#39;m sure we can manage to raise a million for a march. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But think about it, 12 an hour is more than a lot of people (including myself) get paid. I&#39;d rather have protesters that are driven by emotion and genuinely believe in the cause than paid protesters who may not care what the message is as long as they get a paycheck. I just feel like protesters being paid takes away from the legitimacy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is we need both but it&#39;s easy to find. We need real concerned citizens who have to get paid to stay afloat and pay rent. We can also take in volunteers but the 100 core protesters has to stay put. We give them a paycheck to help cover expenses they could have are from regular work. </p>

<p>I get it the purity of volunteers but in today&#39;s world, if you don&#39;t pay your rent, you get kicked to the curb. We want our nucleus of protestors to stay put or else the whole thing can fall apart. </p>
