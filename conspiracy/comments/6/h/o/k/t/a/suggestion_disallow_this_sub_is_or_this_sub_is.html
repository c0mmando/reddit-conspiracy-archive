       These kind of meta posts that say we are not this or that or we are not anti this or pro this, most of those who actually come here for free thinking already know that and well, those who do not come here with open mind, it is their own problem ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of these metaposts like that usually are created to shift the public opinion into certain direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope that this will be the last METApost and I hope that moderators for sake of the quality of this community will disallow that kind of meta-posts, just remove these posts and all.. And I want this to be last post that ends all sort of these posts.

       because we are a blend of people with different views, anyone who is looking for confirmation bias will find it here. "I bet those CTs are all Trumpers" - they then search the sub for only Trump posts and find 3-4 and go "Ahh Ha!" I knew it. In the process they ignored the 100 other posts to get there. Its only best to ignore the bafoons.

       Of course it's being targeted! You run a conspiracy forum for fuck's sake, did you think they were just going to sit back and let you tell the truth without a backlash?

       The question is whether you're going to let them run wild or develop tactics to win the battle.

       Think about your strategic situation and you'll come up with a lot more ideas than the things that are being currently implemented. 95% of your shills are not the least bit sophisticated.

       The way I see it, it's either:
       <br/>
       A) censor the shills - but defining and singling out shills is difficult, risks banning genuine people, and goes again the very idea the sub was made on of info free from censorship.
       <br/>
       B) leave the shills - but that way it may go to shit unless the genuine users are good enough to organically prevent them from gaining any real footing in the sub. But that leads me onto this thought.
       <br/>
       How do you ensure the users are "good enough", or equipped with the right tools, techniques, and knowledge to best allow them to stay on top of the shill/troll problem? You gotta educate. Education seems to be the only obvious long term solution. Educate the users on what the shills and trolls' goals are, their tools and techniques, and how best to counter them. Teach them to calmly explain their perspective, downvote, report (if necessary), and move on instead of engaging and being dragged down to an argument started by some ad homenim attack or whatever.
       <br/>
       This requires being able to compile comprehensive lists and materials, and putting them in one, easy, obvious place for everyone to see. Like a sticky post. It's possible. It would take serious prep to make it air-tight, but without putting in the hard work you can't get the pay off. Then once it's out there it's down to the users to exercise and practice it. Which I believe they could do so, effectively.

       Sound advice - certainly the main impact that shills have is the over-reaction they elicit from the people they interact with, and too many genuine /c/conspiracy users have found themselves being reprimanded/banned by the mods for breaking the rules as a result.

       The main problem with shills is they drive off your organic user base, which is disappearing at an alarming rate while you wring your hands and repeat shibboleths about how "censorship" is bad.

       You could try to comment something productive instead of straight up sarcasm. You're adding to the problem by not being a part of the solution yourself.

       Just let it ride.  We just need to downvote, neg comment, and move on.  It blows my mind that some of them fly up so fast in upvoted though.

       I used to think the rallying cry posts were ways that some groups of people, not just shills but including groups from /pol/ and such, were using to make a roll call.  They post a vague "I'm with you OP" to sound off, then go through and see who else posted before going through their history and upvoting them/coming to their defense elsewhere.  Though maybe the weird behavior of some posters here have me looking way too deeply into things.

       It was just a random thought I had going through my head for about a week, a while back.  I don't put much stock in it because I never actually went through and did the necessary follow up research.  There was an uptick in rallying cries near the end of when PG was huge here, along with a decent amount of upvoted low-effort front page posts along with really terrible and antagonistic comments getting large amounts of upvotes.

       I haven't seen a single one of these meta-super-concerned-troll posts, that came from someone who actually contributes anything.  It's almost always some outside voice, or a person who claims to be a lurker, but doesn't do anything here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pro censorship in any case, but I think this version of concern trolling could fall under rule 10 pretty easily, with
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       a clarification or mention of this specific issue.  Banning these posts, and repeat offenders, wouldn't reduce content or discussion in the slightest.  It would even take away one technique of forum sliding, for when we're really heavily invaded by shills, r/all normies, and such.

       Checking in.  I contribute here pretty often.  OP'd the current text meta-post in suspect.  Truly concerned and frustrated by the apparent social engineering on this sub recently.  That caused me to post my thoughts and frustrations but I expected it to be downvoted into oblivion.  It seems to have struck a nerve (my inbox is toxic).  Didn't mean to wreck havoc just wanted to present (what I thought were) valid concerns.  It's happening whether you like it or not.  Meta posts keep it in the light.  I get these posts are annoying so it's right to voice concern on your part too.   But not allowing people to point it out is probably not the right move either.
      </p>

       What is strange is the pure unadulterated hate from so many people who hate someone for saying they won't accept the narrative.

       number of posts trying to claim that were
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       t_d2, and pretty soon, we end up with a front page filled with people trying to claim what this sub is or isn't about.  It's just a self perpetuating circle of silliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the mods have bigger fish to fry than this particular issue, though.  I think these concern posts could be disposed of pretty easily, and it dovetails into a rework of rule 10, which is pretty vague and unenforceable, as is.  Either way, it's not the end of he world, just obnoxiousness that interferes with actual discussion of conspiracies.

       It is true.  Deleting would be seen as censorship to a small percentage, and a small percentage would question the neutralness of anyone cutting. It would be an even worse shitstorm.

       Two things:

       Use a flair, label it Meta (you can use flairs for more than one thing....)

       And secondly, try not to delete posts that are simply about bombing targets in the US the soviets have. It isn't fear mongering or anti-trump, it is information that people, especially preppers, would be interested in :)

       Why not just lock them and say why? If you guys take a clear stance against it and make it known these types of posts aren't allowed, people can't scream censorship.

       maybe create a trump and trump-adjacent megathread, where all those posts, pro or con, can go, then we can zoom right by but they get the validation of having somewhere to post their trump stuff, because they aren't going away.

       Most of the front page of this sub people circlejerking about being
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       conspiracy theorists. I get that you all like to feel smug about being the right kind of dissident or whatever, but jesus fucking christ we can't discuss anything if you're just engaging in that kind of masturbatory navel gazing.

       I get it, you're superior because you like a politician; stop bumping actual content off the front page.

       This is a good idea for a rule change.  Also, purely religious stuff should be in religious subs, unless it has a conspiracy aspect.

       Not at all. I read and post on this subreddit merly because I like conspiracies.  It's not personal to me.  Just thought your statement was ironic enough to point out.

       you are the kind of person i hope to never meet face to face. your responses are so self-aggrandizing yet are also non-sequiturs; acting like you've won the prize everyone wanted by throwing it down a well.
