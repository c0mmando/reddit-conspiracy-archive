       There are likely specific clauses that can be used to dump some agreements and not others. The Qatar arms deal being cancelled would open up a huge can of worms re:israel, saudi and starting shit with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that its probably safer to just let the countries fight it out on their own and profit than to pick a clear side and start ww3.

       I think US picked a side when POTUS tweeted:

       "During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar—look!”

       "So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"

       talk is talk. Obama talked about being nice to russians and look where we are now.. Its another thing to sell huge amounts of arms to both sides. Personally I think both Qatar and Saudi are terrorist supporters and if they both go up in a ball of fire I am ok with that.

       One thing at a time my friend.  He's fully aware of how hysterical the left gets every time he delivers on a campaign promise (or does anything for that matter).  So he's slowing things down a bit as to accommodate for their tender feelz and delicate emotional state that's teetering on the edge of insanity right now.

       Media blackout? No, everyone was much more interested in the upcoming Comey testimony. You can't seriously argue infrastructure week was more newsworthy than the former director of the FBI testifying before the Senate in an open hearing.

       Lol where does it say infrastructure week started on the 12th? I'm going off of this, from your second link:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Donald J. Trump has dedicated this week to addressing America's crumbling infrastructure.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The date of the post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        JUNE 6, 2017
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And here's another whitehouse.gov article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump ushered in “a great new era in American aviation” and kicked off Infrastructure Week with the announcement of his Air Traffic Control Initiative.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/06/06/beginning-great-new-era-american-aviation">
        https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/06/06/beginning-great-new-era-american-aviation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       See where it says "Yesterday President Donald J Trump...kicked off Infrastructure week" with an announcement that happened Monday, June 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please tell me where you are getting the idea that infrastructure week was the 12th-16th?

       So there are some key points that people seem to forget when it comes to the TPP, Paris Accord, Cuba etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the US Congress can Ratify a Treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the President decides that a treaty is in the nation's best interests (and does not violate the US Constitution!), the President (or designated representative) will sign the treaty. Signing a treaty does not make it become law! It means that the US Government believes the treaty is a good idea, and commits the President to seeking ratification.
      </p>
      <p>
       So TPP, Paris accord, Cuba none of which had been ratified, Just signed meaning the President thought it was a good idea.  The now current president said fuck it, I am out and canceling the request for Ratification.  Thus 'Undoing" them
      </p>
      <p>
       Over simplifies I know, but just because a president signs an agreement it doesnt make it law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paris Accord was a Non-Binding agreement, not really the treaty its made out to be,
      </p>
      <p>
       TPP was never approved by congress, they stopped the process becasue trump said No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cuba was never a treaty is was done Via Executive order, and now that trump is President he can make his Own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Qatar deal was approved by Congress, they approve all arms deals,  President can't really do much, you know checks and balances and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems like you have to ask.  Why is congress approving the sale of arms to Qatar,  We here face, All on the Government needs to be replaced, not just the president.

       Signing a treaty only confirms it's existence, and doesn't make it legally binding. If you make an agreement with someone on something, you want to first make sure you and the other party agree on the same agreement and they don't later say that something else was the real agreement. That's what 'signing' it is, and ratifying it is agreeing to the actual terms.

       Alright, something about arms deals. They are agreements. With stipulations, penalties, if undelivered.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's to avoid the whole one country taking another's money and then just keeping it and the finished goods. Other countries would consider say, Russia, or Chinese manufacturers and arms for longer term contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's pretty much it. International rep in the arms dealing business is big business.
