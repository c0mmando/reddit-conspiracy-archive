    <div class="md"><p>Lol where does it say infrastructure week started on the 12th? I&#39;m going off of this, from your second link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Donald J. Trump has dedicated this week to addressing America&#39;s crumbling infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The date of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JUNE 6, 2017</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here&#39;s another whitehouse.gov article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump ushered in “a great new era in American aviation” and kicked off Infrastructure Week with the announcement of his Air Traffic Control Initiative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/06/06/beginning-great-new-era-american-aviation">https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/06/06/beginning-great-new-era-american-aviation</a></p>

<p>See where it says &quot;Yesterday President Donald J Trump...kicked off Infrastructure week&quot; with an announcement that happened Monday, June 5.</p>

<p>So please tell me where you are getting the idea that infrastructure week was the 12th-16th?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there are some key points that people seem to forget when it comes to the TPP, Paris Accord, Cuba etc etc</p>

<p>Only the US Congress can Ratify a Treaty.</p>

<p>If the President decides that a treaty is in the nation&#39;s best interests (and does not violate the US Constitution!), the President (or designated representative) will sign the treaty. Signing a treaty does not make it become law! It means that the US Government believes the treaty is a good idea, and commits the President to seeking ratification. </p>

<p>So TPP, Paris accord, Cuba none of which had been ratified, Just signed meaning the President thought it was a good idea.  The now current president said fuck it, I am out and canceling the request for Ratification.  Thus &#39;Undoing&quot; them</p>

<p>Over simplifies I know, but just because a president signs an agreement it doesnt make it law.  </p>

<p>Paris Accord was a Non-Binding agreement, not really the treaty its made out to be,</p>

<p>TPP was never approved by congress, they stopped the process becasue trump said No.</p>

<p>Cuba was never a treaty is was done Via Executive order, and now that trump is President he can make his Own.</p>

<p>Qatar deal was approved by Congress, they approve all arms deals,  President can&#39;t really do much, you know checks and balances and all.</p>

<p>So it seems like you have to ask.  Why is congress approving the sale of arms to Qatar,  We here face, All on the Government needs to be replaced, not just the president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Signing a treaty only confirms it&#39;s existence, and doesn&#39;t make it legally binding. If you make an agreement with someone on something, you want to first make sure you and the other party agree on the same agreement and they don&#39;t later say that something else was the real agreement. That&#39;s what &#39;signing&#39; it is, and ratifying it is agreeing to the actual terms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, something about arms deals. They are agreements. With stipulations, penalties, if undelivered. </p>

<p>It&#39;s to avoid the whole one country taking another&#39;s money and then just keeping it and the finished goods. Other countries would consider say, Russia, or Chinese manufacturers and arms for longer term contracts. </p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty much it. International rep in the arms dealing business is big business.</p>

<li>TPP was never in effect or ratified.</li>
<li>Paris AGREEMENT was a lose conglomeration of stupid thoughts.</li>
<li>Obamas Cuban partnership was a presidential decision that could be revoked by Trump.</li>
<li>Qatar arms deal was put in place by congress in 2016 and the deal was completed before the Qatar crisis.</li>
<li>Qatar does not need Billions from the US like you are suggesting. US gives Billions to Israel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy to explain to you everything you missed.</p>
