        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The people in power always had a variety of tools to seperate themselves from the poor and help them to keep that seperation as steep as possible.  </p>

<p>For a long time language had been part of that.</p>

<p>In the middle ages the aristocracy often spoke a foreign language to seperate themselves from the lower classes, this and other things disappeared with the rise of nationalism across the west. Until now.</p>

<p>The west has achieved near 100% literacy across their people, it mostly also got rid of rigid class based systems.</p>

<p>Well we are about to head back into a more class based system and the seperation of poor and wealthy, you might think right now it is already as worse as it gets, but it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The first and foremost symptom of it is of course on how much wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few, the second symptom is the rise of a new &quot;language&quot; that will help the well off to <strong>seperate themselves</strong> further <strong>from the poor and to discriminate them</strong> if they&#39;re not able to speak or write in that language, and this language is called the <strong>gender neutral language</strong>.</p>

<p>When you go back in time, you&#39;ll see that people often discriminated others for speaking a dialect they attributed to the poor, no matter how well-educated or good-hearted their counterpart might have been, they would try to ridicule and make a laughing stock of him because of his speech and use of language.</p>

<p><strong>The gender neutral language is nothing but that.</strong></p>

<p>A tool for the well off to help them identify the people who are outside of their peergroup and ridicule them.</p>

<p>They will of course market it in the name of good, and how it will exactly help the people who they will in the end ridicule for not using it. </p>

<p>The common people will never respect the gender neutral language, they&#39;ll ridicule as one should. But in that they&#39;ll weaken their own position, because the well off, the decision makers at the top exactly want that.</p>

<p>It will be nothing but a old but new tool to seperate the classes from each other. </p>

<p>The ones barely above the poor and uneducated will take to the new language, applications need to be written in that new language, every aspect of life will be influenced by it.</p>

<p>If you want to climb the career ladder, you will need to bow down and accept the new language and learn how to use it.</p>

<p>The poor will not be able to do it, to the point were successful pupils will ridicule their poor parents for not showing enough consideration in their daily lives towards the use of that language.</p>

<p>You will need to write your application in a gender neutral form, like you need to watch for spelling mistakes you&#39;ll need to watch that you write it in a correct gender neutral form and it will be nothing but a new unnecessary <strong>artificial</strong> hurdle to dimish the chances of the poor to achieve what the wealthy achieved before them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m giving OP a pass on the &quot;can&#39;t&quot; remark, when it&#39;s pretty clear the intention was the poor are likely not academically prepared for another language barrier, not that they can&#39;t adapt; and even if they do, they&#39;ll likely be the last to do so, and take the largest hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was just watching a video on the hermetic principles and the final one was gender. Gender is universally a representation of energy, like yin (feminine), and yang (masculine). </p>

<p>By removing gender from the equation TPTB are fundamentally altering the collective consciousness of humanity from being able to properly understand and appreciate both feminine and masculine energy by convincing the masses they don&#39;t exist. This will in turn cause confusion, suffering, and ultimately chaos as those who believe in this system of language and thinking or those who don&#39;t know better will never be able to properly understand one of the key defining principles of our universe.</p>

<p>While they make the idea of equality between genders seem like some kind of superior utopian ideology it is in fact a lie. Feminine energy is a different degree than masculine energy. They are the same type of energy, but they have opposing and yet attracting qualities that define them to serve the different yet equally important functions including reproduction and proliferation of the species. </p>

<p>While much of the conditioned gender roles are also made up bullshit to confuse people, the true nature of masculine and feminine energy is a universal law. If you remove the language to describe and interact with this law then you remove this construct from the collective consciousness and create an entire generation of people disconnected from one of the defining principles of our reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s some serious dark energy behind this neutralization of gender, and although it appears well intentioned on the surface it is in fact is much more sinister in intention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah but it&#39;ll never work..there&#39;s an inherent problem with this approach.  when you fuck with the giver/receiver balance the givers/providers tend to dry up or monoculture by conformity pressure from the dominance dynamic (which is driven by the dominant receiver side of this duality).  it&#39;s a predictable, repeatable phenomena.  lacking in providers to support the receiver, or lacking in a variety of providers to support the receiver, starves or retards the receiver.   simple as that.  </p>

<p>so this play, which i agree is in play, won&#39;t really work, and will kill everyone or backfire into a monoculture/hive mind.  really stupid.  avoidance of duality systems is what saves us from this.  that means use phi not hierarchy.  the failures of hierarchy are always the same, and we&#39;ve had plenty of examples to use to see how this happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe not long term, but I would argue there is an entire gender neutral generation that is being brought up right now. </p>

<p>Even when I was a kid everything was about female empowerment. There was no take your son to work days for me, and I wasn&#39;t allowed to attend the female only leadership programs. It&#39;s far worse now for the next generations, where masculine energy is viewed as a negative, evil, or bad thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately what the op is describing I&#39;ve already begun to witness in the Bay Area. It&#39;s happening.  </p>
