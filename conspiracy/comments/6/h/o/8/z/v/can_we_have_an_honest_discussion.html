       What is it really that you want this sub to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the golden age of Conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't we spend less time poisoning wells, back biting, shill calling, and whining?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen the upvotes on the front page now, we are lucky to have ones over 1k anymore. (maybe the mods could weigh in on that one, maybe it is constant downvotes and upvotes. I don't know). It seems like the sub is slowly starting to shred itself by the seams because we can't agree on what conspiracy theory is important or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought of a possible idea, but it might not work. Has Conspiracy tried [serious] tags?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could we have open debate threads and then ones focused on digging new information? That way we can discuss and bitch at each other, while allowing the old Greybush members to keep researching and enjoying the sub too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just spitballing, but I'd welcome any additional ideas or thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I feel like I should say that I recognize the names here, and you guys regardless of which conspiracy you're behind, you've always been straight forward with your beliefs and provide good content to debate. Thank you all for being skeptical. :)

       I would like to see a derailing rule come into play, honestly this sub can function perfectly fine with all conspirators if people stopped attacking the topics they don't like, make a rule so mods can remove anyone that is just being an obnoxious arm crosser.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit I'm not innocent, one of the thing's that got me hooked on this sub was the fact it isn't some overly sensitive safe-space for a certain community,  but I also try to intelligently explain my argument or view and provide sources to support my side, I don't just go into a post and say "this is dumb, your dumb, and everyone that agrees with you is dumb" that is the shit mods should be getting out of here.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate I'm not anti-dissent, I actually like playing devils advocate but I am anti-intentional de-railing... that shit needs to get fixed

       My agreement depends on what you consider "attacking". Some would say asking "what's the conspiracy" is derailing. One mod recently said as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree. I think asking someone to clarify the relevance promotes discussion. Many of the topics you see those kinds of posts on are just info dumps or links. If OP isn't willing to provide any context I think it should be fine to call them on it.

       Well when the conspiracy is even vaguely connected or reaching it still is attempting to connect a conspiracy to recent info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes that shit is incredibly low effort though and deserves to be called out. Which it usually is, and it is necessary to show that the content is low effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen some legit post be derailed, and others deservingly put to a stop before it could gain traction because they spread blatantly false or old information.

       Here's an example I saw a few minutes ago:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hk747/gops_defense_of_trump_reaches_new_low_ignorance/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6hk747/gops_defense_of_trump_reaches_new_low_ignorance/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how the entire comment section is basically about people fucking dolphins? Wtf is that? Maybe those people should start their own post about how much they want to fuck dolphins instead of derailing that post?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides dolphin sex, whole view of derailing  is basically people posting about trump and the army of
       <em>
        "but what about Hillary and pizzagate?!?"
       </em>
       users derailing conversation...... or post about Clinton with the waves of
       <em>
        "but she isn't even relevant anymore, so why don't you want to talk about trump"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people in the trump post would rather talk about Clinton, they should go find a Clinton post, there are a ton of them, and if the people in the Clinton post would rather talk about trump, they should go find a trump post, there are a ton of them, again I'm not anti dissent, you can argue the other side in any post but it's obvious when that isn't the intent....

       I 100% agree with this, and I think the mods can do a better job weeding out the propaganda from both sides that don't comment or provide sources in their own post they just post links and twitter comments all day..... I honestly wouldn't mind an automod that can give a designated amount of time to the op to provide either a deeper explanation of why or what they're posting, if they don't get an answer in say idk 1 hour, the post can be auto deletes because it's clear he op doesn't actually give a shit

       Oh I'm not innocent either, I've realize that I'm getting easily agitated by obvious bait derailment posts.

       Yeah, this time last year, you wouldn't see the low effort "this post is dumb, you basement dwelling retard" all the time like we do now.

       I wish we used primary sources more than just the MSM news or these random right wing conservative websites that pop up. There is too much propaganda from both the left and the right, and I wish we just focused on primary sources and argue and debate based on just that alone.

       I agree with that, but what would be more apt would be research papers, witness testimonials, and perhaps conversations with professionals in the field we are discussing.

       Kinda like askhistorians but for us skeptical loonies, but I just can't see a way to get us together for something like that.

       Yea I have used my jstor account to assist OP's in the past, and I believe most university students should have access, I'll actually try to do this more now.... or maybe over at /conspiracy2 because published articles won't be of much help with he current political discussions

       I think that notions of banning certain sources and topics need to be stopped. If a source or topic is trash, let the Downvotes and comments reflect that. MSM, Alt media, /pol trickeration, it's all fair game. Obviously I'd like the quality of sources to be better, less absurdly misleading headlines, but if we inch toward censorship territory, we're done.

       people just post verifiable fake facts a lot of the time and not getting punished for it

       I wouldn't mind tags if they aren't used to exclude conspiracy related current news articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally that is because the propaganda is my primary target and is one of the key components in the conspiracy against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not mean we have to accept click bait outrage partisan political attacks even though that is an important part of the propaganda, and what fills some so called news feeds, like AOL, yahoo, dredge report etc.
