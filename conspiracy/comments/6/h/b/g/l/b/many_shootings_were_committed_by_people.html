<p>Hours before he opened fire at the Florida State University library, lawyer Myron May left a desperate voicemail for an acquaintance with this plea: &quot;I do not want to die in vain.&quot;</p>

<p>The message was part of a flurry of emails, texts and phone calls in which the former prosecutor laid bare his torment: He believed government &quot;stalkers&quot; were harassing him and using a &quot;direct energy weapon&quot; to hurt him. He said that he had sent packages to 10 people that would &quot;expose&quot; what he thought was happening to him. </p>

An Uber driver charged with fatally shooting six people in western Michigan told police that the ride-sharing company’s app takes over “your whole body” and forced him to go on a killing spree that also left two wounded. Dalton described the devil figure as a horned cow head … and then it would give you an assignment and it would literally take over your whole body.”</p>

<p>Am I missing any examples? There seems to be a pattern here. </p>

<p>Have you ever heard of the &quot;audio spotlight?&quot; It is an ultrasound device that can direct ultrasound, focused in a beam, that can be heard only when the beam is directed at you. To everyone else, it is silent. This is already being used in grocery stores for advertising: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HGln6ooGyg</a></p>

<p>“Dalton told us that literally, when he logged onto [Uber’s app], it started making him be like a puppet,” the police documents said.</p>

<p>He claimed that the devil head “would give you an assignment, and it would literally take over your whole body.” <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/03/14/killer-driver-told-cops-he-was-possessed-by-devil-through-uber/">http://nypost.com/2016/03/14/killer-driver-told-cops-he-was-possessed-by-devil-through-uber/</a></p>

<p>“When I stepped in, I felt compelled by a higher power,” Hammer told the Orange County Register. “Honestly, have you ever been grabbed by the Lord in a way you never thought you would or you could?

<p>&quot;Police in Richland Township, Pa. say a 26-year-old man killed his grandmother while she ate breakfast, then claimed the Archangel Michael told him to do it.&quot; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/levi-daniel-staver-stabs-grandma-archangel-michael_n_2726958.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/levi-daniel-staver-stabs-grandma-archangel-michael_n_2726958.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;The boy was found not guilty of murder and wounding with intent to murder due to a troubled mental state that led him to embrace Satanism. The court was told the boy had notebooks full of &quot;meditations&quot; on the afterlife and had – on at least three separate occasions – heard what he thought to be the devil&#39;s voice.&quot; <a href="http://www.oddee.com/item_99134.aspx">http://www.oddee.com/item_99134.aspx</a></p>

<p>&quot;On Monday, 27-year-old Ayanie Hasan Ali casually strolled into a recruiting center in Toronto and began stabbing two members of the Canadian military while shouting “&quot;Allah told me to do this, Allah told me to come here and kill people.” Ali is a Muslim and a citizen of Canada.

<p>&quot;However, The Root reports that Williams was a non-practicing Jehovah’s Witness at the time of his death.

<p>&quot;A woman who allegedly stabbed her husband said she did it after, “Jesus and Mary told me to kill him because he is Satan’s spawn!” according to a police report.&quot; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/tammi-estep-stabbing-south-carolina_n_2130765.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/14/tammi-estep-stabbing-south-carolina_n_2130765.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;She allegedly added, however, that “Jesus” had told her to drown her son. Police also say she claimed that her son had &#39;become stuck to the ground&#39;.&quot; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/victoria-soliz-drowns-son-puddle-jesus_n_2875605.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/victoria-soliz-drowns-son-puddle-jesus_n_2875605.html</a></p>

<p>&quot;(RNS) A New Jersey man who claimed God made him kill his pregnant girlfriend will get a new trial because jurors deciding his case should have been allowed to hear special instructions about an insanity defense, an appellate panel has ruled.&quot; <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/news/2011/03/man-who-says-god-told-him-to-k.php#Ct7GS9KWTvCuBSx5.99">http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/news/2011/03/man-who-says-god-told-him-to-k.php#Ct7GS9KWTvCuBSx5.99</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can really only speculate. We know some of the goals of MKUltra though and they included things like: Can we seize a person and in the course of an hour get him to crash a plane? Can we get an individual to do things that go against all his innate morals and sensibilities and even survival instincts? Can we make killers who will not remember they killed? etc, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Again, when we look at past MKUltra experiments, they didn&#39;t select enemies of the state, except arguably when they gave prisoners like Whitey Bulger shorter sentences for &quot;volunteering.&quot; Most of the victims were just innocent civilians- college kids (The Unabomber at Harvard), people who checked into psych wards for things as innocuous as depression, johns visiting prostitutes, children, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am certain that the grocery store end cap video kiosks that play pitches for products have an underlying attractive frequency.</p>

<p>I know that I cannot be near one without the urge to turn it down - and my hearing is not even perfect. The other day, it was a looping video about Fabreeze® at Walmart®.</p>

<p>Originally noticed it at Sears, where they had a Bob Vila video playing in the tool department about some gizmo. I was compelled to turn it down - which brought several employees to see what happened. I was still in the immediate area and simply stated, &quot;I can&#39;t stand that guy...&quot; They shrugged in agreement and di dnot turn it back on. The subsequent times I went in, I always had to turn it off. I do the same thing with self checkout and gas pump ads. There is usually a volume control and I use it.</p>

<p>There is more there than the commercials. It&#39;s mind marketing and they know how to use it.</p>
