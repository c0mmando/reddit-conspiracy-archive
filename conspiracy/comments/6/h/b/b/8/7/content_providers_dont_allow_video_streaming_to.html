Even though you may be a paying customer and have to login to watch the video, if they detect that you are coming from a server outside the US, or can tell otherwise that you are using a VPN, they block you from watching.<br/>
I have had this experience on Netflix and Amazon Prime.<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to boycott......  I have tried to play by the rules, but they keep changing and not in our favor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They suck in lots of ways but it&#39;s really not netflix and cable provider&#39; fault. They sign a deal with production company X to distribute in market Y. Only way they can honor their contract is to make sure IPs are legit. If they can tell a user is re-routing then they block it. Alternative is waiting for Sony to hire some chinese kids to VPN into the US market and then sue Netflix out of business.</p>

<p>All goes back to government colluding with production companies and publishers to create a ridiculously onerous IP landscape.</p>

<p>A very common issue!</p>

<p>It is absurd that in this day in age they still think they can prevent people from exchanging numbers. Please, cancel your Netflix subscription, and be welcome to the world of torrent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but making sure the torrent client is fully protected by the VPN can be tricky it seems.  I set it all up according to their instructions, and I have to trust that it&#39;s working, but I read at least one post by someone who had done that and still got the dreaded letter from their ISP.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that they base it off of the IP you are coming from rather than the type of traffic. In this case, they see you are originating from a PIA IP address, and so they block you because it&#39;s a well known way of getting around their restrictions.</p>

<p>I live overseas, and have a VPN running on a friend&#39;s home network in the states, and I have had zero issues streaming from Netflix, Hulu, or HBO.</p>

<p>disclaimer: this is based off of assumptions from my experience of how they are filtering, not actual knowledge of how they filter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, good point, and I believe you are correct.  It&#39;s just one drawback of trying to protect yourself in cyberspace I guess.  I get a little tired of all the corporate attempts to restrict and control, in the name of the almighty dollar.  </p>
