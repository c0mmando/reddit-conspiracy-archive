       Is anyone else getting suspicious of the big content providers who won't allow you to watch a video if you are using a VPN such as PIA?  Even though you may be a paying customer and have to login to watch the video, if they detect that you are coming from a server outside the US, or can tell otherwise that you are using a VPN, they block you from watching.
       <br/>
       I have had this experience on Netflix and Amazon Prime.
       <br/>
       Maybe it's time to boycott......  I have tried to play by the rules, but they keep changing and not in our favor.

       They suck in lots of ways but it's really not netflix and cable provider' fault. They sign a deal with production company X to distribute in market Y. Only way they can honor their contract is to make sure IPs are legit. If they can tell a user is re-routing then they block it. Alternative is waiting for Sony to hire some chinese kids to VPN into the US market and then sue Netflix out of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       All goes back to government colluding with production companies and publishers to create a ridiculously onerous IP landscape.

       OP, they are trying to perpetuate the absurd model of zone/region repartitions; see this as the successor to
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code">
        DVD region codes
       </a>
       (and PAL/SECAM/NTSC before it).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is absurd that in this day in age they still think they can prevent people from exchanging numbers. Please, cancel your Netflix subscription, and be welcome to the world of torrent.

       It's purely content licensing related. Most of the contracts are old and will remain the same way. Plus content owners are moron.

       Yeah, but making sure the torrent client is fully protected by the VPN can be tricky it seems.  I set it all up according to their instructions, and I have to trust that it's working, but I read at least one post by someone who had done that and still got the dreaded letter from their ISP.

       I believe that they base it off of the IP you are coming from rather than the type of traffic. In this case, they see you are originating from a PIA IP address, and so they block you because it's a well known way of getting around their restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live overseas, and have a VPN running on a friend's home network in the states, and I have had zero issues streaming from Netflix, Hulu, or HBO.
      </p>
      <p>
       disclaimer: this is based off of assumptions from my experience of how they are filtering, not actual knowledge of how they filter.

       Yeah, good point, and I believe you are correct.  It's just one drawback of trying to protect yourself in cyberspace I guess.  I get a little tired of all the corporate attempts to restrict and control, in the name of the almighty dollar.
