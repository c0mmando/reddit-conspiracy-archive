       <strong>
        The Trigger
       </strong>
       You may have noticed a post on r/all calling conspiracy out as T_D 2.0. This was triggered by a r/Conspiracy moderator's comment calling for non-partisanship. This statement confirmed that the intention of this sub is not to fall in line with the likes of r/Politics, r/WorldNews in their astroturfed bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Team One (T1)
       </strong>
       The people we see regularly bumping each other to the top of contentious threads in this sub, only to discredit and mock content and those interested in sharing their opinions. T1 forces the topic at hand to be sidelined, which ensures the real conversation slides and can only be seen by a 'controversial' sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Team Two (T2)
       </strong>
       Work to spread disinformation throughout Reddit about r/Conspiracy being r/The_Donald lite. They recognise that conspiracists in this sub are not discouraged by downvotes, as downvotes often reinforce suspicions. The aim is to discredit this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Conflict
       </strong>
       T2 are sharing posts as examples of a supposed r/Conspiracy pro-Trump bias, but T1 have already 'worked' these threads so top level comments are anti-Trump and generally condescending.
      </p>
      <p>
       This causes a huge conflict in their intended narrative. 
T1: r/Conspiracy has an anti-Trump bias.
T2: r/Conspiracy is T_D 2.0.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can't be both, and if it is, surely it disproves both options and indicates a balanced view across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't already have me tagged as 'The Donald' on RES, I'll save you the trouble of checking my post history. I post in r/Conspiracy AND r/The_Donald and fully anticipate general derision and dismissal as it's a primary shut-down tool used by both teams.

       There is no fucking "team." Only people who don't agree with this bullshit. To most outside observers and those who have been here in and out throughout the years know this place has been making a long slide into batshit xenophbia and anger.

       Gas lighting is there though, talking about Pizzagate and the Seth Rich murder aren't talking about Trump, it's talking and making a point of government corruption. Political pedophila isn't monopolized by the Democratic Party see Lawrence King, George Bush Sr, Boystown, and the Call Boy Scandal. These issue can and should be talked about, yet ShareBlue who works for that VERY SAME government won't bring it up because that works against their and their bosses interest. So instead it's a pro Trump conspiracy when it shouldn't be.

       t_D regularly fills up the entire front page of this sub whenever they need to deflect from a major Trump story.  They filled up the entire front page with Seth Rich for days.  This very post is from a centipede young account that has more comments to t_D than all other subs combined.  There's two of these centipede posts on the front page right now.  There's at least one per day lately.

       Seth Rich isn't an interest specific to Trump supporters. People across the spectrum have an interest in the suspicious circumstances surrounding his murder.

       With regard to your comment on my "centipede young account", not sure what point you're trying to make (if any). I've already confirmed to all that I post in r/The_Donald, so it can't be to unveil me! I haven't reviewed your post history as it's irrelevant. This sub isn't restricted to users of a specific political persuasion, and people would do well to keep this in mind.

       Perhaps because mainstream media has an aversion to reporting on Seth Rich. It belongs perfectly well in r/Conspiracy until they acknowledge it, regardless of who posts.

       What narrative am I pushing that's upsetting you? Or is it confirmation that there are people here with opinions you disagree with?

       Most of the Seth Rich posts here are filled with outright disinformation, lies, and pictures of 4chan posts. The only recent "new developments" were the lies from Wheeler and Fox News that had to be walked back immediately.

       People aren't trying to discuss the merits of the Seth Rich conspiracy, they have been spamming bullshit posts filled with suspect sources and outright disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the Seth Rich conspiracy and the Trump/Russian conspiracy have been heavily politicized, and since this sub has a bunch of T_D posters in it, both conspiracies are being pushed/squashed from a right-wing perspective in this sub, often using disingenuous tactics.

       That was an example of what you are decrying, yes. I believe you may be taking a leap in logic, and that perhaps you are lumping all posts that even discuss these topics, whether they have merit or not, into the same category as the post you just linked, without vetting those posts for credibility or not. I could be wrong, but that is just how I see it, based on the tone and attitude you are conveying. If I am right, you ought to take a step back and look at why you are even here in the first place. If I am wrong, then at the very least you could be more respectful to your fellow man and realize that there are some people posting here that legitimately want to know the truth about these subjects to the best of their abilities. It isn't all pro-trump, right wing spam, and you really paint your comments as if it is, which is in and of itself misinforming and obfuscating. It detracts from constructive conversation, which people around here don't tend to like.

       You honestly think it's that strange that people are defending the President?  Especially considering how recently and how contentiously he was elected?  Why is that a bad thing?  If people agree with him, why wouldn't they defend him?  I fail to see how this would be a problem for you or this sub.  If you don't want people defending the President, then stop posting attacks against him.

         I think you missed something in your analysis. The amount of trump defending/anti-dem posts on the front page isn't the same as comments being critical of trump or his admin. The suggestion here being vote manipulation (bots/brigading).

       <li>
        <p>
         The perceived reaction by mods who flair popular posts critical of trump and/or removal of such posts which has happened. Add into that a recent sticky in a thread that was a trump tweet.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And lastly, the idea that being critical of trump is somehow bad when he is the president and the insinuation that we should bow to those in power and not criticize them any longer. He is part of the wealthy elite and only has his own best interest in minds. He is a smooth talking liar who has filled the swamp when people voted for him because he claimed he would 'drain it' (which was just a meme he made up with no real plans on what he would do).

       Why don't people see the overlap of trump supporters and conspiracy theorists? Obviously conspiracy theorists are going to favor the conspiracy theorist sitting in office. If you are more fed up with the government than ever before there's a good chance you would vote for the only guy trying to shake things up.

       And yet so few people voted for Jill Stein. Mostly because she's batshit crazy.

       There is definitely a Hegelian Dialectic going on in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       . By painting us as the t_d2.0 they can delegitimize what this sub stands for and hijack what it believes. There is also a post claiming we are pro government, this is opposite of what I believe as I'm anti-government and have the belief that although you do have the genuinely good senators and congressman or woman (Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Kucinich, Bernie Sanders, etc) these people are the exception and the rule usually goes to the sociopaths and thugs (Bush, Clinton, Obama, Reagan, Nixon, etc) and that will continue from now till forever until politics and business don't mingle. Government has been and will continue to be a vehicle for the wealthy and powerful and that "democratic monopoly" or "monarchy" will continue until you can decentralize it by asking for individual liberties and freedoms.

       There's tons of overlap of Trump fans and conspiracy types.  The pro-Trump accounts don't go out of their way to smear r/conspiracy as an echo chamber, they don't upvote pro-MSM viewpoints, they don't in general insult us as crazies, they don't botnet with completely skewed downvotes/upvotes to slide discussions.  The ShareBlue/leftist accounts most
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       do.  This is far stronger and more empirical evidence that the sub is being pushed hard to agree with MSM/establishment-approved groupthink a'la r/politics or r/worldnews

       Maybe it's because 60% of the population doesn't like Trump and people who have been posting here a long time clearly see that Trump supporters have taken over this place and constantly play the victim when we don't buy all their bullshit without question.

       Most of the regulars here are familiar with the normal mumerical upvote/down vote range on r/conspiracy. If a pro establishment post or comment is upvoted through the roof here, it has been gamed. As well as if an anti-establishment comment or post has been downvoted through the floor, it has been gamed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The harder these people try to influence the critical minds that dwell here, the more they drag their own asses into the light of day and expose their contrived and fraudulent nature.

       Believe it or not, it's a good sign. We have been hitting very close to home on some very dark and corrupt people and organizations here lately...and now they feel the need to try and compromise what we do here. r/conspiracy is

       Remember this though.. they know that we know that they know that we know what they're doing. The obvious tactics that we can see right through are for the masses, yes. However, because they know that
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       know, I'm positive they have special mind control plans for us that is harder to see through. It's always reverse psychology with them. They know what they're doing.. and they know what
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       are doing. This is why data collection is so important to them.

       Political provocateurs,  both pro-Trump and anti-Trump have overrun this sub and created a more hostile culture than  what used to be here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the run-up to the last election people here could be of one political leaning or another and, despite those differences, would focus more on conspiracy theories and ideas upon which they could agree, or at least debate respectfully that which they may not agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this sub is a much more divided and contentious place where people focus  much more on disagreement, attack, and division. The longtime regulars and those who have any degree of history here tend to not buy into the illusions of our governemnt and society that is presented to people by the MSM. The false reality of our politics and society is something they woke up to and saw through a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today there is a large influx of new users and groups, on both sides of the left/right, GOP/DNC, liberal/conservative who are much more partisan and tribal and much less woke and aware of the larger picture than before. These groups are still invested in the division and tribal worldview that they have been indoctrinated into over the course of their entire lives. These groups, and their divisions, are played out in the brigaded upvoting and downvoting in the comment sections, and because they are numerically significant, play a much larger part in the content of the front page these days. They have brought their views and their fighting into
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and in my opinion it is going to take some time for them to research conspiracy topics outside of their personal political agendas so they can be truly "awake" to the larger illusion of the political and social realities of our our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       When current conspiracy works it's way into the mainstream I  think what we are seeing play out in this sub right now is somewhat inevitable and unavoidable. The influx of active new users is going to somewhat overtake the prior tone and culture of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that these new users stay here, to me, is a good thing. This sub needed an infusion of new users, and my hope is that the longer they stay here and participate the more aware and awake they become as they research and look into all the other, less politicized and partisan conspiracy topics that pierce through our current fabricated reality.

       Nah, I think the "new users" are mostly fabricated to start arguments. I think that real people who aren't paid to go on reddit, myself included, don't really post all that much. That's just me though, take it for whatever.

       Without mentioning them i'll ask people to cast their mind to the topics that people are now afraid to get going on here because they'll be labelled "pro-Trump". Now think back to the revelations of last fall and remember exactly how non-partisan our outrage was. This division is fake. we still know who we are.

       Similar in vein t_d claims 6 million subs, yet they have success rates of sub 1% when every one of their actions are outside of the reddit. Such as

       There's a ton of overlap between conspiracy theorists and Trump supporters. It's really not that complex of an idea.

      <p>
       Also, the 6 million number came from reddits own advertiser site. They didn't make that up. Reddit did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Touching on the overlap again, why would people that are largely anti-establishment put their name and info on a White House petition about a conspiracy theory? Maybe check the comments where those petitions have been posted. The majority will say "fuck that, I'm not putting my name on that".

       The only ones working against each other is us. Stop believing this BS about TPTB being at odds with themselves and start planning for the possibility they aren't.

       Get people out there to understand what the fuck's going on in the world and let's stop tapping ourselves in the back cause we haven't earned it yet.

       Perhaps because mainstream media has an aversion to reporting on Seth Rich. It belongs perfectly well in r/Conspiracy until they acknowledge it, regardless of who posts.

       What narrative am I pushing that's upsetting you? Or is it confirmation that there are people here with opinions you disagree with?

       I'm happy to acknowledge this, but this isn't a safe space. It's what stops this sub becoming an echo chamber.

       Maybe it's because 60% of the population doesn't like Trump and people who have been posting here a long time clearly see that Trump supporters have taken over this place and constantly play the victim when we don't buy all their bullshit without question.
