I highly recommend you guys watch &quot;The Social Network (2010), which chronicles how he stole the idea from the Winklevoss&#39;s, and cut his BEST FRIEND (Eduardo Saverin) out of the deal and screwed him out of a percentage of the profits. </p>

<p>Also, when confronted on security concerns regarding FB, watch how weird he gets, and how he starts sweating. He has to take his hoodie off and wipe his face in front of a massive audience and seems to be having a mini panic attack on stage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>SOME local tech meetups in your area might have talented people willing to do these kinds of ventures. You can find them through incubators and such. I say some because I have used them for recruiting for my day job and honestly it&#39;s not easy. They are also full of the &quot;idea&quot; people looking to pitch, people &quot;in the field&quot; but not technical at all, or VERY green developers fresh out of a bootcamp looking for guidance. None of which you probably want involved in the earliest stages.</p>

<p>I am assuming you don&#39;t have capital to fund a serious consulting firm to build out a POC for you? If you do that&#39;s probably the better route. There are also internet freelancers on many sites who you can get results from on the cheap if you are patient and know how to document. That can be a crapshoot too though, and there are often language, timezone and cultural barriers.</p>

<p>In either case, take my advice above. A template for a non-disclosure agreement in MS Word or something costs you nothing on the internet but may save you the entire proceeds from your idea ;) Don&#39;t show up somewhere and pitch your idea to a bunch of developers without wearing protection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately without knowing what kind of idea it is it&#39;s hard to give a ballpark of hours involved. I have seen multi-million dollar ideas (but simple ones) have POCs good enough for investors in under 200 hours. I have also seen terrible ideas take thousands of hours to even get a working prototype. The larger more professional groups are going to have lots of overhead padding their dev hours for PMs, QA, etc and can be easily $200+/h, sometimes much more.   On the other hand you might be able to find some decent freelancers who will work for 100-150.</p>

<p>Again its all imaginary because the technical complexity is going to determine a lot.</p>

<p>No shit, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy to come up with a good idea.

<p>Having been around people who thought this was true, I can promise you it&#39;s not. Any idiot can learn the basics of programming, but it takes talent and experience to put it to good use. Especially when it comes to inventing something new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a joke. My point is it&#39;s easier to go through a curriculum then to be creative. Creativity requires unknown factors, curricula are laid out and followed in a straight path, often provided by others. Innovation/ingenuity/creativity, etc cannot really be taught--at least not to the extent of &#39;writing code&#39; etc. I am not saying anyone can do it, I&#39;m saying it is easier--which you agree with based on your comment that &#39;not everyone can come up with amazing dishes&#39;, which is what I am saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent quite a few years in the industry. I can tell you there&#39;s a lot more people with great ideas, than people with great programming skills. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easier to come up with great ideas, but based on the sheer volume of good ideas that never see the light of day, I&#39;m inclined to believe it. </p>

<p>Think of it as a movie script. I bet a lot of people can come up with a great movie script. But how many people can take that script and make a great movie?</p>

<p>Ideas are thrown around left and right. There&#39;s nothing that tanks a job interview faster than someone describing themselves as &quot;an idea-man&quot;. I&#39;ve even come across people who seem to think that since they&#39;ve brought an idea to the table, they&#39;re equal partners, without doing further work. That&#39;s just not how the world works. Ideas are great to have, but everyone has them. It&#39;s all about execution. </p>

But there was no sense that I shouldn’t be there, because that was–well, actually, in a funny way, it’s just like in markets–that if I weren’t there–of course, I wasn’t doing it, but somebody else would–would–would be taking it away anyhow. And it was the–whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away. So the–I had no role in taking away that property. So I had no sense of guilt.</p>

<p>Bend over... really? They gave him a job. He wasn&#39;t being asked to bend over at all. He saw a chance to grab the idea and take it for himself.</p>

<p>You can see this whatever way you like. But I see this as something a thief would do. This leads back to the point I was trying to make in my first comment. Most rich people either inherit their wealth, or get it by ruthlessly fucking other people over.</p>

<p>Wealth is power, and power is never innocent.</p>

<p>The thing that really surprises me is how so many people (who aren&#39;t rich and never will be) are ready to be cheerleaders for rich people. </p>

I personally think Zuckerberg is an asshole, but at the same time, I don&#39;t think hes a terrible guy because he stole an idea. We all steal ideas, whether they are jokes, inventions, or something to do that weekend. Part of sharing information, is that the information you share is.. well, shared. If you are stupid enough(sorry, harvard?!?) to tell someone a great idea, when they have the technical know-how to create it - <em>without</em> getting a contract written up.. Well.. tough shit if that person steals your idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, let me tell you about the time I met JFK. See, even though I&#39;m not quite 30, back when I was an engineering undergrad at MFPP (MIT For Poor People) myself and a colleague successfully built a time machine. While this may seem like a tall tale, I assure you it is undoubtedly perfidious. We knew we could use the machine, but once, then it must be destroyed. Without question we chose to visit JFK right before his assassination in an attempt to find out if you, <a href="/u/wh40k_Junkie">/u/wh40k_Junkie</a> were indeed correct in your generalized statement that all alumni of Harvard are dicks unless you&#39;ve met them personally, at which point you can then attest  to the contrary.</p>

<p>As it turns out, JFK was the nicest person I had ever met and in turn for our achievement which he was quite impressed with, he gave us the knowledge that he was killed for. Unfortunately though, after destroying the time machine the knowledge died with it and I have no memory of what it was he told myself and my colleague. I do recall that he was a very kind and generous man though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, companies name is In-Q-Tel, not Quest. </p>

<p>From Corbett article:</p>

<p>&quot;Two of the names that come up most often in connection with In-Q-Tel, however, need no introduction: Google and Facebook.</p>

<p>The publicly available record on the Facebook/In-Q-Tel connection is tenuous. Facebook received $12.7 million in venture capital from Accel, whose manager, James Breyer, now sits on their board. He was formerly the chairman of the National Venture Capital Association, whose board included Gilman Louie, then the CEO of In-Q-Tel. The connection is indirect, but the suggestion of CIA involvement with Facebook, however tangential, is disturbing in the light of Facebook’s history of violating the privacy of its users.</p>

<p>Google’s connection to In-Q-Tel is more straightforward, if officially denied. In 2006, ex-CIA officer Robert David Steele told Homeland Security Today that Google “has been taking money and direction for elements of the US Intelligence Community, including the Office of Research and Development at the Central Intelligence Agency, In-Q-Tel, and in all probability, both the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Army’s Intelligence and Security Command.” Later that year, a blogger claimed that an official Google spokesman had denied the claims, but no official press statement was released.</p>

<p>Steele’s accusation is not the only suggestion of American intelligence involvement with Google, however.</p>

<p>In 2005, In-Q-Tel sold over 5,000 shares of Google stock. The shares are widely presumed to have come from In-Q-Tel’s investment in Keyhole Inc., which was subsequently bought out by Google, but this is uncertain.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, Peter Thiel&#39;s first 500k to facebook <em>allegedly</em> came from CIA, as Thiel owned Palantir which also <em>allegedly</em> run algorithms for CIA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn. The Facebook connection is definitely thin, but that&#39;s not to say it couldn&#39;t be. I&#39;d be surprised if the CIA <em>didn&#39;t</em> have some form of connection/control, especially at this point. It&#39;s practically a wet dream for them. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember if I&#39;m remembering the details correctly, but in the book <em>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</em> Perkins talks about sitting down with the head of a giant tech company and that it was very clear to him that they were working with the IC. I could be very wrong about that though. I remember the passage in the book where he talks about the meeting he has, but can&#39;t remember who the person/company was.</p>

<p>And on a completely unrelated note, Palantir just sounds like an evil dystopian company. Like Monsanto, the name itself just sounds and looks evil.</p>

<p>The Torah teaches us to lie if it means saving life and property. Abraham lied to Pharaoh to keep from being put to death. Actually, the Torah condemns crooked business deals. It teaches us to be good persons and to treat people with respect. That&#39;s why the Chosenites turned on the Torah and they observe the Talmud instead. It&#39;s good for business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair Myspace was once far better than Facebook and now Facebook seems to be going the way of Myspace.  Over time Myspace became overrun by spam and scams, and the site owners didn&#39;t do enough to stop it.  This will happen to every major social network once they gain prominence.  It happened to Digg, it&#39;s happening to Reddit, and it&#39;s happening to Facebook.  Facebook is being overrun with scam artists, blatant spam, and fake news articles.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Reddit or Facebook will be replaced though as both of these came into prominence after the internet became mainstream among all age groups.  The internet was a very different beast in the days of Digg and Myspace.  Those were the days before smartphones when people seemed more willing to explore new platforms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither of the two groups would have come up with what thefacebook.com was.  Zuck was a narcissistic geek who liked to dox fellow students for fun. The Wilkelvi were narcissistic jocks who liked to do whatever they wanted to given their talents and physical gifts.  </p>

<p>Zuck used his fellow geeks to create something cool given the Winkelvi key ingredient - exclusivity</p>

<p>Winkelvi could have hired programmers from India (one of their partners was Divya Narendra) and paid for a site that would have been called harvardconnection.com.  That wasn&#39;t a &quot;dating site&quot; or anything like myspace or what facebook became. </p>

<p>The other thing Zuck did was create that relationship status, which the twins never would have done on their elitist harvardx site.</p>

<p>Then Zuck got lucky as hell by going to silicon valley fast. That was key.  The twins NEVER would have done that. Nope.</p>

<p>If they played nice, we would have had Zuck with his stupid doxing and dentist sites. He probably would have gone on to work for google or something.</p>

<p>And the twins would have had their harvardconnection, which would be like a bad, smaller verision of match.com eventually connecting elitists with eachother.</p>

<p>So my thing is Zuck is a tool and a jerk for not throwing the twins team like 5% of the startup.  But who knows, maybe they were duchebags to him too and he just had a passion for fucking them over at the end which he did.</p>

<p>Fix our infrastructure, streamline the various agencies, construct a government that is meant to work instead of just appearing as if it does; that sounds more like a job for an engineer more than a lawyer or businessman.</p>

<p>Most engineers I know too openly admit they are very good at what they do but not as scholastically endowed in other fields meaning we may get someone who isn&#39;t an ego maniac in that position for once.</p>

<p>Quantifying improvement in a clear and not intentionally misleading way would probably cause some people to revolt when they see real numbers imo. Some of my domestic favorites are &quot;real cost of healthcare vs quality around the world&quot;, real US for profit prison stats, and &quot;real employment&quot; as in part time and contract jobs are their own category instead of just counting as a check in the yes column.</p>

<p>If my company has me working on a new product and I come out with a different one based on the same concept at the same time..I stole their idea.</p>

<p>Mark originally was not going to lose a lawsuit for this. Until AIM messaged were found proving he knowingly fucked these guys over. </p>

<p>Also, for those who actually use Facebook.  You should know that Mark Zuckerberg also thinks anyone who would use facebook is an idiot. According to his AIM messages when his friend asked something like &quot;why would someone willingly give you all their info and pictures?&quot; He said because people are stupid.</p>

I was in University in the early 2000s and the only reason me or anyone I knew was comfortable putting crap on there was that it was basically just shared with the people around us. That was enough of a base for everyone else to want in, I think.</p>
