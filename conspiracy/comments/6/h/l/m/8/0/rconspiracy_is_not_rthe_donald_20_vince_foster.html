    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the testimonies, they&#39;re taking these Russia hacks to the extreme. Passing it off as common knowledge but don&#39;t go into detail about any of that knowledge.

Other than all of this resting in the CrowdStrike docs. I&#39;d really love to read those docs too! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream media was utterly convinced that the public would vote the way they told them to with nothing but glowing words and poll after poll suggesting a major win for Clinton while ridiculing and putting-down Trump and writing off all of his support as nothing but an insignificant collection of lunatic fringe elements at every possible opportunity. </p>

<p>When it didn&#39;t quite work out that way they were angered and indignant, like how dare all those people vote for Trump after everything we said and did to discourage and flatly tell them not to? </p>

<p>So it&#39;s pretty apparent that they desperately want to get even and restore the status quo they thought they had absolute control over except that even fewer people believe them at this point or are paying much attention to them. </p>

<p>What they failed to understand is that the days of print journalism and television news controlling the narrative and being the only source of information is over and has been for some time and slowly but surely the people are beginning to wake-up and see just how that concentration of control over the flow of information has been used against them, time and time again. </p>

<p>The internet and social media and information that goes viral faster than anything can be done to stop it has become the game-changer that has literally done them all in. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily the truth or groundless rumours that spread like a wildfire but the doubts, questions, and individual desires to dig into and scour the web for any kind of information that can tell the people more that they can&#39;t do anything about. </p>

<p>No one has to be satisfied strictly with whatever the government or mainstream media have to say anymore. They are no longer a captive and obedient audience and there&#39;s no turning back. If there are dissenting and opposing voices and points of view they want to know what they are, discuss them with their friends and peers and make-up their own minds about them.</p>

<p>So while the mainstream media said nothing about the contents that Wiki-Leaks revealed or what was revealed in Podesta&#39;s emails the internet was buzzing with nothing but that very information, including the astounding degree to which all the mainstream media was in bed with and onside with the DNC. Their inability to deny or refute the truth of that and efforts to simply malign Wiki-Leaks for daring to reveal it finished off whatever credibility they may have had left, not that it amounted to much at that point.</p>

<p>To what extent does anyone here actually believe that the vast majority of Americans want to see Trump taken down and removed by using ridiculous and exaggerated claims that he is a Russian agent? Or that the Russians had anything to do with the reasons why so many people voted for him, or that perhaps there weren&#39;t so many that voted for him because the Russians somehow managed to rig the entire voting process so that he would win? Of course there&#39;s no evidence of anything besides the six degrees of separation that connect each and every one of us on the planet to each other, including those that were born in Russia.</p>

<p>So the people that have been feeding us a false or misinterpreted narrative all along and don&#39;t know how to do anything else are trying yet again to shove this one down our throats like the bad tasting and poisonous brew that it is and reaffirm that they somehow &quot;know better&quot; when all they know is what is better for them and they don&#39;t give two hoots about anyone or anything else.</p>

<p>Not an argument I was making. You said:</p>

<p>Which is not true. Other presidents (like Obama) have convinced the public they were &quot;actually a change&quot; when, if we look at one important example, he:</p>

<p>approved more than $278bn in foreign arms sales in its eight years, more than double the total of the Bush administration, which approved $128.6bn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s absolutely the point of the post. Don&#39;t be disingenuous. </p>

<p>&quot;Who here believes Trump is really worse than the past?&quot;</p>

<p>What is the point of that statement? To deflect blame from Trump under the cover of &quot;But those guys before were worse!&quot;. Everyone knows they were bad, the only reason to say they&#39;re WORSE is to deflect. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t here to compare his misdeeds to past presidents and figure out who is the worst. We know they&#39;re all corrupt pieces of shit. So why say the people before were worse? What does that add? What is the purpose? So because Bush and Clinton were arguably worse than Trump, we shouldn&#39;t discuss Trump? That seems like the purpose to me. We all know they&#39;re bad, who is worse shouldn&#39;t matter. What should matter is what&#39;s happening now. And Trump is happening now.</p>

<p>Why say that &quot;r/conspiracy isn&#39;t T_D2.0&quot;? Because he wants to defend the pro-Trump postings. There&#39;s no other purpose to that statement, just like people who say &quot;r/conspiracy is T_D2.0&quot; want to attack the pro-trump postings. It&#39;s blatant. </p>

<p>&quot;This sub isn&#39;t T_D 2.0. Look at all the past conspiracies other presidents have done! Do you really think Trump is worse?&quot; What do you consider that statement besides a blatant pro-trump message saying that there&#39;s no need to be anti-Trump in r/conspiracy because he&#39;s &quot;better&quot; than the people before.</p>

<p>OP&#39;s post is a very transparent defense of Trump on the grounds that people before him were worse. There&#39;s no other purpose to this post. Saying otherwise is just disingenuous and partisan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why Trump is worse than the rest:</p>

<p><strong>Trump is a buffoon</strong>; an overconfident, lying, cheating, and stupid old con man, a classic New York City Ass Hole, who thinks he&#39;s better than you, who thinks the rules don&#39;t apply to him, and is superior to anybody else, even though there is no evidence to support that claim.  The result is, he won&#39;t listen to anyone, can never change, and can be easily taken advantage of by the Saudis or Russians or ISIS or anybody who wants to weaken America.  The truth is, the deep state, the press, or anyone who cares about your country, aught to try to bring him down.</p>

<p><strong>Obama was a smart, decent, honorable, naieve, young family man</strong>; but ultimately, not personally powerful enough to get anything great done.  He was able to save the economy from a total collapse, but only by lining the pockets of Wall Street; passed a half-assed healthcare plan, by lining the pockets big insurance; managed to not totally loose the war against Islam, by giving half of Iraq and Syria to ISIS; the list goes on: Israel - more settlements;  N Korea - Nukes; GOP - House&amp;Senate; etc. etc.</p>

<p>Keep Reading?</p>

<p><strong>George W Bush, also a buffoon</strong>, but, surrounded himself with the best and brightest neocons the country has to offer.  He spoke and thought with a simply black &amp; white moral clarity, that some found refreshing.  But the ultimate problem was that the neocon philosophy is naive, aggressive, imperialistic, dangerous, expensive, immoral, and un-achievable.</p>

<p><strong>Clinton was a brilliant but sleazy southern politician.</strong>  He would do or say anything to get by.  He thought of himself as a true social justice warrior (when that didn&#39;t mean what it means today), but did more harm to blacks, women, gays, poor people, working class people, than anybody else.  He just loved being POTUS but didn&#39;t really love anything about the US.  He was as sleazy in his politics as he was in his personal life and had no moral compass to guide his smarts into positive change.</p>

<p>I can do a well-balanced critique of GHWB, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, and Eisenhower but the point is:</p>

<p><strong>Trump is in a whole class of outrageously worse than the rest.  He is dangerously unqualified, not intellectually sound, likely an asset of the Russian Regime (possibly un-wittingly so, but an asset nonetheless), emotionally retarded, and will undoubtedly leave the US in a far diminished situation then when he found it.</strong>   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t believe Trump is worse than the past. I think he&#39;s just as bad. He&#39;s going to continue selling our nation to Israel and Saudi Arabia, he&#39;s going to continue to be involved in wars in the middle east, he&#39;s going to continue allowing police militarization and the erosion of civil liberties, and he&#39;s going to continue the policies of &quot;Make the Government bigger, and the people smaller&quot;</p>

<p>HE IS THE SAME AS THE PAST.</p>

<p>Until he starts to roll back police militarization, CIA/NSA spying capabilities, War on Drugs, and foreign policy intervention, he is the same as all those before him in my eyes.</p>
