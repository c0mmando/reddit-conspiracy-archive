       At this point I don't think he's worse that the past, but he's def controlled by the past. The same power structure that guided dubya is the same waging strategic war in Syria currently. It's almost as if trumps given up on the MIC, and alllow then to run their war games, as they have always done.

       See, this is a resonable response. I might not agree with it, but as of this point I am not convinced either way as to whether Trump can really turn everything around. I just see the obvious Anti-Trump media bias. I see how every network is constantly Anti-Trump. I see no evidence as to why this is occuring.

       It's def hard to gage seeing as he's getting his ass caught in many different spider webs these people are laying for him. Idk it's hard bro, because our system is proving to be broken and corrupt. The mass shootings will only get worse and the media keeps feeding the machine (as if we thought the media would learn their lesson the election). I don't see this lasting 4 years, something is going to give.

       See the problem is when you have an open mind you cant really tell if he is getting caught in spider webs or if they are inventing stuff. There is really a divide like never before, the only thing I am confident in is the media is pushing violence and wants to increase a divide between normal people.

       I mean, I'm sure you've seen the testimonies, they're taking these Russia hacks to the extreme. Passing it off as common knowledge but don't go into detail about any of that knowledge. The one thing I heard in the beginning was that laptop connected to the power grid running Ukrainian software but that has since been dropped as the narrative. Other than all of this resting in the CrowdStrike docs. I'd really love to read those docs too!

       The mainstream media was utterly convinced that the public would vote the way they told them to with nothing but glowing words and poll after poll suggesting a major win for Clinton while ridiculing and putting-down Trump and writing off all of his support as nothing but an insignificant collection of lunatic fringe elements at every possible opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it didn't quite work out that way they were angered and indignant, like how dare all those people vote for Trump after everything we said and did to discourage and flatly tell them not to?
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's pretty apparent that they desperately want to get even and restore the status quo they thought they had absolute control over except that even fewer people believe them at this point or are paying much attention to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they failed to understand is that the days of print journalism and television news controlling the narrative and being the only source of information is over and has been for some time and slowly but surely the people are beginning to wake-up and see just how that concentration of control over the flow of information has been used against them, time and time again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet and social media and information that goes viral faster than anything can be done to stop it has become the game-changer that has literally done them all in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not necessarily the truth or groundless rumours that spread like a wildfire but the doubts, questions, and individual desires to dig into and scour the web for any kind of information that can tell the people more that they can't do anything about.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has to be satisfied strictly with whatever the government or mainstream media have to say anymore. They are no longer a captive and obedient audience and there's no turning back. If there are dissenting and opposing voices and points of view they want to know what they are, discuss them with their friends and peers and make-up their own minds about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while the mainstream media said nothing about the contents that Wiki-Leaks revealed or what was revealed in Podesta's emails the internet was buzzing with nothing but that very information, including the astounding degree to which all the mainstream media was in bed with and onside with the DNC. Their inability to deny or refute the truth of that and efforts to simply malign Wiki-Leaks for daring to reveal it finished off whatever credibility they may have had left, not that it amounted to much at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what extent does anyone here actually believe that the vast majority of Americans want to see Trump taken down and removed by using ridiculous and exaggerated claims that he is a Russian agent? Or that the Russians had anything to do with the reasons why so many people voted for him, or that perhaps there weren't so many that voted for him because the Russians somehow managed to rig the entire voting process so that he would win? Of course there's no evidence of anything besides the six degrees of separation that connect each and every one of us on the planet to each other, including those that were born in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the people that have been feeding us a false or misinterpreted narrative all along and don't know how to do anything else are trying yet again to shove this one down our throats like the bad tasting and poisonous brew that it is and reaffirm that they somehow "know better" when all they know is what is better for them and they don't give two hoots about anyone or anything else.

       Trump acted like a maverick, but he is currently toeing the party line. Nothing he is doing is much different than bush jr's policies. I just hate how everything he does is picked apart when obama was immune to any judgements from the MSM, aside from fox news. You don't have to like trumo to see the bias. I hate being told what to think.

       Trump is worse than the past because his actions and beliefs are no different, while convincing people that he is actually a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       That will give him the freedom to further entrench the status quo - more weapons to the Middle East, more destruction of the environment and our natural resources, more money for the wealthy and the elite and none for the common American.

       Not an argument I was making. You said:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump is worse than the past because his actions and beliefs are no different, while convincing people that he is actually a change.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is not true. Other presidents (like Obama) have convinced the public they were "actually a change" when, if we look at one important example, he:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        approved more than $278bn in foreign arms sales in its eight years, more than double the total of the Bush administration, which approved $128.6bn.

       Funny, the reasons i opposed HRC and the dems
      </p>
      <p>
       They controlled both houses and the Presidency and we got healthcare
       <em>
        INSURANCE

       reform, AKA fucking pay your taxes for these bombs to drop on syrians, oh yeah,at the same time flood every country with labour as automation continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the government brought labour from asia during the construction of the railroad because the then government was concerned about the welfare of immigrants? Immigration isn't such a boon to improving efficiency or for progress on human rights.

       Well, i never supported the republican firesale in the first place. I just hoped to stop it from reaching the dems. Falling into line to prevent a candidate like trump from taking office? A no-no. Couldn't beat the toupee'd cheeto? Thats because of the ineptitude of the weak leadership in the actual dem party

       "Who here believes Trump is really worse than the past?"
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the point of that statement? To deflect blame from Trump under the cover of "But those guys before were worse!". Everyone knows they were bad, the only reason to say they're WORSE is to deflect.
      </p>
      <p>
       We aren't here to compare his misdeeds to past presidents and figure out who is the worst. We know they're all corrupt pieces of shit. So why say the people before were worse? What does that add? What is the purpose? So because Bush and Clinton were arguably worse than Trump, we shouldn't discuss Trump? That seems like the purpose to me. We all know they're bad, who is worse shouldn't matter. What should matter is what's happening now. And Trump is happening now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why say that "r/conspiracy isn't T_D2.0"? Because he wants to defend the pro-Trump postings. There's no other purpose to that statement, just like people who say "r/conspiracy is T_D2.0" want to attack the pro-trump postings. It's blatant.
      </p>
      <p>
       "This sub isn't T_D 2.0. Look at all the past conspiracies other presidents have done! Do you really think Trump is worse?" What do you consider that statement besides a blatant pro-trump message saying that there's no need to be anti-Trump in r/conspiracy because he's "better" than the people before.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP's post is a very transparent defense of Trump on the grounds that people before him were worse. There's no other purpose to this post. Saying otherwise is just disingenuous and partisan.

       Here's why Trump is worse than the rest:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trump is a buffoon
       </strong>
       ; an overconfident, lying, cheating, and stupid old con man, a classic New York City Ass Hole, who thinks he's better than you, who thinks the rules don't apply to him, and is superior to anybody else, even though there is no evidence to support that claim.  The result is, he won't listen to anyone, can never change, and can be easily taken advantage of by the Saudis or Russians or ISIS or anybody who wants to weaken America.  The truth is, the deep state, the press, or anyone who cares about your country, aught to try to bring him down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Obama was a smart, decent, honorable, naieve, young family man
       </strong>
       ; but ultimately, not personally powerful enough to get anything great done.  He was able to save the economy from a total collapse, but only by lining the pockets of Wall Street; passed a half-assed healthcare plan, by lining the pockets big insurance; managed to not totally loose the war against Islam, by giving half of Iraq and Syria to ISIS; the list goes on: Israel - more settlements;  N Korea - Nukes; GOP - House&amp;Senate; etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep Reading?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        George W Bush, also a buffoon
       </strong>
       , but, surrounded himself with the best and brightest neocons the country has to offer.  He spoke and thought with a simply black &amp; white moral clarity, that some found refreshing.  But the ultimate problem was that the neocon philosophy is naive, aggressive, imperialistic, dangerous, expensive, immoral, and un-achievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Clinton was a brilliant but sleazy southern politician.
       </strong>
       He would do or say anything to get by.  He thought of himself as a true social justice warrior (when that didn't mean what it means today), but did more harm to blacks, women, gays, poor people, working class people, than anybody else.  He just loved being POTUS but didn't really love anything about the US.  He was as sleazy in his politics as he was in his personal life and had no moral compass to guide his smarts into positive change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can do a well-balanced critique of GHWB, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, and Eisenhower but the point is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trump is in a whole class of outrageously worse than the rest.  He is dangerously unqualified, not intellectually sound, likely an asset of the Russian Regime (possibly un-wittingly so, but an asset nonetheless), emotionally retarded, and will undoubtedly leave the US in a far diminished situation then when he found it.

       We can't do anything about the past anymore but we can do something against the orange buffoon without social conscious. There is good indication that Trump is involved in conspiracies but this info is surpressed here in favour of delusoional Pizza stories.

       No, I don't believe Trump is worse than the past. I think he's just as bad. He's going to continue selling our nation to Israel and Saudi Arabia, he's going to continue to be involved in wars in the middle east, he's going to continue allowing police militarization and the erosion of civil liberties, and he's going to continue the policies of "Make the Government bigger, and the people smaller"
      </p>
      <p>
       HE IS THE SAME AS THE PAST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until he starts to roll back police militarization, CIA/NSA spying capabilities, War on Drugs, and foreign policy intervention, he is the same as all those before him in my eyes.

       I haven't given up on Trump yet.  Its only been 6 months.  I do not regret voting for him.  I understand there is reason to be concerned, I am too, but I am not ready to 100% turn on the man.  Behind closed doors we have no idea what is actually going on.

       While Trump has yet to prove himself as a President, I think that as of now, the past is still much much worse. Clinton, Bush, and Obama were all ultimately on the same team, which is that of Globalist Deep State.

       Trump is the first President since Kennedy that hasn't been "selected" to be (((their))) guy.
