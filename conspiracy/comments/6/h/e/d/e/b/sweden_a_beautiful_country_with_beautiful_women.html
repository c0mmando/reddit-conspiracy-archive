       better education than the US
better healthcare system than the US
better air and water than the US
better diplomatic relations with other countries than the US
among the happiest countries in the world (along with Norway)
      </p>
      <p>
       meanwhile in the US there were 2 mass shootings yesterday, people in Flint are drinking lead water, and 2/3 of us are obese.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say there are no problems in Sweden, but to say "they're so lost" in that condescending way is simply BS when the rest of the world could say the same about the US

       I was referring to the direction they're going. The stats you reference are from the past. They won't be accurate in the near future because of their boneheaded immigration policy. They're out of touch with reality and it will ruin them.

       odd that you say "from the past" when these things are all still true about Sweden right this second. All of things I mentioned above (education, healthcare, environment, diplomatic relations, happiness index) will remain better than the US, and not just by a tiny bit, even in the future regardless of immigration

       America has certainly been infiltrated.  Many are even happy to abet for personal gain.  May we pray our Jewish brethren and domestic traitors surrender their idols and circumcise their hearts.

       “And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,  and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your good?  Behold, to the Lord your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth with all that is in it.
       <strong>
        Yet the Lord set his heart in love on your fathers and chose their offspring after them, you above all peoples, as you are this day.  Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no longer stubborn.
       </strong>
       For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Remember the days of old;
    consider the generations long past.
Ask your father and he will tell you,
    your elders, and they will explain to you.
       <strong>
        When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
    when he divided all mankind,
he set up boundaries for the peoples
    according to the number of the sons of Israel. 
For the Lord’s portion is his people,
    Jacob his allotted inheritance.
       </strong>

       “Woman,” Jesus replied, “believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.  You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know,
       <strong>
        for salvation is from the Jews.
       </strong>
       Yet a time is coming and
       <strong>
        has now come
       </strong>
       when the
       <strong>
        true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth
       </strong>
       , for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.  God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”

       it's not a matter of 'compassion', it's calling 'a spade a spade'
      </p>
      <p>
       Byy the 1970'2 Sweden was already quite socially advanced compared to the rest of the world ,, which is when it got it's 'reputation' for "swedish women wink wink nudge nudge", however, interestingly it's almost swung the other way now and Swedes are becoming some of
       <em>
        the most
       </em>
       socially confused and uptight country in Europe ... in a way they are 'way ahead' of most other countries ,, except Norway, which isn't quite as 'confused' as Sweden has become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sweden is confused' becoz, "where do they go from here?" ... they tried to be the perfect "equality, libertie et fraternitie' group of people but it's backfired on them in so many ways!
      </p>
      <p>
       shit! there's a whole genre of Swedish films about how confused the people have become, as the ressults of their weallthy laissez faire attitude of "mixing all the colors" has left them with a puddle of brown problems and people that doesn't really fit in, but they've got no ideaa what to do with either!
      </p>
      <p>
       And as it's not like the didn't, Sweden
       <em>
        asked for it
       </em>
       by allowing of these 'new' social standards' to occur without considering the (only slightly, 10-20yrs) longer term inpacts of these choices
      </p>
      <p>
       The were the firsst but they're certainly not the last country to be in this position .. it's going to happen in Germany eventually and I'm not sure how that's going to play out. Even the Dutch are saying 'enough' .. and
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       saying asomething when cruisy ole Netherlander says  "nein!" to letting other people "live and let live" -- coz it seems some of these immigrants are ignorant savages basically, who know nothing else having been raised on radical Islam and weapons training! They fucking scare me tbh, it's not 'their fault' but their parents are no better!
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, eventually we're going to have to have a world without borders, l but it will still have to have rules that are enforced if needed ... but hoperfully the people will have learnt better than to hurt each other in an attempt to profit

       The "no go zone" story is bullshit. Talk to Swedish police. There are no "no go zones".
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the rest, only the FGM stats are disturbing. As these migrants are exposed to Swedish culture, hopefully the rate drops. You don't hear of second-generation parents forcing FGM nearly as much.

       So would areas in the US that are high crime considered no-go zones?  Use logic.  Why the concern about how they run their country vs cleaning up your country first?

       If this were happening in the US you could bet that this post would be at the top of this sub.  The peons here have been brainwashed into believing that there is no reason for a white country to protect its people and preserve its culture; they believe that this would be tantamount to sin because of white guilt.  This has also occured because the marxist jews have been pushing to eradicate all forms of religion and spirituality leaving a void in the soul.  The concept of original sin still permeates every person's being and must be filled.  They have filled it with white guilt.

       You can come here to Norway for help when shit hits the fan swedish brothers and sisters, and together we will reclaim you fatherland and build a nordic union that will last a thousand years:)
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, Norway, Sweden, Denmark(and the Faroese isles) and Iceland should work together in this world. We are all united by language, history and culture, you should say hell no to EU like we in Norway did and join with us instead. We could build a civilization that would be a beacon to mankind.
