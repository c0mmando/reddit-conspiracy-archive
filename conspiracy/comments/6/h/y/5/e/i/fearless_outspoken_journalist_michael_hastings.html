<p>(page 64 of <em>The Operators</em>)</p>

<p>Jake came up to me. &quot;We&#39;ll hunt you down and kill you if we don&#39;t like what you write,&quot; he said. &quot;C. will hunt you down and kill you.&quot;</p>

<p>[note: Jake McFerren is General McChrystal&#39;s top civilian political advisor responsible for helping foster international relations with the 44 coalition countries involved in Afghanistan. Jake was also McChrystal&#39;s West Point roommate and drinking buddy....C. was a member of the SAS, the most elite British commando unit]</p>

<hr/>

<p>(page 88)</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry about threatening to kill you,&quot; Jake said. It was the first time anyone in the group had acknowledged the blowout on Friday night. </p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, geez, the guy is just trying to do his job,&quot; McChrystal said. </p>

<p>&quot;No worries. Like I said, it happens all the time, but yeah, you&#39;re probably the highest rank to do so,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>I laughed, and they didn&#39;t.</p>

<hr/>

<p>FROM r/politics AMA:</p>

<p>Q: Have you ever been warned/threatened by any of the interests whose power your style of reporting threatens to jeopardize?</p>

<p>[â€“]Michael_Hastings[S] M H 7 points 5 years ago </p>

<p>Yes. Every once and awhile, I&#39;ll get a death threat from someone--like, &quot;if we don&#39;t like what you write, we&#39;ll hunt you down and kill you&quot; kind of thing. But there&#39;s a more insidious response most of the time when you piss off the powerful. They come after your career, they try to come after your credibility. They do cocktail party whisper campaigns. They try to make you &quot;controversial.&quot; Sadly, The Powers That Be are often aided by other journalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what Hastings was talking about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q:What do you think propaganda will look like if the ban is lifted?</p>

<p>Michael_Hastings[S]:</p>

<p>Good question re: propaganda. On the one hand, we&#39;re already bombarded with so much government propaganda, it might be hard to notice. But I think we&#39;d definitely see a more direct targeting of certain communities within the U.S. with propaganda that was produced overseas. I think what we&#39;d also see is all sorts of disturbing online and internet initiatives produced by the government. The Pentagon is already trying to do this.</p>
