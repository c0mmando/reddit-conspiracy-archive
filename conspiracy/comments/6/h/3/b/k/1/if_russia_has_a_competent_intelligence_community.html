    <div class="md"><p>Realistically, does Russia care that much about people knowing their corruption, or are they necessarily worried about the rest of the world listening to anything america now has to say? I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be as much as one would think ... cause, they kinda don&#39;t give a shit about much, and with the introduction of &quot;alternative facts&quot;, who knows whats real - so, why bother to listen to what they have to say... you end up down a hole looking for yourself, anyways.</p>

<p>Russia could also be letting the US put themselves in a shit position and will &quot;win&quot; through the art of business deals... a country losing major accounts and trade avenues is good for another country looking for those sorts of opportunities, with enough money on and off the books to make all kinds of things happen. They can become superior in many ways other than bombs... and realistically, with how the US are treating people from other parts of the world, losing these partnerships and agreements is a very real possibility if someone steps in place who doesn&#39;t necessarily follow that same mission statement.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a lot of smart business people don&#39;t even pay attention as to whats going on outside their own doors in regards to the politics of it all. I feel a lot of countries are no different than an office these days. So Russia could be very well keeping an eye, but, letting them do whatever they want, with little regard to it all... as at the end of the day, Putin will have to do what he has to do for the mother to strive one way or the other. Not saying they&#39;re not in the know of everything ... they just might not care. Wasting time worried about a bunch of idiots running around pointing fingers at everyone - paying attention to that does not bring success.</p>

<p>Mostly, I think they&#39;re over it. They&#39;ve been at odds on and off for 100 years+, and seeing the same juvenile behavior gotta be tiring. Whenever you see a retort by Russia in regards to something said by the US, it&#39;s mostly stuff like, &quot;yup, whatever ... bring it on&quot; ... knowing very well, it does no one any good to go down in a blaze of glory.</p>

<p>They&#39;re a weird bunch ... but, they&#39;re probably not so different than me and you. They want comfort and joy in life and no bs. </p>

<p>smells like there is a well-concerted play to out all the bad actors (identifying them by country is too broad a label, btw), and it&#39;s working like clockwork.  it&#39;s not in Russia&#39;s interests, or any other monolithic group really, to inject themselves as global hero.  they get this.  they know we need global agreement.  what&#39;s happening now is just exposure of the old ruling class.  we&#39;ve been warned repeatedly about some of the possible timelines of this, including the gordon michael scallion maps, which i think could represent what happens to the planet by the use of directed energy weapons similar to what took the towers down, but on a much larger scale, should the ruling class fuck off to their dumbs.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Russia had proof of 9/11 being a sham, it would not be in their best interests to simply release that information. This sort of intelligence potentially holds enormous value, but the timing of its release needs to be perfect- America no longer has a free press, and any sloppy, overt attack on the Narrative will either be ignored or discounted in the people&#39;s arena. Beyond that, a shaky release would alienate the most calculating and vicious military apparatus ever assembled: you can bet there would be consequences for any type of brazen, state-approved claims, regardless of if/how they stuck to the news. The situation is intensely complex, but ultimately we are discussing a weapon of war. The Russians may yet have solid evidence about American criminal activity, perhaps even on a large scale, but that evidence, alone, is not enough to gain any sort of power position.</p>
