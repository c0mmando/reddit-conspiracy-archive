       I have been reading up on it and I feel as if the story we are told isn't what happened. I believe he was killed by CIA because of his desire for peace and political change. Wondering what you guys thought happened to him?

       Interesting character..... one of the very symbols of the flower hippie peace movement, yet we've all heard the rumors of his violent fights and abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seemed to be anti-establishment but seen giving the devil horns? Anyone seen the original cover of Yesterday and Today? The Beatles are so weird, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there's the question of Paul's death. Some of Lennon's songs had some intriguing clues.
      </p>
      <p>
       His death is both sad and probably more complicated than what we were told.

       A false flag. Someone got milked for a reason and they used it snuff out the peace and love movement, weed and hallucinogen, and fuel the import of cocaine into the 80's. John Lennon wasn't disco enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disco itself is an import of funk and salsa. On a deeper level the import of coke from Latin American countries and the rise of disco are interconnected. the music industry steers any agenda the shadow government plans.

       But he very openly was against the U.S. government and was going across the country talking about peace and the people taking back the power. It is perfectly feasible the government saw him as a threat to the youth and they wanted to deal with him before he gathered more people to his cause.

       I think there's something not on the public record which is missing--like the Beatles offered support for Muhammad Ali or MLK (maybe even were very outspoken privately regarding Vietnam?).  Info was obtained via CIA which then spread to FBI as well.  Then the Beatles were targeted, smeared and eventually broken up.

       One of the most overrated artists of the 20th century. Harrison and McCartney were much better songwriters. He cultivated an image of the typical peace loving hippie because that's what was cool and hip, but in reality he was a horrible father, an even worse husband, and just an overall intolerable twat.

       He faked his death, he was a British intelligence asset, as was the rest of the Beatles.

       John Lennon was shot in the place he chose as his home (presumably his favourite place in the world)
      </p>
      <p>
       He spent the day with his family (Presumably the people he loved the most)
      </p>
      <p>
       His recently released album, Double Fantasy, had lyrics that explained how he "Had to let it go", as well as a song giving life advice to his "Beautiful Boy".. 
Title's such as "(Just like) Starting over", "Dear Yoko" and "I'm losing you"
Let's not forget about the tracks Yoko contributed with; "Yes, I'm your angel", "Every man has a woman who loves him", "I'm moving on", Ending the album with "Hard times are over"
      </p>
      <p>
       When John was hit, he immediately fell to his knees, and shouted "I've been shot!" Almost like he was expecting it..
      </p>
      <p>
       Coming off drugs is famously a cause for depression, and depression is famously a cause for suicide. Of course, if you're John Lennon, having spent a good while telling people that this is a beautiful world, and a wonderful life, you can't just go and kill yourself..
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that Lennon himself hired Chapman to shoot him, and that he spent his final moments saying goodbye to Yoko and Sean?
