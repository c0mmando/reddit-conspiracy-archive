    <div class="md"><p>Interesting character..... one of the very symbols of the flower hippie peace movement, yet we&#39;ve all heard the rumors of his violent fights and abuse. </p>

<p>Seemed to be anti-establishment but seen giving the devil horns? Anyone seen the original cover of Yesterday and Today? The Beatles are so weird, man. </p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the question of Paul&#39;s death. Some of Lennon&#39;s songs had some intriguing clues. </p>

<p>His death is both sad and probably more complicated than what we were told. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A false flag. Someone got milked for a reason and they used it snuff out the peace and love movement, weed and hallucinogen, and fuel the import of cocaine into the 80&#39;s. John Lennon wasn&#39;t disco enough.</p>

<p>Disco itself is an import of funk and salsa. On a deeper level the import of coke from Latin American countries and the rise of disco are interconnected. the music industry steers any agenda the shadow government plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Lennon was shot in the place he chose as his home (presumably his favourite place in the world)</p>

<p>He spent the day with his family (Presumably the people he loved the most)</p>

<p>His recently released album, Double Fantasy, had lyrics that explained how he &quot;Had to let it go&quot;, as well as a song giving life advice to his &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot;.. 
Title&#39;s such as &quot;(Just like) Starting over&quot;, &quot;Dear Yoko&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m losing you&quot;
Let&#39;s not forget about the tracks Yoko contributed with; &quot;Yes, I&#39;m your angel&quot;, &quot;Every man has a woman who loves him&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m moving on&quot;, Ending the album with &quot;Hard times are over&quot;</p>

<p>When John was hit, he immediately fell to his knees, and shouted &quot;I&#39;ve been shot!&quot; Almost like he was expecting it..</p>

<p>Coming off drugs is famously a cause for depression, and depression is famously a cause for suicide. Of course, if you&#39;re John Lennon, having spent a good while telling people that this is a beautiful world, and a wonderful life, you can&#39;t just go and kill yourself..</p>

<p>Could it be that Lennon himself hired Chapman to shoot him, and that he spent his final moments saying goodbye to Yoko and Sean?</p>
