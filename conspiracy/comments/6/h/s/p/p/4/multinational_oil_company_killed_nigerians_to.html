       Shell Oil acting as a multinational global conglomerate and one of the largest companies on earth (5th largest to be exact) were paying bribes to government officials in Nigeria. They were paying the military to conduct raids on innocent protesters homes and ended up hanging innocent protest leaders in order to suppress the protesting against Shell.

        The oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians' every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.

        His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[15]
       </p>
       <p>
        The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.[16] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.[17] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.[18] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.[17]

        On June 8, 2009, Shell settled out-of-court with the Saro-Wiwa family for $15.5 million.[3][4] Ben Amunwa, director of the Remember Saro-Wiwa organization, said that "No company, that is innocent of any involvement with the Nigeria military and human rights abuses, would settle out of court for 15.5 million dollars. It clearly shows that they have something to hide".[5]

        Deposition of Eebu Jackson Nwiyon, a Mobile Police Force (MOPOL) soldier and Shell SPY (Shell supernumerary police) officer who served in Ogoni describes being told how his fellow soldiers were being paid by Shell, recounts boarding a Shell helicopter at a Shell installation with other heavily-armed soldiers. He recounts his superior being given a bulky envelope by Shell staff, which he assumes contained the cash allowances distributed to the soldiers shortly after. He is told by an officer that the Ogoni are being “taught a lesson” for resisting Shell. He recounts Major Okuntimo telling him that if they encounter any resistance to  not “leave any of the persons alive.”

        In this fax from Anderson to colleagues in London &amp; the Hague, Anderson is aware that Shell’s most vocal critic, Saro-Wiwa, was likely to be found guilty by a military tribunal, 7 months before the sentencing. In Anderson’s words, the BHC believes that “although the charges [against Saro-Wiwa] should not stick, the  government will make sure he is found guilty and then sentenced to death, and reprieved but incarcerated for a very long time”.

       Nigeria has been fucked over a lot of ways, all in the name of putting more money into rich assholes' pockets. And Shell can get away with all sorts of atrocities, worldwide, for the same reason. This is like a perfect storm of a situation where just no one cares because it's "only" Nigerians being killed and Shell is above the law.
