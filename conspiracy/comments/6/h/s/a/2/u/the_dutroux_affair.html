       Even more than the franklin scandal, the Dutroux affair is one of the single greatest cases in the exposure of elite pedophilia. The witnesses especially in the x dossiers had remembered in detail places, names, and the horrible events with such detail that there is absolutely no possibility of fraud of hoax.  This case above all others needs to be researched heavily, especially those who learned about these perverse happenings from the pizzagate investigations. I just got done reading a synopsis of events on the ISGP website, which is probably the most intellectually honest and sound sources for conspiracy research. The link below is a go-to and will give you a complete rundown of the events behind the Dutroux affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warning: This website contains extremely graphic content (including censored pictures of the case which are very disturbing) and is not safe for work. It is hard to read through at times. It can be horribly sick and depressing, so be careful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This info needs to keep getting out to people. This is a case that needs to be understood by everybody in the conspiracy community.

       If you're interested in the Dutroux affair you should read the book his lawyers wrote after his conviction. Haven't read it myself but it supposedly tells all regarding the fact Dutroux was the man in charge of procuring children for powerful interests, for their orgies. They also shiw hiw the crminial proceedings were a vast cover-up, where these crucial elements were purposely dismissed/ignored, to get the case closed asap, and to involve nobody except their client.

       I interviewed Regina Louf, and her story was completely fabricated. Famous people she mentioned had alibi's, even live on TV. Houses she mentioned didn't exist, and when she was taken to the towns were those imagined houses supposedly were located she picked random houses as the crime scenes. When they searched those houses they didn't look anything like she described them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was the story over and over again, she made something up, investigators showed her story didn't match the facts, and then she changed her story. This happened over and over again, and clearly showed she was a mentally ill person looking for attention in the wake of the Dutroux case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Belgian Police made horrible mistakes in the Dutroux case, and as a result the next couple of years every crazy story got way too much attention by the police. Stories that would have otherwise been put on the bullshit pile were investigated to the extreme, resulting in these crazy conspiracies of today. I'm 100% sure this is all bullshit, and it's frustrating this keeps coming up by people who are desperately wanting this to be true.

       You do realize that she was one out of many folks who testified, and that names she brought up were in perfect synchronicity with names other witnesses brought up. There were also folks that participated in this abuse who came out and named names. When did you interview her, and who are you associated with? What is your involvement with the case? Why are you replying to an old article after all this time? Something stinks about you.

       2 days is not old, I just did a search for Belgium and I saw this thread coming up and I knew it was this bullshit again. I interviewed her as a part of my journalism degree in 2001. And it's frustrating to see people mention this case in other cases as some kind of proof while I know it is completely fabricated. And if those other cases hold truth it's beneficial to those case they don't get tainted by this bullshit story. And no non of the witnesses in the case named people on their own, they only confirmed names mentioned by the others after they were published in interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story has been twisted and turned by conspiracy theory crafters it doesn't resemble the reality at all.

       I have read a little bit on the whole affair, and I do not believe you. Even if what you say is true, you do realize that there are many victim witnesses in the Dutroux affair, not just x1 or Regina. I am having a hard time believing you and feel you are pushing an agenda. Discussing the franklin scandal also brings up strange folks who seem to be completely prepared to shut those up who are trying to make sense of it and research these topics. What was your thesis on? Why were you doing it on the dutroux affair? What is your motive in this? If you are a reasonable person then you would understand my concern about you, and know that the dutroux affair did not just involve Regina.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read some of the articles concerning Regina during the whole affair you would see the naked attempts at shutting this case down, and how cruelly she was treated. I mean it is on a bizarre level and flagrantly obvious they did not want her to talk. I also find her to be honest.

       I didn't expect anything different from you, at this point you're in to deep to back out under any circumstance. Find the origins of the stories, interviews and so on and you'll come to the same conclusion I have. You're only consulting conspiracy sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marc Dutroux, Michelle Martin, Michel Lelievre and Bernard Weinstein are the criminals. There was no hard evidence linking Michel Nihoul to the kidnappings, even though he had contact with Dutroux as a drug dealer. But that's it, there are no other leads. EVERY single name the X witnesses brought forward have been proven to be falsely accused. And not lightly proven either, they were live on tv witnessed by hundreds of eye witnesses the moment they were supposed to have taken part in the sex crimes... The two girls they rescued from the cellar of Marc Dutroux also stated that their experiences matched the statements of the X witnesses. At some point it should be enough proof it's bullshit.  I mean if you really believe the girls that were kidnapped and abused are in on the conspiracy, you're a special kind of evil person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just quit it.

       "proof" that they were falsely accused? That is ridiculous, man. You cannot "prove" that somebody is lying unless they actually come out and say they are lying, or have evidence showing that the stories are made up. This has NEVER been the case for most of the x witnesses. A couple witnesses are not as reliable as the rest, but still some of their testimony cannot be put aside when there are direct correlations made (that could not have been hoaxed in any way) with other witnesses statements. Some of these children suffered severe psychological disturbances from these events, and some evil men and women mocked the children or discounted their testimony because of this, especially when dealing with DID (which is an all to real, yet very rare, disorder). To conflate evil with people who believe the victims who suffered in this cabal is horribly evil. You are filth and scum and are continuing the cover-up. The legal system betrayed those kids. The media betrayed them. There is MORE than enough evidence for a very real elite pedophile ring and it's covering up. The witnesses statements usually always correlate with one another. A couple of the witnesses are not as trustworthy as others, but those that we can trust have explained things that could not have been hoaxed. Too many connections and corroborations between them were made when they never had an ability to make contact to align their stories. There were even people in these pedophile rings who spilled the beans on fellow perpetrators, one even killed himself out of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am fine with folks who have a healthy skepticism and wish to validate a story. This is a noble and good thing. I can even tolerate the dogmatic skeptics, but I smell a rat and a shill in you. You are aiding those who tortured and raped children. Anybody who reads your comments will see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read all the available info for yourselves guys, and come up with your own conclusion. The website I listed is a genuinely good source (though in certain aspects I thoroughly disagree with him). It is hard reading, but when you search through the whole of the matter, the sheer obviousness of the existence of this pedophile ring is damning.

       Again a warning for anybody going to the website. There is extremely disturbing content on it, and it is hard to read. Still though the guy gives an honest account of what happened to these children in Belgium. This suffering still goes on all around us, and in almost every country. The franklin scandal is another one of these cases that should be studied.

       sigh the point of the matter is NOT A SINGLE THING in their testimony withstands scrutiny. When people come up with 100 facts, and you're able to have clear evidence that 95 of those are impossible and 5 are unverifiable but not proven true, that's enough proof of lying. And that's about the ratio we're talking about here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also those witnesses testified in newspapers first, and not at the same time. First there was the X1 story, and only after publication there was an X2, who was able to shape her story based on the X1 story. When 95% of the story of X1 is false than it all comes tumbling down. The website you listed is based on a conspiracy book that took all testimonies for granted and did no background research in the stories. It was a cheap money grab at a moment where the Belgian people were angry that their government hadn't been able to protect little girls.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be honest it's so fucking offensive to the memories of the murdered girls and the survivors, I hate everyone using this as conspiracy entertainment, because that is what this is.

       Oh dont pull that "offensive to the memories of the girls" horseshit on me, this is a damn conspiracy site you idiot. I can read citations, by the way. The citations listed by the site owner come from multiple sources and not just from a single book. Damn it man you are simplifying it all. There were indeed news articles released concerning the affair (most basically ridiculing the witnesses) and not much evidence given in those articles. The corroboration of the stories of these witnesses with information that was not publicly available is enough for me to believe something really fucked up was going on. I just flat out disagree with you. You are either simplifying  complex portions of the case, or are blurring truth with falsehoods.
      </p>
      <p>
       What made you do this as your college thesis? What was your motive behind it? The flagrant covering up of this whole affair alone by so many civil servants and individuals of power is enough to shroud it all in a stink that will never go away, and yet you paint the whole case with a broad brush as if it has absolutely no merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not be erudite, or good at getting my thoughts across, but I can smell bullshit fairly well, and you stink, man. I do not like your intentions here. You did not come at this seeming genuine. If you did have concerns about the case you could give me specific episodes that bother you and simply reason with me. Instead you went on the offensive and seem to have just as much of a personal agenda behind this case in attacking it as those who were effected by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short-- blow it out your ass. Especially with that last sanctimonious diatribe. That shit does not work on me or other folks here at r/conspiracy.

       You interviewed X1? Ah, makes sense. You're a spook, paid to quell "conspiracy theory". Your name alone seems to indicate it. That's why you literally invent all your claims out of thin air. At least the OP article is properly sourced:

       What's true is secondary. What's primary is that the X witnesses never were properly investigated and reported on. A Dutch mainstream Zembla documentary alone demonstrated countless bizarre coincidences between X1's testimony and independent information. As discussed... with sources... in the OP article.
