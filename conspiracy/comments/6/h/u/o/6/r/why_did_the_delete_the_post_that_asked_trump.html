       This sub is ran by supporters of everything. If you seriously think Trump supporters/Cambridge Analytica are the only people who have their hands in this mess then you're looking for a narrative that suites you. Browse new, and read comments. There is at least the same amount of anti-Trump Shit as there is pro-Trump Shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be frank, I'd like all of it to get the fuck off my lawn. I don't give a shit about Russia-gate discussions, that's a conspiracy. I don't give a shit about conflicts of interest, or anything else as long as its conspiracy related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get this fucking policy talk to the right subreddits and quit making the problem we clearly have in r/conspiracy worse

       I didn't say they didn't use personal attacks. I didn't even say he did. I said he didn't defend when people responded, he resorted to not addressing the topic.

       Also, the mods only have so much control. They can't stop an onslaught of t_d posters, paid accounts or bots from coming in here and wreaking havoc. They can only deal with the cleanup after.

       Not sure why they banned him. Maybe it's because people were just attacking each other left and right. No answers would suffice from him from what I read. Seems like the post was only made to get people at each other's throats. Still no reason to ban/delete. Crappy mods

       The core principle I suppose? I don't claim this sub has been taken over by Flat Earthers even though we get posts from them daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, believing in the same conspiracies that they do doesn't make you a Trump supporter. You can think the DNC killed Seth Rich for example and still hate Trump. The problem is people like you have a preconcieved notion of what a "Trump supporter" is without even addressing political views at all.

       Yes "he posed some questions" but for the most part everyone graciously tried answering them. He would than go ask them same basic question, reworded a little differently again to the same person or another person.

       Weird.  It seemed pretty on point.  I didn't comment on it, since the rabble showed up, but it got an upvote from me.

       It was a troll for conflict, not an invitation to discussion. It also was not relevant to conspiracy- unless the conspiracy is

       All the people trying to frame this sub as T-D 2.0, when this sub's political leanings tend toward a slightly uneasy coalition of anti-autoritarian right and anti-authoritarian left. That's why people here tend to generally hate both McCain and Ryan
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the Clintons and Pelosi, and to generally respect Kucinich, Ron Paul, Gowdy, Cynthia Mc Kinney - even though their policies represent an enormous range of very left and very right. The US has been more divided lately than I've ever seen, and people on this sub generally see that the partisan divide does a good job of keeping us divided and fighting amongst ourselves, while those at the highest levels of power are not the two ideological groups that the msm narrative portrays, but just one, united by power and corruption - one that must be fought. This rejection of the ever widening parisan divide is a threat to power structures that prefer us divided and squabbling over crumbs, and posts like that only exist to slide the narrative back to the fruitless squabbling.

       There is an entire sub that exists if people truly want to ask Trump supporters questions, and it could have / should have been posted there. That it was posted here instead represents an agenda. Those who believe that it was posted to foster the free exchange of ideas are kidding themselves.
