<p>The money system fucking sucks ass. We need to all admit this now. It was ok in history but it&#39;s way too easy to loot now and all the major corporations and the government plus banks are constantly looting loose cash leaving nothing for the ordinary citizen. </p>

<p>The only system I see that will allow us to live lavishly is Sacred Economics:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EEZkQv25uEs</a></p>

<p>This will eliminate a lot of problems like gangs, mafia, banker control, wars for profit, hunger, poverty, debt, and basically every problem that is created with the use of money. </p>

<p>For those who want to sound smart and call this communism, you are wrong. Communist USSR paid its citizens $1.50-$3.50 a day, they used money, they forced people into certain jobs, and the government owned everything. Sacred economics doesn&#39;t use money or trade, it allows poeple to choose whatever job they want, and the people all own everything. Since we all own everything, we use the caretaker program meaning if you are using an item, it is yours until you no longer need it so you give it away. </p>

<p>We have enough resources and technology to pull this off especially if you count the hoards of hidden resources and 50-100 year worth of futuristic technology the elite are hiding from us. </p>

<p>How do we make this happen? We simply all agree to do it in a geographic area somewhere. It can be a small town or a big city. Once the world sees proof that it works like a charm, the rest will follow. </p>

Many of these people are already aware of these resources and would spill the beans on the location.

<p>That because the best job in town only pays $8 an hour and nobody is hiring. Try to think beyond the shallow appearances. Most everyone will gladly work 5 hours a day if it means they can consume as needed. I know if I lived in the ghetto, there&#39;s no way I would work a shit job for $8 an hour. Look down on them all you what but try to put yourself in their shoes in this shit economy. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no excuse not to work on sacred economics. 35% of Americans refuse to work for various reasons but often it is because of the shit slave wages. </p>

For gods sake, what is 5 hours of work a day for 5 days a week working ones own passions? That&#39;s not even work. That is fun. We are asking America to have fun and consume or don&#39;t have fun and don&#39;t consume. The decision will be simple for 99% of the people.

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody will consume to much because the economy is based on a &quot;consume as you go&quot; system. If you aren&#39;t using the stuff you are caretaking, you have to pass it on. These rules are stringent. They are General with a lot of wiggle room. </p>

<p>Jails are a failure. We don&#39;t jail them. They just can&#39;t go shopping if they don&#39;t work. We also have to help motivate our unmotivated friends and family members. It&#39;s really not complicated. </p>

<p>As far as working more, we need to come to terms that all jobs are important. If it weren&#39;t for our janitors, you would be swimming in shit every time you enetered a public bathroom. Isn&#39;t a janitors job important? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know it&#39;s the regulations.  I mean, we would throw away garbage bags upon garbage bags of food, that we JUST prepared, sometimes an hour before closing.  Lol.  Everything from potatoes, to fruits, desserts, meats, you name it.  </p>

<p>It made me absolutely sick to my stomach seeing it, knowing that there are people struggling to even get food.   I remember I took a fresh batch of cookies we made that we were told to throw out, stuffed em in my backpack, and walked around campus for a bit handing them out. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if it was against the rules or not, I felt pretty fuckin good doing that.   These days, shit, I&#39;d probably get arrested for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah what a great excuse to throw away food while people are starving. If someone was to actually sue, the judge would go easy on the university since they are helping the world with free food. The risk is much less than the reward of feeding the starving masses.

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter what a judge MIGHT do. Corporate lawyers will advise the company to avoid potential liability by NOT giving the food away. I was an executive with a large McDonald&#39;s franchisee. Our attorneys made us put locks on all of our dumpsters to avoid a potential lawsuit by someone who might go into the dumpster and eat food we&#39;d thrown out. The lawyer said that putting locks on the dumpsters would fend off lawsuits because it would show that we were taking steps to prevent people from getting the food we were throwing out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the laws. It&#39;s the fact that people sue over things and refuse to take personal responsibility or assume risks. If someone is getting free food from a food bank and they get sick, they&#39;re going to sue because there are hundreds of TV commercials advertising lawyers who will sue anyone at the drop of a hat. If -- instead -- the recipients of the donated food were to simply say: &quot;Well, I took the free food so one of the risks is that it may make me sick&quot; then that would be the end of that. It isn&#39;t a law that is the issue, because there aren&#39;t many &quot;laws&quot; that prevent donating of food.</p>

<p>No, it is the fact that people sue over every little thing these days. Company lawyers will not allow the companies to expose themselves to potential lawsuit liability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A family friend owned a restaurant downtown. He would take the leftovers to the homeless after closing. It was all in the take home containers and he had a food license.</p>

<p>Cops would give him a hassle, like you can&#39;t feed the homeless as the food might be bad or whatever. It is the exact same food as he was selling to the public! He even had a license. Cops just did not want homeless around. There was no safety issue, nor chance of lawsuit as he was not stealing from his own business. Homeless people sometimes eat out of the dumpsters, so they don&#39;t really care about safety. They just want to protect the property values in the downtown area.</p>

We would have taco day in our cafeteria and make huge bins of toppings but we&#39;d end up having a lot extra.  Especially guacamole and I love that stuff.  I&#39;d have to sneak a plastic container and get some in there before getting caught because we were throwing out a couple pounds of the stuff, but if I didn&#39;t sneak it then I&#39;d be considered to be stealing.</p>

<p>I tried convincing my bosses to donate food to places but was told there were all kinds of rules, laws, and regulations in place that could get the place sued if anyone got bad food so they just told us to throw it all away.  I later found out the boss wasn&#39;t telling the truth, they just didn&#39;t feel like dealing with whatever paperwork and extra work would be involved.  I even suggested contacting various local farms because the food could possibly be composted or something, but the answer was still just to toss it.</p>

<p>I wanted to point out a possible reasoning for why employees can&#39;t take stuff home or it&#39;s considered stealing. If you allow employees to take surplus cooked food home you are encouraging employees to make more than is necessary because they know they can take the extra home. It incentivizes waste for the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a &quot;possible reason,&quot; it is the exact reason. I worked at a pizza place during high school, and when I became part of the management team, we put this rule in place because the employees were deliberately screwing up pizzas so they could take them home at the end of the night.</p>

<p>Apparently giving them free pizza during their shift as a meal wasn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>I think the problem is our current implementation of money using central banks.  Central banking has these properties:</p>

<li>Supply is not limited by real-world resources</li>
<li>Relatively few people / private entities control the money supply</li>
<li>Wealth can be transferred from money holders to money creators by creating new money</li>
<li>Purchasing power decreases over time because of inflation as new money is created</li>
<li>Permission from banks is required to open a bank account to participate in the global economy</li>
<li>Financial transactions are monitored; there is no right to privacy</li>
</ul>

<p>By comparison, digital currency, or cryptocurrency, is based on blockchain technology and has these properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decentralized governance; no one entity is in control</li>
<li>Anyone can participate in mining which is how new supply comes into existence</li>
<li>Supply is limited by open source code which anyone can inspect and contribute to</li>
<li>Value increases over time and with utility because supply is limited</li>
<li>Permission is not required to transact; censorship resistant</li>
<li>Borderless payments, i.e. global currency</li>
<li>Permanent settlement within minutes</li>
<li>Fees of up to a few dollars (most are pennies)</li>
<li>No trusted third parties necessary</li>
<li>Enables financial privacy</li>
<li>Most secure networks in the world by far</li>
<li>Programmable money for a new generation of applications we can&#39;t conceive of yet</li>
</ul>

<p>I think improving our implementation of money can achieve the goals of the video; global abundance for all and the betterment of mankind and our relationship with nature.</p>

<p>You can blame lawyers for all the food thrown out by businesses/corporations.  It&#39;s their fault because now companies cannot risk the liabilities of someone somewhere getting a little stomachache from donated food and subsequently filing exorbitant lawsuits.</p>

<p>For those who want to sound smart and call this communism, you are wrong. Communist USSR paid its citizens $1.50-$3.50 a day, they used money, they forced people into certain jobs, and the government owned everything. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this instance you would <strong><em>both be wrong</em></strong>. Communism is a stateless, moneyless, classless society <em>theorized</em> to follow full socialism. The Communist Party of the USSR wasn&#39;t so named because they or their government <em>were</em> communist, but rather because communism was the nominal end goal of their ideology. </p>

<p>To add to this, the Marxist-Leninist state collectivization and bureaucracy they attempted to use to implement socialism is <em>not the only theoretical form of socialism</em>. There are numerous socialist ideologies, many of which are <em>libertarian</em> in nature. For example, I like the idea of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we all own everything, we use the caretaker program meaning if you are using an item, it is yours until you no longer need it so you give it away. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>literally socialism</em>. The whole idea of socialism is the democratization of the economy, because capitalism is in essence a form of neo-Feudalism, where everything has been made private property and the vast majority must submit to a property owner in a wage labor relationship in order to survive. Since survival is at stake, the &quot;free contract&quot; voluntaryists/Right-libertarians speak of its inherently impossible. </p>

<p>P.s. I think you might just be afraid to consider socialism due to decades of propaganda and brainwashing at the hands of capitalist America (you know, the same corporations and banks you&#39;re talking about). Try reading more about socialism, in particular non Marxist-Leninist perspectives. The USSR&#39;s system was socialist, but not all socialism is Marxism-Leninism or structured in the same way. I suggest reading Peter Kropotkin&#39;s <em>The Conquest of Bread</em> for a libertarian socialist perspective. It&#39;s available online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real problem these days is that rather than a means of facilitating trade as it used to be in the past, money now is primarily used as a (false, attempted) means of demonstrating our worth as human beings.  This is not remotely what money should be used for at all; but that is the real reason for all the inequality.</p>

<p>The cost of an item now has nothing whatsoever to do with its&#39; commonality or scarcity, but rather the perceived degree of social status that it will confer to the person who owns it.  In one shop I can buy a jar of coconut oil for $20, and in another I can get it for $5.  It all has to do with coconut oil being a food status symbol now; it is considered a &quot;superfood,&quot; so sick, pretentious people buy it not for its&#39; real nutritional value, but for how they will appear to their equally mentally ill friends.</p>

<p>This is a psychopathic scenario, and it causes environmental destruction and human misery.</p>

It&#39;s no ones passion to make pencils for 12 hours a day but we&#39;ve shown if we want our kids to have pencils for school someone needs to do it and fuck you I&#39;m not doing it I need my damn gifts after my long day of being one of our societies very valuable pet psychics. When society is the size of ours you need mass manufacturing to supply shit like clothes and paper and fucking food. He says in the video &quot;oh maybe ill grow a garden to make the world beautiful&quot; we dont need gardens we need massive fucking fields of corn to make enough food for everyone and it&#39;s no ones passion to wake up every morning at the crack of dawn and grow nothing but miles and miles of fucking corn meanwhile you are guaranteed to come out the same as the guy who decided photography is his passion and can wake up at noon. This is just a stupid ass name for communism and all it does is inspire laziness, there&#39;s dirty jobs boring jobs and thankless jobs in the world which only get done because it gives you a better life. If your life is already great why would anyone be a garbage collector? What if I decide I don&#39;t have any kind of passion at all and I have no &quot;gifts&quot; to give to the world am I now going to starve because no one will give me a gift? What if a lot of people do this? How will we track who&#39;s a good gift giver and who&#39;s not? Maybe when you give a gift to someone whther it be goods or services I could give you a little ticket that shows you gave me a gift and then you could give that to someone in exchange for gifts from them! No that&#39;s crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Large amounts of food are thrown away by supermarkets now. They used to donate a lot of expiring/expired foods and produce that were approaching end of shelf life to food banks but, thanks to our overly-litigious society, they have started to destroy these things instead.</p>

<p>Recently had a local supermarket throw out dozens of cases of bananas that would have been great to donate to the local food bank. The produce manager told me that the company requires him to throw the bananas out and then pour chemicals on them to make them inedible because of the fact that they have been sued in the past over products they had donated to local food banks.</p>

<p>If you want to lay some blame for this problem, blame the frivolous lawsuits that people insist on bringing against companies that are actually trying to do good for people in need.</p>
