In a material segment of the population, these genes are defective, either being entirely unable to metabolize or being inefficient. This can lead to psychosis.</p>

<p>Ever why school shooters tend to be white and medicated? Whites are the predominant race in America, but also are the most likely to be medicated. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm">Per CDC</a>, from 2005-2008, 13.6% of nonhispanic whites were on antidepressants, compared to 3.9% blacks and 2.7% mexicans.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Race is a factor in the occurrence of CYP2D6 variability. The prevalence of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is approximately 6–10% in white populations, but is lower in most other ethnic groups such as Asians (2%).[13] In African-Americans, the frequency of poor metabolizers is greater than for whites.[14]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C19">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C19</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genetic polymorphism (mainly CYP2C19<em>2, CYP2C19</em>3 and CYP2C19*17) exists for CYP2C19 expression, with approximately 3–5% of Caucasian and 15–20% of Asian populations being poor metabolizers with no CYP2C19 function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C9">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2C9</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Genetic polymorphism exists for CYP2C9 expression because the CYP2C9 gene is highly polymorphic. More than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described in the regulatory and coding regions of the CYP2C9 gene,[13] some of them are associated with reduced enzyme activity compared with wild type in vitro.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Multiple in vivo studies also show that several mutant CYP2C9 genotypes are associated with significant reduction of in metabolism and daily dose requirements of selected CYP2C9 substrate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These drugs go to your liver, which tries to process them. For those people with genetic defects, psych med waste continues to build up in the liver because it can&#39;t fully metabolize the meds. Eventually the patient snaps.</p>

<p>The fact that there is a material chance that you could be a carrier of a polymorphism should scare you, but it gets worse. Many drugs also affect how well the gene can do its job. They can make the gene more or less efficient. A drug like Prozac is what&#39;s known as a strong inhibitor for both the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 pathways. A strong inhibitor being one that causes at least a 5-fold increase in the plasma AUC values, or more than 80% decrease in clearance.</p>

<p>Suppose genetically your liver is able to process this metabolic pathway, but inefficiently. If you&#39;re on Prozac, for example, this means that you still might be poisoning yourself because it&#39;s lowered your already inefficient gene&#39;s efficacy by 80% or more.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t even told you the worst part yet. The worst part is that genetic testing exists to screen for this stuff. But it is standard practice not to test.</p>

<p>People are being driven insane by these meds. It is a recognized issue--people have been acquitted of murder because forensic psychiatrists have demonstrated that their meds drove them insane--and yet doctors won&#39;t even tell you that they can screen for this risk. The tests are only a few hundred bucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference between what a chemist develops and what is in produced naturally is not so much targeting of action, but distillation of the compounds involved. You can isolate a single compound and test for its effects individually instead of the natural mixture. There are benefits to doing it that way - some of the compounds found naturally together may be safer than others. And drawbacks where combined chemical actions may exist that are not seen from either chemical in isolation.</p>

<p>Ultimately ~ whether something is produced by a lab or distilled from a plant isn&#39;t all that important. Chemicals exist and arise from nature ~ we just forget sometimes how dangerous natural things can be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But <strong>analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.</strong> Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind. <strong>The serotonin theory is as close as any theory in the history of science to having been proved wrong. Instead of curing depression, popular antidepressants may induce a biological vulnerability making people more likely to become depressed in the future.</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In clinical trials SSRI&#39;s were only slightly better than placebo at alleviating depression. The theoretical underpinning that SSRI&#39;s work through correcting serotonin levels is generally not supported. All that being said, SSRI&#39;s certainly have some psychological and physical effects. SSRI&#39;s in conjunction with other medication (and talk therapy) has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Working with a qualified mental health professional can find a dosage and mix of medication that makes improvement in the quality of life and mitigates some symptoms. All of this starts with a proper diagnoses.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what&#39;s great and works almost instantly at stopping you feeling depressed? Cocaine, a very potent SSRI (and does the same for norepinephrine and dopamine), and about 2 days after doing it you feel like shit because your levels crash.</p>

<p>So basically an antidepressant that takes 2 weeks to effectively have an SSRI effect will leave you depressed for weeks or months after going off it. You end a bender on coke and you know you&#39;ve got the cocaine blues, but antidepressants you&#39;re not going to think it was the pills when weeks after you not taking them and feeling fine you crash hard for a month. You won&#39;t handle it even if it&#39;s mild like you would one day of feeling like shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you are going for the &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; argument with pointing out that depressed people may not have much of a sex drive anyway. It is well-known that antidepressants can reduce sex drive (not just being depressed) and it is sometimes recommended that you also take viagra with your antidepressants. You can find all kinds of information if you google it, but I&#39;ll give you a few links here. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/antidepressants-dont-just-change-your-sex-drive-they-can-affect-your-feelings-love-toward-297598">&quot;Two common types of antidepressant medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclics, were found to have negative effects on users’ love lives. In a recent study, participants actively taking the drugs reported not only decreased sexual desires but also fewer feelings of a personal connection with their partners. The study adds further evidence to the long-known association between antidepressant medication and loss of sex drive and/or romantic feelings. PsychCentral reported that between 30 percent and 70 percent who take antidepressants experience sexual problems from as early as the first week following treatment. These problems are usually physical, such as erectile dysfunction in men, vaginal dryness in women, and limited ability to achieve an orgasm in both genders.&quot;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Common Side Effects of Antidepressants</p>

<p>Antidepressants can sometimes cause a wide range of unpleasant side effects, including:</p>

<p>nausea, increased appetite and weight gain, loss of sexual desire and other sexual problems, such as erectile dysfunction and decreased orgasm...</p>

<p>One of the more common “though not frequently talked about” side effects is decreased interest in sex or decreased ability to have an orgasm. As many as half the patients who get SSRIs report a sex-related symptom, says Bradley N. Gaynes, MD, MPH, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina.</p>

<p>One way to address such symptoms is to add a different type of antidepressant or even a medication for erectile dysfunction, Gaynes says.</p>

Then talk to a few hundred patients about how their lives were essentially saved by these medications. There&#39;s a reason we choose initial agents based on sumptoms and risk factors, start with fairly low doses and titrate up, and change to different agents based on side effects and efficacy.

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s really not useful information. These drugs have very variable effects in different people at different levels. They&#39;re generally not in any way toxic, and overdose type effects are exceedingly rare. All that test would tell you is that a given person might maybe perhaps do better at 10mg a day instead of 40mg a day, maybe. You would still start the person at 10mg a day and look at efficacy and side effects, then titrate up from there as needed. It wouldn&#39;t actually change your clinical practice.</p>

<p>This sort of thing <em>would</em> potentially be super helpful with, say, warfarin, which is also metabolized by P450 enzymes, and needs to be kept at a pretty controlled level. Too much warfarin and you risk hemorrhages and bleeds; too little and you risk clots and strokes. It&#39;s so important that people on warfarin go have their clotting factor levels checked weekly while getting down to the right dose, and then periodically after that. Things that affect P450 enzyme function, like grapefruit juice or spinach or even Tylenol, can dramatically affect warfarin metabolization and levels. If we could reliably predict via a fairly inexpensive enzyme assay or genetic test how a given patient will metabolize warfarin, then we could tailor the starting dose much more quickly.</p>

<p>But for SSRIs? Not really. The mood-altering effects don&#39;t happen at defined blood levels the way for warfarin. Dosing is based on clinical outcome in terms of patient&#39;s subjective mood and reported side effects, not on serotonin levels or drug levels.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone is saying all psych medication is horrible and bad. The problems are overuse, horrific side effects, lack of objective criteria for diagnosis, and failure to screen for other causes like nutrient deficiencies, and failure to emphasize other equally effective options like exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>

<p>Are you aware there are studies showing, for example that Zinc can be as effective as an SSRI, or that magnesium and vitamin B6 can be as effective as amphetamines in treating ADHD?</p>

<p>Are you aware that MOST Americans have at least one vitamin deficiency, and that these can mimic all sorts of illnesses? Just because SSRIs are effective in some cases doesn&#39;t mean modern medicine&#39;s approach is therefore optimal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s no surprise. I mean, I know a doctor who can reverse most cases of MS. Completely reverse it. I have met many of these people, seen them go from wheelchair to walking and perfectly fine. This same doctor reverses most autoimmune diseases. It&#39;s crazy what big pharma is doing. If some doctor in FL can figure out what is happening in the body to cause MS and other autoimmune diseases, there is no way that someone in big pharma has not put that together. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s why they compartmentalize medicine. You have a headache, go see this specialist. You have joint pain, go see this specialist. You have x, go see that specialist. But no one looks at the whole patient. Each organ does not function in and of themselves. Our body is a complex system, where if one organ is not working properly, it actually effects a whole chain of other body/organ functions. You have to heal the whole to beat disease. But that&#39;s why mainstream medicine is compartmentalized. It prevents doctors and patients from seeing the whole picture. Different specialist doctors can just treat each symptom individually, never able to heal or even see the root cause, thus creating lifelong customers. </p>

<p>I got better from a lifelong disease after I gave up on all the specialists and saw a naturopathic doctor who knew the whole body and how the damage to each organ function needed fixing, that the whole body and function as a whole was the focus in treatment. And once you look at disease through that lens, medicine actually becomes very logical. My mainstream medicine doctors were always saying things like &quot;eh, we don&#39;t really know what causes x&quot; &quot; well sometimes that just happens&quot; &quot;let&#39;s try this pharmaceutical and see what happens&quot;. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I heard &quot;eh, don&#39;t worry about it. Sometimes that just happens&quot; when it came to symptoms. It was like they did not realize medicine was a scientific field. Smh. But after many years of suffering, I saw a naturopathic doctor who knew how the body functioned as a whole system of organs, and I beat my lifelong disease in 3 months. I am now disease free, and actually truly healthy. </p>

<p>People are waking up to the madness of big pharma run sickcare. It&#39;s only a matter of time before their profits plunge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow, That&#39;s so true! Such a solid observation on your part. The profession totally attracts a certain type person, and then they are fed the all powerful white coat and the idea that they know everything and it&#39;s a recipe for disaster of an industry. </p>

<p>What really gets me is that the idea that one know everything about something is truly terrible, regardless the industry or profession (but especially in any scientific field). I mean, how are we supposed to innovate and learn new things as a society, if doctors dismiss any and all information outside what small amount (small in the grand scheme of things) they have been taught. In 1973, a new disease was discovered that was later named Lyme Disease. Only as of recently do we have a somewhat accurate lab test for it and we still have no known protocol to fully eradicate it from the body. Most people do not get a proper diagnosis because doctors are still to this day not taught about it in med school. The development of AIDS was recent in human history, so for a doctor to dismiss sick people in light of new illnesses being discovered is quite shocking.  </p>

<p>And then you have the majority of people blindly trusting their doctor and not advocating for themselves. It&#39;s scary. </p>

<p>We really need a overhaul of our medical system. It&#39;s not quite working for us or for progress and innovation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a bunch of reasons for that, and the primary one is because that&#39;s what most patients want to hear. They come in complaining of a symptom and want the symptom gone, so that&#39;s how doctors talk to them about the plan. That&#39;s not how it works behind the scenes, and that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on in the doctor&#39;s brain. The doctor is forming a differential and likely diagnosis and a plan to further assess and/or treat the potential diagnoses.  </p>

<p>Go Google &quot;sample h&amp;p&quot; to or &quot;sample progress note&quot; to see what a physicians thought process looks like. Chief complaint, history of present illness, medical history, social history, assessment, problem list, and plan. There&#39;s a lot more going on that you just don&#39;t know about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus, often depression is a result of bad bacteria in the gut which makes the body unable to convert melatonin to 5HTP, which is the precursor to Serotonin. </p>

<p>One can just take 5HTP in supplement form to overcome chemical depression (not caused by being chronically unhappy as a result of lifestyle or events). But a person with chemical depression can fix their gut through natural means and thus their body will be able to process melatonin again and no longer require supplemental 5HTP. </p>

<p>Also, many people get misdiagnosed with depression when their symptoms are actually being caused by HS6, a common airborne viral infection which causes fatigue, loss of interest/passion, an overall &#39;meh&#39; feeling about everything which often leads people with this to think they might be experiencing depression. It&#39;s surprisingly common for people to be misdiagnosed, and this is a result of the diagnosis process for depression. A doctor can only go off of a symptom list and most doctors are unaware of the virus that mimics those symptoms. </p>

<p>Your point about the gut is interesting as well. Not many people realize it but 90% of the body&#39;s serotonin is produced there. I&#39;m not sure however whether this gut-produced serotonin contributes to the amount of serotonin available in the brain or what effect it has on depression in general. Are you aware of any of the science behind this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HS6 is Herpes Simplex 6 (airborne virus, not sexually transmitted). Most people are healthy enough to fight it off before it becomes a full blown infection, but people with weak immune systems or even a temporarily compromised immune system can end up with the infection lasting which causes the symptoms. It happened to me. It was quite interesting to see the symptoms it caused for me. But I am so glad my doctor caught it and I was able to get back to normal after a couple of months.</p>

<p>I have not looked up the process of serotonin production in a while, probably several years. But I was taught about this  process by several doctors (during a 2 hour conference) who are able to treat and cure depression by supplementing with 5HTP while fixing gut bacteria issues. Several of my family members along with a couple friends (but this amounts to 100% of people who I know have done this treatment process) were cured of their depression through these means. I had looked it up and found info on this online after the small conference, but it was probably about 5 years ago and I don&#39;t have the computer with those links on it anymore unfortunately. I wish I had saved them. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to look online when I get home.</p>

I pulled out my old medical notebook with my labs and info I printed out off the internet, thinking maybe somehow I had confused the name. I have the name right. I have all the sheets with the info on HS6 but I can&#39;t find anything online now. I received his diagnosis about 7 years ago, so that&#39;s when I looked this up online. I&#39;m finding it hard to imagine that even if the name changed, I would not be able to find some record of it now online. </p>

<p>I seriously fucking baffled and really freaked out. I have a webMD fucking print out in my hands and can&#39;t find anything about it online. </p>

<p>I am going to ask my doctor about this. </p>

<p>**the only thing I can find is HHV6, but nothing on that is listing any real symptoms. I don&#39;t know if maybe the name changed. But my symptoms were extreme fatigue, windedness, overwhelmingly apathetic to everything, and a rash on my skin exposed to the sun. My skin would turn red, inflamed and slightly itchy after maybe a couple minuets in the sun. My dermatologist could not figure out what was causing it but my doctor figured it out pretty quick. I gave her that info and she looked it up herself too (she was a very proactive doctor who liked knowing about skin stuff to help find other possible issues with the body). </p>

<p>I honestly am baffled right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so after calling some friends and a family member who also had it, we determined the name was changed a couple years back or something. We were all diagnosed with HS6, but now it looks like it goes by Human Herpesvirus 6 (one word) HHV6. </p>

<p>But with the virus comes extreme physical fatigue (but not necessarily sleepy), loss of interest in food and hobbies, and a rash/reddening from brief sun exposure (which up close looks like a very mild blistering and goes away within a day of being out of the sun). It DOES NOT cause sadness or crying bouts. But because of the other symptoms doctors often think it still is depression because the rash is usually dismissed as being caused by something else. </p>

<p>I think that this is an unrelated issue. The sober truth is that simple, cheap genetic tests are available to ensure that your medication won&#39;t turn you psychotic. And it is standard practice not to test, nor to inform the patient of these facts. This is a malpractice time bomb.</p>

<p>(This also belies the fact that most industry funded research is extremely short-term focused. As in weeks, not years. My understanding is that the long-term benefits are more debatable although I have not looked into this personally.)</p>

I didn&#39;t use medication and focused on therapy, diet, and lifestyle for 5 years and while it was incredibly helpful and gave me great coping skills, nothing really clicked into place until I added medication to the list.</p>

<p>Likewise, I had an ex with bipolar disorder. On medication he was ambitious, smart and calm. Once he stops taking it he becomes super aggressive, reckless, and his personality gets all twisted up. He&#39;s currently homeless and using meth, if that tells you anything.</p>

<p>I think that medication is over prescribed and a lot if mental health issues can be resolved with lifestyle changes. But not everything can be solved so simply. I work in healthcare and there is actually a huge shift being planned to add more focus on behavioral health. Lots of jobs opening up and clinics are changing the way they handle comprehensive patient care. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can attest to this. </p>

<p>They got me when I was 18 loaded me up on a bunch of psych meds on and off for the next 8-9 years. The drugs made me far more anxious and depressed then I had ever been before them. The withdrawals from getting off them literally took years and arguably I&#39;m still healing and haven&#39;t touched a psych med in over 3 years now. </p>

<p>Who knows what damage they caused to my brain, liver, and other organs but those drugs were killing me slowly. </p>

<p>Luckily I was able to get off them through sheer will and by improving my lifestyle and reconnecting with my spirituality. I&#39;m honestly still amazed they didn&#39;t kill me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have reluctantly improved my diet and learned to meditate, just as I reluctantly went on meds in the first place. I was brainwashed to believe doctors were some kind of ultimate authority and I should listen to them. So I can&#39;t imagine if they gave me a list of foods I could and couldn&#39;t eat, and taught me how to meditate that I would reject that.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t looking for an easy fix, I was looking for a solution that actually worked. Antidepressants were sold to me as that solution, and it did not work. It instead made my mental health worse in the long run and potentially damaged my body and brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the oldest and probably one the most well studied meds. It&#39;s safe, with caveats. It&#39;s very sensitive to the concentration in your blood. There is a fine line between the target dose and a dangerous dose. When you&#39;re going onto lithium you need frequent blood tests to make sure that your levels are OK. Tremors aren&#39;t uncommon. Long term it can be bad for your kidneys. It&#39;s great for dealing with suicidal ideation. Often prescribed for bipolar. Works synergistically with some antidepressants (google &quot;Lithium Boost&quot;). Can cause weight gain and acne. My experience with it was positive overall.</p>

<p>Three genes are required </p>

<p>or having a close variant</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to metabolize a wide variety of medications, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antianxiolytics. In a material segment of the population, these genes are defective, either being entirely unable to metabolize or being inefficient.</p>

<p>which can be seen with urine or blood screening. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t even told you the worst part yet. The worst part is that genetic testing exists to screen for this stuff. But it is standard practice not to test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because a cheaper method exists. To look to see if the drugs are metabolized. Not everyone can eat aspirin either. Genetic tests are way more expensive than a simple urine screen and/or just seeing how a patient reacts to any given medication. </p>

<p>You want everyone to have a gene test? Who&#39;s going to pay for a test that&#39;s a few hundred $ that&#39;s probable when one for a few $ is definitive?  Not insurance companies - they&#39;d deny it as too expensive. Not the US government - they are moving toward private prisons instead of prevention. Not GOP controlled state governments - they are cutting medicare/medicaid services - especially to the segments most needing help with depression and drug dependency and also moving toward private prisons as the &quot;solution&quot; or just <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/7/15753510/kansas-brownback-tax-reform">flat out Bankrupt from years of trickle down tax failure</a>.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a few doctors in my family (in laws) and their doctor friends, thereby, in my social circle, my opinion on the matter is that they&#39;re mostly people who, for whatever reason, felt humiliated in childhood for not being smart/knowledgable and they&#39;ve ever since oriented their lives so as to confer the greatest affirmation that it&#39;s no longer the case. That&#39;s why the position in this society of &#39;doctor&#39; is so attractive to them – it&#39;s like Respect on Rails™ – a &#39;surefire&#39; way to have their intellect respected by society. They&#39;re really too fearful of failure to choose any path that opens them to that humiliation, and it&#39;s the same reason they cling so strongly to their profession&#39;s status quo.</p>

<p>I really wish I could respect it more, because it pains me to have to think these things. Tough ask, however.</p>
