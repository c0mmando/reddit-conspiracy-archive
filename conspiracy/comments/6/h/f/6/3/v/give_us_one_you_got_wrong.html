    <div class="md"><p>That video is a gem. She explains it way better than I just did.</p>

<p>Basically, scientists discover a problem with something, then industry hires its own scientists to deny it. After a while, they can&#39;t deny it anymore, so they say there&#39;s no proof or there&#39;s no causal connection or something else is responsible or other things are responsible. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a formula. This has happened many times: leaded gasoline, smoking and cancer, global warming.</p>

<p>I <em>generally</em> trust that science is correct, but when it goes wrong -- it goes wrong good!</p>

<p>I just found this paper. It seems right on point. <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf">http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that this will seem ironic in a sub like this, but I think it applies in this case. Hell, I think it applies to a lot of topics here.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia</a></p>

<p>That said, I do believe, based on the undeniable science, that the global climate has been steadily getting warmer since the last ice age. I also think the humans HAVE had an undeniable effect on the environment and that would naturally impact climate.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t claim to know is what degree people affect the climate, or to what degree we could actually change the steadily increasing warming effect.</p>

<p>All the same, I walk to and from work everyday. I try to avoid the impact I directly have on the environment in the many small ways an individual is capable. </p>

<p>I have simply lost faith in the man-made climate change advocates and their line of fear mongering. 20 years ago I was led to believe that by now Florida would be gone, California would be an archipelago, the ice caps would no longer exist, the Mississippi river would reverse flow and cut the nation in half, etc, etc... They only damage their own reputations and the credibility of the topics they advocate for by these sorts of predictions, as they were demonstrably false. </p>

<p>So like I said before,  </p>

<p>I remember holding onto that vid on a USB stick, showing people in private - asking if they lie about this, what else?  How is this protecting our freedom?  How would we react if another force was on our homeland shooting our families?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 9/11 I joined the army.  Patriotic.  Fighting the &quot;terrorists&quot;.  Serving something bigger than myself.  Going to Iraq.  All that nonsense.  Driving around on patrols and mail runs, and seeing the oppression we were inflicting on the people of Tikrit and Mosul was pretty surreal, but not enough to wake me up.  Seeing my commanders call in blanket bombing a neighborhood (artillery) out of &quot;revenge&quot; for a minor skirmish which tore up a humvee.  It was a little shocking, but not enough for me.  Seeing murdered people flopped over dead in their cars on the side of the road, while we drove by.  I still didn&#39;t see, completely.  I was pretty disillusioned with what we were doing over there, sure, but not enough to <em>really</em> question what was going on.  </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until a year or so after I got out, watched a pbs(?) documentary showing building 7 going down.  Sitting there in my apartment, watching that controlled demolition, I finally realized how badly I&#39;d been duped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do some things, but not enough to help Iraqis directly.  I don&#39;t run across any in my neighborhoods, and traveling isn&#39;t really an option for me these days.  I speak against propaganda, wherever I can, and point out the psychosis of our war mongering in the middle East and other places.  I&#39;ve also become too much of a softie, not wanting to even hurt a fly if I don&#39;t have to.  I&#39;m vegetarian now.  Doing more harm to humans and creatures around me is something I avoid as much as possible.  Not out of pennance or guilt, but being true to myself, and not letting others convince me of what&#39;s &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;right&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ll find ways to help more, down the road, but my main mission for the foreseeable future is to raise up my kids to not fall into the same trap I did.  To be kind to their neighbors, nearby and around the world.  To not live in fear of the foreign bogeyman, and to not blindly believe what their tv&#39;s tell them to believe.  </p>
