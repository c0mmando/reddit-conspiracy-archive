        This school
       </a>
       has dominos every single day. Trust me when i say the trash cans are filled with "chilled fruit cups" and salads but not a single piece of pizza is thrown away. Plus the nutrition numbers on the side are BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to work at dominos and delivered school pizzas every week to elementary schools all around the city. Dominos charges the school at $8 a pizza and the school sells the pizza at $3+ per slice to the kids, i don't know where the not for profit part takes place in the system. But the only losers are the children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how schools get grants, tax breaks, and tax intensives while running for profit food scams against unknowing children. Why are for-profit charters, private companies, and schools making money while children get early obesity, diabetes, and other general health issues they should never have had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll leave you with a
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/09/21/dominos-pizza-delivers-to-public-schools-dorms/88c25e08-c8cb-439a-a7cf-d18a143de3ca/">
        story from 1990.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Domino's Pizza will soon be delivering lunch to students in hundreds of public elementary and high school cafeterias around the country
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the National Education Association said the Marriott-Domino's deal runs afoul of an NEA resolution advocating that school lunch programs "be supported by public funds" and not run as commercial, for-profit ventures."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Ed Cooney, the deputy director of the Food Research and Action Center, a nonprofit group that lobbies on behalf of nutrition programs for children, said the Marriott-Domino's deal "raises a red flag for nutrition advocates. ... I am not anti-business, but I do think you have to ask whether {Marriott and Domino's} are placing the profit motive above nutrition."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then look at
       <a href="https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/15_fig1.jpg">
        childhood obesity
       </a>
       since 1990. By the time the late 90's hit, pizza in schools is in full swing and 10% of children aged 2-5 are now obese from 0% only a few years earlier.

       They do already through the fund raising for incentives programs. But teachers have the ultimate incentive already, the children. Besides the BS nonsense taught in school already. Teachers, subs, nurses, counselors, PE, janitors and other school staff have been caught trafficking, and abusing children. Mismanaged medications. Creepy psychiatry lessons. Selling drugs as well as making children sell drugs. Selling children to organ harvesters. Even

      <p>
       Here's a better way I could word it..

      <p>
       Assumptions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The state has an education budget, it will cost $X.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They've exhausted all grant options.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Budget cuts wouldn't suffice.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The state must generate revenue to cover expenses.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Their options are increasing taxes or finding a way to generate revenue through the schools.

       Question:
In a situation where the citizens are going to pay for it either way. Do you care if they pay for it through either:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) profitable lunch programs, which places the burden on citizens currently receiving benefits from the education system?
      </p>
      <p>
       B) state-wide taxes, which places an equal burden on all citizens?

       ok I understand what you are trying to say this is not the first choice for anyone. So we agree it's a less than ideal system we have going. No one is arguing saying pizza is healthy. Or if they could have their choice of system it would be the for profit system we have in place now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I haven't seen this be a major topic of discussion no one is trying anything else. Probably because it's too difficult to make the change at this point. People could risk losing their jobs. I knew the cafeteria ladies at all the schools I delivered to, most of them expressed negative feelings about the for profit situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       no one stands up for anything the believe in anymore and everyone is ok with it. Its a combination of things, for one, the internet. Makes everyone feel like they are doing something useful but really we are just posting on a website. nothing is going to change from that alone. Real changes come from going to form groups which decide the best form of action. 
secondly, people can lose their jobs if they speak out. It's a reality of how things are, not everyone can take the risk. But someone has to. 
third. there is always more than two options you presented. If people in every state started to write their congress person etc who knows what could happen. It just takes people to be focused and dedicated to an issue even though many people will write it off as insignificant. 
If we are going to have profitable lunch programs. why not just have actual vendors set up shop and cut out the cafeteria completely. Every school parking lot is empty on weekends anyway it could be an actual business paying rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many solutions you just have to admit it's  a very bad thing we got kids eating pizza every day when they are supposed to be eating good food getting that nutrition we all learned about.

       this can all be blamed on budget cuts bye the fed. schools have been forced to take whatever steps to ensure kids get something to eat. they simply do not have the budgets for full time cafeteria staff. states and cities where this is happening much of the time are in districts that  are fairly poor with larger amounts of families that cant send lunches with theyre kids.  school lunches  arts  music all get chopped. if it doesnt generate income it goes.

       Growing up, we had Pizza twice a week.  One was from the district's own kitchen (which kids didn't like as much), and on Fridays we had square pieces that were rumored to be from Pizza Hut or Domino's.   I definitely think it can contribute to obesity when it is presented as a 2x a week choice (along with the other junk food offered). Very few kids (if any) picked the single 'healthy' option they would offer (which was usually like 2 things rotated, that no one would want.)   I thought that was bad, but...

       The link to the christian academy's lunch menu surprised me, though.  I totally understood that schools were serving crap, but specifically listing french fries and whipped potatos as "Veg", Lemon Dinos as "Grain", Pork &amp; Beans as "Veg", Croutons as "Grain", Tater Tots as "Veg".... wow, how can someone do that with a straight face.

       Don't you remember when they taught you in school how the lemon dinos (from the ancient grains family) where revered by the people who built the great food pyramid? The dinos have been at war with croutons ever since pork decided to leave them for beans and convert to a vegetable.

       How about fat free milk having more sugar than 2% or regular, plus you get an apple juice and maybe even an orange juice all in one meal. Heaps of sugar. I remember having all three in one meal many times, i didn't know any better. The water fountains were disgusting and only soda was in the vending machines, no bottles of water.

       Let's be real.  Kids are picky eaters.  If you are unhappy about your schools cafeteria, make them a lunch.  However you can't leave it up to the government to solve school lunches.  They can't even manage school much less lunch.

       Children from "less developed" countries are not picky eaters and that is not because of choices or circumstance. Children from most other countries eat a far vaster array of food than kids from 'merica. Their children or not exposed to ridiculous invasive advertising and programming like children in america. Toddlers watch shows saying how yucky vegetables are then commercials for ice cream appear right after. What do you think that leads to?

       The problem is, under Michelle Obama's school lunch initiative, the school staff are required to assess that lunch you packed for your child, and to dispose of it if they determine it does not meet the necessary dietary guidelines.

       You can't pawn your children off to schools and expect them to care? You can't even drink tap water so how do you think schools are going to provide real nutrition to kids? Dependency on the system makes them believe they can do what they want and steal all the money, which they do. News flash the system sucks! So don't depend on it anymore. If you can't afford to feed your child whole real foods then you have no business having children. Our country is run by psychopaths from micro to macro. If you want something done you do it yourself. Off grid is the way to be, independence from the system will be the only way to take back the truth.

       ok I understand what you are trying to say this is not the first choice for anyone. So we agree it's a less than ideal system we have going. No one is arguing saying pizza is healthy. Or if they could have their choice of system it would be the for profit system we have in place now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I haven't seen this be a major topic of discussion no one is trying anything else. Probably because it's too difficult to make the change at this point. People could risk losing their jobs. I knew the cafeteria ladies at all the schools I delivered to, most of them expressed negative feelings about the for profit situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       no one stands up for anything the believe in anymore and everyone is ok with it. Its a combination of things, for one, the internet. Makes everyone feel like they are doing something useful but really we are just posting on a website. nothing is going to change from that alone. Real changes come from going to form groups which decide the best form of action. 
secondly, people can lose their jobs if they speak out. It's a reality of how things are, not everyone can take the risk. But someone has to. 
third. there is always more than two options you presented. If people in every state started to write their congress person etc who knows what could happen. It just takes people to be focused and dedicated to an issue even though many people will write it off as insignificant. 
If we are going to have profitable lunch programs. why not just have actual vendors set up shop and cut out the cafeteria completely. Every school parking lot is empty on weekends anyway it could be an actual business paying rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many solutions you just have to admit it's  a very bad thing we got kids eating pizza every day when they are supposed to be eating good food getting that nutrition we all learned about.
