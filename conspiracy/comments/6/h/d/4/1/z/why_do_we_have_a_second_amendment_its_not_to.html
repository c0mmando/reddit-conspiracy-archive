       I believe they realize there is too many guns to take and it wouldn't be worth the hassle. That said, I don't think that will stop them from advancing the plan. They are learning a lot from Iraq and Afghanistan's small arms resistance.

       Who are they going to get to shoot Americans? The army is mostly normal socially liberal people, some libertarian, some leftist, but almost all are socially liberal. They enlisted for a job, or for college, or for a place to live, but almost none of them are going to accept the order to invade our cities and towns and shoot civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a revolution, the military will fracture. A large number will fight with us. A large number will sit out of the fight all together (the guys with access to nukes and heavy shit aren't going to want them on either side of the fight), so that leaves a small number of true believers and assholes. Sure, they will have some howitzers and helicopters, but I promise you, it won't be like a united front.

       Oh but we've been Team America: World Police for quite awhile now. When martial law is declared, the military essentially becomes the police force - and they'll attack who/whatever they are ordered to, I have no doubt of that.

       The military is trained to de-escalate. The training is 100% different. The reasons people enlist, vs. the reasons people join the police are different. The culture is different. Hell, police departments don't like to hire former military. Trust me, a good portion of military will refuse to shoot Americans on American soil.

       What military are you talking about because it sure isn't the US military. In experience is that the military is very right-wing, and authoritarian right-wing at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in from 2010-2013 and what I discovered is that there is a holier than though attitude towards civilians. More than half of the people believed in a major division between "us and them" and that those that didn't support us in everything we do are akin to traitors. I've seen a guy get beaten to a pulp for saying that the War on Terror is a bullshit excuse to pad pockets, that's the punishment for telling these jackboots something they didn't want to hear. I was one of those storm troopers once but thankfully I woke up and got the fuck out of there first chance I got.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short  I totally believe that a huge amount of soldiers could be made to fire on "domestic terrorists" who are trying to destroy "your home." You just get logistics to ensure soldiers aren't sent to their own home towns.

       Almost everyone I've met out of the military are libertarian or left wing (not liberal, actual left wing). Sure, there are some right wing religious fascists, but almost everyone I've met are socially liberal. So, they support ending the war on bodily autonomy, they heavily support the 1st, 2nd, and 4th amendments and hate the government's assaults on our liberty.

       I never saw that being the majority or even a good sliver of the population. Sure they support the second amendment because people love guns but they were overwhelmingly in favor of curtailing speech that they disagreed with (burning flags was a big example) and believed that if you had nothing to hide why hide anything.

       It's hard for me to believe your story. There's a lot of political diversity at every level from what I saw. Not to say people in the military don't fight over stupid reasons though.

       I obviously can't prove an anecdote with evidence but as an example most of my old unit are republicans and were pro-trump in the early stages of the primary.

       From my experience soldiers are overwhelmingly indifferent to politics. Most are just focused on their own situation. Republicans and southerners are over-represented, I'll give you that. My interpretation was that had more to do with economics than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw people get beat up for all kinds of stupid shit. It was mostly when people were drunk, so I don't think someone getting their ass kicked for anything represents feelings of a significant portion of any branch. Its hard for me to imagine a scenario where someone who got a beating solely for their political beliefs.

       Like I said to another person that replied all I have to go on is my own personal experience which isn't exactly verifiable by a third party. My view is shaped by what I have seen but then again I was primarily with Marines and Sailors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Southern over representation is huge too and you are right that it is economics more than anything, poor people predominately fight our wars these days. On my base they ran a sort of census to essentially showcase diversity but they found that 1 in 5 people were from Texas alone. All I know is that patriotism is the state religion for military forces and even if they don't give a shit about politics they do care about the flag and what it claims to stand for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the crux of what I'm saying is that we shouldn't count on our military disobeying orders and turning on their leaders now that the military functions in the mold of a Fortune 500 company as well as a fighting force. The enlisted and lower officers are often misled and the upper brass are just politicians in uniform. It will be a rebellion if the people rise up and it is likely those in charge spin it so we look less like rebels from Star Wars and more like those from Syria.

       How did you get out of that last year (or three) of your contract?  I served four. Contracts are four or six.  Three years means ya "fucked up bruh" or are fibbin.   I'm with you if you're for real. But at least in my exp it was mix of all political alliances. Granted it was always the anti obummers that spoke up when I was in.  On the subject, anyone want to know just how fucked our land based nuclear arsenal is?

       Feel free to scold the government, just try to know the first thing about what you are talking about when you do. Tons of disinfo agents are pushing completely made up propaganda on social media, and it's becoming more and more obvious why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go over this again. Trump did not make a deal with Saudi Arabia or Qatar. These were deals that the US government was already committed to when he took office. There is so much more going on here than you even seem to begin to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are people going to do if he ever does something actually bad? You're all blowing your was over fake stories and trivialities. It's getting to the point where I don't believe anything I hear about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some actual research like a real human being before you go spouting off "facts" all over this forum, or be prepared to get called out when you do.

       Your probably correct on assuming most Americans, or at least the ones willing to defend their rights are no were close to as well armed or trained as any middle eastern gorilla fighter. I don't think the amaricans that are armed and willing to form militias will be able to act fast enough to effectively dig in and hide before the goverment would be able to crush them like cockroaches. The Afghans had years of experience fighting for their lands defending it from invaders, most non military Americans probably don't have any actual experience fighting in a war, with probably some basic training in survival and not much more. My guess is they will either destroy most of them immediately after calling martial law, or they convince them to join them to fight against the enemys of the state.

       I could be wrong but I believe it was F-15s that were already coordinated and authorized when the Obama administration was still in. There could be other arms, but this is all I could find during my Google. I doubt we will be seeing ISIS flying around in F-15s.

       I would have to say that the U.S. is armed way better than terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan. I'm not arguing that they don't have an impressive inventory, just that we are doing better.

       Of course they are trying to take the guns, but I wouldn't view their long-term plans as necessarily a military occupation of the US. Rather, they are trying to loot the US and then move the currency to another nation that isn't so prone to... well being so damn American and freedom-loving.

       The US Armed Forces has the intel and the resources. The arsenal of tanks, helicopters, bombers, fighters, and fleet of naval vessels is just icing on the cake. Plus, the propaganda machine will keep most civilians in the dark. Who do you suppose would be willing to resist? If all out civil war broke out, yet was not immediatly squashed, how could the rebels win?
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a rebel victory could be had with foreign assistance. What would countries such as Russia or China do? Would they wait it out and strike when the US is weakest? Would they help the insurrection by supplying weapons to the resistance? Would the Russian/Chinese army fight the US military along side the rebellion? Let's say the US govt. was overthrown with foreign assistance; what does that cost?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would cost tens of millions of American lives (most will die of starvation due to shutdown of infrastructure). It would cost billions or perhaps trillions of Ruble, Yen or whatever becomes the world currency in the wake of this war -- an insurmountable debt for the rebels. The new government would be a puppet of the foreign power who defeated the democratic-republic we now enjoy. Can Liberty survive a revolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that no matter which side is victorious, Liberty dies.

       Let me start off by saying I am not advocating violence against the United States Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it would not be difficult to take down the current regime. You can imagine a larger scale implementation of something like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">
        this
       </a>
       to take down the grid. Even things like strategic arson could be enough to take down large sections of the grid, destroying 99%+ of the military capacity of the US within a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the fact that, as soon as fighting began, the people would be immediately aided by the 2nd most powerful military in the world in Russia, and possibly China, while the regime would be fully supported only by the UK and Israel, whose power to project force to the US facing supply lines contested by Russian air and naval superiority would be minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr don't take down the government, but be aware that you can.

       So what does that have to do with the individual rights? Every amendment in the Bill of Rights deal with the restrictions that the government has when dealing with people as an individual and as a collective. They don't even mention the states until the tenth amendment and that was dealing with the restriction of federal overreach into state matters and even then it still mentioned the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even you state they were careful with their words, so then if the text is written
       <em>
        A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, *
       </em>
       the right of the people** to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed*, why not restrict it to just militias?

       Because he doesn't understand how to read. For dummies it should read "Because, among other things, a militia is essential to a free polity, the people's existing and individual right to bear arms shall not be infringed." The founders didn't need to get that specific because everyone understood that is what was meant.

       You don't even understand the clause and the fact that there is a difference between the purposive and the operative. So your claim of knowing what they actually wrote is false, you just don't know how to read it properly. For example, if the first amendment was written similarly it would read: "the writing of newspaper editorials, being important to disseminating political views, the right to freedom of expression shall not be infringed." You wouldn't then claim that your freedom of expression could only then be exercised in that circumstance as that would be silly. This is because you understand that the right to freedom of expression is broader than the purpose. The reason that the founders stated the purpose in the second amendment is related to the negotiations at the time but it doesn't restrict the operation of the operative portion of the clause being the right to bear arms.

       of the purposes of the right is to allow for a militia, that doesn't mean the purpose restricts the intrinsic nature of the right itself. A right to freedom of expression can be exercised in many ways and for many purposes, those purposes don't restrict the otherwise distinct nature of the intrinsic right itself.

       A bill of rights, sometimes called a declaration of rights or a charter of rights, is a list of the most important rights to the citizens of a country. The purpose is to protect those rights against infringement from public officials and private citizens. The term "bill of rights" originates from England, where it refers to the Bill of Rights 1689 enacted by Parliament following the Glorious Revolution, asserting the supremacy of Parliament over the monarch, and listing a number of fundamental rights and liberties.

        context
       </a>
       was that the Americans had just defeated the British Empire and wanted the 2nd Amendment to be a check on tyranny:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This proportion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the British arms, will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it. "
      </p>
      <p>
       They discussed the militia so much in the Constitution because there wasn't supposed to be a standing army at all, only a navy. Eisenhower

       Of course, and it's unbelievable bullshit on its face. You're alleging that the right of the government militia to keep and bear arms was somehow slipped into a section of guarantees of individual liberties against the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was generous enough to look up the exact section of the Federalist Papers demonstrating how laughable the traitors on the US Supreme Court are for making such claims. With any luck, they'll stand trial for treason in the near future.

       Anyone upvoting this should go read DC v. Heller as this line of reasoning is utterly demolished. OP doesn't understand the difference between the purposive and operative portions of the clause, the historical background of the right to bear arms, the meaning of the word militia in the context of the clause, the meaning of the term "state" (ie state in the sense of a polity not a State), and that such an interpretation would undermine the exact purpose the founders were hoping to achieve at the time.

       You can disagree with the 2nd Amendment but you don't get to make up stories about its creation and meaning just because eliminating it would be politically impossible and you hate guns.

       Political leaders are not saints - I find it not unrealistic that they might find it more "economical" to just throw enough fuel on the fire to make a clean sweep, issue a weepy public statement, then say "never again" and proceed to pick through what's left for gold nuggets.

       The forces hiding in plain sight are so insidious and widespread that simply by force of apathy, ineptitude, or timidity, very unpleasant outcomes that are unthinkable to the everyman are merely a matter of course to the sociopathic plotter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you think that death, mass-murder, global thermonuclear war, etc., are the worst case scenario, well, I can think of many worse outcomes.

       Trying to occupy foreign territory, with limited resources, limited man power, in a different culture that sees you as an enemy and foreign, that speaks a totally different language is a vastly different situation than a military on its home turf. They have to transfer their tanks, planes, ammunition, etc all the way to Afghanistan (or near by in the case of planes), they already have that stuff here.

       The US military is also more or less trying to abide by international law in the Afghan scenario, so they won't just massacre entire villages even though they could.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the civil uprising scenario we're assuming a tyrannical, openly evil US government controlling the military. Nobody could hold them accountable so they wouldn't care about taking more extreme measures.

       And that's assuming every tank commander is willing to fire on their own citizens,  friends and family.  Trust me their not.   Leo's may be a different story.

        The real reason the Second Amendment was ratified, and why it says "State" instead of "Country" (the framers knew the difference -- see the 10th Amendment), was to preserve the slave patrol militias in the southern states, which was necessary to get Virginia's vote.

       Well pretty much all of Mr. Hartman's credibility was lost for me after "Little did Madison realize that one day in the future weapons-manufacturing corporations, newly defined as "persons" by a Supreme Court some have called dysfunctional, would use his slave patrol militia amendment to protect their "right" to manufacture and sell assault weapons used to murder schoolchildren."
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall in his article it seems like he took a few truths and proceeded to make assumptions that fit his narrative. Also, he published this literally one month and one day after Sandy Hook. The fact that he puts an article on his website a month after a tragedy that not only demonizes gun manufacturers as if they somehow condone the murder of children and also depicts the RIGHT to bear arms as being inherently racist just goes to show that ALL this is is some poorly know wannabe journalist that wanted to increase the traffic on his barely-visited page with relevant clickbait.
      </p>
      <p>
       And , for the record, if Adolf Hitler and Satan themselves created the 2nd amendment I would still be behind it. So what if some racists wanted it for this or that reason???

       That may be the case, but has any person or group stood up to the American government successfully with guns in the modern era? As far as I know, they just get killed, there's a long list of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's idealism anyway, because first you have to assume all gun owners are willing to fight, then you have to assume they have the ability to fight (majority of Americans vastly unhealthy for even military service), then you have to assume they'll properly organise, then you have to assume they'll actually fight government and not just each other over piddly shit, and then you have to assume guns and homemade bombs (presumably) match large artillery, chemical weapons, biological weapons, tanks, jets, nuclear weapons, etc. of an organised force of millions of soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sure, the Second Amendment sure will protect Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best you can hope for is for the military to at least split in half, but the idea that in any situation government vs citizens without the case of a belligerent state with its own military existing... definitely an aspect of American delusions about how much power their citizens have. I really love too how even George Washington was willing to send in the military to take out Whisky Tax protesters and their militias.

       People say the government would wipe the floor with its citizens if it ever came down to a fight all the time. But occupations never work. Look at farmers in Afghanistan. Our military can't kill them all. Why would the US government be able to occupy the US if all the citizens turned against it? All of these citizens would surely include some of the military. I for one, don't think the government stands a chance if the majority of the citizens revolt against the elite minority.

       Even during the American Revolution the majority of citizens didn't revolt and were either loyal British subjects or indifferent. I think it's just a projection to think that just because people are upset that most Americans or even a huge amount will take up arms. I don't think there's a single example of any sort of civil war where that's happened. The exception is when there were governments states battling it out, and even in those cases, you're still lacking most of the population -- the American Civil War was governments states fighting it out, not a government vs people. Even the American Revolution was sort of that, but due to distance and other factors it was easier to see the British as very different compared to your neighbours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, in Afghanistan that's a foreign military force, it's easier to get support because the Americans are invaders. It's a totally different story when it's brother against brother, as they said in the case of the American Civil War.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government would absolutely stand a chance, because Americans have no living memory of any extended hardship or prolonged war that was not far away, and even those lacked the level of deaths compared to most countries' wars. People desire stability at the cost of literally anything, and I know it's a big thing in America to say that it's liberty or death, or if you trade freedom for security you deserve neither, but in practice in all history of humanity people gladly give up freedom to live stably.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've got disorganised militias fighting the US government, which has much better training and organisational skills, and logistical abilities, morale won't last long. Militias really are just a total mess in comparison with the US military, and I'd bet any amount of money they'd fight each other just as often as they'd fight the government. The US government would even encourage this via black propaganda. Sure we like to think of the Minute Men and all that, but in reality it was mostly the Continental Army, not militias that defeated the British.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way it would happen is if there was an extremely long down turn in the government's ability to function at all, and by that I mean enforce the law and keep people in line, and provide basic services; I don't mean following the Constitution either. I imagine you would have a situation, due to America's size, of new governments coming out, likely as independent states such as Texas, Alaska, California, or possibly others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those calling for civil war though, not that you did, often don't realise how civil wars rarely end with anything other than dictatorships more severe than the ones people wanted to get rid of. It doesn't matter how idealistic the fighters are, people who desire stability will latch on to the most authoritarian people they can if they believe they trust life will regain some sort of normalcy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying this from the perspective of being pro-government, I'm saying it from the perspective of "oh shit, the likelihood this would end in something better than we have now is really low, I hope we're not as fucked as I think we are."
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd likely only take a few big smashing of militia controlled areas for most people to bow and and accept whatever out of fear of it happening to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again though, the exception would be setting up another government all together and having the same abilities, like I said in my post before, if the military were split in half for example between them, you may have something. But regular people with guns? No chance in hell.

       Yes, you are absolutely correct, but it also assumes Americans would fire on military and police. That's something I do talk about with pro-new-civil war people, is that really you're saying you want to kill US military personnel, because that's what you'd have to do, and I think that makes it a much more complex situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to say what would happen though, I largely base what I say on the Civil War and also modern Civil Wars in other places, which often aren't good comparisons because people have ways to separate and view each other differently in ways that don't quite exist in America, e.g. ethnic-religious boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think really it would be two separate governments emerging, even if a lot of the military turns on the government, I imagine many also would not. Union troops did fire upon Confederate ones, even though they spoke the same language, looked the same, had almost identical cultures, etc. It's not hard to imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is hard to imagine that based on the idea that an armed society itself protects itself from the government is remotely true, especially because even Iraq under Saddam had (I think) the highest gun ownership per capita in the entire region.

       Well, duh, you're assuming a tyrannical government. That implies almost total control of military/LE forces. Your idea that the military wouldn't shoot at their fellow citizens is also easily proven wrong by basically all military dictatorships and civil wars.

       Battle of Athens Tennessee: American GI's returning home from WWII found their hometown of McMinn County terrorized by the local police department/political machine. In response, the GI's created a nonpartision (carefully matched political demographics of the town) coaliton in an attempt to replace local politicans and sheriff. An elderly blackman was denied the right to vote by local politicans, hit with brass knuckles, and shot in the back. Two GI poll watchers were also taken captive who eventually escaped. Eventually, the local politicians took the votes and were going to "count them at the police station" in which the GI's led a successful armed revolt.

       That Battle of Athens is crazy, I remember reading about that. Those guys would have been labeled terrorists immediately nowadays and the tanks would have been brought in to shut them down. They're lucky they lived in an age when media wasn't so abundant. You best believe CNN and Fox would be down there reporting on the "terrorists" 20 minutes after it started today n

       You imply that what they have done is anything short of using force against me. Let us consider the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may invade my home at anytime for any reason and detain anyone they deem necessary for an indefinite period. Whilst there they may murder my pets (because lizards are dangerous) and forfeit property that was undoubtedly used to "sponsor terrorism". Then steal said property and liquidate it through country auctions which they then use funds for further harassing citizens and making it impossible for the very people who are arrested for pretty laws unable to vote out said petty laws. Not to mention the brainwashing and programming going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ya know I think they may already be using "force", just not the physical kind your talking about. Good day.

       The entirety of governance
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the use of force.  In any type of government in any country around the world, the authority of the government is backed up with guns.  if you refuse and refuse and refuse to follow the laws and take it far enough, eventually the guns come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the government being authorized to use force you have literal anarchy because no one that doesn't want to will follow the laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing the government's
       <em>
        authority
       </em>
       to use force in the enforcement of the law to an unlawful, unauthorized use of force to control its citizens is ludicrous.  The first is necessary to even
       <em>
        be
       </em>
       a government.  The second is what the second amendment was designed to prevent.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those things you are complaining about (rightfully, I fully agree with you) are based on laws that were passed by elected representatives, and they can be repealed by voting for other elected representatives.  The guns only come out when someone breaks those laws.  If you don't like them, elect people who will change them.  That's how the system works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answering a lawful, authorized use of force (or non-force) that you don't like with unlawful physical violence is not a measured response and it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       what the second amendment provides for.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't shoot at congressmen.  You vote them out.  And if you are unable to vote them out, you re-evaluate your position in society and recognize that perhaps your community and peers think you're wrong and don't want what you want, regardless of how certain you are that your opinions are right and just.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       go shoot people because you lost an election and you're pissed at what the winners are doing.

       Governance
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       force.  If you think it's anything less than that, you're delusional.  The ultimate result of resisting government
       <em>
        at any level
       </em>
       is the use of force, period.  You can resist the local dog-catcher and if you resist and continue to resist, eventually the police come with their guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Consent of the governed" doesn't mean "consent of every single citizen under the banner of that government".  If 99 people think murdering someone is bad but you disagree, you don't get to kill people just because you "didn't consent to be governed" by that law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without force backing up the laws, the government is literally useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second amendment protects us from government who are using force
       <em>
        wrongly
       </em>
       , not ones that are using it the way they're supposed to.

Your being far to literal with the word "force" anything you compel someone to do against their wishes can be "force" but if a child in the wild west avenged his father via killing a gang of bandits I would dare myself to say he used "force" even though in all technical terms of course he fucking did.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are implying is the need for a federalized or state sanctions group of police who enforce law because it is the law, instead of using the rational thinking aspect of human existence and examining whether or not the laws they are enforcing are just. So no I think we are talking two different kinds of "force" kinda like says the weak force=strong force.

       No, I'm trying to get you to understand that there is no governance without force to back it up.  Too many people think that people can just agree to some rules and everything will be fucking kosher, but as soon as one guy disagrees your entire fucking hippie commune falls apart.

       Use of force is a completely different argument than the justification for it.  One is an actual fact of life, the other is politics.

       okay, so what in your opinion would constitute a wrong use of force?
      </p>
      <p>
       Justifying the use of force by appealing to some automatic virtue of the law ignores all the cases where a law does nothing but expand the state's power and does everything to subvert the personal liberties of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you say for example about the issue with civil asset forfeiture?  Is that an appropriate use of force?  Would it be okay for a random citizen to stop someone, search them for no reason, then steal all of their cash?  If not, then why does a law that permits police officers to do this make any sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a law exists that allows the government to do to its citizens what its citizens may not do to each other, then you have to question the legitimacy of the laws, and where those laws are not legitimate, the use of force is immoral and corrupt.

       I'm done arguing this because you have finally seen my point and are now arguing about justification for use of force, which is an entirely different topic on which we would likely agree.  Your example is indeed an illegitimate use of force.

       Okay, I'm realizing that I may have misunderstood your stance.  I think the divide in this exchange was that you're explaining what government currently is, and everyone else is coming from the position of what it
       <em>
        ought to be
       </em>
       and thus interpreting your stance as condoning the State's illegitimate use of force.  Is that accurate?

       My only gripe was with the guy saying that governance does not equal force, when in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       cases, that is not true.
       <em>
        All
       </em>
       governance stems from the use of force.  Without force, there is no government since people can just say "no" and there is no consequence and no way to make them do what is required (or stop doing something, you get the point).  There are two big problems that result from not understanding this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The guy I was responding to has this dreamy idea that people can just agree to some rules and everyone will follow them, which only works in ultra-small communities and usually not even there.  This belief leads to a deep mistrust of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       government action as
       <em>
        they all require force
       </em>
       and creates anarchists.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The opposite side of the fence is people who don't understand that government=force and think the government is always on your side and don't understand that something as simple as not paying a parking fine is ultimately enforced at the point of a gun and
       <em>
        they will do so
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I was originally just pointing out that government
       <em>
        literally is
       </em>
       the people the citizenry agrees is allowed to use force and nothing more than that, then this guy decided to try and prove me wrong and ending up agreeing with me but arguing about justification for it, which is, as I said, an entirely different subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want everyone to understand that government is force and force is government.  You need some laws and enforcement to even have a civilized society, but don't think for one second that even small things governments do aren't fully backed by their authority to murder you.

       Less than 20% of our peers vote for the winners of these "elections." In smaller elections, it's even less. My local sheriff's and judicial elections get about 1% of the populatiom voting for the winner.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's truely a minarchy and truly a kleptocracy when the tiny minority has the authority to rule over and steal from the gross majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you voting these folks out is an option, you're braindead. When Hunter S Thompson ran for Sheriff of Aspen, he got legitimate bomb threats, both parties colluded against him, and they threw their all into narrowly beating him.

       Look at the context of the tweets of the day.  It clearly outlines that a staffer was live-tweeting speech by @Judgenap and the tweet has since been taken waaaay out of context and credited to RP only because it was quoted on his twitter feed.

       Well, that's kinda the entire point of having it on Twitter under your name, that it is representative of you. And having a person as your media/spokesperson is literally​ there to speak for you.  If Rand didn't agree with it, he could have had it removed.

       That's not always how twitter works...  if you post something that is clearly another persons quote, it doesn't automatically mean you 100% agree with it..  c'mon people!  This is basic fact verification.

       How is it misleading?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine for you to add to the truth by pointing out that staffers often are the ones to do the actual posting, for people who might not know that bit of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of the people here understand that tidbit. A quote from House of Cards comes to mind, from the scene where Frank was in a coma, something along the lines of "Frank Underwood isn't just Frank Underwood, he's the people around him".
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for Rand Paul. He's always had staffers assisting and driving his persona since before he was ever elected as congressman.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to act like the fact that a staffer typed out the tweet is somehow the "gotcha" that you think it is, and someone means Rand Paul doesn't actually stand by the tweet, despite no retraction...is just insane to me.

       It's really simple.  It is literally someone else's quote...  not Rand Paul's.  Even if RP typed it himself, it's quoting someone else.  That's why this post is misleading.

       Really?

      <p>
       Are you aware of the drama that takes place in this sub between the mods over enforcement of rule 11, "misleading titles"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware that a major reason
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       is so awful is because they use a similar rule, among others, to delete anything that goes against their narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand that the people trying to disrupt this subreddit in the same way try and take advantage of rule 11 to get the mods to remove posts that go against the establishment narrative every day?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I stated, if
       <a href="/u/hogsandducks">
        /u/hogsandducks
       </a>
       had just added their observation that it was probably a staffer that posted it, I wouldn't have taken any issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the fact that they tried to inject an argument for enforcement of rule 11 to get the post removed, or at least convince people that the spirit of the post is invalid based on faulty logic.

       If they were using Rand Paul's identity they were speaking for him.  Who cares if he was quoting someone else?  His quoting means that he is promoting the sentiment.  It means he agrees with it.  You do realize that right?

       I know to some extent we can fight off our enemy, whoever they are. But our only hope is that our brothers, sisters, father's, mother's, aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends of the military stand and fight with us if such an atrocious act is ever committed.

       Ehh if worse comes to worse, however, doing so would just mean that they now have a reason to bring in martial law on a number of people who don't have guns. A solution could be simply ignoring their demands, we have the sheer numbers on our side and with the Internet the flow of information detrimental to power is extremely easy.

       At this point its little more than a distraction while they take away all of your other Amendment rights. Memba Fourth Amendment? That's been long gone for years. They'll come for the others. All you'll be left with is your Second Amendment and muh guns n ammo. The government knows that Americans love nothing more than wagging their dicks about their gun rights like giant phallic symbols, so they'll let you have that and keep up the image everyone else in the world has of Americans being dumb fucking rednecks clutching onto their guns for dear life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And none of it will matter. Your stupid handgun won't do shit. They will have taken everything else from you
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       your gun that you love so much. They don't need to take by force. They take through other means and slowly erode away your rights as a citizen.

       This is true.  I mean look at the extreme left right now.  Complete war on the first amendment.  And anybody who uses it how they dont like is a nazi.  But they themselves are more and more embracing firearm use.  Because they are slowly realizing that just telling People with differing opinions to stfu doesnt work.    So looks like it wont just be rednecks clutching onto their firearms in the end.  It will be all of us as we have lost all our other rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all seriousness we are losing rights because people from all walks of life allow themselves and others to be bullied.  At least the people who fight for their rights to defend themselves and protect others have some sense of honor and duty to home and country.

       And no stomping and burning the american flag because you are mad at one person doesnt count.

       You're confusing a "well regulated militia" with "the right of the people to keep and bear arms". Yes, there is a duty to protect the government from insurrections, especially when that government is not tyrannical. However, the framers did not want a tyrannical government and wrote in specific protections such as the separation of powers to guard against that. But if everything they wrote into the constitution failed to stop a tyrannical government from forming, don't you think they would advocate for another revolution? I think Thomas Jefferson sums it up nicely: "what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. "

       This is of course the purpose of the Second Amendment.  But the left doesn't get to arbitrarily define tyranny so they can freely go about shooting people.  "Muh Obamacare!" isn't a reason to shoot a Congressman.  Neither is "Muh 37 genders!"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are arguably tyrannical parts of our government - or at least the foundations of them.  A surveillance state apparatus that can, and eventually will, be turned entirely against us all.  It already has been, in fact, when Obama's DOJ started spying on the incoming administration to manufacture the Russian narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like all police states, it will grow and it will begin to target ordinary citizens more and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't advocate it, if someone had targeted that apparatus or its participants, they could at least make a solid Second Amendment argument for fighting against a (proto?)tyrannical entity.  Doesn't make it right, but they could at least make the case.

       Why would you make such a suggestion then try to back pedal from it? It is a terrible idea. For so many different reasons. The only change that would happen is to further push us into a police state to protect the elites from the "unruly masses"

       I don't know what kind of change you are looking for, but if you want a society that is not based on one class oppressing another, well that change wont happen through violence.

       What I also think, however unpopular, is the power difference between what the government has and what people have.

       I agree, but not everyone in the military are brainless zombies. I think you would see mass desertion and theft of equipment. Regardless of who would win a war like that, it would be long and it would be bloody. It would not be a walk in the park for the elite, nor should it ever be.

       Yeah but thats my point. The second amendment didnt help in a scenario where the military goes awol.

       Again I support the right to gun ownership I just believe that in a traditional engagement between civilians and a real trained fighting force the civilians would lose 99 times out of a 100.

       Part of the reason the revolutionary war was so successful is because you had both sides similarly armed. If we had muskets and the british had tanks and automatic rifles we would be fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our best defense against a tyrannical government is a well rounded military who doesnt owe their allegiance to any branch of the government other than the people. If our military was tasked with protecting us we wouldnt even be in Iraq or Afghanistan. The problem is they are tasked with protecting the state and the state doesnt always have the best interest of the people at heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again we have things like Kent state, how hard do you think it would for TPTB to convince even a small percent of the military to fight against their best interests?

       The second amendment does not apply for to individual gun ownership but to the right to bare arms by an organized citizen militia for the purpose of defending the People against potential or eventual tyranny. If you are not a militia member you do not have a constitutional right to own a firearm and the government is legally able to take your weapons from you. I'm not saying this is how it should be, but it's the way it is.

       I'm sure it was a Reddit post on the subject, but whenever we had uprisings against our new government, it was the 2nd amendment that allowed the arming of militias to violently oppose said uprisings.

       The military is trained to de-escalate. The training is 100% different. The reasons people enlist, vs. the reasons people join the police are different. The culture is different. Hell, police departments don't like to hire former military. Trust me, a good portion of military will refuse to shoot Americans on American soil.

       This is true.  I mean look at the extreme left right now.  Complete war on the first amendment.  And anybody who uses it how they dont like is a nazi.  But they themselves are more and more embracing firearm use.  Because they are slowly realizing that just telling People with differing opinions to stfu doesnt work.    So looks like it wont just be rednecks clutching onto their firearms in the end.  It will be all of us as we have lost all our other rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in all seriousness we are losing rights because people from all walks of life allow themselves and others to be bullied.  At least the people who fight for their rights to defend themselves and protect others have some sense of honor and duty to home and country.

       Governance
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       force.  If you think it's anything less than that, you're delusional.  The ultimate result of resisting government
       <em>
        at any level
       </em>
       is the use of force, period.  You can resist the local dog-catcher and if you resist and continue to resist, eventually the police come with their guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Consent of the governed" doesn't mean "consent of every single citizen under the banner of that government".  If 99 people think murdering someone is bad but you disagree, you don't get to kill people just because you "didn't consent to be governed" by that law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without force backing up the laws, the government is literally useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second amendment protects us from government who are using force
       <em>
        wrongly

       , not ones that are using it the way they're supposed to.

       Given that governing bodies

       You don't even understand the clause and the fact that there is a difference between the purposive and the operative. So your claim of knowing what they actually wrote is false, you just don't know how to read it properly. For example, if the first amendment was written similarly it would read: "the writing of newspaper editorials, being important to disseminating political views, the right to freedom of expression shall not be infringed." You wouldn't then claim that your freedom of expression could only then be exercised in that circumstance as that would be silly. This is because you understand that the right to freedom of expression is broader than the purpose. The reason that the founders stated the purpose in the second amendment is related to the negotiations at the time but it doesn't restrict the operation of the operative portion of the clause being the right to bear arms.

       okay, so what in your opinion would constitute a wrong use of force?
      </p>
      <p>
       Justifying the use of force by appealing to some automatic virtue of the law ignores all the cases where a law does nothing but expand the state's power and does everything to subvert the personal liberties of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would you say for example about the issue with civil asset forfeiture?  Is that an appropriate use of force?  Would it be okay for a random citizen to stop someone, search them for no reason, then steal all of their cash?  If not, then why does a law that permits police officers to do this make any sense?
