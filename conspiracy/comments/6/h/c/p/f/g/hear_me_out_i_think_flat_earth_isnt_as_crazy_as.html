        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, I don&#39;t know whether or not to believe in the flat earth theory itself. I really don&#39;t know which side of the evidence I stand on. If I could, I&#39;d travel up to space and take a look for myself.</p>

<p>However, the biggest takeaway I got from watching this video (<a href="https://youtu.be/UbYtkrTquXE">https://youtu.be/UbYtkrTquXE</a>) is that a geocentric model typically goes hand-in-hand with the flat earth conspiracy.</p>

<p>Their reasoning for the powerful elite wanting to spread the word of a heliocentric model to the masses is to dilute the &quot;true&quot; meaning of our creation - that we are the center of God&#39;s creation, the most meaningful thing in existence in God&#39;s eyes as the center of it all.</p>

<p>Now, this is some shit I can get behind. I&#39;ve seen firsthand how accepting the masses have become of modern-day science, forgetting the fact that you&#39;re doing the exact same thing as believing in Abrahamic religions - trusting the word of other humans as fact, a.k.a blind faith (because you&#39;re not seeing the experiments being performed yourself). A lot of the higher-level astronomical science can&#39;t really be observed from home. And NASA images/videos have for the most part always been kind of laughingly fake looking in my opinion.</p>

<p>What are y&#39;all&#39;s thoughts on this? Debate me hard, I feel like I&#39;m a newbie into this idea so I have a newbie bias that I&#39;d like to put to the test.</p>

<p>The idea of it all is just to get people to question things and look at how they discuss/debate.

<p>The cellphone stuff is on hold (but is intriguing!) until I can get somebody to explain <em>tethering flights</em> to me.

    <div class="md"><p>This pops up every time and every one of these &quot;facts&quot; has been thoroughly debunked.  None of these are actual scientific proofs.  I&#39;ll just cover them shortly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.Aristotle (who made quite a lot of observations about the spherical nature of the Earth) noticed that during lunar eclipses (when the Earth’s orbit places it directly between the Sun and the Moon, creating a shadow in the process), the shadow on the Moon’s surface is round. This shadow is the Earth’s, and it’s a great clue on the spherical shape of the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lunar eclipses have never been proven to be the shadow of earth being cast on the moon.  This is only a theory.  One that is very shaky given that lunar eclipses can be seen while the sun and moon.  It&#39;s explained away as an illusion caused by the atmosphere, but the fact remains that it&#39;s not a fact.  Just a postulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.Ships and the Horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ships sink into the horizon due to perspective.  When an object moves too far away for you eye to perceive, it will appear to sink and vanish.  The same object will come back into view with a telescope or zooming lens until it reaches the limit of that lens.  Not fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3.Varying Star Constellations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This too is simply dependent on the perspective of your eye.  You can&#39;t see forever.  Your field of vision does not stretch infinitely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4.Shadows and Sticks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eratosthenes&#39; experiment is contingent on the sun&#39;s light arriving to earth in parallel rays due to it being millions of miles away. <a href="http://www.eratosthenes.eu/spip/IMG/jpg/module-guide-figure-2.jpg">Simple diagram showing why this is not proof of a spherical earth</a>.  Completely circumstantial.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5.Seeing Farther from Higher</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another failure to understand perspective.  The higher you go the further you see because the field of vision underneath you would increase.  This is actually what you wouldn&#39;t expect on a globe, because at a certain point you&#39;d have a view of the whole hemisphere and then you couldn&#39;t see further, it&#39;d just look like a smaller and smaller circle as you ascended.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6A.Planes can travel in a relatively straight line a very long time and not fall off any edges. They can also circle the Earth without stopping.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the earth is a circle with Antarctica being the outer edge this is exactly what we expect.  They&#39;re purposefully misrepresenting the flat earth model.  Planes never fly over Antarctica due to the Antarctic treaty.  Convenient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6B.If you look out the window on a trans-Atlantic flight, you can, most of the times, see the curvature of the earth in the horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve flown back and forth between the US and France twice this year and it&#39;s a lie.  There is no visible curvature.  I&#39;ve seen globe people say you can see it from a plane and that planes doesn&#39;t go high enough to see it.  There no consensus so go up and see for yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7.Look at Other Planets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This begs the question that earth is a planet, the very thing it&#39;s trying to argue.  There&#39;s no proof those lights in the sky are other worlds like the earth.  Just lights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>8.The Existence of Timezones</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ignorant of the model and perspective again.  If the sun is small, local, and circles the earth, its light wouldn&#39;t travel as far as this guy thinks.  Likewise it would leave the scope of your perspective like the constellations.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The Center of Gravity</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Begs the question of gravity.  Gravity has never been proven to be a property of mass.  It&#39;s a theoretical force said to cause attraction between all objects with mass.  That things are drawn towards the earth with a certain force is observable, that this is due to earth&#39;s mass/center of mass is entirely conjecture.</p>

<p>You cant just say shit like that and not back it up. An illusion caused by the atmosphere is not an acceptable answer. It would like me saying &quot;We cant see curvature because of an illusion caused by the atmosphere&quot;. Do you accept that as a reasonable response? </p>

<p>No it wont. A telescope or binoculars only make larger things already visible. Otherwise with sufficiently powerful telescopes I should be able to see London from NYC. I cant, no one can. Why does this phenomena only apply to ships? Why not land masses? </p>

<p>Field of view is not the same as being able to see &quot;forever&quot;. Also can you explain why you couldnt see an object producing light over long distances? You keep making claims without backing them up. </p>

<p>Which is why Erosothenes performed his experiment on solstice at noon, when the sun is directly above the observer. If the Earth were flat we would see the same length shadows or no shadows, but we dont. Ill let Sagan explain this one</p>

<p>Im honestly confused by this. I take it  you mean field of view? It remains consistent, you always have the same FoV it doesnt increase or decrease. </p>

<p>There is a sailing race every year that circumnavigates Antarctica, how is that possible to fake? That is thousands of people who would have to be in on it. Planes do fly over antarctica, im not sure why you think they cant. Book a flight here</p>

<p><a href="http://www.antarcticaflights.com.au/">http://www.antarcticaflights.com.au/</a></p>

<p>Not to mention people routinely perform expeditions there. A fellow died last year trying to recreate a famous expedition. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This one is tricky, with the limited FoV (Restricted by the window) there should be about 3% curvature. Or ask any SR71 or Concorde pilot, they fly much  higher and have noted curvature becomes very apparent at 50k feet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This begs the question that earth is a planet, the very thing it&#39;s trying to argue. There&#39;s no proof those lights in the sky are other worlds like the earth. Just lights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Explain why Mars takes the orbit it does? Why would a light do a loop de loop as if it were a part of a solar system revolving around the sun? Why can we see these lights affecting other lights? Why can I look at Jupiter, see it turn and see its satellites orbit them? There is a lot of evidence they arent just lights. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You keep suggesting light cant travel far but I honestly think you are making shit up to fit your narrative. What evidence do you have that light travels a certain distance? As part of my schooling we had a chance to bounce a signal off the reflectors on the moon and write a program to figure out how long the laser took to travel, degradation and power. How is that possible? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again what about modelling how the lights in the sky interact with each other? With gravity we can know exactly how they behave down to the centimeters. Again Im not sure what you are claiming, can you expand on this idea?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure you understand.  This is the reason the people who believe in the globe say that we can see a lunar eclipse while the sun is in the sky.  I agree it&#39;s a bullshit answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Otherwise with sufficiently powerful telescopes I should be able to see London from NYC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because not only would you need a telescope accurate enough to discern that light, you also have to deal with the atmosphere.  There are numerous examples of people seeing skylines across lakes when they should be hidden by the curve.  But comparing 40 or 60 miles to over 300?  It&#39;s a big leap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also can you explain why you couldnt see an object producing light over long distances?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you see a traffic light 50 miles away?  Your eye stops being able to discern things after only a few miles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is why Erosothenes performed his experiment on solstice at noon, when the sun is directly above the observer. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you were confused by the diagram...  If the sun&#39;s light is local and diverges from a point that&#39;s nearby we would expect different angles on a flat plane.  Eratosthenes&#39; experiment assumes all light arrives to earth in parallel rays.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t fly <em>across</em> it.  They don&#39;t circumnavigate <em>over</em> it.  Sure you can go around it, it&#39;s a circle.</p>

<p>Why can I look at Jupiter, see it turn and see its satellites orbit them? There is a lot of evidence they arent just lights.</p>

<p>TIL lights can&#39;t move?  All postulations for why they move are only that.  It isn&#39;t any kind of scientific proof and demonstrates nothing about the earth.  You have to make giant leaps of faith to decide these things are the same as the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With gravity we can know exactly how they behave down to the centimeters.</p>

<p>&quot;Gravity&quot; is nothing but mathematics.  People observe the way these lights move and then invent masses so that it&#39;ll fit their equations.  The geometry of these movements is observable, the attribution of that movement to forces that originate from their mass is entirely imagination.  It&#39;s never been proven.</p>

<p>Yeah, they say the same thing about the Apollo 17 image that used over and over and over.  Use your own discernment.  Believe what you want dude.  My point is that all of these things are circumstantial but deceptively put out as if they&#39;re actual facts.  These are their best proofs for a globe?</p>

<p>I am very well versed in this so please dont start off with an attack on my ability. </p>

<p>I&#39;m explaining why none of these things is an actual scientific proof.</p>

<p>Thats the problem many of your answer have zero supporting evidence. You appear to be making assumptions, not scientific proofs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure you understand. This is the reason the people who believe in the globe say that we can see a lunar eclipse while the sun is in the sky. I agree it&#39;s a bullshit answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im still not following. Do you want to know why we can see the moon during the day? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because not only would you need a telescope accurate enough to discern that light, you also have to deal with the atmosphere. There are numerous examples of people seeing skylines across lakes when they should be hidden by the curve. But comparing 40 or 60 miles to over 300? It&#39;s a big leap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mostly explained by refraction which is why there is a max. Why can I see through 200 miles of atmosphere to see lights in the sky but I cant see a landmass or a ship 200 miles away when looking through the same atmo? I should be very easily able to see Cuba from Florida but we cant, no one can. </p>

<p>Why is this not more consistent? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you see a traffic light 50 miles away? Your eye stops being able to discern things after only a few miles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you offer no proof... We can see the sun and moon both very far away (Even on a FE, relatively) so why does their light have their own rules? You also cant see a traffic light 50 miles away because of curvature, not because of brightness. </p>

<p>Light will diffuse after a certain distance depending on brightness. Unless you can show me some information about why light cant travel far Im moving on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know how you were confused by the diagram... If the sun&#39;s light is local and diverges from a point that&#39;s nearby we would expect different angles on a flat plane. Eratosthenes&#39; experiment assumes all light arrives to earth in parallel rays</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not sure why Sagans explanation wasnt sufficient or why you cant understand that your photo wont work. </p>

<p>Erostothanes performed this on solstice, the sun is directly above. If the Earth were flat we would see either the same size shadows (As your image showed), no shadows or opposite shadows. Instead we see shadows of differing lengths which mean that the Earth is curved, otherwise the outcome would be different. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t fly across it. They don&#39;t circumnavigate over it. Sure you can go around it, it&#39;s a circle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when you said there are no flights over it you actually meant no flights over certain parts? Can you source that for me? You can fly over antarctica but there are certain conditions. </p>

<p>So if I can circumnavigate antarctica doesnt that mean its not an ice wall surrounding the planet? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have no model to show their movement in a coherent way. Explain to me why Mars moves the way it does. Its really simple. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s never been proven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism hasnt been proven... </p>

<p>But again no one has an alternative no one can offer up a competing model. So you cant say its fake and then not replace it with an equal explanation. </p>

<p>I cant argue with your faith. You believe they are fake but offer up no evidence they are. </p>

<p>tldr; You offer no scientific proofs and your arguments are easily debunked. </p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about lunar eclipses.  <a href="http://www.passmyexams.co.uk/GCSE/physics/images/eclipse_lunar.gif">During a lunar eclipse the sun, earth, and moon are supposed to be in alignment.</a>  This means it shouldn&#39;t be possible to see both in the sky at once but it&#39;s explained as an <a href="https://www.space.com/27338-total-lunar-eclipse-rare-sunrise-selenelion.html">illusion, caused by the atmosphere refracting the light.</a>  You yourself said this is a bullshit explanation.</p>

<p>The faith of people that believe in the globe is what always causes the impasse.  I acknowledge that the flat earth is not proven through evidence, and neither is the globe.  The difference is that I&#39;m willing to scrutinize the explanations for the globe the same way  I do for the flat.  I don&#39;t know whether the earth is flat, but I know that the evidence given for the globe is circumstantial at best and lies at worst.  Your only defense is &quot;There is no better model&quot; but that&#39;s irrelevant to whether the one you&#39;re using is true, and not even true.</p>

<p>There is overwhelming amounts of evidence the world is a globe, If you have any other points to discuss I would be more than happy to point out the issues in your arguments. </p>

<p>I was also being polite by saying there isnt a better model, there is no model out there that explains why the Earth behaves like it does. FE started as a disinfo campaign that people thought was real. </p>

<p>Look into the evidence like I have and there is no option but the world is a globe. </p>

<p>Why not?  Still assuming a lunar eclipse is caused by earth&#39;s shadow?  Nice cartoon btw.  So scientific.  I forgot people are 1000 miles tall.  Even the article I linked you admits it&#39;s geometrically impossible and can only be explained as the light refracting around the earth via the atmosphere.  &quot;An illusion caused by the atmosphere is not an acceptable answer.&quot; Except when it&#39;s your idols saying it?</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read they take two data sets, L1 and L2 then snap them onto a grid of lattitude and longitude measurements.</p>

<p>However, I am not technologically versed in all this stuff and would love a dumbed down explanation of how multi spectrum images are not doctored when they clearly are at least adjusted for color. The sattellite is 1 million miles above earth and can even take pictures of the moon in the view of earth pictures. I think if these could be proven legitimate it puts a huge kink in flat earth theory. But I&#39;ve always believed the earth to be hollow, not really a flat plane.</p>

<p>But that would be like saying DLSR images are fake, because they might take more than one photo and combine them into one. </p>

<p>The thing takes 10 photos at different wavelengths and combines them with geodata (as I understand it) So it would be similar to a camera taking 3 photos of just blue, green and red and overlaying them to produce a full image. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re finding the truth friend.  All of us on the flat earth side started off seeing it as a big joke.  Most of us first looked into it to debunk it and found ourselves stumped.</p>

<p>The further you delve into it, the more everything falls into place.  I think the biggest barrier people have to get past is their blind faith in cosmological science.  Once you realize that all of the &quot;proof&quot; for the mainstream cosmological model has to come from space agencies, and how often these space agencies are caught in lies, you see that there isn&#39;t really proof for their globe model.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the earth is exactly flat, but I know that the globe is constantly pushed and supported through lies.  For example, <a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2017-01-students-breathtaking-curvature-earth-high-altitude.html">this article claims we can see the curvature of the earth in this high altitude video</a>.  The problem is that this statement can be shown to be plainly false.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jdImh">It&#39;s a fish eye lens which is apparent from the very beginning of the video</a>.</p>

<p>So are the people putting out the article too stupid to realize that the image is being distorted?  Could they not figure out something so obvious?  Or are they purposefully putting this stuff out to reinforce the brainwashing.  Most people probably won&#39;t watch the video, just look at the pictures.  The people that do watch the video probably don&#39;t look at it critically enough to realize it&#39;s an illusion.  That&#39;s how they keep the lie going.</p>
