        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to ask a simple question that I was curious to see what other people think on the matter. So for as long as there have been humans there have been all kinds of groups: cults, druids, shamans, priests, nuns, monks, Buddhas, etc all with the opinion that their group is proper to follow for &quot;x,y,z&quot; reason and people gravitate to whoever one for whichever reason. This being said people continue for generations to follow their groups and all while none of the groups ever really present or offer any form of evidence, kind of blindly following and just hoping things are how their higher ups tell them it is in the end. I want to know from you guys, who or what would be behind these groups of people and what would be their purpose if it&#39;s all just make believe anyways? Hopefully I didn&#39;t confuse y&#39;all too badly but I was just trying to make this easy to read and understand. This isn&#39;t a religion debate, it&#39;s a thread regarding how are these things able to go on for so long and people still follow them and who is behind them and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the Abrahamic religions, and most organized religions are a control system. The one that converts the most followers will be the one that the NWO uses, and right now I&#39;m thinking thats going to be Islam since they are hyper-militaristic and will kill non-believers. Most people who refuse to convert will die, and the rest will convert out of fear or a desire to live with privileges. Now I believe spirituality and the original message of Jesus Christ is real, whether you get that from mushrooms, prayer, or whatever. But that is something you don&#39;t have to pay for, and it is unique to you. You can experience the love of God, and be apart of the divine, we all can, and I think this is the most rebellious thing in the world. Organized religions want to trap you in a system, and prevent you from experiencing the divinity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but what I was talking about is the us vs them mentality that these groups harbour for one another. You either follow their rules, identify as one of them, worship only their god or prophets, marry within the group otherwise you are the enemy. Hindus, many pagans, druids, buddhists, can all worship other gods within their religions, marry whoever, and etc. They are definitely not as restrictive as the Abrahamic religions. Resources were scarce in the Middle East, and in group preference was definitely an adaptation to survive in the harsh environment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say that organized religion exists for people who a) crave clear, established and handed down from above rules about right and wrong; and b) have a very low tolerance for the inherent ambiguity and mystery of the universe. </p>

<p>I view religious texts as interpretations of the divine.  Even if rooted spiritual truth, the human interpretation is what drags it into the realm of our imperfect selves, which is why religion sometimes serves the greater but is so easily wielded as a weapon of mass destruction.  I don&#39;t see any of them as immune in this respect, other than indigenous belief systems, which tend to take a more humble view of humanity&#39;s place in the universe.  Other than that, the radicalizing variable in all religions seems to be access to the basic elements of living, i.e. food, water, education, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not <em>all</em> make-believe.  A lot of it is proto-science.  Jews were told not to eat shellfish or pork, because it would probably make them sick.  Muslims fasted in the spring because that&#39;s when they would run out of food anyways.  At the same time, ancient Egyptians and Romans would hold religious festivals in which the wealthy would open their stores and give food away.  Catholics are good at incorporating beneficial practices from other religions, and flat-out making up new ones -- eating fish on Fridays because fish is cheap protein almost everywhere, but an acquired taste.</p>

<p>Some of it is control, obviously.  But most people are dumb and writing and education were not widespread until recently, so there is obviously selective pressure to play follow-the-leader.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just commented about this same subject. Check out the below links to the Urantia Book. It explains how religions evolved throughout our history.</p>

<p>A person by the name Machiventa Melchizedek (Prince of Salem) arrived on Earth 1,973 years before Jesus. His teachings are the base of most religions, if not all.</p>

<p>Urantia book suggests that there are bits of truth in every religion, but no single religion has all the truth. We would be better suited to take the best examples from each, and combine them, versus focusing on the negative aspects of a particular religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The spiritual truth of the world is found in the Bible, specifically the King James Bible if you&#39;re looking for it in English.  Most if not all religions exist to confuse or outright deny this truth as it is given.  At the root these false religions are Satanic.  They seek to draw people away from God&#39;s plan into any other avenue that will lead to destruction.</p>

<p>Most false religions carry the same lies that the serpent told Eve in the garden.  &quot;Ye shall not surely die&quot; and &quot;ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil&quot;.  Satan tells people that they won&#39;t surely die and that they can obtain godhood, typically through knowledge.  This is echoed by most false religions that proclaim reincarnation and that people can evolve into higher beings, become &quot;enlightened&quot;, or become one with God.</p>

<p>The other main attribute of these religions is the idea that you can work your way to heaven, or some kind of paradise/nirvana state.  That by living a certain kind of life or doing enough good deeds, you can attain paradise.  This is manifest in ideas such as karma or Catholicism&#39;s teachings of performing sacraments.  These religions also tend to teach that any religion can bring someone to this paradise because there are many ways to achieve it.</p>

<p>This is directly contrary to everything in the Bible.  The Bible teaches that there is one God and no other gods shall ever be formed.  The Bible teaches that none are righteous and none can save themselves, there is only one path to eternal life, and that it cannot be achieved by works.  It is a free gift contingent only on you accepting it as such.  Understanding that it was paid for by Jesus Christ himself and that your works are meaningless to God in terms of salvation.</p>

<p>Organized religions that seek to control people cannot condone this truth because it removes the authority of the men who control them.  It bars them from their ability to gatekeep people of their salvation/enlightenment and impose their own will.  When people are assured by the scripture that they have everlasting life and can do with it whatsoever they choose, they are empowered to choose to do good.  They know the truth, and the truth sets them free.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. (John 14:6)</p>

<p>For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)</p>

<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. (John 5:24)</p>

<p>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? (John 11:25-26)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, while there are many different groups to join and choose from there are also groups of people primarily tribes who have no outside contact with anyone and they are totally oblivious to all else. I just find that interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but what I was talking about is the us vs them mentality that these groups harbour for one another. You either follow their rules, identify as one of them, worship only their god or prophets, marry within the group otherwise you are the enemy. Hindus, many pagans, druids, buddhists, can all worship other gods within their religions, marry whoever, and etc. They are definitely not as restrictive as the Abrahamic religions. Resources were scarce in the Middle East, and in group preference was definitely an adaptation to survive in the harsh environment. </p>
