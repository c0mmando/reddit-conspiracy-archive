        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-06-15 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ifitoldyouthe.html">ifitoldyouthe</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please go look at the human body in any search engine or physical text. If you are experiencing the Mandela Effect then you&#39;ll probably notice we just experienced a massive shift in the human anatomy.</p>

<p>If you are not experiencing the ME, one of 2 things will happen when you look at the pictures. </p>

<p>You may call me crazy and/or stupid. That&#39;s ok. I&#39;m not writing this for you. </p>

<p>Or, you may look at the images and realize something freaking wild is happening. Because something freaking wild is happening.</p>

<p>Here are my initial impressions on the anatomy changes from comments I made elsewhere. Originally, someone posted asking, vaguely, if anyone noticed any changes to the ribs. I looked and responded with:</p>

<p>...way more cartilage. Twice the amount, I&#39;d guess. The cartilage seems to cave in a bit creating a shadow effect.</p>

<p>The entire shape is different. In diagrams it&#39;s more barrel shape. In real images of skeletons it&#39;s like squished up? Smaller and wider? Hard to describe.</p>

<p>These ribs are completely new. Does that explain the upper body pain lots of MEers have described the last couple of weeks?</p>

<p>Then I checked out the rest of the anatomy and responded with: </p>

<p>More of an overbite. The spine is thicker/wider, especially the base. The collarbone seems more offset, prominent, and wavey. The arms look ganglier. </p>

<p>The bowtie sternum is much larger and thicker. The knees seem more bowlegged. Floating ribs are way more obvious. The ribs come so far up the neck, almost to the jaw. </p>

<p>Shoulder blades and pelvis keep getting bigger. The large intestines are getting larger. The dents in the sides of our skulls are getting bigger. </p>

<p>And a lot of the skeletons online appear to be smiling. That&#39;s lovely. </p>

<p>Posting links to images because I want people who are just scrolling through new posts to see this too.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about your name. I discovered last night that the meaning of my name has drastically changed. Here is a post I made about that in another sub:</p>

<p>My name is in the dictionary but, if you hear it used at all, it&#39;s usually as a name. But it&#39;s a pretty archaic word. The definition has drastically changed.</p>

<p>I googled it (Google your name then come back here) and the first definition was as usual. The second definition is completely new.</p>

<p>I know the definition of my name. I was named after something for a specific reason. Do I even need to prove I knew the definition?</p>

<p>The second (and sometimes given as first!! WHAT?) definition is barely related to the first.</p>

<p>The new definition is related to me though. It&#39;s my profession.</p>

<p>Imagine your name is ASDF and it&#39;s always meant fat. That&#39;s it. Just fat. Now the very common second definition is a butcher. And you are a freaking butcher.</p>

<p>You would have known. I would have known. Look up your name. Freak out with me.</p>

<p>Ps. Discovered this today under hugely synchronistic circumstances.</p>

<p>Ps2. Don&#39;t share too much info. People are sneaky and can use your old comments to put pieces together. Or use a throwaway.</p>

<p>Immediately after posting, it became apparent that my name&#39;s meaning wasn&#39;t the only one to have changed. So far, about 20 pretty drastic name changes have been documented.</p>

<p>Has your name (first, middle, last, maiden) changed? Would really like to hear so but please be careful with details, obviously. </p>

<p>So, that&#39;s your Mandela Effect update. Any questions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Further explanation on the name change: My name is so perfect for my profession it&#39;s like a veterinarian being named Dr. Feline or a firefighter named Inferno. But not one person ever made the connection? </p>

<p>I have degrees in the field and not one professor ever remarked on how fitting my name is. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked with some people who would definitely had made known, either jokingly or with great arrogance in their esoteric knowledge, that my actual given name is relevant. Not once. </p>

<p>This is just incredible to me. </p>

<p>Any other name changes? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ME community only wonders if there are physical symptoms related to shifting. Never claimed proof of that. But when every picture of the human anatomy is different and you can feel some changes for yourself (like location of heartbeat), it&#39;s natural to wonder if those unexplained sudden appearing and then disappearing symptoms are connected. </p>

<p>Also, my heritage via this name has been traced back a long, long time to Wales, and New England in the 1750s. I have googled it a number of times and the results have always been similar. Typically the first thing is the (ghost)town in Wales, followed by a couple sort-of prominent figures in history and then the facebook pages of people I mostly don&#39;t know, and the family crest. </p>

<p>This time however the first return was a company founded in 1983, in South America, that is still operating and apparently succesful. I have never seen this before. It&#39;s possible that they only recently have a web presence but it seems so unlikely as it is a consumer/retail type of business. My name is so far from anything Spanish, and has nothing to do with the founder (from what I can tell based on the wikipedia page) that I&#39;m really scratching my head over here. I can see how it&#39;s possible the algo has changed and before it excluded the results geographically. </p>

<p>This however is the reason I decided to comment at all: half my family is mormon and most of my cousins have gone to South America on their missions, including one I know for sure was in the country where this company was founded. Never once has anybody mentioned this coincidence to me. I just don&#39;t know anything anymore, man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been digging a little deeper and the backstory of the company I can see how the name came to be, but then I also find out that the company wasn&#39;t founded in &#39;83, but the year of my oldest sibling&#39;s birth, and was incorporated in &#39;83 which is the year of my other sibling&#39;s birth. Wtf? </p>

<p>And then there is an obvious pop culture coincidence  to the whole thing, which is just sending me down the majick/ME dimension jumping rabbit hole. </p>

<p>Holy Hell!</p>

<p>Also I had pains in my backbone and ribs for the last two weeks, if that matters.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t remember that skulls used to smile before.</p>

<p>The pain in the back and ribs was a common complaint among MEers before this latest anatomy shift but who knows really. </p>

<p>Life could be a psyop for all I know. Something weird is going on and I wish I knew what it was. For the etymology and recorded meaning of a word to change in this way, like it&#39;s just always been this way, that ain&#39;t normal. </p>

<p>Thanks for checking your name. Does the anatomy look different to you? </p>

<p>Yes, it is.</p>

<p>My name is Anna. Previously it meant &quot;favor&quot;, &quot;merciful&quot; (in Russian &quot;благодать&quot;, &quot;милостивая&quot;). I remember it well because when I was a teen, this meaning seemed boring and tasteless to me. I hated my name tbh.</p>

<p>Now the first meaning in Russian is &quot;grace&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; (&quot;грациозная&quot;, &quot;миловидная&quot;). In English it&#39;s the second one.</p>

<p>Guess I like my name now!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It sounds crazy, but it seems to me that my arms are too long. Now the hands almost reach the middle of the thighs, and the elbows are below the waist level. It feels like the arms were a few centimeters shorter.</p>

<p>As if before, they looked like <a href="http://www.visualdictionaryonline.com/images/human-being/human-body/woman/posterior-view.jpg">that</a>, and now it&#39;s like <a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-woman-body-measurement-chart-scheme-for-measurement-human-body-for-sewing-clothes-female-figure-512271703.jpg">that</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! That&#39;s what I was thinking about the arms - ganglier. The proportion is off. Those pictures you added are awesome! Exactly what I&#39;d say are before and after. </p>

<p>My middle name is Ann but I can&#39;t remember ever looking it up. I wonder if it changed in the same way as yours. Grace and beautiful are a billion times nicer! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I must correct myself: pains in the backbone started three weeks ago, maybe even earlier, but I was busy and didn&#39;t pay attention. And the arms not just seems longer, but I also feel they are heavier now, which is logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t spend much time thinking about physical symptoms when there is just no way to know. The body has been in metamorphosis for some time though. I first noticed the eye sockets changed in 2008. Way before the ME for me. But off course we make excuses and the changes seemed more subtle. What ever this is, it&#39;s happening faster and faster. And I do know that sounds crazy but I also know the spinal column never shot up through the middle of our skulls and our kidneys were not at all under the ribs. Sigh. </p>
