       The military base is Qatar's only hope. Now whether the rest of the country is ruled by Saudis or Qatar's make no difference to America.

       We can just watch and enjoy the fight from that base. Qatar won't be able to do shit when they turn into Saudi Arabia.

       Keep up the good fight my fellow centipede! Obama is a war criminal, traitor, and a muslim. He was the worst president in US hisotry. President Trump, on the other hand, is bombing actually terrorist and not hospitals like Obama. Good for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure you, like myself, know President Trump will go down as the one of the best presidents in hisotry, second to only George Washington no doubt. But we must continue to spread the word, spread the truth about President Trump, and keep on spreading the truth about Traitor Obama.

       He was given a Nobel Peace Prize and was then hypocritically responsible for countless innocent lives lost as collateral damage in drone strikes. He can be deplorable and so can Trump, but you keep pushing a one-or-the-other agenda and it makes very little sense.

       Yeah, ok. So he asked for the prize?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is he a hypocrite when someone else gave him a prize he didn't ask to have. Thing is, bush was so damn bad (conservative - just like the mullahs in the middle east) that the world felt relieved to have a decent man in the whitehouse for a change.

       I would give hitler the peace prize after bush (and I voted for him once)

       It's hypocritical to not imbue the qualities one should possess if considered for the award. Shame on him and on the ones who selected him. Similar to how Saudi Arabia was awarded for Women's Rights. Bottom line is he campaigned on undoing all of the largely neoconservative practices such as the torture program, drone program, and Guantanamo Bay. Those are the reasons he was considered for the award. He continued and expanded the functions of those programs rather than fulfilling the promises that won him the award. He was no different than Bush in his policy towards the middle east in general.

       Comparing someone to Hitler doesn't necessarily help any argument. Again, falls in line with your comments being sensationalist and deliberately emotional and misleading.

       If you want us out of the middle east, find an alternative to people commuting 30 mins in their single occupancy SUVs, eating cheeseburgers and running the ac at 60°F for a 2.4ksqft building which hold 2 people and a dog. In other words, figure out and disseminate a lifestyle that doesn't demand infinite cheap oil inputs. Then we might have a reason to withdraw from the most oil-rich region of the world.
