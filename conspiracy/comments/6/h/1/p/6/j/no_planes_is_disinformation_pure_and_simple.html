    <div class="md"><p>I think that for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>One of the biggest and the most solid is they would never have used a second plane. Are you saying no actual witness saw a second plane?</p>

<p>All inconsistencies can be attributed to pixelation related shit. It was 2001. Saying the plane entering the building looks &quot;weird&quot; from some dude&#39;s household camcorder that was made in 1998 isn&#39;t a smoking gun.</p>

<p>It was a conspiracy but I think no planes is pushing it. Millions of witnesses. Who in NYC was not looking at the twin towers after the first plane?</p>

<p>There would be like 50k people who say there was no plane. Not the one video of some guy on the street saying it was &quot;a bomb&quot;. Pretty sure that guy just had a different view of the building and only saw an explosion.</p>

<p>You are not answering my question. <strong>What about the 1000&#39;s of witnesses (New Yorkers) that saw the plane?</strong></p>

<p>Are you denying every account of eyewitness testimony by New Yorkers? </p>

<p>See, this is why NO PLANES is worthless. At the end of the day there&#39;s always a debunker who will dismiss any evidence in support of their pet theory. Yet the controlled demolitions are the only key piece of evidence being ignored by playing <em>disinfo whack-a-mole</em> - TM. </p>

<p>The simple fact that all of new york city was looking at the towers with their own eyes and saw a plae is all the evidence you need.</p>

<p>There is reason the debunkers love to just say &quot;a bunch of nutjobs who think George Bush put CGI planes on every news channel.&quot;</p>

<p>9/11 was not a conspiracy that involved thousands of people in the media and the government. That simply is not the case. The regular cameraman and intern at the local station would surely know that a fucking plane was not in the original footage.</p>

<ul>
<li>The flashes of light seen right before the plane hit the building</li>
<li>The black-out occuring the exact moment the nose of the plane (or debris, as the official story goes) comes out the other side, <strong>across all video material</strong> (What are the odds of that?!)</li>
<li>The fact that the footage from the helicopter 5 miles away, zoomed out, doesn&#39;t show the plane where it was supposed to be?</li>
<li>The numerous minor mistakes/oddities regarding shadows, lack of damage, lack of destruction to the plane on impact, ...</li>

   into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will

   aircraft to its original status.  The drone aircraft
   meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan.  When
   over Cuba the <strong>drone will being transmitting on the inter-

   is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft.  The transmission
   will be interrupted by the destruction of aircraft which will

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly certain this is disinformation. I believe the government/elites have technology that is decades ahead of ours. Plus if you watch the videos of the planes hitting it looks a little fishy. The planes literally explode upon impact as if they were wired with explosives from nose to tail. You don&#39;t see any projectiles or large pieces of the plane falling to the street below.</p>

<p>Agree to disagree</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repeating, because <strong>the longer you ignore two <em>key</em> pieces of evidence against &#39;no planes&#39; the worse you look!</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How did TV stations broadcast &#39;no planes&#39; in front of thousands of New Yorkers live, without any video to manipulate? </li>
</ul>

<p>Ignored this pertinent question. Shocker!</p>

<ul>
<li>One major problem with the &quot;no plane theory&quot;... (aside from the many, many, many videos) what about the 1000&#39;s of witnesses that saw the plane?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ignored another pertinent question. Shocker!</p>

<p><strong>Your retorts show &#39;no planes&#39; is worthless disinformation.</strong> Thanks for doing OPs work for him! There&#39;s a term for someone who is useful to me, but doesn&#39;t really realize they are useful! </p>
