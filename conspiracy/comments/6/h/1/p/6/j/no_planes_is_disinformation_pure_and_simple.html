       I think that for a number of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest and the most solid is they would never have used a second plane. Are you saying no actual witness saw a second plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       All inconsistencies can be attributed to pixelation related shit. It was 2001. Saying the plane entering the building looks "weird" from some dude's household camcorder that was made in 1998 isn't a smoking gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a conspiracy but I think no planes is pushing it. Millions of witnesses. Who in NYC was not looking at the twin towers after the first plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       There would be like 50k people who say there was no plane. Not the one video of some guy on the street saying it was "a bomb". Pretty sure that guy just had a different view of the building and only saw an explosion.

       How did TV stations broadcast 'no planes' in front of thousands of New Yorkers live, without any video to manipulate?

       One major problem with the "no plane theory"... (aside from the many, many, many videos) what about the 1000's of witnesses that saw the plane?

       Because you can manipulate live video. Again do you have videos of these witnesses saying they saw the plane? I don't necessarily believe the no planes theory, but I have an open mind.

        What about the 1000's of witnesses (New Yorkers) that saw the plane?

       See, this is why NO PLANES is worthless. At the end of the day there's always a debunker who will dismiss any evidence in support of their pet theory. Yet the controlled demolitions are the only key piece of evidence being ignored by playing

       First I find it odd you just reference your own post with "There's no questions about videos on OPs thread!" you're talking about yourself...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's your rhetorical question:
"How did TV stations broadcast 'no planes' in front of thousands of New Yorkers live, without any video to manipulate?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Live is video is video and it can be manipulated live...how was your question rhetorical? Because you seemed to be repeating it over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also does everyone have to answer your questions, you seem to repeat over and over without actual discussion, before they can comment on your OP?

       I agree. I'm not saying I believe this but even those planes simply not being civilian planes and some sort of drone makes more sense then CGI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple fact that all of new york city was looking at the towers with their own eyes and saw a plae is all the evidence you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is reason the debunkers love to just say "a bunch of nutjobs who think George Bush put CGI planes on every news channel."

      <p>
       9/11 was not a conspiracy that involved thousands of people in the media and the government. That simply is not the case. The regular cameraman and intern at the local station would surely know that a fucking plane was not in the original footage.

       One major problem with the "no plane theory"... (aside from the many, many, many videos); What about the 1000's of witnesses that saw the plane?

       Every comment you replied to was the exact same thing. You referred to you own post as it wasn't you who posted it. That's just weird man!

       The towers were brought down, you are attacking others who might have a slightly different theory of how it was exactly done. Yet we are all on the same team.

       I'd also say you didn't really rip it apart...if you don't know what having a brand new account says about you here, then you probably don't belong to this community.

       So what you're saying is we should completely
       <strong>
        ignore
       </strong>
       anything that documentary (The Key) brings forward, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The flashes of light seen right before the plane hit the building
       </li>
       <li>
        The black-out occuring the exact moment the nose of the plane (or debris, as the official story goes) comes out the other side,
        <strong>
         across all video material
        </strong>
        (What are the odds of that?!)
       </li>
       <li>
        The fact that the footage from the helicopter 5 miles away, zoomed out, doesn't show the plane where it was supposed to be?
       </li>
       <li>
        The numerous minor mistakes/oddities regarding shadows, lack of damage, lack of destruction to the plane on impact, ...
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There's a couple more fair points being brought up, though in essence you're saying all of these points are bullshit, despite being
       <strong>
        true
       </strong>
       in nature, regardless if there were physical planes or not?

       Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.  From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status.  The drone aircraft
meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan.  When
over Cuba the drone will being transmitting on the inter national distress frequency a "MAY DAY" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft.  The transmission will be interrupted by
       <strong>
        the destruction of aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal.

       Why are you questioning eyewitness testimony? Many eyewitnesses saw and heard explosives. Are you denying their (mainly first responders) eyewitness testimony too?

       There are many reasons to believe there were explosives in my opinion, the eyewitnesses reporting them just supports the theory. Ofcourse the theory may still be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the case of the planes... It really got me thinking. What other evidence do we have besides a few eye witnesses and some footage (that I now find highly suspicious by the way after watching that video)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't know what to believe. I don't know if there were planes or not.

       Wow, I've always believed no plain theory is unreasonable. But after watching this, the least I can say is I'm not so sure about that anymore. Very interesting.

       "no planes" has to be made up by some kids who weren't alive in 2001, considering at least a million people in NY saw the planes with their own two eyes- not on a screen but in reality, a realm where CGI has no effect....

       a. An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and
   numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered
   aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the
   Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be
   subsituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be
   loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under
   carefully prepared aliases.  *

       aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of
   Florida.  From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying
   aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly
   into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will
   have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the
   aircraft to its original status.  The drone aircraft
   meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan.  When
   over Cuba the

   will be interrupted by the destruction of aircraft which will
   be triggered by radio signal.

       Not exactly certain this is disinformation. I believe the government/elites have technology that is decades ahead of ours. Plus if you watch the videos of the planes hitting it looks a little fishy. The planes literally explode upon impact as if they were wired with explosives from nose to tail. You don't see any projectiles or large pieces of the plane falling to the street below.
