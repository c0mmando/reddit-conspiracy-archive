        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/06/10/the-math-behind-why-overwatchs-loot-boxes-are-exhausting-to-unlock/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/06/10/the-math-behind-why-overwatchs-loot-boxes-are-exhausting-to-unlock/</a></p>

<p>This has laid somewhat heavy on my heart for awhile now; and I feel the need to post it after getting into a ridiculous argument on the xbox one subreddit regarding shady business practices by Microsoft. Almost all triple A(AAA) games even ones that cost full price, contain these loot boxes with unknown odds. I tried out Madden for the first time in 10 years this past fall, as it looked really good and the thought of building a fantasy team of all time great players with todays graphics excited me.  I came to find out that you need to spend an insane amount of time, or money in order to compete online for the most part. </p>

<p>Madden ultimate team mode for those unaware is full of BF Skinner style devices(<a href="http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/skinner.html">http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/skinner.html</a>)
You can earn bronze gems to unlock silver gems to unlock gold gems to unlock elite gems to then spend on what you HOPE contains a pack of something good; if not start all over.  OR you can just skip all that and spend $100 on just 10 packs of virtual playing cards.  I believe there is a huge disconnect between the individuals responsible for regulating this(or maybe they are bought off/just don&#39;t care) and the people actually playing these games.  Its pretty recent that it has become THIS widespread, and I don&#39;t feel most parents are fully aware of how insidious even long standing game franchises have become. I certainly wasn&#39;t prepared for what Madden had in store for me, and I&#39;m ashamed to say I spent $200 myself before quitting as I have ADHD and an addictive personality.  I would like others thoughts on this, as the videogame industry for whatever reason seems so immune to conspiracy talk or criticism. Sorry this post is somewhat haphazardly put together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been bitching about micro transactions and RNG in gaming for years now. It&#39;s what it&#39;s become. Buy the game for $60 then spend more money to be better than everybody else. Gaming has gone downhill over the years.

<p>Loot boxes and such in Overwatch and Destiny is like a crack addiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I play Overwatch, paid $60.  Christmas I paid $80 for 100 lootboxes.  Felt dumb paying more for lootboxes vs the price of the game - but in my defense it is my favorite game, it is a great put together game, Blizzard is a quality company that invests in great servers and programmers.</p>

<p>Am I addicted?  Nah.  It was double XP weekend, yet I still went to the lake.  I gamed that night, but enjoyed real life first.  By policy I like to never pay more cash for DLC than the game cost.  For apps I like on the phone, I will never ever pay more than $10 for anything.  Makes no sense to me to pay more than $10 into a phone app when I can goto Walmart and get a sweet console game for $20.</p>

<p>So will addictive personalities find things to trigger that feel?  Sure.  All platforms have it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>how do you feel about the fact games take so much time, and are so in depth these days, that many spend so much time lost in virtual worlds rather than being engaged in the real one, praying/meditating, helping others, etc...some can smoke cannabis fine, and others allow it to become habit forming. some can play ESO online at a relatively normal pace, others will get lost in the world and neglect things that really matter in regards to their soul until its too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Micro transactions? More like giving away small pieces of what is left of my soul away. I&#39;ve been gaming for a few years and I always promised myself I&#39;d never do the micro transactions.... I have almost all the store bought mounts in WoW, a few pets from the shop, and gold tokens that blizzard now sell. To be fair, I couldn&#39;t maintain that and drugs, so I stopped my smoking. One positive benefit...? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a choice, my friend.  I have an Amazon Kindle account, and I eventually got a Steam account, which I don&#39;t use anyway; but as far as microtransactions, that&#39;s it.  No Netflix, no iTunes, nothing else.  I also don&#39;t use mobile phones because I consider them evil.</p>

<p>Your integrity is literally the only thing you have.  Give that up and you have nothing else whatsoever, regardless of whether you think money means anything.  It doesn&#39;t.  Your integrity is the only thing you can take with you.  I left WoW before the microtransactions started.  I briefly played D&amp;D Online, but I bought the full package, even though I didn&#39;t end up using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The selling my soul and the vibe of having no control was just a poor attempt by me to inject a small bit of humour into what I was writing. In that sense it didn&#39;t really communicate the point I was getting at, about how freely and fast I feel into that system without me considering exactly what I was doing. Which in hindsight isn&#39;t a good thing! If any of that makes sense? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much open and shut. Lootboxes prey upon the reward systems in our brain the same way slot machines do, and every game developer is rapidly moving towards the system since it&#39;s so freaking profitable. I don&#39;t think they are doing it with evil intentions, but simply because right now it&#39;s by far the most lucrative way to monetize a game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they care whether its &quot;evil&quot; or not, or what long term damage is done.  This to me is like hooking kids onto slot machines at a young age.  There is a reason why you have to be 21 to even enter a casino.  Furthermore, these games are so micro transaction driven that its almost impossible to play multiple games because if you don&#39;t want to spend money, you pretty much have to devote all your time to just one game to stay up with everyone else. That&#39;s another angle of conspiracy as well; keeping us distracted with amazing graphics and lost in virtual worlds.</p>
