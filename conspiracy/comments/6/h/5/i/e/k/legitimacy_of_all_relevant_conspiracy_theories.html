        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sandy Hook: Stupid</p>

<p>Russian hacking and interference in US &amp; European elections: YES, obvisouly.</p>

<p>Pizzagate: Ultra-stupid</p>

<p>Chemtrails: Way overblown and ridiculous, but at the same time, cloud seeding IS a thing.</p>

<p>NWO: NO.</p>

<p>HAARP: What a silly theory.</p>

<p>Illuminati: What? No.</p>

<p>Alex Jones: The final boss in the game of right-wing assclowns. Unfortunately, he&#39;s right about 5% of his ravings (mostly 9/11).</p>

<p>Vaccines: Clearly necessary, but ineffective needle injections need to be replaced with nanopatches (as seen on TED). </p>

<p>Freemasons: They don&#39;t run the world. Or anything.</p>

<p>UFOs: The fact that the US government made a few investigations into this gives me pause... but not all much. Most &quot;evidence&quot; has come from experimental government aircraft.</p>

<p>Crop circles: We know they&#39;re fake.</p>

<p>Zeitgeist Chapter 1: This part on religion had me convinced for years until I saw the debunked version. Regardless, its still pretty clear that Jesus was a copy of older historical messiahs.</p>

<p>Moon Landing Hoax: Obviously dumb for so many reasons. Of course we went.</p>

<p>Alien moon bases: neat one to learn about. but no.</p>

<p>Planet X: dumb.</p>

<p>Columbine: Their were more than two shooters, but I have no idea why they covered that up.</p>

<p>Jonestown, Guayana: Murdered, not Suicide. Mind control Experiment gone bad.</p>

<p>2000 US presidential election: Quite obviously rigged. That goes for Ohio in 2004.</p>

<p>Global Warming: 98% of climatologists agree. You&#39;re dumb if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>9/11: You&#39;re an idiot if you&#39;ve spent more than 10 minutes researching this and still think 19 arabs did this on their own. Bet you didn&#39;t know that Bush was planning to start operations in Afghanistan that fall anyway. </p>

<p>JFK: Again, the evidence is pretty clear. Unquestionably the CIA was involved, FBI and other agencies have fingerprints throughout as well. Lone assassin? Go home, you&#39;re drunk.</p>

<p>RFK: Sirhan Sirhan sure had some skill - able to shoot a man from the back while standing right in front of him.</p>

<p>JFK jr: much of the same, it seems.</p>

<p>MLK: FBI job. lots of evidence.</p>

<p>Pearl Harbor: They knew in advance. And no, it was not just &quot;vague&quot; intel.</p>

<p>Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki: Not necesarry AT ALL except to scare Russia and China. All of the Japanese high command were trying to surrender (Except Hirohito, but thats irrelevant). US ignored their pleas on purpose.</p>

<p>WW2: Didn&#39;t need to happen at all. The Brits, French and Yanks all hated Communism more than Fascism - that&#39;s the only reason why this war happened.</p>

<p>Lockerbie: Intelligence job</p>

<p>U.S.S. Liberty: Coverup</p>

<p>TWA flight 800: intelligence job</p>

<p>Clinton Chronicles: No one likes them, but I doubt theirs much truth to it.</p>

<p>1999 Chechan terrorist attacks in Russia: Putin and the FSB</p>

<p>7/7 bombings: intelligence job</p>

<p>1993 WTC bombings: We know this was FBI led</p>

<p>OKC bombing: This one was an especially obvious intelligence job</p>

<p>Aspartame: WHY is this legal?</p>

<p>Fluoride: Useless in drinking water. Not for mind control.</p>

<p>Lyme Disease: The debunking of &quot;Under Our Skin&quot; has been pretty weak and unconvincing. Experiment gone bad?</p>

<p>Holocaust: Happened. But you know what&#39;s stupid and unhelpful? Screaming at people for no reason who say that &quot;6 million&quot; is really more like &quot;4 million&quot;.</p>

<p>FEMA camps: stupid</p>

<p>Obama Birth Cert: Trump level stupid</p>

<p>2001 Anthrax scare: We know it was an inside job, we just don&#39;t know who - but it very plausible to assume another intelligence op.</p>

<p>Underwear bomber: We know he had help... white people help.</p>

<p>Osama Assissination: Now THERE&#39;S a clusterf*ck. Story kept changing and then thrown to sea....WHAT!!?? </p>

<p>Mumbia Attack: Headley</p>

<p>Biggie and Tupac: LOL who cares. Still good documentary.</p>

<p>Princess Diana: Doesn&#39;t seem plausible the royal family would care enough to kill her. Plus the official theory is plausible. Most things are accounted for (like the cameras). Still questions remain about blood swapping and the flash.</p>

<p>East Timor 1999: Australian intelligence</p>

<p>Flight 007: very fishy as well</p>

<p>US behind all the uprisings in Arab Spring and Ukraine. No. Read a book. You idiot.</p>

<p>I saved the best for last!
MONKEY BLOOD: Part 2 in the &quot;Ring of Power&quot; series. I beg you to watch this for epic lulz. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i don&#39;t want to go thru the whole list, so i&#39;ll just pick one and test your understanding on it.  haarp.  are you saying that haarp (or similar tech) isn&#39;t used for weather manipulation?  i know it&#39;s asking for proof of a negative but what are your reasons for thinking this?</p>

<p>do you mean radio (which is a limited spectrum by the definition of the word) or do you mean electromagnetic including microwave which does influence water (that&#39;s how microwave ovens work by exciting water molecules).  so if you mean the latter, than the evidence of it might be correlation of strange pattern precip (you know, water being affected by a field of some sort) radar images that look totes artificial to unusual high energy weather events.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HAARP is probobly the conspuracy on  this list that I researched the longest ago so i dont exactly remember how i came to my conclusions. We all saw the same documentary though. JREF and the debunking sites i recall did a good job of debunking this one. And more recently even joe rogan (i think) and jesse ventura&#39;s shows both took down the HAARP theory that it could be used as weapon to create earthquakes.</p>

<p>As for weather modification, yes they found it can work.... but only barely. Not useful enough.</p>

<p>&quot;Within germinal centers, B cells proliferate and mutate the genetic region coding for their surface antibody&quot;</p>

<p>note the mutate genetic region coding part of that sentence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that&#39;s how most people are..but thx for at least keeping an open mind to learning new things...it makes sense when you think about it - cells die much more quickly than the duration of vax shots are supposed to be effective.  for this to happen the immunological response has to be encoded in dna, in this case in specific types of cells that do that...it makes total sense...not what people want to hear..but then again, people also tend to not want to think.</p>

Quite a few of the more recent ones I&#39;m skeptical of since, the evidence never really comes out until the culprits are dead.</p>

<p>What do you think of agenda 21? Or the articles that show the 98 percent consensus on man made global warming was contrived?</p>

The presidio affair? 
Iran Contra? Mena Arkansas?
