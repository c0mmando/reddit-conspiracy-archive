       Like, I don't care at all about, say, exotic cars.  So I never go to any subs dealing with exotic cars - they're just a non-entity to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never go in those subs to be sure everyone in there knows I don't care about their cars.  I just refrain from participation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say it's something like r/ republican or r/ democrat for that matter.  I don't agree with the things they believe.  So I just don't go in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't do is go in there and tell
Them how wrong they are for posting what they do.  Post a bunch of (fake media) content to prove them wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just behave like a normal person and ignore them.   Am I the only one who does that?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why it's simply got to be clear to the mods who the shills are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that I have any suggestions for it, but just really wanted to express my extreme frustration.

       We need to do something as a community about this.  Feel free to brainstorm below.

       Looks like my post is doing just fine even though I've freely admitted it- especially since I know you can go through both histories and never once find an incident of me falsely claiming anything as one alt f/or the other.  Not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't be continuing to discuss this with you under either name though, bc it's too matrix for me to be having the conversation with the very same kinds of people this post was meant to talk
       <em>
        about.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       No thanks- you can believe what you want, and I like to converse with people who are about real exchanges of info, and nothing else.

       Exactly this. There are alot of people coming from other subs who probably aren't shills, but think they know it all because they saw it on the news or something. Their brains cannot see the big picture, so they focus on one little detail and say it isn't so. This is a conspiracy 'theory' sub, where we look at all of the evidence and start connecting dots.

       I hate the constant negativity and closed mindedness that has become so prevalent on this sub. People don't understand this is the place to talk about crazy theories and entertain these crazy ideas, I don't understand why theres so much fighting.

       The reason there is so much fighting is because the Deep state and some of its satellite organizations pay people to simply repeat on reddit what it tells us through Corporate media, as well as angrily and abusively refute any counter-narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while most of CTs will happily engage in lively debate with any real person with those views, doing so with a paid entity is an exercise in futility, and it's difficult to tell them apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the infighting.  It's really frustrating to know your government is purposefully subverting and interfering with natural conversations among its citizens.

       Go to Bizapedia and search James Alefantis, then start connecting the dots. Whether or not you believe in the pedo aspect, the money laundering network is exposed and it can be traced to foreign money from Saudis and Russians.

       Go to the senate.gov sight and find Podesta Group LD 1 disclosure form that proves the Podestas work for the Russians, or see the Foreign Agents Registry published by Congress. Russian money is pouring into the DNC.

       It's still fucking annoying. They still post all over the place and there are people who might be fooled by their bullshit even if I can avoid them just fine. Shills don't shill to change the minds of active communicators, they do it to change the minds of people reading the comments.

       The first post is def MSM and the second just has the commenters; I'm pretty sure it was those two in a row that got me going.  Hope that helps explain where my frustration originated.  Mornings seem to be MUCH better for less of these posts and comments altogether.

       I never called you a shill. I know you like self fellatio and  to cum on your self (for what? Idk - probably think your ssssspecial and love that milky white on your lips), but what does that have to do with anything I said..?.. Anyways... I shall wait.

       You started it by offering to wager 95% of your monies. That started the challenge. I then said to wager your account instead and we'll have a bet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want me to take the lead i'll happily write the rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         You must show within 1 month from now that I am using an alt or alts on this sub. Failure to do so within 1 month, and you will forfeit your account.
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Given timezones are different and a grace period, lets make that the 15th of July.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you refuse the challenge and refuse amendments to the challenge, then that proves you like to make challenges without backing them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, your 'word' is valueluess.

       Failure to respond within 24 hours will result in your loss. Which will basically give me ammo against any future claim made by you. It's like the ultimate discrediting tool.

       You have to show proof I'm a martian (we never agreed - my amendment).. That was the amendment... Dude, you're just digging yourself deeper (lmao). No one takes you seriously here. You're actually a joke, to be frank.... Keep digging... This is hilarious....

       I agree. The challenge is defining and policing the line between discussing conspiracies around a narrative and energizing the narrative itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the fundamental feeling everyone is describing is being disrespected in your own house. Ad hominem attacks by D-grade petulant mouth-breathers leaking out of the lad magazine subs.

      <p>
       Goddammit, I really enjoy imagining where the perspectives come from of people whose ideas to me are whacked the fuck out - or just simply, wildly uninformed. No one should be made to feel hesitant to post their wildest theories for fear of personal ridicule. Besides, the theories that stretch your brain cumulatively build one's capacity to see the larger patterns and motives woven throughout this reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do my best to upvote respectful disagreements or discussions and downvote the bastards before they wear us all down.

       There is a post where it explains what's going on on this sub right now...
       <br/>
       This sub is been AstroTurf by both the left and the right. And the mods have agreed to let it happen... I believe that they don't want to be seen as partisan and they don't want to get bogged down removing all the AstroTurf so like a virus they are just letting it go it's own course.(This is my assumption I really don't know)
      </p>
      <p>
       They tell me back when Bush was elected it was the same shit also with Obama..
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the only thing we can do is downvote what we don't like and just ignore the political post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I will try and start posting on real conspiracis like creepy disappearances in out natianl parks or alian human hybrids or old rituals and just kewl shit that makes you think.

       This is probably the same reason why twoxchromosomes automatically ban T_D users/commenters.  I mean, he's admitted to sexually assaulting women, and that sub is specifically meant to discuss and support women's issues.  It stands to say that if you think Donald Trump is a good person in any sense of the word, then you might not give a fuck about how women are treated.  How a person acts towards people should be a good indicator of their character.  Including and especially leaders.  Same idea with theworldisflat.  A place where you can discuss flat earth under the assumption that every single thread won't get misdirected into another "prove it's a plane/globe", or "you're an idiot" argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a line between censorship and fostering discussion by keeping out the people that completely disagree with any and all conspiracies and hence never have anything good to add to any conversation.  It's a line that I'm sure can be drawn one way or another.  I don't usually click on political threads (because I think "they" are all on the same team and unless we all quit using money, there is no way to stop them, because money is their power), but I'm not going to go on every single political thread and say that over and over and ruin the discussions with off-base remarks.

       If you had enough reading comprehension to finish and understand the complexities of my comment, you would have realized that I was advocating for banning users that are only here to say "conspiracies are dumb".  In the same way that other subs ban users that will not add to the conversations they want to have. Maybe I should use fewer words and less complex sentences so that people can understand my meaning easier.  Sigh.

       I believe in many conspiracy theories. I also believe that TPTB push bogus disinfo theories to split and discredit the community, and make anyone who questions the official explanation look crazy. For this reason, I believe critical thought and arguing against false facts and logical fallacies to be a vital part of truthseeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone believes all conspiracy theories, that's a pretty slamdunk indication that they aren't thinking critically. Trying to establish some sort of Conspiracy Purity Test can only serve to legitimize disinformation theories and muddle the real picture.

       The Truth doesn't need to be coddled, it emerges naturally from spirited, intellectually honest and rigorous discussion. That is all we need.

      </p>
      <p>
       My personal rule is if someone genuinely asks me a question then I answer but if they're bitchen for an argument, I yawn, roll my eyes and ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if there are some people who jump into posts and deliberately argue with one another in the attempt to derail the thread. Ignore those as well.

       People have been trying to force narratives on this sub for at least the past year and now others are getting tired of it and speaking out. People let it go at first, probably hoping it would take it course and pass, but it just got worse the more the propaganda and misinformation went left unchallenged. So now your seeing people actually try to stand up for truth by calling out bullshit. Those here to push a narrative don't like getting called on their lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that not everyone on this sub is obligated to believe in every ridiculous conspiracy that gets posted. And, as in any proper debate, come prepared to back your case with some facts or be ready to get called on it. This sub isn't carte blanche for those who want to spread lies unopposed.

       there's a difference between a conspiracy

      <p>
       theory: the story of who killed JFK is not what we are canonically told.

evidence: nothing that stands up to the most cursory of investigation

       see the difference? the sub has been heavily into delusions whereas in the past, in my opinion, it explored theories. that doesn't mean the theories were right, just that they were plausible or at least not completely ruled out.

       okay well unluckily for you i actually challenged myself to do this two days ago
      </p>
      <p>
       here is the experiment: you know newtonian laws of motion, right? okay, time to put those to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       get yourself a powerful rifle and some bullets. the bullet needs to travel at least a mile. build yourself a target bullseye, and at the center of the bullseye, put an X/Y axis and a bunch of hashmarks one mm apart on each axis so it's like a piece of graphing paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       now set that target up right like 10 meters away.
      </p>
      <p>
       using a vicegrip and a protractor, make a mount for your rifle so that you can extremely carefully control its angle and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       calculate the distance between the muzzle of the rifle and the very center of the bullseye and the angle of the muzzle that you'll need to make sure the bullet hits the exact center of the bullseye. now, calculate the drop of the bullet in the quantity that it will fall over the course of the 10meters between the bottom of the mount and the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, fire a shot. if you did everything right, the bullet will land directly in the middle of the bullseye, just how you calculated for it to do so. great, you've proven that you know how to do basic math and a little engineering, and you're ready to prove that the earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       record where the bullet landed. move the target back 10 meters, and repeat the shot after making a new set of calculations and adjusting the angle of the gun. record the location again, and verify that it's still landing exactly where it should-- in the exact center.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep walking back 10 more meters and repeating the experiment over and over. make sure there is no wind to mess up your experiment. eventually, you will find that your equation no longer causes the bullet to land exactly in the center, where you calculated that it would. in fact, your bullets will reliably land either to the left or to the right of the mark by a repeatably measurable amount, thanks to the hash marks you made on the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       why is this the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       there's a variable you've been missing that hasn't been relevant at shorter ranges: the rotational force of the earth. the earth is moving in a circular fashion underneath your bullet via the coriolis force
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       you can adjust your firing equation to compensate for the coriolis force, and bam, you're back on target.
      </p>
      <p>
       but couldn't a flat earth rotate, or spin in a given direction, too? it sure could, but we can disprove that very easily using our same setup. this time, instead of making our bullet go really far away by firing it along the surface of the earth, we'll fire it at a very very steep angle upward and try to have our bullet land on the target that is relatively closeby. the set of equations is different, but the idea is the same. you're going to be compensating for the coriolis force this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       when you run this experiment, you'll find that the shots land exactly where you expect, which wouldn't be the case if a flat earth were spinning or rotating. if you did this experiment on a flat earth that was spinning or rotating, your bullets would land in a different place than where you had calculated because the surface of the planet would be either panning toward the incoming bullet or away from it. if the earth were a spinning flat disk, you could bet on a cyclone in the "center" which rules that right out.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah. earth is fucking round, NASA or no.

       Cool experiment.  However I'm wondering if this same thing would happen underwater.  If so, wouldn't the left-right movement of the billet/torpedo be due to the actual spinning of the bullet? Similar to how a spinning baseball doesn't fly straight.  It's called the Magnus effect.  I'm always curious as to why people say that the coriolis effect is blamed for the bullet's flight path, but yet it doesn't affect airplanes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe doing the same experiment yet shooting in different directions would be better proof for the true cause of the flight path.

       I think it's important to challenge eachother though, especially if there's information that counters our claims. That's discussion.

       People just need to be cordial and not make fun of people for having what, at a glance, appear to be crazy ideas. They also need to not take the bait from people insulting them. Just don't engage with the agressives.

       Someone was saying that Hillary being a deep state puppet was preposterous and there is no reason to believe she was involved with pedo activity or gangs/drugs. 
I finally asked him why he was on this sub and if there were any conspiracy theories he beloved. This ended his replies. 
Why all the sheeple showing up?

       Exactly this. There are alot of people coming from other subs who probably aren't shills, but think they know it all because they saw it on the news or something. Their brains cannot see the big picture, so they focus on one little detail and say it isn't so. This is a conspiracy 'theory' sub, where we look at all of the evidence and start connecting dots.
