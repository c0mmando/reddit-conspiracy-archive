    <div class="md"><p>Not a 100% Trump supporter, but I think it&#39;s important to realize that even if Trump was a &quot;good guy&quot;, he still wouldn&#39;t have much choice over the choices &quot;he&quot; makes. Maybe they&#39;re blackmailing him. Or maybe he has some kind of divine protection around him and he was chosen by a divine power. You have to take a look at the whole 777 thing. 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days on the day of inauguration. I still love him for waking up so many Americans about the deep and sick corruption that lingers within our government. Even the biggest Trump hater has to admit this election was pretty awesome. I think Trump plays a big part in this global awakening that is occurring as I type this. So maybe he&#39;s said what he needed to say. I look at it this way, there are two Trumps. One anti-establishment, and one pure insider-globalist-scumbag. You can&#39;t deny that you&#39;ve seen both. We are living in some interesting times. Sometimes it still hasn&#39;t hit me that fucking Donald Trump is our president. This calling out of the elite won&#39;t go down in vain. I think something big is coming.</p>

<p>Trump Tower, or Trumpet Hour?</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that although the media presents themselves as hating his guts, they must really like the cash he&#39;s making them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately/fortunately, this backlash isn&#39;t scripted. Trump&#39;s actually an asshole. The media&#39;s actually corporate and politically poisoned. This is incredibly convenient for the media. Also happens to be convenient for Trump because he can campaign and evidently win on it.</p>

<p>Perhaps I characterize him wrong, but he is an asshole to anyone who doesn&#39;t like him. Can&#39;t blame him, but perhaps a better attitude is required, him being the president.

<p>His hateful rhetoric was too much for me. Had he said none of that racist/ xenophobic stuff, I would have voted for him possibly. And that&#39;s my opinion of it. Things I&#39;ve heard him say, in context, watching his rallies live, not on CNN or msm or wherever people are brainwashed. </p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is, he&#39;s a terrible person. What a shitshow. But is he any worse than the liars already there? Maybe. Pushing to cut healthcare, hating on  bomb king obama and repealing his shit just because is a scary way for some kids to remember their first president. </p>

He mocked other people in the same way, picking and choosing that one instance and not the others makes you a hyorocrtie to fit your confirmation bias for your dislike of him. This was easy as fuck to see and the media manipulated it purposefully on tv to outrage people like you who are stupid enough to fall for it in the first place. Next point. If you even spend a small amount of time researching and looking up islamic history and background youd understand how much of a fucked violent, deceitful religion it is, that doesnt mesh well with western civilization and culture. YES, not all muslims are terrible people who genuinely want to be here and assimilate properly to culture. But on the the end game with Islam, it is to spread and take over as it is outlined in a Muslim Brotherhoods guide to assimilating to western culture and to spread and infiltrate into western society as far as they can reach. This is how countries eventually fall to get taken over through assimilation and majority rule. It takes time but is doable.</p>

<p>How is preserving our culture suddenly a bad thing when there are ill intentioned people out there wanting to take that away? There is nothing phobic about legitimate concerns that are rationalized, phobias are irrational. Xenophobia is a dumb fucking buzz word liberals love to throw around to paint this picture that rational critical thinking people are racist and less than their own views because they have no argument against it.</p>

<p>Illegal immigrants, enforcing immigration laws, nuff said. I understand it sucks for well intentioned illegals to get deported, but we have laws and rules to follow in regards to immigration policy. Ive had a friend get deported (sorry Mauricio, shouldnt have gotten a DUI while living here illegally). A lot of stuff liberals cry and bitch about are either far assumptive issues or &quot;muh feels&quot; anymore when it comes to shit without a complete rational thought to it. Its either vitrolic responses in terms of name calling or virtue signaling to get other people to drown out conversation amd debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most &quot;Trump people&quot; aren&#39;t die-hard lunatics, so I assume this is meant to be directed at the lunatics on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>.</p>

<p>Ted Cruz was definitely the most anti-establishment candidate. Trump donated to the establishment on both sides all his life.</p>

<p>However, no one unbiased can deny that Clinton is the absolute embodiment of the establishment elites. Why someone who was anti-Establishment would support Trump over Clinton, their only choices, wouldn&#39;t be too hard to understand.</p>

<p>All your points are good. Unfortunately, just about everyone in Washington, including the establishment on both sides hates him so this kind of shields him from his die-hard fans figuring it out. At the same time, I&#39;m willing to believe Trump could turn 100% globalist and they&#39;d still side with him. Everyone else would likely leave or be really upset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first paragraph describes exactly the die-hard base that lives in <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine the support is growing. When you&#39;re called a racist or a sexist, you tend to get pissed off. Most people who voted for Trump, like Clinton, voted unwillingly. My assumption is that many of them would vote for him again, but willingly, out of spite. The country is heavily divided. Your post neglects the hyper-partisan atmosphere. The over-arching reasoning.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s to hold back and what&#39;s to hold back? Politics is holding everyone back, that&#39;s why we end up with two of the word presidential nominees in the history of America... I&#39;m curious, who, if you could choose any probable politician/person, would you have as President right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you figure?  </p>

<p>Trump is a Nationalist and Hillary is a New World Order globalist.  Are you familiar with the NWO agenda?  They want one world government, which means that the US would cease to exist as a sovereign nation.  It is treason for any politician to promote this agenda.  They also want to reduce the world&#39;s population to about 500 M people.  I am betting they do not want either one of us to survive.  Why would I vote for my own elimination?  Why would you?  </p>

<p>I am disappointed that the OP removed his/her question, and did not address my response.  I am also disappointed that most people still do not see the main issue clearly.  It was not too long ago that I also did not understand the main issue, so I understand.  </p>

<p>The main issue is this.  The Establishment in control of the world are New World Order globalists.  They want all world leaders to be the same.  They expected Hillary to win because she is with them.  However, Trump won.  </p>

<p>Now, how do the New World Order globalists control a Nationalist US President?  </p>

<p>Once people see things from the perspective I just laid out, it becomes apparent how to address the OP&#39;s concerns.  </p>

<p>I can provide more information if you want, but I will wait to see how you respond.  I do not want to waste my time or yours if you are really not interested.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i went to one of Trump&#39;s first public speeches as an official candidate, and he had a long list of proposals, and i listened along with the crowd,</p>

<p>and Trump would say &quot;I&#39;m going to give a tax cut to the middle class!&quot;</p>

<p>the crowd is like: meh</p>

<p>the Trump says &quot;I&#39;m gonna build a wall on the US Mexico border!&quot;</p>

<p>and the crowd goes ballistic, cheering... </p>

<p>Trump makes more policy/budget proposals that would be beneficial to the average middle class voter attending the speech, </p>

<p>and the crowd is like: meh</p>

<p>then Trump says something negative about immigrants, </p>

<p>and the crowd goes ballistic, cheering...</p>

<p>not sure if the crowd was a legitimate random sampling, or if there were provocateurs planted to stoke the mob</p>

<p>but it seemed that the only issues that got any kind of reaction was immigrant bashing and wall building. </p>

<p>it sickened me to think that these sentiments were so widespread in my community</p>

<p>but at the same time, Trump did not create these sentiments. he merely exposed them by talking about them to a mob who was already pre-disposed to these attitudes. </p>

<p>i didn&#39;t quite understand it then, and don&#39;t understand it now. </p>

<p>the USSR built a wall too. i suppose the Bolsheviks told the people that it was to keep the dirty immigrants from entering their communist utopia </p>

Also, attitude change doesn&#39;t really happen in a single encounter, especially when intense emotions are attached. That being said, we know that interactions with people who we view differently than us can reduce in-group / out-group effects. This effect is part of the Realistic Conflict Theory.</p>

<p>ever since pg this makes more sense </p>

<p>I&#39;m like, who would want a pizza delivered by drone? how would your pizza not get all jacked-up in transit? how would the drone land? how would the drone unload the pizza? how would the drone get back in the air...</p>

<p>the whole concept is absurd, and yet here is the establishment joking about this on a regular basis....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I may not answer all but i will give little input and it may be a little out of order.</p>

<p>Wilbur Ross specialized in bankruptcy, so this is something that, coming from a rich family, probably had the knowing about. Also before President Trump, guy was a democrat... shouldnt anti-trumpers like him then?</p>

<p>Ross was made cabinet because of him being &quot;pro-trade&quot;, not a one way street where we give money and not get anything back.</p>

<p>Several goldman sachs cabinet members... lets just say this helped these guys... jobs up, stocks up, country up... President Trump has no issue firing anyone if they do not live up to his standard, friend or not. He believed these people (whether you think they are scum or not) will give good input in helping the economy. So far it is working.</p>

<p>Henry Kissinger... directly from WaPo - Republican right of passage. Guy is 94. Globalist or not, he probably is in his death bed and at this point is more of a gesture.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/</a></p>

<p>You need to rephrase the terrorism boogeyman line (3) cause i have no idea what you are talking about. If you are stating terrorism is fake. You need to leave reddit and get a life...(seriously i have no idea what you mean)</p>

<p>CIA... Trying to make an professional intelligence agency legitimate, i would hope is a top priority, back something you want to fix, catch leakers, try(sp?) for treason, make them fear for there job security and life, stop traitors to this country. He backed the FBI too.</p>

<p>Bombing of Syria... Why did Obama Bomb the middle east ~26000 times in 2016... i wont go farther than that.</p>

<p>Obamas policies.. bomb things that dont matter (doctors without borders, civilians, not including crossfires) 400,000 a day (seems outrageous, no matter what side you lean one)... same price no matter where President Trump goes. We just were never told what Obama was worth a day until left-wing leaning sites started &quot;claiming&quot; after President Trump was elected. This is most likely not even real numbers, most likely Top-Secret Info seeing as it could help criminal plans figure out who, what, where, when, how many security, vehicles, spend a year planning how many vehicles go around with the President you probably will figure out the price.</p>

<p>Just in case you want to say about his wife and son living in the towers for the first few months, the Obamas did the same thing for the same exact reason. Children to finish the school year there. No Issue.</p>

<p>I am not saying I am %100 on all of this. for the most part it could be opinion, but more of a logical opinion. Take it with what you want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whilst I appreciate what your saying, and the fact that you linked me to some stuff, I find it exceptionally hard to believe that every single major event from the last decade and a half has been a hoax.</p>

<p>I like a good conspiracy as much as the next guy, and I don&#39;t doubt that the government has done some dodgy shit with ulterior motives, but imo pointing to every single major catastrophe as being a &#39;false flag&#39; or hoax, takes away any legitimacy you may have.</p>

<p>There are bad people out there, there are going to be people that just want to kill a bunch or people, or whatever.. The odds thst every single event is a hoax is just so astronomically low that it just doesn&#39;t make sense..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my thought:</p>

<p>NWO and Nationalist will go hand in hand</p>

<p>Lets start with Nationalist/Nationalism</p>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nationalism</a></p>

<p>Using that definition, any President, King, Queen, Emperor, etc would be a Nationalist. So where you think he is or is not, well its everyone cause i would think the person you voted for would care about their nation first</p>

<p>The NWO does not want nationalists. They want one ruler of the world. They want to play god with planet Earth</p>

<p>Now to go back to Kissinger, President Trump probably met the guy (in secret i assume according to ops original post, so unverified) and probably whispered in this guys ear, &quot;Fuck NWO, we will MAGA&quot;. With President Trump pulling out or re-evaluating many of these treaties/agreements/etc..., it causes many countries (primarily first world) to start spending their own money to try to fix their own issues instead of our money. </p>

<p>Money is what makes the world turn and grants power. Put us in enough debt and someone else will take control of us. </p>

<p>The NWO does not like that we are moving in the direction of a proper economy and our debt will slowly dissipate. They need us to be week. This is not an over night thing. This is (or would have been if Hilary had won) the plan that was probably hatched during the Bill Clinton presidency (If not earlier). You start with something like 9/11 and put troops on the ground, tons of money spent there, humanitarian efforts around the world costs money, treaties, agreements, bank bail outs, pay offs, etc... Sell the things we make/create to other countries, ensure we do not get anything of value in return. </p>

<p>After that we begin with a depression which in turn would turn in to a full on collapse of the U.S. People on the streets will start getting violent. Start killing each other, and we turn in to a third world country that anyone can try to invade.</p>

<p>Seeing that President Trump was elected. The NWO started pulling up the backup plan. Antifa, violent protestors, fraudulent claims of Russia collusion, etc.</p>

<p>Here is the part that really surprises me. The U.S. probably has its own version of the NWO or some type of black-ops entity. The NWO is supposed to be this all powerful elitists, and they couldnt get the Electoral College to vote for Hilary, hell the population vote ratio was not even that far off? 1 mil was all the NWO could pull off? It is almost Impossible to hack the Electoral College without threatening actual people. </p>

<p>The NWO is failing due to President Trump. Maybe not in his presidency, but somewhere in the near future, the NWO will completely be defunded since we are not paying them anymore with crap like the Paris Agreement, and they will collapse, and we will just have separate countries without some background entities. Countries like germany and france will collapse due to needing the money from us for their refugees. </p>

<p>This is just a small theory, like i always say, take from it what you will</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  I predict the NWO will make some adjustments so they do not have to suffer another election loss, like they did last November.  That had to of hurt.  </p>

<p>I believe they are pushing a bill through Congress to audit the Federal Reserve.  This needs to be done, and the Federal Reserve needs to be nationalized.  That way, we are out of this unconstitutional debt slavery.  </p>

<p>It seems like what you said is what Hitler did with his National Socialist party.  We can forego all the genocide bullshit, unless it involves the top 1%.  We can work our way down from there to see how far we need to go before we can all live in peace and prosperity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe how i worded the Nationalist part was kinda wrong. Im not talking about how Hitler handled the things, Hitler wanted a one rule/religion system he wanted to spread throughout. I was speaking to the sense of &quot;to each their own&quot;. Im guessing ya Hitler was a nationalist to germany, but i didnt mean it that way since the official definition is &quot;loyalty and devotion to a nation&quot;. Saying i am loyal to the U.S. does not mean I want everyone else in the world to be exactly like the U.S. and then go off on a genocide. </p>

<p>When people say the word nationalist they start to think about the bad things and not what it actually means. But yes the overpowerment can cause a hitler style epidemic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still want your answer, but here goes:</p>

<p>First and foremost, there isn&#39;t one single thing with Capitalism. This country was based on it, and we have laws. It has been entirely corrupted by something the rest of us can&#39;t compete with, pedo-blackmail. They throw out there &quot;corporate&quot; this and &quot;white guy&quot; that to give everyone something to blame, and they aren&#39;t necessarily lying. <em>But they made the laws</em>. And every single one of our middle-level politician is benefiting.</p>

<p>So, here comes Trump. He&#39;s not a stupid guy, btw. And he has literally been pushing every single legal limit in every possible way for decades. And now he&#39;s going to show you, illustrate to you, what the real fix is. Every single time you catch him on something, he&#39;s going to show you someone that you&#39;ve looked up to that did the same. He&#39;s showing you how rigged it is. And the rest of the establishment is freaking out about it. They are being unmasked, Trump is purposely showing us all of the tricks they devised.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get back to the pedo angle if you&#39;re interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear a lot of people claiming that he is clearly anti-establisment because the mainstream media is against him and because even republicans and conservative media was against him at first. I think there is another fairly obvious explanation.</p>

<p>As for the MSM: considering most of the MSM is liberal, it would make sense that they would give him a hard time. They want to push for their &quot;team&quot; and Trump is a very easy target.</p>

<p>As for conservative leaders/media: Trump is a very easy target. He is not someone you want to represent your team, because he makes them look bad. If they were truly against him, they wouldn&#39;t have turned everything around once he got the nomination. After the public had spoken the Republican establishment backed him up full heartedly and began to compensate by stepping up the anti-liberal sentiment and constant reminding of Hillary and Obama days.</p>

<p>As for everyone else or for other organizations that are more or less neutral: Perhaps they really just believed Trump would be a bad president. It really is not that difficult to comprehend if you can consider some other perspectives people might have on what makes for a great/successful presidency. They may also have just felt that Trump would not be good for their interests, whatever those may be.</p>

<p>This is not to say Trump is either good or bad, rather to say that strategy is a big part of politics and winning is less about the quality and skills of the players than it is about the publics perception of the abilities of their team. It&#39;s not actually about building a skilled team, but building an image of a team that the people will be willing to place their bets on.   </p>

<p>Seriously, the media fawned over Trump when he made a good speech, but Trump isn&#39;t even disciplined enough to keep doing that much. I thought the &quot;there&#39;s never a good time to fire the FBI director&quot; line was a good one because the move would have been questioned whenever it happened. But no, Trump can&#39;t stick to a script even when obstruction of justice is on the line.</p>

<p>yup. I think this is a big one. A lot of people don&#39;t realize how important our foreign relationships are when it comes to our countries well being and so they focus more on the issues we face at home. Trump is really reckless in how he handles things in this area. We may be the most powerful and influential country, but we are not the ONLY powerful or influential country. He can&#39;t just boss everyone around and think he can have his way, always, without compromise. </p>

<p>“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, probably an international conspiracy to hide the moon landing, and every scientist is in on it, of course, because that makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>you realize your own link, the top comment is destroying that guy, right?</p>

<p>This is kind of a kindergarten approach to physics, especially the fixation on Lagrange points and the weird idea that you&#39;d need to fire engines the entire way there. It&#39;s like this is based on a worldview that nixes the laws of motion, the rocket equation, and basic math. (Not to mention the nature of orbiting and probably the shape of the planet.)
I&#39;ll toss this one in, though:
The Saturn V launch and the lunar lander can&#39;t really be compared in scale. Not even close.
The former had to launch the lander and orbiter through the atmosphere with the fuel required for the Moon visit - and then it had to carry all the fuel required to lift its own upper stages too. At launch it weight something like 6.5 million lbs and it had to reach a speed of 17,500 mph while countering drag and high gravity.
The lander, meanwhile, required only enough to launch a small lander from an airless surface that&#39;s got a fraction of the gravity, and accelerate it to about 3,700 mph. There are orders of magnitudes difference here, it&#39;s not a matter of dividing by 6.</p>

<p>the top comment was just another opinion from a random idiot who believes that men walked on the moon, and that a lunar lander can intercept and dock with a lunar orbiter traveling at 3600 MPH </p>

<p>...in the 1960&#39;s...</p>

<p>he specifically mentions (not) needing to fire engines all the way to a Lagrange Point. </p>

<p>has he personally replicated the experiment, or does he just regurgitate tripe? </p>

<p>Yes. Your comment.  I made no claims. You attacked a user and I intervened. And now it&#39;s not a claim but a comment I responded to. Why did the goal posts move so fast?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  That is fine.  Trump wants closed borders, right?  That is a consistent with the Nationalist agenda.  Trump also says &quot;America first&quot;, which is also consistent with the Nationalist agenda.  There is a bill making its way through Congress that would require the Federal Reserve to be audited.  This would be very, very huge because the globalists use the Federal Reserve as their own personal money printing machine, then they stick us, the taxpayers, with the bill.  </p>

<p>The globalists want open borders, which is what we are seeing in Europe.  Immigrants are moving into most European countries and these countries are being destabilized in response.  I suspect the globalists want to destabilize Europe to drive down the prices on real estate and corporations so they can buy them cheaply.  Then they will stabilize the countries so the prices go back up.  This is standard practice for people like Soros.  </p>

<p>I assume you are aware of what is going on in Europe right now regarding the immigration...  Let me know if you are not, and I will provide you with some sources.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response and dialogue.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not a believer in the &#39;weaponized immigration&#39; argument. I think this is just a natural result of the wars we&#39;ve been engaged in for many years now which have made those countries unlivable for decent people who only want to live.

<p>Yeah, immigration is of course a problem, and I don&#39;t really know what the answer is.

<p>That brings the nationalism thing in. Why are we continuing to sell arms to Saudia Arabia and Qatar, which directly fuel the conflicts which lead to forced migrations. You want to stop migration? Let them fight it out with sticks and rocks. </p>

<p>Another big one is corporate taxation. How are we supposed to improve our country&#39;s infrastructure when we continue to allow multinational corporations to horse an estimated $2 trillion in offshore tax havens? </p>

<p>How about military spending? Our current military budget is bloating, and it was already beyond obscene to begin with. We have non-competitve military equipment contracts which basicakky function as machines to fleece tax payers. People lose their minds when you propose improving education, infrastructure, and things like small-business subsidies - but they don&#39;t think twice about bloating up a military that, as I stated before, is only serving to worsen problems like mass migrations and instability at this point. They are buying toys they don&#39;t need, and have contracts with equipment suppliers that will get you your infamous $10,000 replacement rivet on a tank or whatever it may be. This isn&#39;t the cold war. Our only enemy attacks us with hijacked airplanes and homemade bombs. The military contractors are robbing us blind. </p>

<p>I tend to believe the weaponized immigration argument, but that is fine.  I have read a lot about Soros, and I see this pattern.  Either way, we created this problem because we illegally invaded and occupied certain Middle Eastern countries.  Bush and his cronies need to be arrested and put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The CIA continues to wage war in certain countries, like Venezuela, to steal their natural resources.  This needs to stop.  A point I have made to many people is that immigrants would not come to the US if they were allowed to build the lives they want in their own countries.  However, if they do, then they will consume the natural resources that the CIA wants to steal for the Establishment.  This is one reason the CIA needs to be dismantled.  </p>

<p><strong>Yeah, immigration is of course a problem, and I don&#39;t really know what the answer is. This is what people were referring to when they talked about the long term effects of decimating a part of the world.

<p>The before and after pictures of countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, etc. are very striking.  They had very good lives before the US decided to bring them freedom and democracy.  If the politicians responsible were rounded up and shot, I would not complain.  They are responsible for the deaths of millions of people, and I have very little sympathy for them, especially since they are driven by pure greed.  They are sacrificing human lives for money.  </p>

<p><strong>That brings the nationalism thing in. Why are we continuing to sell arms to Saudia Arabia and Qatar, which directly fuel the conflicts which lead to forced migrations. You want to stop migration? Let them fight it out with sticks and rocks.</strong>  </p>

<p>I am disappointed that the arms were sold to Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  However, I question who exactly is responsible.  My belief is that the President, any President, has very limited power.  It is the Establishment, the Corporations, and the banks that have the power to make things happen.  The President is a puppet and he/she comes and goes, but the Establishment, the Corporations, and the banks are always there and are always run by the same people.  </p>

<p>Having said that, though, the President needs to step forward and expose the invisible powers that are manipulating world events so that We the People can take care of it.  I supported Obama when he was first elected because I hoped he would be different, but he did some horrible things.  Obama was not brave enough to speak out publicly against the Establishment.  Trump could be the same, but we will see.  It is much more likely that Trump will speak out against the Establishment than Hillary would have.  </p>

<p><strong>Another big one is corporate taxation. How are we supposed to improve our country&#39;s infrastructure when we continue to allow multinational corporations to house an estimated $2 trillion in offshore tax havens?</strong>  Right!  If taxpayer money is spent on infrastructure, then there is less money for the Establishment, the Corporations, and the banks to steal.  That is why taxpayer money is not spent on infrastructure.  </p>

<p><strong>How about military spending? Our current military budget is bloating, and it was already beyond obscene to begin with.

This isn&#39;t the cold war. Our only enemy attacks us with hijacked airplanes and homemade bombs. The military contractors are robbing us blind.</strong>  </p>

<p>Yes!  We could reduce military spending by one half and then everyone could have healthcare and better educations.  It is criminal that we do not pay teachers very well at all, and that school lunches are still disgusting.  </p>

<p>Have you watched Where to Invade Next by Michael Moore?  I don&#39;t necessarily like him, but this is a very interesting documentary.  He discusses a lot of the issued you raise.  </p>

<p>Yes, we can disagree and still have a constructive discussion.  It is why I post here, and I am glad you gave me an intelligent response.  It is interesting to see how and what others think, and to share information and debate.  </p>

<p>Neither one of us is Establishment, so we are all in the same boat together.  Even if we disagree, we are fighting the same fight.    </p>

<p>I have looked through those cabinet members.. I will just go through the list i believe do not belong or are should be in a different area</p>

<p>Betsy Devos - To be honest I have no Idea, unless she has some super master plan for next fiscal year</p>

<p>Ben Carson - Should have been Health and Human Services but Tom Price is just as equal. </p>

<p>Linda McMahon - Small Business Admin... actually Betsy Devos may have been better suited... not really sure what Linda is about</p>

<p>Everyone else seems pretty set or similar to what they have done prior, unless i missed out.</p>

<p>If you have someone else in mind aside from that list. send it through. Pretty sure you said cabinet so that is what i will go off of</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take the bait: </p>

<p>First and foremost, there isn&#39;t one single wrong thing with Capitalism. This country was based on it, and we have laws. It has been entirely corrupted by something the rest of us can&#39;t compete with, pedo-blackmail. They throw out there &quot;corporate&quot; this and &quot;white guy&quot; that to give everyone something to blame, and they aren&#39;t necessarily lying. But they made the laws. And every single one of our middle-level politicians is benefiting.</p>

<p>So, here comes Trump. He&#39;s not a stupid guy, btw. And he has literally been pushing every single legal limit in every possible way for decades. And now he&#39;s going to show you, illustrate to you, what the real fix is. Every single time you catch him on something, he&#39;s going to show you someone that you&#39;ve looked up to that did the same. He&#39;s showing you how rigged it is. And the rest of the establishment is freaking out about it. They are being unmasked, Trump is purposely showing us all of the tricks they devised.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get back to the pedo angle if you&#39;re interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Secondly, let&#39;s set the scene for what Trump inherited in the US government. Doing so allows us to set legitimate and grounded expectations for what his terms can achieve. Under Obama&#39;s rule, every branch of government was politicised, with pol appointees showing a breathtaking disregard for their responsibilities to their fellow citizens and the Constitution. I barely need to name examples, but Lerner at the IRS, and her lack of punishment for targeting political rivals, and Comey&#39;s decision not to indict Clinton were perhaps the most egregious instances of political appointees doing whatever the fuck they wanted with little consequence. As well as the open government, it has become increasingly clear that the shadow government of lettered agencies were, and remain, dominated by deep antipathy to Trump. Finally, the media largely hated Trump, running the gamut from open detestation to dislike.</p>

<p>It is against this backdrop of a cold war of US societal institutions that you have to judge Trump, his manoeuvers, his appeasement of certain groups to wring concessions, or merely respite, from others, his occasional pandering to groups for calculated gains.</p>

<p>In short, the house is on fire, and you are complaining about the colour of the curtains.</p>

<p>Politics is mind control/black magic against the masses.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty goddamn easy debating these points.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll use a real list because you somehow cannot create a numerically ordered list.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The world is run by globalist corporations, which themselves play by a set of rules that everyone else does. It&#39;s all a game and if you want to get rich like Trump did, you have to play with everyone, play both friendly and ruthless, and play as smart as possible. You do not burn bridges in business. Wilbur Ross is not a Rothschild and he is not &quot;establishment.&quot; Ross&#39; cabinet appointment was good because he&#39;s a genius at making money and Trump trusts him, it&#39;s that fucking simple. You can&#39;t just slander Ross as an &quot;evil banker&quot; with no evidence. </p></li>
<li><p>Why wouldn&#39;t he hire a wallstreet genius? These people are the cream of the crop with proven track records. Try a little bit harder, Trump&#39;s economic plan has reinvigorated the market and the massive tax-cuts across the board is going to kick America&#39;s economy into overdrive. Bloated, bureaucratic regulations rolled back, no disastrous Carbon Tax, 3 trillion in the stock market? Trump&#39;s economic policies is going to help America as a whole, INCLUDING the rich people, because guess what, they&#39;re American citizens too and maybe don&#39;t deserve massive taxation to carry the dregs of society. </p></li>
<li><p>ISIS IS an existential threat. It&#39;s a cancer that must be purged from the Muslim community. Muslims that are able to coexist are not bad, never were bad, and Trump&#39;s said this a million times. ISIS and terrorism is used by the communist deep state to tear apart nations from the inside. ISIS is no boogeyman, he&#39;s in your neighbor&#39;s backyard and he&#39;s trying to get into yours. Terrorists hide in taxi-service refugee waves, spread extremism, promote terrorism, commit crimes, kidnap and rape children, create no-go zones, and actively seek to overthrow western governments with Shariah law, even if they&#39;re a fraction of strength. Removing ISIS and terrorism is a HUGE blow to the military industrial complex and communist deep state.</p></li>
<li><p>The American government is divided into two shadow governments: the communist deep state and the true patriots fighting to keep the republic alive and out of the hands of the communists. The CIA and other agencies HAVE abused their power, but under the direction of evil psychopaths. The average grunt is a red-blooded American who has his hands tied and whose role is so specialized it&#39;s impossible to connect the dots without making near-treasonous accusations with no real way to prove it. Why would you say you don&#39;t trust the CIA or any other government body? It&#39;s subversive and it&#39;s what the communist deep state wants everyone to think. They want the current government torn down, removed, and replaced with a global NWO. America is strong because its people have the most freedom in this world and have been able to translate that into the strongest nation in the world. The people are strong but are being divided and are ripe for being conquered. Trump is no subversive anti-American like Obama was, Trump knows America is strong and that it can be great. Exterminating the communist deep state and righting the course of the American government will be one of his greatest challenges. </p></li>
<li><p>No one died and he ABSOLUTELY exposed the MSM. MSM and the left have NEVER supported Trump on anything EXCEPT FOR WAR IN SYRIA, HOW INSANE IS THAT. Good optics for Trump but it was very tense in the beginning because the future was uncertain. War seemed to be so close but it never happened. Trump, Putin, and Assad are smarter than that. He probably knew it was a false-flag but he had to act.</p></li>
<li><p>What an absolutely garbage point. FUCK you degenerate, ANTIFA larping communist retards. The left is VIOLENT, Trump Tower and the Trump dynasty are PRICELESS. Human life is PRICELESS. The absolute turn-around of this country is worth BILLIONS A DAY, I give literally 0 fucks that golfs &quot;almost every weekend.&quot; He&#39;s 70 and DESTROYING you cucks DAILY, I&#39;d let him golf every fucking day. </p></li>
<li><p>Your &quot;arguments&quot; are full of holes, your account is less than a month old, and the fact that such a poorly written post gets this upvoted is evidence of shilling. 80% for this garbage? You&#39;ve gotta be fucking insane. Absolute fucking garbage.  You have the same 4th-grade vocabulary and the same weak, illogical talking points as the rest of the anti-Trump shills. You get fed the same lines and talking points and your 3rd-world english results in a steaming pile of word garbage. The thing with conspiracy theories is, there&#39;s evidence behind them. You have no evidence. You have no argument, no real facts, nothing. Get the fuck out. </p></li>

<p>everyone knows MSM is fake news, so what do they do? Call independent journalism and anything that doesn&#39;t fit their narrative fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But with that preamble, let&#39;s look at your list.</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump was bailed out in 1990, and put Wilbur Ross in his administration.
1b. Trump appointed Goldman Sachs people to various positions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, he went bankrupt, so has this connection to a Rothschild bank. The Rothschild&#39;s have rather a large number of banks so this isn&#39;t surprising. I&#39;m not sure how this means Trump cannot, 27 years later, be an anti-establishment candidate- perhaps you could explain the logic.</p>

<p>Wilbur Ross is part of a pattern of appointees  whereby Trump uses highly competent men of business, often unsavoury business like Goldman, as a power base. By appointing them, he ties them to his administration, and gains people independent of the political and media class utterly opposed to him. Lacking media, political or ethnic power bases, I think he deliberately courted the money/Wall Street/ economic political power, seeing in them the potential to counterbalance his other enemies.</p>

<p>I would say the Goldman Sachs connection is the strongest criticism on your list. I can see why it was done, but I do not like the vampire squid openly nozzling around government.</p>

<p>Seems weak, without anything concrete in terms of outcome or what was discussed.

    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>Trump talks about ISIS, who are fake terrorists, and not about Saudis who are real terrorists.</li>
</ol>

<p>Firstly, however ISIS began, they have grown into a regional group with some minor local capabilities, but greater than that, have assumed an almost mythic status in the West, to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Trump is right to combat the latter -he should humiliate and degrade them in the public mind.</p>

<p>Saudi money has infiltrated much of the West, which is why western politicians attack the symptoms and not the cause. I think foreign policy recognises that Saudi could become the next Iran if pushed too hard, so I think Trump is falling into standard US statecraft and toeing the usual line. I think it is about picking battles he can win, and he hasn&#39;t much room for manoeuver here, but YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel cautious optimism about Donald Trump, which is not the same thing as confidence. I have learned to be cautious about investing too much into any one belief or hope, but my gut tells me that something <em>different</em> is finally happening, and that alone is reason for excitement and perhaps optimism.  </p>

<p>I will respond to your second point honestly, because I think it is the most reasonable. I find many of your other concerns to be rooted in dishonesty and media distortion, so I will hold off on addressing them. It is tiresome to go over the same things over and over. If you and other users demonstrate a willingness to hold an actual honest conversation, then I will take the time to give my perspective on the other points that you raised as well. However, I don&#39;t deal in knee-jerk reactions. There is a well-known disinfo strategy to spam arguments that appear reasonable at surface level, but require some effort to deconstruct. This is intended to wear down and monopolize the time of those who seek to find and expose the truth. I am particular concerned by statements such as:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>These questions should be very easy for you to explain, considering your die hard and obsessive support for him as the current POTUS.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an illogical strawman on two levels: You imply that the truth is simple and you imply that supporters must be obsessive and diehard. This demonstrates classic black-and-white thinking that is responsible for so much cognitive dissonance and is exploited for the purposes of disinformation. If you are actually willing to engage in careful, reasoned debate, then I welcome you to join me in this thread.  </p>

<p>But, okay, let&#39;s get into it.  </p>

<p>This is not a black-and-white world. There are two things to keep in mind when considering cabinet appointments: compromise and coalition. It is conceivable that some of the appointments were unfortunately necessary compromises in order to manipulate or otherwise circumvent Deep State, media, or criminal power structures. Moreover, it is conceivable that some of the appointments were not compromises at all, but rather represent the formation of a coalition among well-connected people that understand the system and its weaknesses better than anyone.
Even if you don&#39;t find these possibilities to be likely, I think it is unwise to overlook them entirely. I developed a strange sense of suspicion when I saw shallow attacks on his cabinet scattered everywhere in social media. By &#39;shallow&#39;, I just mean that the attacks appear reasonable at first glance, and they may be reasonable, but very few attempted to explain their concern beyond a knee-jerk reaction. This is potentially similar to a CTR strategy regarding the DNC primary: &#39;The primary was not stolen since Clinton received 3 million more votes than Sanders&#39;. Well, yes. That&#39;s how the numbers worked out. But it&#39;s practically meaningless to throw that number around every time people start discussing the problem of media collusion and bias as revealed in disgusting details by WikiLeaks. Never mind the possibility of actual ballot fraud.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what is going on with certainty. But for the first time in my life, I see the possibility for blowing the curtain wide open to reveal the hidden criminal power structures that are waging war against all of us. If the system is to be repaired rather than burned down, then it has to be done through legal channels. It is conceivable to me that Donald Trump became aware of the scope of the problem by virtue of his wealth and familial ties to law enforcement, and now he is in a position to do something about it.
I am extremely suspicious of the narrative that has been pushed on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> very suddenly since he won the election: &#39;Trump is a double-agent for the NWO!&#39; If that is the case, then he is playing his part extraordinarily well. Is he a dummy or an evil genius? Take your pick, because it can&#39;t be both. I don&#39;t believe it is either. But the attacks against him come desperately from both angles, which leads me to seriously consider the alternatives.  </p>

<p>It feels to me like some criminals at the top are getting nervous for the first time in ~25 years. The media is losing credibility and apparently losing their minds. That alone is priceless. So we shall see. But for now, I remain cautiously optimistic. If I change my feelings about this, it certainly won&#39;t be from the pressure of knee-jerk reactions on Reddit or in mainstream propaganda.  </p>

<p>Disclaimer: Some of the paragraphs above were copied from other comments I have made here over the past few weeks. Very similar conversations have happened here frequently, and I took the time to summarize my thoughts and feelings last time. Since the comments were equally applicable to your question, I took the liberty of saving myself some effort in this reply.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Objective reality still exists. Each point raised by the OP here is valid and you&#39;re skirting those problems with a claim to an optimistic perspective, which is still vague at best. Trump&#39;s actions betray his campaign promises, that&#39;s it. Politicians on both sides try to play the same game that you are right now, they say &quot;it&#39;s more complicated in the real world, so what might seem like betrayal is just realpolitik&quot;, or that, &quot;change is slow and incremental, we really are working for you&quot;.

If you have a rebuttal to each point of policy that the OP has raised here, go down the line and offer a counter argument. Otherwise, you are another apologist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Breaking down a list of sensationalized half-truths is time-consuming and especially pointless when another person will simply post the same list tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you actually cared about the truth you would understand that. You would have already fact-checked and vetted the media language, sources, and context of quotes. You would have already analyzed the articles and seperated the facts from the opinions of the authors.</p>

<p>You have obviously done none of those things. If you had, you would understand that each point would need five or six paragraphs and a step-by-step breakdown of the tactics the media magicians used to fool you.</p>

<p>You can put a thousand sensationalist articles in a link and it will still be nothing more than the hard evidence buried within. I have been following and analyzing these Trump hit-pieces for months now. They all rely on the reader valuing quatity over quality. Which is why we have a new &quot;breaking story&quot; every week which spawns another thousands spin-off articles that add nothing but more opinions based around whatever half-baked hearsay the original one claimed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Thank you for taking the time to write this. It is so true that it just becomes tiresome after a while splitting open the sensationalized and media-distorted half-truths that are continually pushed as &quot;proof&quot; to demonize Trump.</p>

<p>Thats the thing almost nobody ever addresses. The fact that sensationalist headlines are treated as truth by the majority of people who are already desperate to hate Trump. A smaller percentage actually skim the article. An even smaller percentage are experienced or knowledgeable enough to correctly interpret the media jargon. And an even smaller percentage have the last skill and the time or attention span to keep following the case once it leaves the public eye. The kind of person who follows up on corrections or understands what it means when a &quot;breaking story&quot; suddenly disappears never to be mentioned again (remember how Trump was suddenly a &quot;serial rapist&quot; with numerous women claiming they would see the charges through).</p>

<p>Of course, both sides do this and Trump supporters are also guilty of these forms of lazy media consumption.</p>

<p>However, being neither anti-Trump or a Trump supporter, I am getting really sick of the organized bullies on this website brigading their &quot;Trump is evil and if you dont think so you are also evil and stupid&quot; narrative onto anyone with a neutral opinion.</p>

<p>Almost every political thread on this website has an anti-Trump top comment and people are now so scared that they are starting to preface their comments with &quot;not a Trump supporter but...&quot;.</p>

<p>That is fucking scary.</p>

<p>We are being trained through brigades and gang-downvoting. We are being trained to only believe one side of the political spectrum and to demonize the other.</p>

<p>Fifty some million people voted for Trump and this is a majority US website, and somehow it is not okay for anyone to have a neutral opinion without hearing cries of &quot;t_d is brigading again!&quot;.</p>

<p>What does that even mean? Everyone with a different opinion who gets upvoted by the silent majority is a card-carrying member of t_d?</p>

<p>Why is it not okay for someone to disagree with democrats? Why must those people always be grouped together into &quot;t_d&quot;? Once again, tens of millions of people voted for Trump. Its not some small fringe group. Its a very large percentage of the country.</p>

<p>I dont know, it all feels very twilight zone to me. A manufactured online world where tens of millions of people are being hourly shamed and demonized for picking one of two options. If you ask me, whether it was a good decision or not, Trump was the &quot;fuck you&quot; vote to the establishment. In my opinion, these &quot;fuck you&quot; voters won him the election.</p>

<p>Now we have the Washington-DC-led mainstream-media unleashed and shoving &quot;hate Trump&quot; down our throats, all behind sensationalist headlines, exaggerations, and opinion-pieces parading as journalism.</p>

<p>I dont know, the whole fucking thing stinks. I wish I could claim to be shocked at how mant people seem to be eating out of the medias hands, but I am old enough to know exactly how gullible the general population is. </p>

<p>Which brings me to my last point. Millions of people parroting media talking-points doesnt suddenly make them true. And people not being bothered to spend twenty minutes breaking-down (for the tenth time that week) the latest hearsay, opinion-laden, half-truth media hit piece, doesnt make that hit-piece suddenly true.</p>

<p>And making long lists of these hit-pieces only proves one thing to the people paying attention: how desperate the mainstream media is to make something stick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using Donald Trump as the monster definitely benefits the establishment. </p>

<p>Compared to Donald Trump, Republicans become &quot;moderate.&quot; Using Donald Trump to pass their long-standing reactionary agenda of deregulation and tax cuts permits Republicans to pretend its not <em>their</em> agenda, and leaves Republicans room to become the heroes against Donald Trump, and therefore, lends Republicans credibility. </p>

<p>Compared to Donald Trump and Republicans, Democrats have room to become even more willing to support Ronald Reagan policies. Donald Trump glues many Democrats to the party out of fear.</p>

<p>Result: Both parties pander more to the oligarchs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this before. This is what happened under Ronald Reagan and then again under George W. Bush. They are pulling the spectrum toward oligarchy. They have been doing this since 1981.</p>

<p>At some point, there will be a backlash. That will probably benefit the oligarchy too -- because it will further polarize and distract the nation, and because it can be a reason for larger masses of the population to support police state crackdowns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In summary, I continue to support Trump because he is exactly what is expected. To be effective, to make any changes, he will have to appease some groups, develop his own power base, and clean out traitors. There will always be lists like this, but in the end it comes down to an emotional, gut check - I still trust him to do the most he possibly can to correct the disastrous path the US is on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART I:  </p>

<p>Regarding your title, I do not recall people saying that Trump is anti-Establishment.  Maybe I missed it, but I just want to clarify this point.  I do recall people saying that WE are anti-Establishment.  When Trump does something that benefits the Establishment, then that is a problem...  When Trump does something, intentionally or through shear ignorance, that hurts the interests of the Establishment, then we applaud it.  Why would we not?  Does this mean we are pro-Trump?  Of course not.  </p>

<p>If Hillary would have been elected, then she would have done everything to benefit the Establishment.  Hillary is decidedly pro-Establishment.  Hillary knows how it all works because she was first Lady for eight years, she has held public office before, and she is an attorney.  </p>

<p>Trump is not an attorney, and this is his first time holding public office.  Trump is a very bad politician with little experience, and now the Establishment has to deal with him.  That fact alone is extremely amusing.  It is like the Establishment was expecting Hillary to show up at their high class party, but Trump crashed it instead, and he showed up with hookers and beer.  </p>

<p><strong>“Here&#39;s a fun little social experiment....Answer in list form.”</strong>  </p>

<p>First of all, we should agree on how all of this works.  The Establishment is in control of world affairs. The politicians come and go, but the Establishment is always there manipulating events from behind the scenes.  The members of the Establishment are not voted into position.  Instead, they are there because their ancestors acquired a tremendous amount of wealth, and it is passed from one generation of the family to the next through tax free foundations and other financial manipulations.  </p>

<p>So, who exactly is the Establishment (i.e. the trillionaires, Illuminati, Jesuits, etc.)?  You mention the Rothschilds.  There is also the Rockefellers, Carnegies, DuPonts, Harrimans, Warburgs, etc.  We don&#39;t need an exhaustive list for this discussion, but including the Rothschilds and Rockefellers is good enough.  </p>

<p>The stated goal of the Establishment is to implement the New World Order.  This is one world government that is controlled by a select few, which would require the dissolution of the U.S. as a  nation state.  Any politician that supports this should be tried for treason.  </p>

<p>The Establishment will own everything, and have already acquired over half of the world&#39;s wealth.  They are well on their way to acquiring more because they are very well organized and we are fighting with each other instead of fighting against them.  I think their endgame is to turn the world into China where you have a small ruling class and a larger group of slave labor.  </p>

<p>To accomplish the New World Order, the Establishment has created several organizations, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.  The Establishment has also acquired the MSM.  I hope I do not have to tell people here that the Establishment owns and controls the Federal Reserve.  The Establishment also controls the politicians, or will do whatever it takes to get control of politicians.  </p>

<p><em>Trump is a Nationalist, which directly conflicts with the NWO globalist agenda.</em>  So then the main issue that touches upon all of your questions and comments is this:  How does the Establishment push its NWO globalist agenda with a President that is a Nationalist?  One really good solution is to surround Trump with people that are globalists.  Another good solution is the have globalists, like Kissinger, meet with Trump and explain to him the intracacies of global politics and how the NWO is better for humanity.  I would love to be in on that conversation.  Trump would be completely clueless about anything Kissinger had to say.  Everyone should find that funny, especially to see Kissinger become frustrated because a simpleton like Trump cannot even grasp the basics of it all.  It would be like watching Chomsky debate Sam Harris.  Harris is so completely outmatched that he does not even realize it.  </p>

<p><strong>“1. Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project. 
When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; &quot;the trump name is still very much a future asset for us&quot;...
How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren&#39;t the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?”</strong><br/>
The way it works is that the Establishment identifies people of significance to be recruited into their fold.   They use several techniques to recruit people, such as videotaping them having sex with adults and/or children.  They also recruit people by controlling them financially, which is what you mention here.  </p>

<p>Trump was bailed out by someone associated with the Rothschilds.  This did not happen because they are nice people or because they like Trump.  That is not how they operate.   They did it because they felt that Trump would increase his power, and he did.  The Illuminati have very good foresight!<br/>
To answer your question, they targeted Trump for recruitment by taking advantage of his financial situation.  Was the recruitment successful?  If so, how successful?  Trump is not acting like they have him on videotape having sex with children, or ritually sacrificing them in some Luciferian ritual.<br/>
As you mention, Wilbur Ross was made the Secretary of Commerce.    </p>

<p>The previous Secretary of Commerce was Penny Pritzker.  She was appointed by Obama and you can read about their relationship here.  </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker</a>  </p>

<p>Bush Jr. appointed Donald Evens, and you can read about their relationship here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Evans">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Evans</a>  </p>

<p>So, Wilbur Ross being made the Secretary of Commerce seems like a typical appointment for such a position.  It is cronyism, and it always has been.<br/>
All of Trumps appointments seem to be typical and expected.  For the reason I mentioned above, they are people who tend to be pro-Establishment and are pro-NWO.  At least, they are sympathetic to this cause.  However, is this all Trumps doing or is he under duress to accept the Establishment picks?  </p>

<p>I think that Trump was not supposed to win the Presidency.  Hillary was the Establishment pick.  This is why she got such favorable press coverage from the Establishment owned MSM.  They made Trump out to be a joke and did not take him seriously.  The voters revolted against the Establishment choice, and they did not see this coming.  </p>

<p>Would Hillary have made better choices if she had won?  You can search for information regarding who she may have chosen.  I am not sure how accurate these lists are, but they include people that are pro-Establishment and pro-NWO.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/10/hillary_cabinet_plans_leaked_sheryl_sandberg_at_treasury_starbucks_ceo_at.html">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/01/10/hillary_cabinet_plans_leaked_sheryl_sandberg_at_treasury_starbucks_ceo_at.html</a>
Do you see a pattern here?  It does not matter who wins the election because they same type of people will be appointed to government positions to push the NWO globalist agenda.  </p>

<p><strong>“Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position. Why was this a good move?”</strong>  A good move for whom?  For us?  You say that Trump made Ross a cabinet position, but how much say does Trump have in the matter?  How much say does any President have in the matter?  Ross was probably selected by the Establishment to remind Trump that he owes them.  </p>

<p><strong>“After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The point is, he lied to you, turned around, and &quot;got the band back together&quot; so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Explain.”</strong>  </p>

<p>It is not good for us, but that does not matter to the Establishment.  You are assuming that the President has the power to make his own appointments independently of the Establishment, and this is not the case.  It is not true for any President.  Hillary would have made similar appointments, especially based on the leaked transcripts of her Goldman Sachs speeches.  Goldman Sach is owned and controlled by the Establishment, so they will require that their people be put into positions of power, whether Trump likes it or not. If Bernie would have won, even he would have appointed Goldman Sachs bankers.  Right?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>PART II:  </p>

<p><strong>”Why did trump meet in private, and visited the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone are fucking incriminating as shit and, reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can you explain this? Are you OK with this and why?”</strong>  </p>

<p>Kissinger is NWO goon, and I am assuming he met with Trump to explain to him the reality of being President, as well as to remind him of the plight of JFK for not going along.  I think that Trump went in thinking he was going to implement his policies, and this was the cause of the conflict with the CIA before the inauguration.  The CIA is the only part of the Establishment that is a US government agency.  The CIA was created by the Establishment to acquire natural resources for them, as well as to control the media and politicians.  </p>

<p>Obama had no conflict with the Establishment before took office because he knows how it all works.  Hillary would have had no conflict either because she know how it works.  Trump has never held office before, so he won the Presidency thinking the President has all of this power.  Trump learned real quick that the President is a puppet.  You attribute a lot of these happenings to Trump, but I think it does not work that way.  </p>

<p><strong>Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the &quot;terrorism boogeyman&quot; in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, &quot;bomb the shit out of them and take the oil&quot;. Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?</strong>  </p>

<p>ISIS is a CIA operation, and I can only guess that Trump was clueless about this.  I think that Trump discussed a lot of things not knowing how it all really works.  The President does not decide who to bomb or not bomb.  The President merely gives the ok after he is told to give the ok.  The CIA is not going to put up with any resistance bullshit from a President after the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the Cuban Missile Crisis.   </p>

<p><strong>Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?</strong>   Again, you are assuming that Trump, and only Trump, did this deal with Saudi Arabia.  We all know that the Saudis are huge supporters of terrorism, and so is the CIA, as well as American corporations and banks.  Trump, or any politician, will not be allowed to interfere with this.  There is too much money involved.  </p>

<p><strong>You would agree that the CIA is a globalist and evil intelligence agency, correct? Why Is trump saying that the CIA is &quot;great&quot; and &quot;terrific&quot;? Why did he say that he was behind them &quot;1000%&quot;?</strong>  That one is easy to answer.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/iU83R7rpXQY">https://youtu.be/iU83R7rpXQY</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?</strong>  Again, CIA operation to bloody the hands of the new President.  Trump is still alive, but he is no longer innocent of war crimes.<br/>
<strong>Also, after criticizing Obama&#39;s policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?</strong>  Again, CIA operation.<br/>
<strong>Finally (I will be editing more, stay tuned), also after criticizing Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips, is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000 dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these acceptable to you? Why are you willing them slide.</strong>  This one, I am not sure about.  I have heard about all of this, but I never really looked into it.  I spend most of my time looking into other issues.  I am not saying that this issue is not important.  It is just that I personally cannot add any insight.  </p>

<p><strong>These questions should be very easy for you to explain, considering your die hard and obsessive support for him as the current POTUS.</strong>  He is a better choice than Hillary, that&#39;s for sure.  I think there are 8 or 9 legitimage political parties, but are only allowed to choose between two of them.  What are we supposed to do?  We know that Hillary is very pro-Establishment and NWO.  Trump is a wild card.  Maybe he will turn out to be the same as all the others.  Maybe they will hold a gun to his head or threaten his family, like they did to Chaffetz.  </p>

<p>The two choices we have are really the same choice.  Under normal circumstances, both Presidential candidates are associated with the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.  These organizations create policy, and the politicians implement it.  As far as I can tell, Trump is not associated with any of these organizations.  Hillary is, and so is Bill.  Also, I cannot find a link between Trump and Freemasonry, which I think would change everything.  </p>

<p>So, this last Presidential election was unique because only one candidate was associated with the Establishment organizations, and that one candidate got all the positive press coverage.  Coincidence?  Also, there were a lot of hard core Republicans that said they would support Hillary if Trump won the Republican nomination.  This is because these hard core Republicans are associated with  Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission, and they suppor their own.  The political party does not matter, except to us, the profane.  The whole Democrat-Republican thing is to keep us distracted from how it really works.  </p>

<p>Are you willing to risk it all to fight the Establishment?  If we do nothing, then we condemn future generations to slavery.  We might be in the best position to do something now.  Are you willing to work with people you disagree with to make this happen?  We are all in the same boat.  None of us are part of the Establishment, and the Establishment does not give a rats ass about any of us.  In fact, they want us all gone.  They want to reduce the population to about 500 M slaves.  I say we reduce the population, but we start from the top and work our way down from there.  Then we can all live in peace.  </p>

<p>If I missed any of your questions or points, sorry but it is late here.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK.  That is fine.  Trump wants closed borders, right?  That is a consistent with the Nationalist agenda.  Trump also says &quot;America first&quot;, which is also consistent with the Nationalist agenda.  There is a bill making its way through Congress that would require the Federal Reserve to be audited.  This would be very, very huge because the globalists use the Federal Reserve as their own personal money printing machine, then they stick us, the taxpayers, with the bill.  </p>

<p>The globalists want open borders, which is what we are seeing in Europe.  Immigrants are moving into most European countries and these countries are being destabilized in response.  I suspect the globalists want to destabilize Europe to drive down the prices on real estate and corporations so they can buy them cheaply.  Then they will stabilize the countries so the prices go back up.  This is standard practice for people like Soros.  </p>

<p>I assume you are aware of what is going on in Europe right now regarding the immigration...  Let me know if you are not, and I will provide you with some sources.  </p>

<p>Can you please tell me why you think Trump is not a Nationalist?  If I know, then I can address your argument.  Right now, I am not sure why you feel that way so I do not know what else to say.  </p>
