    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The Reptilians are part of the Archon Hiearchy. The Grey Aliens are their slaves. The tall blond aliens people have seen are actually evil. The are also part of the Archons. Yaldaboath pretends to be a &quot;God&quot; but is an Alien Archon.  The Evil Demon that Rene Descartes spoke of is the Matrix Itself.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the fact that our government is most likely being run by pedos is a good indicator. When has the government EVER done ANYTHING in your favor? This whole world is upside down my friend. Trust me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Archons are more of an allegory. The truth is the Powerful worship ...power. What is power, then? It&#39;s the antithesis of the moires and moralities of the commoners. For example, back in the days of the Athenian oligarchies, families would get together and say, literally, &quot;We are against the people. What the people are for, we aim to destroy.&quot; It was a ritual of solidarity for the oligarchical &quot;Watchers-Against-Democracy&quot;, if you will. As time flows on, people forget why these rituals exist, but still value traditions.The Ritual Abuse stuff seems to me an old societal taboo broken by those with the power and protection to break it as a hobby. Besides, what better way to destroy the future generation, the true enemy of the Powerful? What better way to separate fully from the commoners? Whether you call it Set, Archons, or simply worldly power, it&#39;s all ultimately towards the same ends. It&#39;s just different flavors of the same old story of us vs them. The Archons is an excellent metaphor for that struggle though, which is why Gnostics would often rather die than convert from their populist nihilism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard stories of my friends doing DMT and they saw the green elfs and the robotic/cyborg people. Maybe there is something around but we just don&#39;t have the right antenna to tune into that frequency. Maybe demons and angels are around us but we can&#39;t see them. My own experience was when I fell asleep but I wasn&#39;t fully or my brain wasn&#39;t but on a coffee table I saw a Shadow evil looking thing just looking at my direction , I always tell people it felt like it was a demon, but what do I know. I want science to be able to explain these events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so weird that you mention a green elf. An older friend, who is very Christian, recently told me the story of his friend. He said that this friend swears that in his early twenties he was approached by a green elf like creature. He used the word Leprechaun. This creature basically wanted his soul in return for wealth and prosperity in this life. The guy agreed. Had a lot of money and that type of thing in his life, but not a lot of personal happiness in regards to relationships,etc... The guy believes it was &quot;the devil&quot; in disguise.</p>

<p>Obviously, I have no proof. I just thought the green elf was interesting and maybe my story would relate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just one interpretation that people have latched onto for unseen forces that they perceive to be a highly negative influence in our crummy world.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like if you hold a soda can up to the light, the shadow can be a circle, a rectangle, or neither depending on the angle from which it is viewed.</p>

<p>People have the inkling and intuition to realize that there are more aspects to existence than the wavelengths we interact with in a daily basis, and their spidey senses and historical digging leads them to the conclusion that we are not alone and some others are not quite benevolent.</p>

<p>Call it whatever you want. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever gonna get hard 3D evidence using a beaker, micro meter, and Wikipedia to make a conclusive labeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about the Archon theory is alot of religions wrote about them just used different name for them. So it&#39;s possible they have some how got in contact with them.Also some of the religion that wrote about that  are the Sumerian, Dogon Tribe, Gnostic , and hindu. Dont you find it a little weird that they all have connection to the Archon. Not to mention various hieroglyphics that shows picture of spaceships and aliens. Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m still skeptical but it amazes how many connect we have through history and religion that talk about aliens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all the Demiurge, and the Archons are our own thoughts. Some people are more or less influenced by fleeting thoughts and think they&#39;re fact. They confuse ideas for thoughts. That&#39;s all real - I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything controversial about it. Beyond that, maybe it manifests are higher perspectives (it probably does) but I know that running around afraid of unseen forces doesn&#39;t solve anything! If you think they&#39;re controlling you, then take control of your own mind!</p>
