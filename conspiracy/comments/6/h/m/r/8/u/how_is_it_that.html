<p>I&#39;m not saying that he doesn&#39;t have bones in his closet or saying that he&#39;s not corrupted already but the allegations are getting to the highest point of hypocrisy and if you fail to see this you&#39;re not looking at the whole picture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really showing that the whole system left and right if you believe in choice will do anything to point the corruption away from the system itself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not shilling for Trump and would like to hear real opinions on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your question was, is Trump corrupt? Then Yes, absolutely. Waay before any political foray and for sure after that too. </p>

<p>If your question was, &quot;Is everyone making this a partisan thing and deflecting from the real issues of wealth, political power and corruption?&quot; Then Yes, absolutely. But this is not really a sub for questions..</p>

<p>Trump is notorious for being corrupt and dishonest. Much like most politicians and most wealthy people. There is no meaningful difference between a Dem or Rep. They are all the same upper classes protecting each other and stealing as much as they can for themselves while blaming the rest for not being born rich.</p>

<p>Trump is the perfect manifestation of this because he is so unbelievably inept, stupid and delusional but with such force of personality that no one knows quite what to do. He is intentionally divisive and we are good sheep who play along real well while both political sides keep stealing our shit.</p>

<p>why is it...etc/etc </p>
</blockquote>

<p>An answer in two parts.</p>

<p>It is because you can be incredibly corrupt without being a career politician. And it is because you can be corrupt and get called out on it by other, also corrupt, people.</p>

<p>Are opposition politicians complete frauds and hypocrites for wanting to sink Trump for his corruption? Yes.</p>

<p>Is Trump corrupt even if his accusers are corrupt too? Yes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to properly interpret your post. Basically you say they are all corrupt... Tick, agreed, corruption starts from the local business owner on wards, everyone does what it takes to get ahead, some are just better at it, such as career politicians or billionaires.</p>

<p>Trump is notorious for being corrupt, notorious is a strong word because I would lump him in with every other person who has a billion or more. You have to sleep with the devil to get that high. So the word notorious i don&#39;t think fits well here, but rather he is a part of a breed that is known for corruption. </p>

<p>Unbelievably inept, stupid and delusional but the sheep follow him.... I can only agree with delusional here. He does sometimes seem to let his imagination get away from him. Inept and stupid? I don&#39;t think so. You don&#39;t become the president of the united states in 2017 by being inept and stupid. I think this part of your statement is incorrect. And here is why.</p>

<p>You are forgetting that he didn&#39;t just beat hillary, he also beat all the heavyweights of the Republican party. He kept to a strategy, played the cards right and won. Not once, but twice. Yes, he is full of himself to the point of delusion, but he most certainly isn&#39;t stupid or inept. I would describe him as cunning, conniving and delusion.</p>

<p>After that you can express the force of personality and the sheeple. </p>

<p>Stupid is not the right word, you are right. He is cunning and for sure has cultivated his strengths. But I think he isn&#39;t smart at all.

    <div class="md"><p>Most politicians have to learn to keep their corruption on the down-low. Trump is unique in that he doesn&#39;t hide it. He&#39;s certainly the most openly corrupt national politician I&#39;ve ever seen. He&#39;s still involved with his many businesses and properties, which keep receiving sweetheart deals from certain foreign interests. He refuses to disclose his finances. He has extensive mob ties. He has sold a lot of real estate to anonymous buyers at inflated prices. He spends much of his time funneling US taxpayer dollars into properties like Mar a Lago. He hired his son-in-law as his top aide and has created some vague role for Ivanka. He&#39;s personally under investigation for obstructing justice. And he lies about all of it, all the time, before getting caught and lying again. </p>

<p>The sad part is that this was all off the top of my head. There&#39;s more. I&#39;d go find some sources, but it&#39;s time to get out of bed and get to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I hate Trump&#39;s political agenda so far.  </p>

<p>That said, I am really grateful for all the stirring up the muddy waters and general chaos his presidency has caused.  </p>

<p>People are listening to what happens, those who like it, and those who scrutinize it for mistakes.  </p>

<p>The general populace&#39;s interest in politics skyrocketed lately.  </p>

<p>That - in itself - is positive.</p>

<p>...  </p>

<p>I think a while back someone claimed, that Trump was not part of any political cabal, or established powerful group. A real outsider to DC. And I think that is exactly what was needed.<br/>
HRC would have been more of the same shit we had, or even worse, if we believe some of the darker conspiracy theories (and I do).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a double-edged sword though. Climate change is far and away the most pressing issue humanity needs to deal with, but instead we are transfixed by an un-hinged narcissist in office that <em>intentionally</em> creates this drama to obscure and fatigue anyone who would try to think critically about what is going on in the halls of power.</p>

<p>Political interest from the public is a good thing, but I think in the context of what is going on now everything is &quot;fake news&quot; and the white house is even <em>less</em> accountable and transparent now than ever before. For example, Trump is unapproachable and will only talk about himself or things that paint him in a good light, aside from the usual whataboutisms that political figures always engage in.</p>

<p>This is deeply disturbing for obvious reasons. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I take it you mean an outsider is someone who doesn&#39;t have the same incentives to be corrupt in the way the current political class is. And you are right, that is sorely needed. But Trump, a born millionaire who&#39;s been hovering in these circles for decades, directly or indirectly, is not quite an outsider. </p>

<p>Even if he was an outsider, he has a long and well-documented history of only caring about himself (more precisely his image), not the people who help him get what he wants. In other words he is the same problem &quot;the establishment&quot; is. He will in one way or another primarily serve his own needs and the needs of those who are like him. In practice this will mean more money for those who are already rich and less for those who have little.</p>
