<p>But you are responding to comments I make to the other poster almost immediately. Can you set notifications for that poster too? Apparently. </p>

<p>Seth Rich is an actual conspiracy with actual evidence and a blatantly obvious massive coverup.</p>

<p>No different from anonymous sources on WaPo, NY Times except media companies actually have a duty to report truth that they shirk daily. The 4th Estate was destroyed long before 2016.</p>

<p>The Pedogate posts that are just tweets?</p>

<p>Pedogate/Pizzagate is a retarded way of referring to the massive global pedophile ring. Thank you for identifying yourself as one who tries to use the  Pedoagate/Pizzagate as your coverup umbrella to avoid talking about any actual details</p>

<p>You realize what a Controversial rating means right? It&#39;s the combination of upvotes/downvotes. That post was highly upvoted/downvoted by both sides but only one side has the grace of the Reddit admins to use their botnets to upvote comments as well. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a monumental leap to consider this the same thing as saying &quot;I don&#39;t like Trump but hell, he&#39;s doing better than if Hillary was President.&quot; Also if you look at the person I replied initially, that started this whole argument, they admitted to being pro-Trump.

    <div class="md"><p>Not the best example granted but you still haven&#39;t explained why saying Clinton would do worse than Trump makes you pro Trump. </p>

<p>Another example, I&#39;m right handed if I had to be shot in a hand it would be better if the left one got shot but I&#39;d still prefer not to be shot at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all conjuring though Clinton didn&#39;t win so we can&#39;t be certain however we can look at her time as secretary of state and see it was a complete failure so it&#39;s not much of a stretch to say her incompetence would continue whereas Trump has done a whole lot of fuck all.</p>

<p>If someone is still talking about Trump in comparison to Hillary, they are likely pro-Trump. If someone thinks Trump is doing an okay job, they are likely pro-Trump. If someone is commenting in this post and agreeing with the posts OP, they are likely pro-Trump. If someone looks at conspiracy, sees tons of Seth Rich posts and thinks it is biased against Trump, they are likely pro-Trump. </p>

<p>True.  But when they bring it up it is fair game to ask questions don&#39;t you think?  If I said something like I didn&#39;t have anything to do with 9/11 wouldn&#39;t that make you wonder why I said it?</p>

<p>Obama for one. People forget that there were effigies of him being burned routinely  not to mention all the racism. </p>

<p>If Trump stopped acting like a child there would be less to report on. When he consistently gives fodder to the media in the form of tweets, inviting Russians to the whitehouse baring American press, plays golf every weekend, pulls out of a popular climate deal, sells weapons to countries he labeled repsonsible for 9/11, hires wall street execs, tries to lift russian sanctions, gives his kids jobs, reverses on China after getting his trademarks approved there, insults our allies, praises dictators, and generally being an embarrassment. </p>

<p>The media makes money, its a business and Trump is so ridiculous of course they are going to report on the dumb shit he does. </p>

<p>Yeah because he has bankers in his cabinet who are pro large business and pro lending money. Ask yourself why Trump would want to increase borrowing amounts for his friends as the first thing he does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that we believe the crap Trump spews; we don&#39;t buy into the politically-driven narrative endlessly paraded by the MSM (CNN, MSNBC, the Washington Post), the late night talk shows (Colbert, etc), the live comedy shows (SNL, The Daily Show, and all it&#39;s spinoffs), the default subreddits, the anti-trump flavor-of-the-week subreddits, and the inexplicably upvoted submissions that are barely relevant to the generally non-political subreddit:  np.reddit.com<a href="/r/scifi/comments/5x5t42/sir_patrick_stewart_im_applying_for_us/">/r/scifi/comments/5x5t42/sir_patrick_stewart_im_applying_for_us/</a></p>

<p>If you consider conspiracy t_d#2, blame correct the record, shareblue, and the reddit admins for forcing an obvious narrative down our throats day after day.  Conspiracy users will push back against heavy-handed stuff like that reflexively.</p>

<p>I was watching Rachel Maddow a couple months ago and thought her tenuous evidence was weaker than many conspiracies I don&#39;t even think credible.  The house he made a massive profit on?  He sold it in 2008, at the height of the housing bubble.  The meetings with various ambassadors before transitioning into the white house seem prudent considering working with ambassadors is a good tool for foreign diplomacy.  His tax return release was a non-story that was hyped way out of proportion.  The collusion by Trump with Russia was a non-starter as testified by Comey.  But now it&#39;s all about how he obstructed justice and needs to be impeached.</p>

<p>I have plenty of complaints about Trump and the people surrounding him, but this constant speculation and news stories that go nowhere is exhausting.  I also had no taste for the abuse Obama received from members of the tea party and Fox eight years ago either.</p>

<p>My belief is we&#39;re purposefully being torn apart and incited to violence and hatred in a left/right, black/white manner to distract us long enough for some plan to come to fruition.</p>

I like the theories and information.  I often find that this sub has the best and most recent groundbreaking news before most other sites.  I love that!  I always sort by new though, and I almost never go to r/all.  I don&#39;t want the popularity of a post to determine my thinking or research.  I hate all this negativity and name calling.  I think it plays right into TPTB hands and only divides us further.  Who cares about who you support politically?  This sub is supposed to be about learning and researching Conspiracy Theories.

    <div class="md"><p>I do feel the same way about Obama, it&#39;s just that we&#39;ve moved past him, he&#39;s no longer president and using his actions to excuse Trump&#39;s is just, well, I feel it&#39;s empty excuses at this point. Obama was wrong, just as Trump is, but I&#39;ve seen it time and again where redditors use &#39;but Obama&#39; as if it excuses Trump, when it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I just believe we shouldn&#39;t use previous presidents actions (or in-actions) as an excuse for the current president&#39;s choices, no matter who they are or what choices we are criticising them for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I care about the rule of law and equal treatment. You can throw the book at Trump for all I care as long as you do it to Clinton too. I don&#39;t give a fuck what Trump thinks about it; the Democrats are the ones who are trying to nail him for something that they did too. </p>

<p>If the Democrats really care about holding high officials accountable, they can show it by handing over Clinton and the people who covered for her.</p>

<p>Look, Trump can go fuck himself with a rusty cactus. This is about principle. Prosecuting people for crimes because you don&#39;t like their politics is the definition of tyranny. We&#39;re supposed to be better than the Soviet Union!  And it&#39;s obvious that the Democrats are trying to prosecute him because they don&#39;t like his politics, because if they really cared about obstruction of justice they would care about Loretta and Bill&#39;s meeting on the tarmac and Hillary deleting tens of thousands of emails at her own discretion.

<p>Probably less under-qualified than Trump&#39;s cab, but they&#39;d still be execs no doubt.  And there was that whole &quot;pay-for-play&quot; issue of a major donor getting a committee seat he had no qualifications for, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s unheard of.</p>

<p>Both were confirmed by official sources, thank you very much.  I know you think that criticizing Clinton makes me an obvious Trump supporter, but I assure you, I am no shill and no supporter of that buffoon.  I didn&#39;t even bring up the Clinton topic, I just responded to a post that said &quot;she wouldn&#39;t have done these things&quot; with examples that yes, she would.  </p>

<p>In fact, that&#39;s what this entire post is about, which half the commenters seem to have missed.  It is possible to be anti-trump and still be able to see that there is a massive anti-trump propaganda campaign being waged.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow if you think it&#39;s in the president&#39;s power to sell weapons to other countries you need to open your eyes. Obama did it, bush did it, it&#39;s a problem with the system we are in. Also she DID obstruct Justice when she lied under oath AND refused the FBI from looking at the DNC servers. The corruption is from all angles, it&#39;s set up so that we feel stuck and get to choose from what we&#39;ve been given. </p>

<p>There are plenty of extremists, and yes some (idiotic) people come here and try to push their pro-trump agenda, but that&#39;s not what this sub it truly about. Take a step back and see how the media, the president, and the government in general is turning the public against ourselves. We need to unite and act as a unified people, not as &quot;pro Trump&quot; &quot;pro Hillary&quot; even rep or Dem. We need to actually make a stand against the people who are pushing BOTH SIDES of the arguments we are having.</p>

<p>The problem is that BOTH SIDES aren&#39;t engaging with equal honesty and integrity. People are free to criticise Clinton, Podesta and the DNC without being downvoted or swarmed with defenders telling them to look the other way, but the same isn&#39;t true of Trump or the Republican party.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no-one defending Clinton Some people are asking why we&#39;re focusing on some random Senator who is not in government when the other party controls all branches of government, but no one is defending Clinton.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we&#39;re not allowed to discuss conspiracies or corruption involving the President of the USA and his political party that controls the entire government, because those conversations are brigaded, downvoted and turned into petty shitfights.</p>

<p>There were no &quot;Obama supporters&quot; posting here in the last eight years. There was no <a href="/r/The_Barack">/r/The_Barack</a> brigading, constantly telling us to look the other way.</p>

<p>This subreddit has been ruined by Trump supporters and their refusal to look at the corruption of &quot;their side&quot; even though people who voted for Obama spent the last 8 years doing exactly that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no smear campaign going on against him.  He is just inept at controlling the narrative.  The messages that come out of his WH are consistently contradictory.  Hell, the messages that come out of Trump himself regularly contradict what he&#39;s said only days before.   </p>

<p>This is a guy who led chants of &quot;lock her up&quot; and then turned on a dime right after the election to say that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt the Clintons and won&#39;t seek the special prosecutor he promised to have appointed only days before.  This is a guy who says he&#39;ll make sure everyone has healthcare coverage at the government expense no matter how much it pisses off Republicans and then authors a bill that does the opposite.  This is a guy who said he wouldn&#39;t touch Medicaid and then supports legislation that cuts it by hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>

<p>Trump is  just a blatant liar and you&#39;re crazy if you think the media isn&#39;t going to cover blatant lies and contradictions from the WH.   </p>

Any politician who behaved the way he does would receive the same kind of scrutiny in the media.

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhhh what? </p>

<p>IIRC there were any number of press articles about the massive amount of coverage the MSM gave Trumps campaign at the expense of Clintons. Now press is bad press, especially if you are Trump, not that the MSM thought they were doing him and favors. </p>

<p>Same with Bernie vs Clinton; the MSM decided the narrative was Clintons got this, which helped Bernie lose. They also didn&#39;t aggressivly report on the shady games the DNC was playing with the nomination, because the story was Clinton has this one. </p>

<p>So yeah, lots of MSM culpability for Trump. It&#39;s one of the reasons they are so irrationally and violently anti-Trump now... Guilt over their perceived collusion in a result they (most MSM staff are pretty liberal and Democrat) directly created. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a cheating spouse... Once you cheat, you must paint a picture of the spouse you chested on as being extra evil and bad, thus allowing the blame and shame for your actions to be their fault and not your own. </p>

<p>In a quick glance, you accuse Podesta and Hillary of child porn, engaging in human trafficking and other crimes.   You accused Hillary of lots actually.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said either one is probably true given the fanatical censorship about Seth Rich and pizzagate. </p>

<p>Anthony Weiner has been caught more than once sexting underaged girls.</p>

<p>And Spez is a fucking loser who can&#39;t handle that a large sub has a different opinion than he does so he has to change the algorithm for the entire website to suppress it.</p>

<p>So basically I said nothing about what you originally accused me of saying. And so what? Why do you care? Are you some fucking loser who spends all his time searching peoples post history for something to attack them with? You can&#39;t even seem to do that right.</p>

<p>This is why his tweet was posted in a conspiracy subreddit, because the President of the United States has to resort to social media to get his own message out unfiltered.  The MSM is corrupt, has been long before Trump became political and was called corrupt in this very subreddit long before then as well.  </p>

<p>The only new addition here is anti Trump &quot;conspiracy posters&quot; who claim we should suddenly take the MSM&#39;s word on matters of importance because Trump is bad.</p>

<p>Most don&#39;t.  They get a edited clip of Trump, followed by a biased take on what his entire speech was with a few anonymous sources thrown in claiming the exact opposite of what the administration says.  Then the anonymous source is paraded around as fact for the next few days.</p>

<p>ayyyy, bigtime shout out from a conspiracy nutter! I&#39;d like to thank pizzagate, vince foster, and the lizard people for getting me here!
I am, of course, the alt for all the accounts you think (wink). We all know there&#39;s no conflicting opinions on Reddit, and everyone who disagrees with you is part of a one-person shill team!!
How did someone get banned from an anti-trump sub for repping conspiratorial trump talking points?? The world may never know!&quot;</p>

<p>repping conspiratorial trump talking points?  What were those again?  </p>

<p>Your post history and overlap with the few people that uses them is more telling than anything I&#39;ve said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah dude im totally the mod of those subs you mentioned. Like I said, im the alt of the one person on reddit who disagrees with you, it doesn&#39;t matter where.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how someone who is a trump supporter and tries to spread trump conspiracy theories (like how russia is an innocent lily white dove who would never <em>ever</em> influence the us election, especially for the guy who asked them to in public, and how the entire thing is made up by podesta, the guy who <em>made</em> trump hire manafort, flynn, sessions, kushner, page, and praise putin endlessly) gets banned from an anti-trump sub. It sounds like shill work to me.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing your story of how you found r/conspiracy. I&#39;m going to get it printed and hang it by my desk. I wonder why a lot of people post on popular threads, it&#39;s mind boggling to me. It&#39;s probably shills, too, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What this reply basically states</p>

<p>&quot;I have less proof of russia than these &quot;nutters&quot; i openly mock.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s russia influencing? Not hacking eh?  How&#39;s that goalpost movement going for you? </p>

<p>In your own post history we have Russia Hacked the elections, russia tried to hack elections, russia tried to influence.</p>

<p>Is influence like having a former president fly to a country and openly campaign for one person?  Seems that would be a better way to influence a nation than sending nigerian &quot;i&#39;m a prince&quot; phish emails.</p>

<p>Glad to know topminds is basically Dunning-Kruger effect in action.  The houlier than thou attitude though is bit over the top when you apply &quot;hate&quot; to every subreddit you disagree with</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, trump publicly asked russia to &quot;find&quot; the emails, which in this case would be hacking. Although it was sarcastic, it&#39;s an insane thing for a president to say. Russia admits to trying to influence the election and jokes about hacking it, and is roundly, loudly, and quickly defended by trump, which is another insane thing.</p>

You&#39;re a poster on <a href="/r/T_D">/r/T_D</a>, a sub that actively cheerleads for the head of the US government and actively ignores the wrongdoings of said head, and therefore have no place in a subreddit that should strive to question all those in power, especially those who hold suspicion of underhanded dealings. Also, you&#39;re using childish tactics like deflecting to try to avoid the matter at hand, the fact that people with clear pro-Trump biases are flooding the sub with propaganda supporting the current US Government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the people who subscribe to group think that are in a state of crisis.</p>

<p>The people who rely on being told what to think rather than thinking for themselves have become the rope in a game of tug-o-war between two increasingly polarized sectors of the populace.</p>

<p>People are paranoid because they know that their mind is being bid on by both sides. They are afraid that their support is more important than the truth and are aware that they&#39;re being lied to. Those who fall on one side are terrified of listening to the other side because the cognitive dissonance will cause them distress.</p>

<p>The only way to be objective is to understand both sides and try and do the most good for the most people. To take on a sort of &quot;the only rule is that there are no rules&quot; stance, in that &quot;the only thing that all of us have to agree on is that we don&#39;t have to agree on everything&quot;.</p>

<p>I am so tired of this &#39;guilt by association&#39; mentality where if you even <em>read</em>, god forbid <em>post</em> on T_D, you get tagged, and stalked, and told your opinion doesn&#39;t matter. Same goes for <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing to dig through someone&#39;s post history because you can&#39;t find the words to refute the post you disagreed with on it&#39;s own, kindly find the nearest stove and slam your head in the door until you understand what you&#39;ve done wrong</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but did you even read the headline of this fucking post? No, it does not say &quot;love&quot; exactly, but it sure as shit defends him and makes him look like a victim of circumstance rather than his own fucking incompetence, which he is.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t even need the MSM to wreck his reputation. He just needs Twitter and those words are coming from the man himself. The bucks stops with Trump on Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In what way, from my past experiences your far more likely to see an article from Ron Paul or James Corbett then Trump, it should be noted as well that t_D isn&#39;t what it once was. My memories from the early days of t_D were it revolved around the Federal Reserve, Anti-War and Intervention, and Job Opportunity for the struggling middle class already which at least the first two sounds like the grievances we at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> try to highlight, so it that way this place does mirror t_D before then deep state. </p>

<p>When the election grew closer, it went from all those things to never mentioning the Federal Reserve, being Pro War and Pro Intervention, and hating Muslims. The backbones of the Neocon Conservative movement. The fact that now this group seems to have taken an interest in here should tell you that other factions outside the Democratic Deep State are trying desperately to try and steer the narrative to us being Pro Trump when all that we are pointing out are Fed and Income Myth, Political Pedophilia, Military Industrial Complex, Middle East Intervention, Israel and Saudi Influence and other conspiracies that the community wants to highlight.</p>

<p>Now we are being attacked from the both the &quot;Left&quot; (ShareBlue) and Right (Cambridge Analytica, Zionist Front PR Firms,) as they try to frame this narrative and buy upvotes for exposure to set their and their bosses agenda. It&#39;s especially noticeable when someone has like 200-400+ upvotes in bashing a thread detrimental to the swamp and push the narrative. Anyone who has been here long enough can see the obvious bullshit, but get downvoted to hell by the PR firms.</p>

<p>If you get so frustrated by the stance of articles, you might need some more personal work to get a bit more detached from your opinion. It isn&#39;t necessary to buy into a narrative to understand it, once you&#39;re able to juggle a few alternate timelines of events into your head it becomes much easier to navigate the complex timelines of most really interesting/detailed &quot;big picture&quot; theories. </p>

<p>For example, I do understand that one possible reason to play golf is to get (I assume at a presidential course?) private meeting time with important people you want to meet with (Rand Paul before healthcare bill, Shinzo Abe when he visited, etc.) He&#39;s been looking like he could use the exercise too, I&#39;m sure we can agree on that haha. </p>

<p>On the other hand, he could just be golfing because he wants to wave his presidential dick around more. It definitely costs a fair amount of money, although I can&#39;t imagine anything other than jerking off at the White House that would be cheaper for Secret Service to cover. Hell, even that probably costs a good $10,000 per hour or whatever.  </p>

<p>But again, you&#39;re always going to come across alternate viewpoints that you don&#39;t agree with in any conspiracy community. Treat the flat earthers, the phantom time theorists, the &quot;Matrix&quot;-ers, the ayy-lmaoists (did I just invent the best name for cosmic Communism?) all equally and entertain their ideas. At the very least, understanding the psychology of holding a drastically different viewpoint is very helpful for keeping your brain sharp. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all my point is really. Just explained two possible stances on the issue and how each is a possibility that could be entertained, just like every really big conspiracy. Once you encounter more than a few big ones, you need to be able to adopt this viewpoint and not be raging all the time. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just advice from a fellow human being. You&#39;re letting politics get in the way of something way more important (truth, whichever timeline/narrative it ends up being). </p>

<p>How do you feel about this sub having numerous posts with 500+ karma about how it&#39;s either anti Trump or pro Trump all occuring within the last 24 hours? Currently holding online user in excess of 1000 people over average. My opinion is something​ is afoot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>George Bush Sr. had JFK assassinated because he didn&#39;t green-light air support for the bay of pigs operation. That&#39;s the kind of stuff I come here for. Trump has a ROTHSCHILD BANKER WORKING FOR HIM. A GOLDMAN SACHS banker working for him. As far as I&#39;m concerned he&#39;s as guilty as the rest of them. Yall are forgetting who really pulls the strings. He&#39;s a puppet and the Illuminati are tryin to take him out since he&#39;s in too deep with Russia to the tune of a few billion in loans.</p>

<p>Trump is the POTUS. He&#39;s as much a part of the establishment as anyone has ever been at this point. His lack of political experience is now to his detriment but it doesn&#39;t make him anti-establishment. Not while appointing the establishment to the cabinet, letting them prop up private prisons, try to kill network neutrality, make student loans more predatory, re-instate mandatory minimum sentencing and execute lots of other traditionally establishment Republican agendas.</p>

<p>I my mind, the establishment have the NWO globalist agenda that they want to impose on the world, whether we like it or not.  </p>

<p>Trump is definitely a Nationalist, and this conflicts directly with the NWO globalist agenda.  It will be interesting how it all plays out.  If Trump resists too much, then he will be impeached or JFK&#39;d.  </p>

<p>Being a billionaire might not inherently make you &quot;establishment&quot;, but being a billionaire who:<br/>
hobnobs with politicians (ex: going to the Clinton&#39;s weddings)<br/>
has relatives in the government (ex: a sister for a judge)<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment are the trillionaire class.  They control all, and decide policy.  It is why they created The Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.  This is where policy is created.  The politicians are tasked with implementing the policy, and it does not matter if they are Democrat or Republican.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, someone like Kissinger is not establishment.  He is merely an establishment goon that creates and implements their policies.  This is beneath someone like a Rothschild or Rockefeller.  Do you see what I mean?  </p>

<p>I see what you are saying, but I have a different definition.  The politicians are not establishment because they come and go.  Families like the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are always there, so they are establishment.  </p>

He is a billionaire who spent his entire life mingling among politicians, bankers, and media elites. He then proceeds to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; by appointing former bankers and lobbyists. </p>

<p>Those who point to his law restricting former lobbyists never mention that Trump has signed five times more ethics waivers than Obama did within in the first four months. Then he REFUSED to disclose those waivers to the Office of Government Ethics and then LIED about the letter of refusal being leaked. It was legally obtained through a FOIA request lmao. Their refusal was an unprecedented action that serves no purpose other than attempting to conceal their ethics waivers. </p>

<p>To me when I see a poster stop posting completely afterwards it tells me they are potentially a shill and/or have been on an alt just for trying to sway conspiracy. </p>

<p>I&#39;d really like you to expand on this.  The two of them are absolutely nothing alike in my view.

<p>Ron Paul was the populist Republican candidate that was ignored. Trump is the populist candidate who couldn&#39;t be ignored, so he gets mocked and the media is saturated with lies about him.  So while the Ron Paul and Donald Trump are very different people, to their supporters they represent the same anti-globalist message, so there&#39;s a feeling of continuity between their campaigns.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one of my biggest pet peeves. If you call bullshit on a media article that is attacking Trump, that doesn&#39;t make you &quot;pro-Trump.&quot; Maybe I want the media to <em>accurately</em> report how shitty Trump is (and leave like 80 percent of the rest of their stories about other important things), rather than spending 50 percent of their resources and time attacking Trump for every little thing, and exaggerating while they do it. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw people claiming that anything anti-Trump will be downvoted to oblivion, so I decided to see if that was true. It&#39;s false, of course, and the comments usually swing anti-Trump, but anti-Trump submissions can get plenty of upvotes and hit the top of this sub. </p>

<p>Here are just a few examples I found from a quick search: </p>

<p>2,000 points, gilded, and claims he will be downvoted:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6chgbe/dear_t_d_readers_please_read_this_post_i_am_ready/">Dear T_D readers, Please read this post. I am ready for your downvotes. If you are a trump supporter who also visits this sub, here is a message for you. The_Donald is one of the most heavily censored subs on reddit. Try posting anything that questions the supremacy of Donald Trump. Your post will get removed and you will be banned</a></p>

<p>2,400 points:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6g7jcf/house_republicans_with_support_form_trump_passes/">House Republicans with support form [<em>sic</em>] Trump passes sweeping legislation to roll back banking rules on globalist bankers who caused the great recession</a></p>

<p>26,000 points: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6awhsy/im_fucking_tired_of_the_fucking_war_on_drugs_jeff/?st=j2ndg2p6&amp;amp;sh=61617e28">&quot;I&#39;m fucking TIRED of the fucking WAR on drugs. Jeff Sessions Demands &quot;Strongest Possible Charges&quot; For Drug Users. Fuck Jeff Sessions, and Fuck the War on Drugs&quot;</a></p>

<p>1,000 points: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6f952z/if_we_fund_the_terrorists_they_will_stop/">If we fund the terrorists they will stop attacking us, its a foolproof plan!</a></p>

<p>This one was stickied for a while: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/?ref=search_posts">&quot;Let me explain exactly how Trump is a Rothschild asset and has been for decades. How his advisers, policies, alternative media talking heads all emanate from the Cabal, via Rothschild financial influence. We&#39;ll begin with Alex Jones and make our way down.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Here are a few that are not exactly &quot;anti-Trump&quot; submissions, but look at the comments. They are full of anti-Trump discussion upvoted to the top:</p>

<p>4,000 points: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5txzbc/michael_flynn_resigns_trumps_national_security/?st=j2mm8gbv&amp;amp;sh=c38fdfb0">&quot;Michael Flynn resigns: Trump&#39;s national security adviser quits over Russia links.&quot;</a></p>

<p>10,000 points: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a8k3o/president_trump_fires_fbi_director_comey/dhcm43s/">Trump fires Comey,, comments full of anti-Trump material</a></p>

<p>Even the top posts that support Trump (usually fake news bullshit that anti-Trump people probably post to discredit Trumpets) are full of anti-Trump comments upvoted to the top and occasionally gilded. Here is an example:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6exlzq/melania_trump_bans_monsanto_products_from_the/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6exlzq/melania_trump_bans_monsanto_products_from_the/</a></p>

<p>How is it possible that these kinds of comments and submissions get so many upvotes? Maybe this sub is full of a lot of different people? Maybe the claim that &quot;this sub is overflowing with Trump supporters&quot; is complete bullshit? Not only that, but the claim that this sub suddenly turned &quot;pro-government&quot; due to some Trump-supporters being here is also bullshit. Users here have supported many government officials in the past, including Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, etc. Maybe Trump is not anti-establishment, but that doesn&#39;t matter. Some people here think he is, so there is no reason to be &quot;surprised&quot; when you see some Trump supporters. Get over it and stop the false narratives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is more of a wild card, and he was not supposed to win.  Hillary is definitely pro-establishment, and she was supposed to win.  </p>

<p>I know that the Establishment have this NWO globalist agenda that they want to impose on the world.  We never voted on it, but it was unilaterally decided that it is the best thing for humanity.  It would include dissolving the US as a nation state, so any politician supporting it should be tried for treason.  </p>

<p>I know what Trump is a Nationalist, which directly conflicts with the NWO globalist agenda.  It will be interesting to see how this all plays out.  The Establishment will have to &quot;persuade&quot; Trump to get with their program one way or another.  I am not even sure that Trump has the ability to understand their agenda.  LOL.  </p>

<p>I suppose they can impeach or JFK him if he resists, and I suspect they will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was drawn to this sub initially because of how they treated all MSM with skepticism. This sub would try to see the broader implications of news stories and their role in manufacturing narratives.   </p>

<p>Nowadays things have changed. Regular posters are aligning themselves with the government, on the basis that the media is always evil.</p>

<p>I wish we could get some objectivity on here. I wish people could realize that Donald is slowly implementing the financial policies that Goldman Sachs have been having wet dreams about for years. I wish users would understand that without WaPo, General Flynn would still be head of National Security, lobbying on behalf of Turkey. I wish posters would question why the top lawyer in the United States seems to practice selective amnesia unless the topic at hand involves filling up private prisons.</p>

<p>This is in no way a blind appreciation post for MSM. Regular posters know that MSM is complicit in several coverups. Hell, people actually believe Saudis were the only entity behind 9/11 because of the role of the media. But it&#39;s time to face the sirens. </p>

<p>The Trump admin is going down in flames. </p>

I believe the Trump/Russian collusion narrative is complete bs.
I also believe that Kushner and friends may have had shady business dealings and conflict of interest regarding Russia.
I also believe that Trump is now compromised after his 180 on foreign policy in March.  He is now openly funding terrorism like any Bush or Clinton.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m personally against a lot of the things that Trump does, but there is CLEARLY a conspiracy between major media outlets, deep state operatives, and establishment politicians to destroy his presidency. Anyone looking at the scenario objectively should be able to see this.  The only time the press unanimously praised Trump was when he bombed Syria without congressional approval.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend agree with what you&#39;ve said. I&#39;ve played over quite a few scenarios in my mind and even I can&#39;t conceive that the entire MSM, Hollywood (music, tv, films) and others are all in on this vast conspiracy where they hate on Trump 24/7, make things up, etc. IF they don&#39;t feel legitimately threatened by him, or what he represents. I love &quot;conspiracies&quot; and have since high school but this just doesn&#39;t make sense. I&#39;m not saying Trump is some angel or perhaps not a part of this grand scheme in one way or the other, but the reaction from the media, etc. just doesn&#39;t make sense to me unless they truly feel threatened by him (his supporters?) It&#39;s the one thing that always pulls me back when I think that Trump is willingly in on it. They may be using him to further their agenda but if so they are actually being counterproductive because a lot of average people were awakened this past election cycle up til now simply from viewing the way the media was (is) so dishonest and in it for Hillary. After that it pretty much became undeniable that <em>something</em> was going on to anyone with a working brain in their head..</p>

<p>This statement should go both ways with Trump, who is obviously a ass, and those that smear him in the government.  And of course the media should be questioned also. </p>

<p>Obama destroyed a country and then bragged about on Leno. Hillary laughed about the leader getting murdered, yes I know he was a bad guy but look and the country now.</p>

<p>I think that behaviour is reprehensible and in my opinion Trump has not done anything that bad.... yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like Im looking at this objectively. We have elected a buffoonish con-man. Lots of people recognize that now, as many did before the election. That&#39;s what you are hearing over and over. Articles about this will not destroy his presidency, he is doing that on his own quite well.</p>

<p>Care to provide some sort of evidence of this CLEAR conspiracy? Because what I see are politicians on both sides scared of what this guy will do to our country. I think proof of that is when some of these politicians that really have nothing in common are giving the same warnings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, come on.  It&#39;s pretty clear that posts about Hillary Clinton being Satanic, a pedophile, a child trafficker, mass murderer, biblical demon, and my personal favorite... cannibal who has contracted Kuru due to eating murdered children are absolutely grounded in reality!  The piss dossier is clearly MSM fake news that doesn&#39;t need to be discussed because it conflicts with the worldview fed to me by various conservative talking heads.  /s</p>

<p>Sorry, had to get that out.  When that happened (said post being tagged) it had become clear to me that some of the mods were unable to be objective.  It was disheartening to say the least.  That incident, along with the torrential downpour of posts that we get when the MSM reports on something &quot;big&quot;*, has proven to me that this place has become a battleground for ideologues.  Ugh, the amount of completely misleading or inaccurate posts is just sad as well.</p>

<p>*To clarify;  Trump&#39;s sharing of intelligence shitshow triggered 400 Seth Rich posts.  It&#39;s happened several times and the amount of people that can&#39;t recognize it is sad for a place that is supposed to hold critical thinking as one of its central axioms. </p>

<p>And then Trump was elected, and suddenly half of the people who were claiming to be anti-establishment proved that they really never were, because they started viciously defending the establishment from any and all criticism.</p>

<p>Trump is the POTUS. Trump&#39;s party controls all three branches of the US government. Trump is appointing (and firing) heads of the intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Trump has literally become &#39;the establishment&#39;, but his fanatical supporters only want to see him as the underdog so they can continue with their victimhood narrative.</p>

<p>There are people here who are willing to criticise all parties and branches of the government, but Trump supporters don&#39;t care about power, the establishment, or real corruption - they just care about promoting their dictator and playing victim.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was the mods of that subreddit who shut it down. Even if that is a conspiracy, it&#39;s a conspiracy isolated to a tiny group of vocal pro-government sycophants who decided to close their own circlejerk.  Who the fuck cares? Or if we should care, shouldn&#39;t we care about looking into the motivations of the people who made the fucking decision to shut the subreddit down?</p>

<p>When <a href="/r/leftwithsharpedge">/r/leftwithsharpedge</a> was shut down, did the Trump shilling moderators welcome all the refugees from that subreddit? What about when the admins started censoring things in <a href="/r/anarchism">/r/anarchism</a>?</p>

<p>Trump shilling moderators shut down <em>their own</em> subreddit, and somehow that was a conspiracy worthy of welcoming all of the people who defend the corruption of the current administration. But when the administrators of reddit <em>actually</em> censored political subreddits, that wasn&#39;t worth the time of the Trump shilling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators, because it conflicts with the ridiculously childish victimhood narrative that keeps Trump supporters feeling like they&#39;re on the right side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump, for his first few months in office, has been neither a good nor bad president. He&#39;s a mediocre con artist and demagogue, with a habit of reversing and rebranding Dem-era legislation, just like every other mediocre Republican president. </p>

<p>If you believe the sustained character assassination that he&#39;s received from the mainstream media, you would think that he was spawned from the devil&#39;s rectum during a black mass. Suspicious doesn&#39;t even begin to describe it. It&#39;s a coordinated - and no doubt very expensive - smear campaign, orchestrated by the power elite who are disgruntled that their favored Illuminati pawn didn&#39;t win. </p>

<p>Make no mistake, I consider myself a far-leftist, and I <em>don&#39;t</em> like Trump, but electing another Clinton would have been a grave error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for assuming. You said &quot;the media,&quot; but it seemed like what you really meant was &quot;the part of the media that disagrees with Trump,&quot; and that part is mainly liberal.

<p>Do you honestly not believe that the media is wholly controlled? Looking into Operation Mockingbird would be a good start. I mean, Trump only garnered so much attention initially because the DNC directed the media to play up Pied Piper candidates, which is telling all on its own. It is my firm and informed believe that the IC has much more influence over the media than either party.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we view the media is &quot;wholly controlled&quot;, and every major news organization from Fox to MSNBC is in cahoots, then that leads us to the &quot;it&#39;s all theatre&quot; explanation, which is a possibility I am open to. However, that scenario also opens the door to the possibility that Trump&#39;s victory was simply another part of the plan. If a united and immensely powerful media conglomerate allowed him to ascend to the presidency, clearly he poses no real threat to the interests that control this conglomerate. And if this is all theatre, how can you be so sure that Trump isn&#39;t just another actor? We&#39;ve all read about his past fondness for the Clintons and seen them laughing it up at Melania&#39;s wedding. And I&#39;m supposed to believe that he&#39;s a black swan? Forgive me if I&#39;m skeptical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely, Trump has influence. He won the election for a reason. Fox News is popular, though its ratings have seriously slipped and I don&#39;t believe it is rated number one any longer. However, I&#39;ve not seen much of any evidence to indicate that Fox is a manipulated mouthpiece for the IC in the way the rest of the media is. They&#39;re a rather new institution, not hooked into the apparatus to nearly the same degree; missed out on the Mockingbird heyday. TO REITERATE: Fox News is gaaaaarbage journalism pushing a huge adenga, I don&#39;t watch or like it. I just don&#39;t believe them to be fully owned by the IC.</p>

<p>Not all influence is equally insidious. Trump&#39;s media presence is overt, obvious. It is the secret coordination with deep state interests(which you can damn well be sure has benefited from illegal government psychological experimentation ah la mkultra/torture) that makes the rest of the media a loathsome dog of the state. </p>

<p>Funny how a subreddit that is NOT pro-Trump has the same users now as the Russians over on <a href="/r/uncensorednews">/r/uncensorednews</a> and the children from <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a>.  </p>

<p>Funny how a subreddit that is NOT pro-Trump is still talking about Clinton foundation shit endlessly while actively refusing to even entertain the idea that Trump is compromised.  </p>

<p>Funny how a subreddit that is NOT pro-Trump has Trump false-equivalence tweets heavily upvoted, in spite of the fact that they have nothing to do with any conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Funny how a subreddit that is NOT pro-Trump is so actively and belligerent NOT anti-Trump.   </p>

<p>Funny how a subreddit that is NOT pro-Trump has no problem believing that THE PIZZA IS KIDS, but thinks it&#39;s insane to think that the President, who has made hundreds of millions of dollars from Russia, is compromised. </p>

<p>The irony of calling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subscribers &quot;free thinkers&quot; is most certainly not lost. </p>

<p>Do you understand the concept of scales? Of gradients? Ranges? Scope?</p>

<p>You want people to stop talking about the Clinton Foundation whose laundry list of alleged crimes included: murder, child trafficking, human sacrifice, money laundering, selling political appointments, intimidation, and financing terrorism; and focus on an orange baffoon who may have taken money from Russians???</p>

<p>The President of the United States is acting against the interests of the United States, has received hundreds of millions of dollars from Russian interests over the last 2 decades, and actively colluded with Russians during the campaign and after to change US policy in their favor.

<p>You made a post telling people not to criticise the POTUS, despite the overt corruption and scandals plaguing him, despite his overreach and abuse of power in his short tenure, and despite the huge conspiracies surrounding him.</p>

<p>If someone had made a post like this about Obama, they would have been drowned in downvotes and told to fuck off, but now that Republican bootlickers have their own corrupt conspirator in the White House, we&#39;re being told to ignore the fucking power grabs, the criminal overreach, the obstruction, the lies and deception, and the fear-mongering &#39;Muslim terrorism&#39; narrative that&#39;s still being pushed while the white-supremacist terror attacks are being ignored.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve decided Trump is &#39;your guy&#39; so he can do no wrong. You&#39;re willing to overlook all of the criminality and all of the abuses of power - you&#39;re willing to overlook the establishment and all that it does now that he has sway over it - because you&#39;re defending &#39;your side&#39;.</p>

<p>This subreddit turned to complete shit once Trump seized power, because <strong>instead of trying to address corruption and abuse at the highest levels, half of the people here are obsequious bootlickers who just want to focus on emails and pizza</strong>, and will downvote and shout down any conversation about the truly powerful exploiting that.</p>

<p>So a pro-Trumper is trying to convince people that this sub isn&#39;t pro-Trump, but is trying to show people the &quot;truth&quot; that MSM is trying to brainwash people. Yeah, not buying that narrative, buddy. Especially from someone saying shit like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The scary thing is the amount of liberal brainwashing that is happening in schools at every grade level. These cucked teachers abuse the respect that is expected for educators and use it to inject their mental illness into the minds of children. These weakminded people argue politics before children are taught the critical thinking to point out the obvious logical flaws in their BS.</p>

<p>My brothers and sister all bring home horror stories of teachers flying off the handle at students and even mocking them if they support the &quot;wrong&quot; viewpoint.</p>

<p>Take a close look at who is teaching you children (K-12). Don&#39;t bother investigating college level teachers. 99% chance they are totally cucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You read way too far into that, didn&#39;t ya?</p>

<p>I admit that I see constant manufactured anti-Trump hysteria.  I fight against this hysteria and propaganda that I am certain is being manufactured by the deep state.  Trump ruined the agenda of both DNC and GOP and is attacked by both.  Just because he has an R by his name doesn&#39;t mean he owns them. I don&#39;t support Trump and I dislike his policies and personality.  However I dislike what the media and the establishment are doing to tailor opinion against him even more.  I considered myself a moderate (dem) until the whole party sunk into radical Anti-Trump obstructionism as their only policy.  After being red-pilled by the last election I think Trump is still part of the elite controlling us, but he was a surprise disruption to the bought and paid for elite agenda.  That&#39;s why they attack him.  I go to the various other subreddits because most the people on here are still sucking from the teet of the MSM and those are the only places you find rational thinking humans anymore.  You choosing to point attack my thinking that liberal brainwashing in schools is a bad thing makes me think you&#39;ve already been fully brainwashed.  We&#39;ll know soon enough. </p>

<p>This is where the obvious difference is. You&#39;ve been &quot;redpilled&quot; so you are <em>certain</em> that anything that goes against your narrative must be some sort of conspiracy against it. But &quot;the media&quot; (which conveniently doesn&#39;t include Fox News despite their influence as an arm of the Republican party) is only showing what&#39;s popular and relevant, and every intelligent person in the world thinks Trump is a narcissistic idiot. Most people, regardless of intelligence, recognise the fascination value of having such an outspoken egomaniac in control of the country, and that&#39;s why &quot;the media&quot; is constantly showing the calamity that&#39;s Trump&#39;s presidency.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are no democratic party defenders here - only Trump shills. With that said, the Democratic party has policies, but a) they&#39;re not in government, so that&#39;s not really relevant, and b) <strong>obstructionism was literally the only policy of the Republican party for the last eight years</strong>. If that&#39;s the hinge this door of stupidity swings on, it&#39;s as hypocritical as it is ignorant.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. Trump ruined the plans of the DNC, obviously, but the GOP and the deep state are over the fucking moon to have such an easily cowed puppet in the whitehouse. Trump&#39;s someone who will do everything they want with only the most basic prodding, and because they control the entire government and he has the rabid support of so many morons, nothing he can possibly do or say will ever set them back.</p>

<p>The deep state is <em>thriving</em> with people like you focusing on the Democrats while they have literally no power.</p>

<p>When did I say that?  You seem to enjoy putting words in people&#39;s mouth and casting assumptions.  Not a good argument technique. Like how you assumed because I&#39;m not against something then I&#39;m definitely for it, or because I post to a subreddit that I&#39;m a blind, stupid supporter.  Makes it easy for you to simplify these things so you can justify generalized hatred of a whole group instead of considering the many shades of gray in between extremes. </p>

<p>Again you&#39;re assuming I didn&#39;t include Fox and that I think theres a conspiracy against my &quot;narrative&quot; (wtf does that even mean?).  Fox is as bad as any and is manufactured counter-thought while still piping the elites narrative into the masses. </p>

<p>There aren&#39;t &quot;only Trump shills&quot; if you can&#39;t see the massive Anti-Trump shilling then you are truly a blind person.  </p>

<p>The deep state is <em>thriving</em> while people like you go to such huge lengths to defend their current puppet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to get this straight, what do you think the deep state is exactly?  I think it&#39;s the CIA and shadow government entities that control the media, banks/Fed, etc.  If that&#39;s the case then why the fuck would they attack their own puppet?  That makes zero sense.  He disrupted their plans so he&#39;s got to go.  Is he the savior?  Hell no.  But it&#39;s fun to watch him disrupt their whole agenda as both sides sling propaganda and attack one another in a power struggle.  I&#39;d rather watch that than our regularly scheduled globalist programming.  You&#39;re the one on the deep states side and I think you&#39;re on the wrong side of history.  Don&#39;t support Trump but definitely stop helping the deep state return us to watching shadows on the wall with their mental enslavement objectives. While they&#39;re focused on him we get a little chance to crawl from our caves and see real daylight. </p>

<p>Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.</p>

<p>Bush: Whatever you want.</p>

<p>Trump: Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those entertainers and Trump&#39;s boasting of how does anything he wants to women have nothing in common.</p>

<p>And honestly, you don&#39;t know what kind of person I am.  I don&#39;t like Trump for a lot of reasons.  And I am not focusing on &quot;something like this&quot; more than anything else, I just used this as an explanation for why Twoxchromosomes bans the Donald users.</p>

<p>People like you are annoying because you think everyone has to think like you do, and if they don&#39;t, they&#39;re somehow missing what&#39;s important.  It&#39;s you&#39;re opinion that Trump was being sarcastic, and it&#39;s mine that he&#39;s a piece of shit man that I will never like for a lot of reasons, one of them being that he has bragged about doing anything he wants to women without consent (I.e. admitted to sexual abuse).  Where I live, a woman said a man raped her.  The man&#39;s text history revealed him saying he &quot;basically raped&quot; her to his friend.  Now he&#39;s in jail.  Because he&#39;s a rapist.</p>

<p>Good, innocent people don&#39;t lie and say &quot;yeah, I did this terrible thing&quot; if they didn&#39;t.  Either way, if he&#39;s lying, he&#39;s shitty, and if he&#39;s not lying, he&#39;s super shitty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not but i have seen many older guys do similar things And it does seem like more old men feel they need to say things like that to be accepted by others.... That speaks more to their lack of confidence or personality. That said 90% of those guys would never ever do something like that. Actually the only guy I&#39;ve ever met that i know for a fact raped a girl was a sweet talker and would try to be over the top nice to girls ( that was high school though.) trump may be a rapist, i have no way to know.... But just because you&#39;ve never heard talk like that in your bubble doesnt mean there aren&#39;t plenty of good people that brag about made up sexual exploits in poor taste.</p>

<p>There is media/establishment movements against Trump, but Trump is definitely trying to install his own establishment in the best case scenario.</p>

<p>It is easy to lean a little one way when you see how blind the public is to reality, but if you meet someone who is pro Trump the truly woke will still have an argument against him and will bend back to the middle when faced with that wall.</p>

<p>The left is just sooo indoctrinated that it is making everyone look like a bit of a Trump supporter.</p>

<p>Look, I do not like Trump, but Hillary was supported by just about every major political villain we know of. She even terrifies the reptillians from draco. Check out the article above from one of the most unbiased and credible sources in the conspiracy theory world.</p>

<p>Trump is being attacked from all sides and from the most powerful people in business and government. I think Trump is a goon, but it would be irrational not to see he is being blatantly attacked by most of the major powers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uhhhhh what? </p>

<p>IIRC there were any number of press articles about the massive amount of coverage the MSM gave Trumps campaign at the expense of Clintons. Now press is bad press, especially if you are Trump, not that the MSM thought they were doing him and favors. </p>

<p>Same with Bernie vs Clinton; the MSM decided the narrative was Clintons got this, which helped Bernie lose. They also didn&#39;t aggressivly report on the shady games the DNC was playing with the nomination, because the story was Clinton has this one. </p>

<p>So yeah, lots of MSM culpability for Trump. It&#39;s one of the reasons they are so irrationally and violently anti-Trump now... Guilt over their perceived collusion in a result they (most MSM staff are pretty liberal and Democrat) directly created. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a cheating spouse... Once you cheat, you must paint a picture of the spouse you chested on as being extra evil and bad, thus allowing the blame and shame for your actions to be their fault and not your own. </p>

<p>&quot;I have less proof of russia than these &quot;nutters&quot; i openly mock.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s russia influencing? Not hacking eh?  How&#39;s that goalpost movement going for you? </p>

<p>In your own post history we have Russia Hacked the elections, russia tried to hack elections, russia tried to influence.</p>

<p>Is influence like having a former president fly to a country and openly campaign for one person?  Seems that would be a better way to influence a nation than sending nigerian &quot;i&#39;m a prince&quot; phish emails.</p>

<p>Glad to know topminds is basically Dunning-Kruger effect in action.  The houlier than thou attitude though is bit over the top when you apply &quot;hate&quot; to every subreddit you disagree with</p>
