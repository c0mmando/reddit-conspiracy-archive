      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Every charismatic figure is such an obvious crook that he destroys himself, like McCarthy or Nixon or the evangelist preachers. If somebody comes along who is charismatic and honest this country is in real trouble because of the frustration, disillusionment, the justified anger and the absence of any coherent response. What are people supposed to think if someone says ‘I have got an answer, we have an enemy’? There it was the Jews. Here it will be the illegal immigrants and the blacks. We will be told that white males are a persecuted minority. We will be told we have to defend ourselves and the honor of the nation. Military force will be exalted. People will be beaten up. This could become an overwhelming force. And if it happens it will be more dangerous than Germany. The United States is the world power. Germany was powerful but had more powerful antagonists. I don’t think all this is very far away. If the polls are accurate it is not the Republicans but the right-wing Republicans, the crazed Republicans, who will sweep the next election.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime,” Chomsky added. “I am old enough to remember the 1930s. My whole family was unemployed. There were far more desperate conditions than today. But it was hopeful. People had hope. The CIO was organizing. No one wants to say it anymore but the Communist Party was the spearhead for labor and civil rights organizing. Even things like giving my unemployed seamstress aunt a week in the country. It was a life. There is nothing like that now. The mood of the country is frightening. The level of anger, frustration and hatred of institutions is not organized in a constructive way. It is going off into self-destructive fantasies.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “I don’t bother writing about Fox News,” Chomsky said. “It is too easy. What I talk about are the liberal intellectuals, the ones who portray themselves and perceive themselves as challenging power, as courageous, as standing up for truth and justice. They are basically the guardians of the faith. They set the limits. They tell us how far we can go. They say, ‘Look how courageous I am.’ But do not go one millimeter beyond that. At least for the educated sectors, they are the most dangerous in supporting power.”

       Amazing quote. My partner asked me recently, why do you focus on criticizing the democrats so much? My response: Trump is too easy. We have to organize outside the controlled 'opposition' of the corporate democrats. "Guardians of the Faith" - Chomsky is a god damn genius.

       In my experience on the far right they are at least open for debate, comments like yours shut down any possibility of debate since you just claimed the term anarchist without even giving a definition and then closed with borderline ad hominem.

       I have actually spent a lot of time pondering the similarities between anarchism and libertarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Horse-shoe thoery plays into I think, but I also believe the main differences are in social theory and in "personal values."
      </p>
      <p>
       anarchists tend to be collectivists, and libertarians tend to individualists.
      </p>
      <p>
       but beyond that, they are very very similar.

       He considers himself a libertarian socialist, or an anarcho-syndicalist, not an anarchist.

       Chomsky is absolutely nuts. What about JFK or MLK weren't they were charismatic? And to compare the US to Nazi Germany is absolutely absurd because Germany was facing real threats on all sides, hence the rise of Hitler. People's standard of living has risen enormously since the 1930s, even since the 1970s. People are not aware of the heavy Marxist ideology being thrown around here. Chomsky himself supported genocidal Communist regimes and I guess we need another genocide to prove this isn't the right approach.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is impossible for someone to lie
unless he thinks he knows the truth.
Producing bullshit requires no such conviction.
       </p>
       <p>
        A person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is to
that extent respectful of it. When an
honest man speaks, he says only what
he believes to be true; and for the liar, it
is correspondingly indispensable that he
considers his statements to be false. For
the bullshitter, however, all these bets
are off: he is neither on the side of the
true nor on the side of the false. ~is eye
is not on the facts at all, as the eyes of
the honest man and of the liar are, except
insofar as they may be pertinent
to his interest in getting away with what
he says. He does not care whether the
things he says describe reality correctly.
He just picks them out, or makes them
up, to suit his purpose.
