<p>That would be one. How can you tell how much questioning is going on here? How can you tell which posters firmly believe in prosteletize about their content and which just like to entertain all compelling ideas that hint at a greater truth?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve discussed Flat Earth honestly before and while I think it&#39;s compelling and worth debating, I by no means agree with it.</p>

<p>I do agree that some of us can jump to premature conclusions, but it&#39;s not like they&#39;re not being called out for it when it happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen. Sharing those r/conspiracy blues, brother !!</p>

<p>Seriously, every genuine person here can check polthrow2 and similar users&#39; comment histories and they are filled with almost nothing but negation, ridicule, and obfuscation, and you can see that the rest of &quot;them&quot; frequently pile on, downvoting legitimate users and upvoting their own nonsense. Short snarky smarmy despicable bullshit which in the end amounts to little other than confusion for the general reader/browser/lurker. I&#39;d suppose that the majority of propagandist agents don&#39;t outright lie, but they do engage in constant obfuscation and intentional misleading.</p>

<p>The 9/11 inside job conspiracy theory received legitimate widespread coverage/contemplation from mainstream news/outlets ? Hmmm...

    <div class="md"><p>Which conspiracy theories, if any, do you think have some degree of validity or credibility to them ? For a seemingly frequent user of such a forum, you seem to only try to negate and discredit conspiratorial suggestions rather than contribute to some kind of dialogue or exploration of ideas, granted I did not read through your entire comment history. Most of what I saw was you pushing the official narratives à la John Oliver&amp;co and it comes across as HIGHLY SUSPECT to those who have been trying to connect the dots. It REEKS. Your profile resembles so closely one of the cookie cutter archetypes of one of these propagandist goons. To be clear, I am officially not accusing you of being a shill, but I offer to anyone conspiracy-minded to give a brief glance at our fellow&#39;s comment history and not a have the same impression as I. Why not be a little more positive/creative rather than &quot;negative&quot; (archontic / AI forces, anyone?)?) ;]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all. It reminds me of the narrative of a spike in hate crimes in the last decade. Such crimes have actually gone down across the board since the 90&#39;s but due to extreme over representation in the media and a myriad of fabrications the average person thinks they are up.</p>

<p>No one is saying that there aren&#39;t some assholes are running around and committing hate crimes but no more than usual, potentially even less, but we are seeing a ton of hoaxes pop up from guys fire bombing their own churches or painting shit swastikas on dorm walls.</p>

<p>Granted subversive internet posting isn&#39;t even in the same league of dastardly as a hate crime but this over representation of their impact and the false flags make for a strong narrative against this place.</p>

<p>I think healthy skepticism is great, but when this sub clearly ignores very good conspiracies and ones that actually have a chance to be correct (ie numerous Trumcampaign related Russia conspiracies) then it&#39;s pretty obvious where the mods and users fall.  I don&#39;t think there is much question at all.  Which isn&#39;t that big a deal, but I wouldn&#39;t deny it if I were a regular or a mod. Just accept it, acknowledge it and move on.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a look at the top threads from the past week (I don&#39;t come here often) and 3/10 are in some way pushing a Trump narrative (bad London Mayor, Colbert v. Stone missing footage, and one other).  And zero conspiracies like Sessions conspiring to hide Russian contacts or anything negative about Trump. </p>

<p>The rest were pretty on target for conspiracies. I think I&#39;d probably amend my statement to say there is still a healthy amount of regular conspiracy theories (seemingly) but there is definitely a bias. Again, not bad per se, but shouldn&#39;t be ignored or lied about (it&#39;s a conspiracy!!!!). </p>

<p>I hover around top past hour in r/all and regularly see pro-Trump narrative things posted to this sub. I suppose one could say that the MSM is conspiring to obscure these pro-trump type things and there are plenty of other subs to deal with anti-trump conspiracy. But again, if you&#39;re going to deal with political conspiracies, be honest about your intentions. Don&#39;t act like this sub is hgh and mighty above r/politics when you basically pick and choose things you already agree with too.  </p>

<p>Or dont! this ain&#39;t even my sub!</p>

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are being misguided, this is from u/soberreflection</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to offer an explanation to all the people in this thread arguing things like &quot;This is like the best conspiracy I&#39;ve seen in years,&quot; and &quot;This sub is ran by the alt-right and Russian trolls.&quot;
1. You&#39;re ignoring context that informs most people interested in the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; community. So what&#39;s the relevant context here? Though you&#39;re in r/conspiracy subreddit, you&#39;ve apparently never picked up on the widespread skepticism of the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Allegations that are coming from sources within US intelligence will be subject to this skepticism. I won&#39;t go into all the examples that justify that skepticism here, but there is good reason to believe that US media getting these &quot;scoops&quot; is not an accident or an example of good investigative journalism, but rather a deliberate attempt to manipulate the public through the media (c.f. Operation Mockingbird). Furthermore, many here, though not all, believe that the top-level conspiracy is to bring about a NWO. There may be some disagreement about who the ultimate puppet masters are (Illuminati, Jews, the Pope, etc.), but there is not much disagreement that this conspiracy is not guided by benign motives. In that context, the attempt to portray Trump&#39;s relations with Russia as sinister, whether those relations are real or not, looks a lot like propaganda. Trump and Russia are commonly regarded as enemies of the NWO. That may or may not be true in the end, but at this stage it seems likely that their opposition is genuine. This is relevant because we would have to be naive to think that a person who has frustrated the ambitions of a (if not the) global elite would not come in for some retaliatory attempts to discredit him.
2. Another specific and significant reason to be skeptical of this and stories like it is that there have been so many stories about Russia recently that have turned out to be false. It really starts to look like a pattern of lies, even to ordinary people who are oblivious of the motives of TPTB. Here are several recent examples:
<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/">https://theintercept.com/2016/12/31/russia-hysteria-infects-washpost-again-false-story-about-hacking-u-s-electric-grid/</a>

<a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/26/washington-post-disgracefully-promotes-a-mccarthyite-blacklist-from-a-new-hidden-and-very-shady-group/">https://theintercept.com/2016/11/26/washington-post-disgracefully-promotes-a-mccarthyite-blacklist-from-a-new-hidden-and-very-shady-group/</a>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?utm_term=.7a28900fb717">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?utm_term=.7a28900fb717</a> (The fact that even the Washington Post disavowed the story should tell you something)
3. Another specific reason to suspect that these attacks are highly motivated disinformation meant to discredit Trump and raise fears about Russia is the events in Syria. As I&#39;ve discussed many times before in this sub—since it&#39;s an area of particular concern to me—the US ran a CIA led campaign in Syria to topple Assad. Among this project&#39;s objectives was that of securing the route for the Saudi-Qatar pipeline into Europe. The US is complicit in arming ISIS and Al Qaeda to bring about this objective. For that reason and many others, to be explicit, the US are not the &quot;good guys&quot; in this scenario. The relevant point here is that Russia has now thwarted that plan by stepping in for Assad. So do you think that the powers behind that objective will just passively accept this result, or do you think they will use every dirty trick they can to seize back the reins? This explains why anti-Russian propaganda, which has been going on for years, has reached a peak recently.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5itgwp/the_obama_administrations_role_in_the_overthrow/</a>
4. Another important point is that a lot of these reports, and the reddit &quot;dossiers&quot; of evidence linking Trump to Russia are based on the assumption that such relations are sinister. But to be clear, I want the US to establish peaceful relations with Russia. Americans happily swallow propaganda showing the Russians, and Putin in particular, as aggressive, murderous, and scheming. And it is propaganda: any country can be shown to be sinister if certain facts are given the spotlight and others hidden. Americans who happily indulge in negative Russian stereotypes should be more judicious and realize that the US has more than enough sins of its own that could be spun the same way. The main point here is that conflict with Russia is neither inevitable nor desirable, so if members of Trump&#39;s team are contacting Russia to facilitate better relations, why would I be bothered by that? Yes, the allegations about the Rosneft deal would be damning, but that is not substantiated. These reports are spinning mere contact as sinister, and that is fucked up. Here is a comment I made in response to some of these issues recently for context:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/5roev7/donald_trump_lifts_sanctions_on_russia_that_were/dd9ifc7/</a>
5. Finally, none of these arguments necessarily imply support for Trump! There are specific policies of Trump&#39;s that I agree with, but many that I don&#39;t agree with. Also, I don&#39;t find his personal ability or character particularly suitable in a leader. However, in terms of conspiracy, these 2-dimensional political policies and personal qualities are secondary. While I&#39;m not sure exactly what Trump represents, and while he clearly does have links to some part of the establishment, he clearly does represent some kind of change. I am ambivalent as of now about whether that change is for the better, but I&#39;m not naive enough to think that the establishment that he&#39;s replacing was in any way more ethical or less sinister than Trump is currently portrayed to be. The forces that he has displaced and whose interests he is frustrating are pushing this anti-Russian narrative hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How come when T_D posters come over here and complain about people &quot;eating up the MSM&quot;, they never mention Fox or Breitbart? You know, the most watched news channel and the one with a direct link to the White House?  </p>

<p>So really, what you&#39;re saying is that r/conspiracy and T_D are the only places that don&#39;t listen to left wing media. Hmm... almost like there&#39;s some kind of overlap between the 2?</p>

<p>If Conspiracy isn&#39;t being taken over by Trump supporters, why are there <em>5</em> posts on the front page telling people not to listen to it? Why do you suddenly need to call everyone who thinks that&#39;s the case a shill? Why do you all feel the need to suddenly say &quot;Nuh uh! This place isn&#39;t pro-trump!&quot; </p>

<p>Maybe so many people are saying it is pro-trump, and so many of you have suddenly come out to fight that narrative, because it is pro-trump?</p>

<p>Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, was jubilant at the result and said a Trump presidency would make it more likely the US would agree with Russia on Syria, where the two powers back different sides and Moscow has intervened decisively on behalf of the president, Bashar al-Assad. </p>

<p>Markov also said it would mean less American backing for “the terroristic junta in Ukraine”. He denied allegations of Russian interference in the election, but said “maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you wake up and smell the ash. Trump is a puppet like the rest of the &quot;leaders&quot; of the free world. He is a very stupid puppet at that, think of all the stuff he said on the campaign trail that he has turned his back on(most of the things he said were bad ideas anyway). He is just another politician here to say how he can give you everything you desire while he and his cronies slowly take your rights away.  They will leave you with the rights you care about most like right to bear arms while they take away your rights for privacy, free speach, right to a fair trial, protection from unreasonable search and seizure in the name of security, and your safety because the scary brown man is going to use some cia provided guns to gun down some people every few months to scare you into submission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. </p>
