<p>This is exactly the problem. They pretend it&#39;s the MSM taking Trump down in a grand conspiracy. Trump takes Trump down on Twitter. Trump undermines his own travel ban on Twitter. Trump praises dictators on Twitter. You&#39;ll probably never have a more open view into the president&#39;s mind than Trump and that mind is a scary place to anyone who isn&#39;t already equally addled.</p>

<p>You do not need the MSM to take down Trump. Just give him his phone.</p>

<p>Exactly. I&#39;d even go so far as to say that the MSM gave him more of a chance than I was willing to, based solely on his track record. TONS of people were hoping that this would be a blessing in disguise. Trump had everything he needed to show the world he was actually a competent leader, but you can&#39;t just delegate that part and put your brand on it.</p>

<p>No, I see that&#39;s what you would like to project for anyone else stupid enough to take the bait. He&#39;s the one that&#39;s supposed to be a great leader, a great delegater. He has the best people. Why the fuck doesn&#39;t he appoint them? Because he&#39;s incompetent.</p>

<p>That has nothing to do with being an outsider, no matter how many desperate handsprings and backflips you do.</p>

<p>Simply dismissing something because it&#39;s in the MSM has become an anti-intellectual blanket talking point that prevents you from even looking any further at it, even thought he sources are reputable, unlike PizzaGate. Since neither you or I are likely doing any investigative reporting, the operative skill is the ability to source information from MULTIPLE places, and develop a good bullshit detector. You&#39;ve been rolling in shit so long with this blanket &quot;MSM&quot; bullshit that you don&#39;t even know what is real anymore.</p>

<p>At least you realize he&#39;s not &quot;the government&quot; considering he hasn&#39;t even had his appointees put in.    Also I hate to break it to you, but since I don&#39;t support Trump I don&#39;t care if you slander him.</p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, where we question the MSM and give credence to the possibility of things like pizzagate.  Now that you&#39;ve made it completely obvious to everyone reading that you are an outsider here, enjoy your stay as you slowly figure out the MSM has been lieing to you for your entire life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not validating a single line of your bullshit. He is the government. He can order state secrets to be fucking delivered to him and made unclassified, if he wanted.

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like you forgot that the Republican establishment hate Trump just as much as the left does, if not even more.  Did you miss that whole part of the election where he shit on them just as badly as he did the Dems, or the part where tons of them backed Hillary over him?  To think that they protect him or support him with anything but the merest lip service is naive at best.  He&#39;s their horse into government that they were forced to ride because Jeb Bush bombed, nothing more.  Trump is more likely to destroy the Republican Party than anything, which may even be intentional.</p>

<p>The Deep State are the global intelligence services, military industrial complex, globalist think tanks, banks and Wall Street, not the House and Senate.  Our elected officials are largely blackmailed and bought by the Deep State to ensure loyalty to the State agenda.</p>

<p>I will say it once again so your <em>top mind</em> can comprehend it.  Trump is ONE THIRD OF THE GOVERNMENT.

<p>If you see a highly upvoted post <em>seeming</em> to promote position (A), and go into the threads and see that MOST of the <strong><em>highest upvoted comments</em></strong> are ridiculing, deconstructing or otherwise opposed to position (A), it may just be that the entire thread was setup to be a STRAWMAN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was going to come in here and say this exact thing. The front page of this subreddit right now is filled with posts on why you should hate Trump, and why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is no place for anyone who opposes the Deep State&#39;s &quot;Russian Collusion&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>They try to spin it like, &quot;Being for Trump is to be pro-government&quot; when the reality is: They&#39;re all pro-Deep State. Which <em>is</em> pro-government.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to masquerade as us long-time users (i.e., us, real posters). But, like all fakers, they get stuff wrong. Like one of them told me that CNN was a legitimate news source, and if I cited something that wasn&#39;t from CNN it wasn&#39;t real, lol.</p>

<p>What they don&#39;t understand is that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has always been anti-Deep State. It was the place you came to discuss NSA surveillance (when no one else was talking about it). It was the place that was against the Deep State&#39;s pro-torture policies. It was the place you visited to confer with other like-minded individuals who expressed concern about the Deep State deposing legitimate democratically-elected governments.</p>

<p>We were always pro-politicians who were against the Deep State. Like Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and, yes . . . even, nominally, Donald Trump (since he ran on a platform that was 92% the same as Ron Paul&#39;s).</p>

<p>Now the Deep Staters are in here, telling us that we really want to be at war with Russia, that Russia &quot;hacked our election,&quot; that Hillary Clinton is an ethical politician who we should all trust, that State spying on its citizens in good, that elite pedophile rings are fake, that mainstream media sources are valid, uncompromised sources of information, etc.</p>

<p>And, above all, that we should all attack Trump, Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Kucinich, Gabby Tulsard, etc.</p>

<p>There is exactly <em>one</em> post out of 25 that might be construed as anti-Trump (and even that one is more a complaint about the sub itself than about Trump).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are at minimum six that can be construed as pro-Trump, arguably more, or that are arguing against Trump-related criticism of the sub.</p>

<p>A tangent about how we should ignore the media and be angry at Congress, not Trump.</p>

<p>Comments about how much the sub does or does not support Trump. Tangent is focused on the <em>sub</em>.</p>

<p>Tangent saying there is a smear campaign against Trump.</p>

<p>So the top root comments are a mix, <em>none</em> supporting the Deep State, some critical of the sub, some critical of anti-Trumpers.</p>

<p>The rest of the comments are mixed, yes, there are people critical of Trump all throughout, but should that be surprising? The man is not popular by any measure. He&#39;s generated a lot to criticize. And being critical of Trump is <em>not</em> being &quot;pro-Deep State.&quot; That&#39;s a ridiculous way to twist things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what&#39;s absurd is a President who hasn&#39;t even gotten his cabinet into place yet (hence he&#39;s not yet even a &quot;sitting President,&quot; in effect because his people aren&#39;t even in place). At this point, more than 6 months into his Presidency, it&#39;s unprecedented. </p>

<p>Effectively, he&#39;s not even a &quot;sitting President&quot; yet, since they&#39;re obstructing him. And running 12 investigations on him before he&#39;s even done anything as a method of tying him up and neutralizing his pro-Ron Paul agenda. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see peace with Russia and other nations. I&#39;d love to see an audit of the Federal Reserve. I&#39;d love to see more jobs and opportunities for our citizens.</p>

<p>But all these things are being obstructed by the Deep State. And with patent absurdities.</p>

<p>I hate being lied to. And worse: I hate having my intelligence insulted by a bad liar.</p>

<p>Between a pro-Ron Paul Trump and a Deep State running fake news stories every day to take him down, my sympathies are with the pro-Ron Paul President.</p>

<p>If your sympathies are with the Deep State, feel free to let everyone know.</p>

<p>Own it.</p>

<p>Embrace it.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t insult ur intelligence by pretending that you&#39;re just &quot;holding a sitting President to account&quot;.</p>

<p>You can make that argument after he actually has his cabinet in place, and he&#39;s actually done something wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the Attorney General should recuse himself based on the second scoop.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a &quot;scandal,&quot; after all.</p>

<p>The media told me so.</p>

<p>Here. Let me challenge you with something. We&#39;re six months into Trump&#39;s presidency with a booming stock market, a falling unemployment rate and no Third World War or concentration camps. (Remember: We were told the sky would fall if Trump became President.)</p>

<p>Give me a list of ACTUAL &quot;bad things&quot; you think he&#39;s done.</p>

<p>Not fake media-made-up bullshit.</p>

<p>REAL things he&#39;s done.</p>

<p>(&quot;Well, Trump <em>still</em> hasn&#39;t denied his possible role in the Abraham Lincoln assassination,&quot; so it&#39;s a scandal and we should have a senate investigation on it.)</p>

<p>I mean ACTUAL substantiated things he REALLY did.</p>

<p>Not &quot;proving a negative&quot; propaganda.</p>

<p>(&quot;Prove that you DIDN&#39;T collide with Russia!&quot;)</p>

<p>No, give me something he ACTUALLY did that you think constitutes &quot;The Sky is Falling. We&#39;re all gonna die now!&quot;</p>

<p>Hillary, by contrast, was up on the stage, treating six wars at the same time. Recklessly ramping up anti-Russian rhetoric (like no candidate in history had done before her).

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, there was overlap in how both Trump and Paul ran as &quot;anti-establishment&quot; candidates who challenged deeply entrenched power/corruption within our system. But that&#39;s vastly different from the original claim of &quot;a platform that was 92% the same as Ron Paul&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;d argue that Paul and the other names you mentioned (Kucinich, Gabbard, etc) all have a documentable history of fighting for their convictions (both through legislation and activism), and had written/spoken extensively about their philosophies. Their words translated to <strong>action</strong>. </p>

<p>Trump words didn&#39;t correlate to a history of action. In fact, many of Trump&#39;s stances/claims shifted from day to day, and he didn&#39;t have any history of fighting corruption (in fact, by his own admission, he benefited from it).</p>

<p>So, even though it was clear to me that the Deep State (the <em>real</em> power in this country) wanted Trump to lose by any means necessary (even if it meant flogging a false narrative), I&#39;m still deeply uncomfortable with seeing Trump categorized alongside those other names. Many of us in the conspiracy community were deeply skeptical of him then, and remain so now.</p>

<p>Right, but he didn&#39;t have a history of writing, activism, funding anti-establishment/anti-corruption causes, bringing awareness to political corruption, etc. That&#39;s why I said &quot;action&quot;, not just &quot;legislation.&quot; I don&#39;t count talking about Obama&#39;s birth certificate as &quot;activism&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think my original post disproves that claim. Yes, they overlap some, but the differences--at least to me--are far starker than the similarities. I mean, Trump was pushing for broadening surveillance powers, having a registry of Muslims, continuing unilateral drone strikes (in addition to all the policies I mentioned originally)...all authoritarian strongman behavior that a libertarian like Paul would never support (and indeed, Paul has repeatedly and strongly criticized Trump).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anthony Jeselnik, one of Trump’s roasters, also noted the same thing during a conversation with Joan Rivers on In Bed With Joan back in 2013. “Donald Trump’s rule was, don’t say I have less money than I say I do,” Jeselnik said. “Make fun of my kids, do whatever you want, just don’t say I don’t have that much money.”</p>

<p>why would trump be sensitive about people saying that? cuz its true. </p>

<p>Whenever you see a shill using the phrase &quot;anti-trump shill&quot; you know they are a paid shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most conspiracies are actually corruption, and in cases of corruption the government is usually not the one pulling the strings.</p>

<p>So, at least in theory, a well functioning transparent government can be an ally in fighting corruption and preventing such conspiracies from taking place.</p>

<p>So when someone says &quot;pro-government&quot; it is important to understand what they mean. Is it a blind faith in the government? Or is it faith in a well functioning transparent government acting as a check on powerful/undemocratic private interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course Trump didn&#39;t have a &quot;history of action&quot;. He wasn&#39;t a professional politician before he ran for President (as Paul, Kucinich and Gabbard were).</p>

<p>I&#39;m a former Ron Paul voter. The only point at which I diverged from Trump was on his casual and easy permissiveness of torture. That disgusted me.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why I said that he didn&#39;t run on a pure Ron Paul platform. </p>

<p>But other than that, the two men are a shocking amount of policy overlap. </p>

<p>As someone else said, Trump was akin to Ross Perot. But he was really a mixture of Perot and Paul. </p>

<p>Or are you suggesting that the media should positively cover his negative actions so as not to make people feel bad?</p>

<p>Also ironic that you brought up the russia collusion-thing, because most of the US population seems to think it&#39;s going pretty well, for people that aren&#39;t Trump supporters that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If America is such a dumpster fire you trump haters think it is, why is the stock market at all time high? I think when I see people like nothing good has happened clearly don&#39;t investment in stocks! Plenty of good over in land of investment, dollar is getting stronger, and interest rates are increasing after years of historic lows. All signs of a strengthening economy, something that should be important to you regardless of political affiliation because after all we all have dollars in our bank account.</p>
