       There is no getting through to these thick headed retards.  They've convinced themselves that trump is one thing and they'll never let anyone show them otherwise no matter what he actually does.  It's called brainwashing by repeated messages and r/the_donald is a classic example.  Governments have been propagandizing through repeated messaging for decades, it's the same old shit in a barely new coat of paint, and it's being treated as legitimate by neocons who just want a republican in the white house.

       This is exactly the problem. They pretend it's the MSM taking Trump down in a grand conspiracy. Trump takes Trump down on Twitter. Trump undermines his own travel ban on Twitter. Trump praises dictators on Twitter. You'll probably never have a more open view into the president's mind than Trump and that mind is a scary place to anyone who isn't already equally addled.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need the MSM to take down Trump. Just give him his phone.

       When people say they are tired of seeing negative coverage of Trump, I can only think, "Where would they get the POSITIVE material from?" Almost everything Trump
       <em>
        provides
       </em>
       is negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is, when Trump gave his first speech before congress and it went well, the press fell all over themselves doing pieces on how "presidential" he was. The coverage was overwhelmingly positive. That's how low the bar has been set! And that goes to show that they WILL give him tons of positive coverage...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... there just has to be something positive for them to cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now it's idiotic tweets, investigations, and blunders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it boils down to garbage in, garbage out.

      <p>
       Exactly. I'd even go so far as to say that the MSM gave him more of a chance than I was willing to, based solely on his track record. TONS of people were hoping that this would be a blessing in disguise. Trump had everything he needed to show the world he was actually a competent leader, but you can't just delegate that part and put your brand on it.

       If America is such a dumpster fire you trump haters think it is, why is the stock market at all time high? I think when I see people like nothing good has happened clearly don't investment in stocks! Plenty of good over in land of investment, dollar is getting stronger, and interest rates are increasing after years of historic lows. All signs of a strengthening economy, something that should be important to you regardless of political affiliation because after all we all have dollars in our bank account.

       Why's my head gotta be up my ass? If you could talk like a normal person maybe we could discuss pros and cons. But it seems a lot of people just want to use catch phrase and talk about issues more complex then their understanding so we are reduced to name calling.

       Tell me how all major indices, representative of our economy, are at all time highs? While the Dow struggled to pop past 20k in the wanting months of Obama. Fact is since Trump won election all major indices are all up +10%
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from social issues that are ever present since the birth of this nation, what leads you to believe it's a dumpster fire? Last time I checked most  people choose America, why is that?

       No, I see that's what you would like to project for anyone else stupid enough to take the bait. He's the one that's supposed to be a great leader, a great delegater. He has the best people. Why the fuck doesn't he appoint them? Because he's incompetent.

       Simply dismissing something because it's in the MSM has become an anti-intellectual blanket talking point that prevents you from even looking any further at it, even thought he sources are reputable, unlike PizzaGate. Since neither you or I are likely doing any investigative reporting, the operative skill is the ability to source information from MULTIPLE places, and develop a good bullshit detector. You've been rolling in shit so long with this blanket "MSM" bullshit that you don't even know what is real anymore.

       I'm not validating a single line of your bullshit. He is the government. He can order state secrets to be fucking delivered to him and made unclassified, if he wanted.

       Seems like you forgot that the Republican establishment hate Trump just as much as the left does, if not even more.  Did you miss that whole part of the election where he shit on them just as badly as he did the Dems, or the part where tons of them backed Hillary over him?  To think that they protect him or support him with anything but the merest lip service is naive at best.  He's their horse into government that they were forced to ride because Jeb Bush bombed, nothing more.  Trump is more likely to destroy the Republican Party than anything, which may even be intentional.

       The Deep State are the global intelligence services, military industrial complex, globalist think tanks, banks and Wall Street, not the House and Senate.  Our elected officials are largely blackmailed and bought by the Deep State to ensure loyalty to the State agenda.

       I didn't change shit. He's the government. His party is in power and is covering his ass. He certainly isn't a private fucking citizen. He's more of the government than any of you saying he isn't the government will ever be.

       You know what's killing discussion? Calling anyone who disagrees with you a shill. No matter how much they converse, no matter what they comment elsewhere, if they have a point of view that matches others, they must be a shill. The number of paid political operatives on here is negligible because nobody here matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the idea that people at ShareBlue are just pencil-pushers throwing out random ideas is equally dumb. The people that get hired for jobs working social media for the Democratic party are, shockingly, people that were already posting on social media about the Democratic party. We're not talking about people paid to mention how awesome Oreo cookies are.

       You mean, the shills are here to do exactly what OP is doing? Cause infighting so it disrupts from everything else by creating so much noise it's hard to look at any potentially real conspiracies?

       Maybe the shills are the ones who are constantly calling everyone else shills because they don't have anyway to actually discredit their viewpoints.

       Their tactics are pretty blatant, too.  Promote MSM narrative. Raid comments. Upvote comments supporting narrative. Downvote and use logical fallacy/sensationalism against comments countering the brainwashing.  Exhaust commenters and force them out.  Take over subreddit and commence pro-narrative circle jerk.

       Just out of curiosity, how would this look any different than, say, a scenario where a bunch of liberals are suddenly interested in conspiracies (fueled by Trump-Russia) at the same time that a lot of conservatives are growing disheartened and disillusioned with Trump? They'll show up with their 'MSM narrative,' reply to comments, upvote comments they like, downvote the ones they don't, and argue with a dwindling number of conservatives who are less and less likely to put in the effort defending Trump/pizzagate/Seth Rich/what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you tell the difference between these two possibilities?

       If you see a highly upvoted post

       to promote position (A), and go into the threads and see that MOST of the

         highest upvoted comments

       why would they tailor their tactics for a smaller audience that requires more work? The same tactics as every other sub take 75% less work and work 85% as well, and thats what appears to be happening anyway.

       He's not going to be able to renegotiate NAFTA. For some reason, people think Canada and Mexico will voluntarily eat shit on a new trade deal. They won't take all the bad parts without the good parts, just like the US. And please stop floating economic isolationism. It doesn't work.

      <p>
       The Paris Accord was completely non-binding. It wasn't ridiculous. It would have improved our standing if we lived up to it, but it's easier for Trump to pretend it was somehow killing American jobs.

       No such thing. You could have countless intelligence officials, agencies, countries, reporters all coming to the same conclusions from different (and extensive) research ... or you could call all of them shills and ignore the asshole in the oval office whose incompetence knows no bounds.

       I was going to come in here and say this exact thing. The front page of this subreddit right now is filled with posts on why you should hate Trump, and why
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is no place for anyone who opposes the Deep State's "Russian Collusion" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       They try to spin it like, "Being for Trump is to be pro-government" when the reality is: They're all pro-Deep State. Which
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       pro-government.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're trying to masquerade as us long-time users (i.e., us, real posters). But, like all fakers, they get stuff wrong. Like one of them told me that CNN was a legitimate news source, and if I cited something that wasn't from CNN it wasn't real, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they don't understand is that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has always been anti-Deep State. It was the place you came to discuss NSA surveillance (when no one else was talking about it). It was the place that was against the Deep State's pro-torture policies. It was the place you visited to confer with other like-minded individuals who expressed concern about the Deep State deposing legitimate democratically-elected governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were always pro-politicians who were against the Deep State. Like Cynthia McKinney, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and, yes . . . even, nominally, Donald Trump (since he ran on a platform that was 92% the same as Ron Paul's).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the Deep Staters are in here, telling us that we really want to be at war with Russia, that Russia "hacked our election," that Hillary Clinton is an ethical politician who we should all trust, that State spying on its citizens in good, that elite pedophile rings are fake, that mainstream media sources are valid, uncompromised sources of information, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, above all, that we should all attack Trump, Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Kucinich, Gabby Tulsard, etc.

       There is exactly

       post out of 25 that might be construed as anti-Trump (and even that one is more a complaint about the sub itself than about Trump).

       A tangent about how we should ignore the media and be angry at Congress, not Trump.
      </p>

      <p>
       Comments about how much the sub does or does not support Trump. Tangent is focused on the
       <em>
        sub
       </em>
       .

      <p>
       Tangent saying there is a smear campaign against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the top root comments are a mix,
       <em>
        none
       </em>
       supporting the Deep State, some critical of the sub, some critical of anti-Trumpers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the comments are mixed, yes, there are people critical of Trump all throughout, but should that be surprising? The man is not popular by any measure. He's generated a lot to criticize. And being critical of Trump is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       being "pro-Deep State." That's a ridiculous way to twist things.

       No, what's absurd is a President who hasn't even gotten his cabinet into place yet (hence he's not yet even a "sitting President," in effect because his people aren't even in place). At this point, more than 6 months into his Presidency, it's unprecedented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Effectively, he's not even a "sitting President" yet, since they're obstructing him. And running 12 investigations on him before he's even done anything as a method of tying him up and neutralizing his pro-Ron Paul agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to see peace with Russia and other nations. I'd love to see an audit of the Federal Reserve. I'd love to see more jobs and opportunities for our citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       But all these things are being obstructed by the Deep State. And with patent absurdities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate being lied to. And worse: I hate having my intelligence insulted by a bad liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between a pro-Ron Paul Trump and a Deep State running fake news stories every day to take him down, my sympathies are with the pro-Ron Paul President.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your sympathies are with the Deep State, feel free to let everyone know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Own it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Embrace it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't insult ur intelligence by pretending that you're just "holding a sitting President to account".
      </p>
      <p>
       You can make that argument after he actually has his cabinet in place, and he's actually done something wrong.

       Wait, so you're suggesting that there's shills that use upvote bots and are taking over this place, but they let the front page be filled with pro-Trump and anti-Hillary/DNC posts and conspiracies just so they can upvote some comments disproving the narrative?

       When Trump stood on that debate stage and was savaged by everyone for suggesting that we have peace in the world, and that we work with our perceived enemies, THAT'S what I mean by running on a Ron Paul platform.
      </p>

       When Trump openly talked about The Deep State (at a time when no one else was), and the need to "drain the swamp," THAT'S what I mean by running on a Ron Paul platform.

       When Trump said that he was in favor of auditing the Federal Reserve, THAT'S what I mean by running on a Ron Paul platform.

       Hillary, by contrast, was up on the stage, treating six wars at the same time. Recklessly ramping up anti-Russian rhetoric (like no candidate in history had done before her). Trump was (in some bizarro twist) the peace candidate. He was the one saying that the Iraq War was waged on a lie. And he was attacked savagely by his own party for it.

      <p>
       And he never waffled or backed down.

       Certainly, there was overlap in how both Trump and Paul ran as "anti-establishment" candidates who challenged deeply entrenched power/corruption within our system. But that's vastly different from the original claim of "a platform that was 92% the same as Ron Paul's."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'd argue that Paul and the other names you mentioned (Kucinich, Gabbard, etc) all have a documentable history of fighting for their convictions (both through legislation and activism), and had written/spoken extensively about their philosophies. Their words translated to
       <strong>
        action
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump words didn't correlate to a history of action. In fact, many of Trump's stances/claims shifted from day to day, and he didn't have any history of fighting corruption (in fact, by his own admission, he benefited from it).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even though it was clear to me that the Deep State (the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       power in this country) wanted Trump to lose by any means necessary (even if it meant flogging a false narrative), I'm still deeply uncomfortable with seeing Trump categorized alongside those other names. Many of us in the conspiracy community were deeply skeptical of him then, and remain so now.

       Of course Trump didn't have a "history of action". He wasn't a professional politician before he ran for President (as Paul, Kucinich and Gabbard were).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a former Ron Paul voter. The only point at which I diverged from Trump was on his casual and easy permissiveness of torture. That disgusted me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why I said that he didn't run on a pure Ron Paul platform.

       As someone else said, Trump was akin to Ross Perot. But he was really a mixture of Perot and Paul.

       Right, but he didn't have a history of writing, activism, funding anti-establishment/anti-corruption causes, bringing awareness to political corruption, etc. That's why I said "action", not just "legislation." I don't count talking about Obama's birth certificate as "activism"

      <p>
       I think my original post disproves that claim. Yes, they overlap some, but the differences--at least to me--are far starker than the similarities. I mean, Trump was pushing for broadening surveillance powers, having a registry of Muslims, continuing unilateral drone strikes (in addition to all the policies I mentioned originally)...all authoritarian strongman behavior that a libertarian like Paul would never support (and indeed, Paul has repeatedly and strongly criticized Trump).

       Yeah, I think those were his
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       words: "I'm going to commit war crimes . . . and grab women's genitals against their will."
      </p>
      <p>
       The "against the will" was totally said. The media says so. (Just don't check the transcripts.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We should all rely not on what was
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       said, but on the media's version of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I, Donald J. Trump, plan to be Hitler. I will throw every Mexican in a concentration camp and execute innocent people."

      <p>
       Well, we're six months into his administration.

       The Media does talk about obamas drones, Doesnt like it, and he isnt intentionally killing innocent people.

       Trump said he WANTED to do it. When considering war crimes intent is a big part of it, whether or not it matters to the victims.

       It's true. I think it's the most frustrating irony that you people have an actual conspiracy that goes to the highest levels of the American government, and instead you're supporting that government. The world hands you people a juicy, real conspiracy and for once you can stand up and say "we were right about the government" and be the heroes who everyone now sees were right all along, and you turn it down to support a burgeoning fascist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no point to conspiracy theories if you can't take the truth when it's finally on your side.

       Pro-government is being used because suddenly this sub is with the establishment. Trump is part of the Globalists - he even allowed one into his family. As well as doing things (albeit all sloppy like) on behalf of Globalists.

       Also, these latest batch of threads is clearly gas lighting; "I'm not a shill - YOU are a shill!!"

       The actual quote is that judging Alex Jones on his performance on Infowars would be like judging Jack Nicholson as a person on his performance as The Joker.  “He’s playing a character,” Wilhite said of Jones. “He is a performance artist.”

       Globalist is exclusive to the Establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump doesn't give a flying fuck about you or anyone who voted for him. He wanted in on the inner circle (again, the Establishment). He was only worth millions. Now he is well on his way to billions (like his buddy Putin).
      </p>
      <p>
       To get into the inner circle, he offered his daughter and became an agent of the Establishment (specifically Putin's puppet).
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has done this to 3rd world leaders (who become millionaires over night once 'democracy' is established in their countries). And the Russians have done it to us.

       Putin may be the richest man alive, but I think this is more due to having access to the Russian Oligarchs, psychotronics- and all the other high-tech that the KGB had, and shady business dealings.

       He is not a billionaire. His fortune before the elections was estimated to about $200M to $300M.

       The same way a merchant offered his daughter to royalty to marry into a higher class of society in the past, is the same way Trump offered his daughter to the Establishment to enter into it. Same practice, different times.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anthony Jeselnik, one of Trump’s roasters, also noted the same thing during a conversation with Joan Rivers on In Bed With Joan back in 2013. “Donald Trump’s rule was, don’t say I have less money than I say I do,” Jeselnik said. “Make fun of my kids, do whatever you want, just don’t say I don’t have that much money.”

       why would trump be sensitive about people saying that? cuz its true.

       You know, the percentage of the coverage that was negative doesn't really prove anything. Maybe if he'd stop fucking up and pissing people off, the coverage would stop being negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you suggesting that the media should positively cover his negative actions so as not to make people feel bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also ironic that you brought up the russia collusion-thing, because most of the US population seems to think it's going pretty well, for people that aren't Trump supporters that is.

       This poor sub used to be so great to come to. It has been fucking ruined. I hope we can actually get back to conspiracies at some point. Like real ones, involving the government, no matter what fucking letter is next to their name. They are all bad, if people see things differently that doesn't mean they are shills. Fuck it, not sure why I'm even bothering. My favorite sub is doomed.

       Pro-government sounds like newspeak. 'Progov" can be happily confused with "progressive."

       There's no anti-Trump shills here, although I'd believe there's probably trump shills that immigrated from the Donald. I do believe someone is trying to distrupt and split apart this subreddit though. Fuck Donald Trump, fuck Hillary, fuck the Republicans and fuck the Democrats.

       Nope, that's again you attempt to put strawman words in someone else's mouth.

       The OP was referring specifically to the talking point that any argument against an anti-trump narrative be smeared as being pro-government.

       That is a dumb argument, you're right. It's a good thing that no one but you is making it.

       youre right, he is being more specific.

       Calling people shills by default for calling defenders of the president "progovt" is still lazy and not defending any position.

       How do you think one should handle a coordinated campaign to shut down dissent by pushing talking points?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think lazy or not lazy really come into play when you are calling a spade a spade. I see great utility in drawing attention to a tactic that only serves to shut down dissent.

       'shill' implies that the people holding that opinion are not organic, and so should be identified as paid liars. People can hold that opinion organically however, in fact it seems to be a quite reasonable position to hold

       It's like the perfect storm. Trump would still be stupid if the media did not give him shit..but if he was not stupid they would still give him more shit than any other president.

       Most conspiracies are actually corruption, and in cases of corruption the government is usually not the one pulling the strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, at least in theory, a well functioning transparent government can be an ally in fighting corruption and preventing such conspiracies from taking place.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when someone says "pro-government" it is important to understand what they mean. Is it a blind faith in the government? Or is it faith in a well functioning transparent government acting as a check on powerful/undemocratic private interests.

       Of course Trump didn't have a "history of action". He wasn't a professional politician before he ran for President (as Paul, Kucinich and Gabbard were).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a former Ron Paul voter. The only point at which I diverged from Trump was on his casual and easy permissiveness of torture. That disgusted me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why I said that he didn't run on a pure Ron Paul platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       But other than that, the two men are a shocking amount of policy overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone else said, Trump was akin to Ross Perot. But he was really a mixture of Perot and Paul.

       Yeah really, the OP is telling this sub to ignore a conspiracy that seems to actually have legs, all based on ad hominems against the people supporting the conspiracy theory. Meanwhile he's clearly pro-Trump, a brand new account, and yet the people who want to investigate ties with Russia are the shills?

       You know, the percentage of the coverage that was negative doesn't really prove anything. Maybe if he'd stop fucking up and pissing people off, the coverage would stop being negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you suggesting that the media should positively cover his negative actions so as not to make people feel bad?

       Also ironic that you brought up the russia collusion-thing, because most of the US population seems to think it's going pretty well, for people that aren't Trump supporters that is.

       If America is such a dumpster fire you trump haters think it is, why is the stock market at all time high? I think when I see people like nothing good has happened clearly don't investment in stocks! Plenty of good over in land of investment, dollar is getting stronger, and interest rates are increasing after years of historic lows. All signs of a strengthening economy, something that should be important to you regardless of political affiliation because after all we all have dollars in our bank account.
