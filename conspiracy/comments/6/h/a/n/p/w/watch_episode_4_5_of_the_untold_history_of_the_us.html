Hearings are held to &quot;out&quot; Communist. Henry Wallace is called a Communist just for speaking out against the Government at the time and his campaign is destroyed. Reporters put out hit pieces on anyone who goes against the official narrative of MacCarthyism. History always repeats itself except this time it isn&#39;t Communisim it&#39;s Putinism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are always spies operating in other countries. We had spies in the USSR and vice versa. What I am saying is the use of the word Communist to control a narrative of dessent that if you aren&#39;t with us you&#39;re a Communist. MacCarthy and the FBI used the Red Scare to control their opponents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but in the case of McCarthy, he was indeed vindicated in the accuracy of his claims, and was at the time unfairly tarred by the media because they were, in fact, under the influence of communists. There were also quite a few operatives in the Democrat party. </p>

<p>I do not believe the current state of Russia operates in the same manner the Soviet Union did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agreed with you on what he was doing to get spies, but then the whole scare was redirected into something completely different. Look at what happened to George Wallace. Back then parts of the media was controlled by Communist now they are all or at least the MSM controlled by Deep State. In the documentary it talks about how the FBI convinced the civil rights movement was Communism and used that to go after the leaders of the movement. Cointelpro was developed just to combat Communism and look how that was used. You cannot deny that in a search for USSR spies it also had a border scope and intention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I will have to investigate it some more, though I do know there were even communists among the civil rights movement. It was certainly a problem that required dealing with, but yes the term &quot;Red Scare&quot; is a good parallel to what&#39;s happening currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I will say during then Communist and USSR spies were two totally different things that were also skewed. The minority of Communist were too small to have an effect on the American government but they were still labeled as spies of the USSR just for their political beliefs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Folks notice the rhetorical shift that occurs in this post.  Communist &#39;agent&#39; is used to imply foreign spy. This is not true. Hollywood was not full of foreign spies. It might have contain individuals who identifies as communists or were sympathetic to communist theory and politics, but they were not foreign spies.  The equivocation of foreign spies with communists is one of biggest McCarthyist smears and lies propagated.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am talking about having a boogie man, The Russians. We now have a 1950 Red Scare narrative again &quot;Russia interfered in our elections, Russia has taken over our Government and our President is their Manchurian candidate&quot;. Just as people feared in the 50s that the USSR was going to do exactly this. It is a fear propagated by a Cold War, that shouldn&#39;t have ever begun. If you watch the documentary which I hope you do, you will see how the Cold War started and why we labeled Russia and Communism as the boogie man who&#39;s goal was to take our democracy. </p>

<p>Also I said nothing about the Left or the Right. There is no DNC or RNC they are two sides of the same coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man I&#39;m with you on all that, I checked out the doc. The boogieman need is potent as ever (and convenient when you consider that the Saudis, by all accounts who should be our real boogieman on the grounds of funding jihadists and human rights abuses, to say nothing of their new buddies, Israel). </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to the actual ideological content and othering that went on during the Red Scare, which is being propagated by the Alt Right and like-minded institutions (Jihad Watch, basically Infowars at this point). Aside from just gaining click revenue, they&#39;re playing up the divisiveness and feeding their constituents a steady stream of &quot;our enemies within are conspiring against us in order to destroy America&quot; that&#39;s right out of Joe McCarthy&#39;s mouth. Democrats are doing the same shit with Trump, this thing is moving in both directions. </p>

<p>As far as Russia goes, incredible place and people. I view Putin&#39;s regime as what happens when a fledgling state inherits the same 70 plus years of paranoid IC fuckery and spy games that the US has sustained itself on since the end of WWII (criminally in most cases). I don&#39;t trust him and the whole arresting/assassinating journalists and political opponents thing, what he did to Khodorkovsy (sp?), and the &quot;mafia state&quot; WL revealed in &#39;10 before Assange went silent on Putin altogether, the weird shit still going on in Ukraine. Plus he seems like the world&#39;s most clever troll. These factors have helped me buy some of the hacking/phishing/influence stuff, as well as little to no dissension from the idea according to both parties in congress, unlike WMD in Iraq. In addition to all the material, strategic advantages jacking with US confidence in elections/our government can provide, oil and natural gas issues, and the legit grievances Russia under Putin does have with the West, the &quot;Gerasimov Doctrine,&quot; etc. I could be wrong, of course, but I don&#39;t think the Cold War games ever stopped being played by either &quot;side.&quot; </p>

<p>It also may be impossible to truly know the truth in the present, as neither populace did during the actual cold war years. The narratives presented are perfectly contradictory, and middle ground feels the most insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both sides Left and Right are playing into this divide. Putin is no different from our own Government. He&#39;s just out there for the interests of the few that control his government just like the few who control our government. What I am also getting at is the Senators and Congress members who are fanning this Putin/Kremlin pawn for Trump wanting a better relationship with Russia is bizarre when as you pointed out we are allies with the Saudis who financed the 911 hijackers. As you pointed out with Cold War never stopping is probably why we are seeing this the Deep State, these people were there during the Cold War and probably never want to see a Russian-US alliance. If we do not start an alliance with Russia China we will be left behind in the trade war when it comes to the New Silk Road. I do agree with you that it is impossible to know the truth, we don&#39;t have the means to know the whole truth unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I appreciate it a large part of it is theater even tho many of the politician actors are unaware their acting or playing their parts it&#39;s always struck me how the US has been through the MacCarthyist purges and black listing of academics, politicians, actors, script writers, directors etc...which viewed in hindsight was always touted as an ideological victory for the left in the US and evidence of the intolerance, bigotry, chauvinism and zenophobia - you know all the regular epithets the left like to accuse the right of embodying, literally hitler, and yet today - you gold fish memory span equipped fucking doofuses - who is it that&#39;s earnestly looking each other in the eye like glazed eyed lunatics on a fanatical witch hunt prattling on about &quot;muh russians hackeded da electionseses&quot;. </p>

<p>Does the left have no concept/recognition of factual history? </p>

<p>Much like the embittered leftist academic hold outs across the US who were the last to admit to the atrocities occurring under the great social engineering plans of the USSR, The Peoples Republic of China, Cuba, Indochina etc....who then unfortunately mutated into frankfurt school, nihilist, deconstructionist/post-modernists and really fucked the world up as you can see today.</p>

Oliver Stone was obviously either on drugs or has spent too much time fetishizing communism.

Instead of being pro US biased it just swings the bar the opposite direction and tries to pass Russia off as the unsung hero of the last century. Hard pass.</p>
