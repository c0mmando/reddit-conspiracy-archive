    <div class="md"><p>Lucifer is not Satan. Christianity was subverted multiple times in the past and is a shell of its original self. Now its so mixed up that they get you to hate what you should love and love what is evil.</p>

<p>The Latin word lucifer means &quot;light-bringing&quot; and was applied to the moon. As a noun, it meant &quot;morning star&quot;, or in poetry, &quot;day&quot;
Lucifer means &quot;light bearer&quot;, which is used various times and in various ways in the Bible, including by Christ to refer to himself at one point in Revelation.</p>

<p>In Issiah 14:12,  Isaiah referred to the king of Babylon as “the morning star” (“son of the morning”; “son of the dawn”) to depict the once-shining-but-now-dimmed, once-lofty-but-now-diminished, status of the (soon to be former) ruler. In his Bible Commentary, E.M. Zerr observed that such phrases were “...used figuratively in this verse to symbolize the dignity and splendor of the Babylonian monarch. His complete overthrow was likened to the falling of the morning star”.</p>

<p>Nowhere within the context of Isaiah 14, however, is Satan depicted as Lucifer. In fact, quite the opposite is true. In his commentary on Isaiah, Burton Coffman wrote: “We are glad that our version (ASV) leaves the word Lucifer out of this rendition, because...Satan does not enter into this passage as a subject at all” (1990, p. 141). The Babylonian ruler was to die and be buried—fates neither of which Satan is destined to endure. The king was called “a man” whose body was to be eaten by worms, but Satan, as a spirit, has no physical body. The monarch lived in and abided over a “golden city” (vs. 4), but Satan is the monarch of a kingdom of spiritual darkness (cf. Ephesians 6:12). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people have little belief in God precisely because of the so-called elite.   They have built a system that turns people away from the idea.  They own the education system that indoctrinates children into thinking only science has the answers, that faith in something that can&#39;t be seen is foolish.  </p>

<p>The scientific system and those who created it&#39;s rules are and were all masonic-aligned satanists themselves.  </p>

<p>Even the religious systems today are all against God.  Look at the things they come out with.  Vatican-pagan head francis said is was better to be an atheist than a lapsed Christian.  That goes against God, turning people away from Him.  </p>

<p>God is very real.  Don&#39;t fall for the deception.  There is a spiritual war happening around us all and moat are blind to it.</p>

<p>But people that claim to believe in one thing, but actually, secretly, believe in something else are the scary ones. Those are the people that are actively lying about their beliefs to carry out some sort of sinister agenda. Maybe they do it solely for money, which is bad, but not as bad as those who do it for power and influence. Power and influence affects the lives of many. These people deceive their followers to get into a position where they can seriously affect the masses. From this platform they can secretly create division, conflict, and death.</p>

<p>Anyone who lies about who they are and what they believe is the worst kind of evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for one think they mostly (the educated and elite) don&#39;t believe in an actual physical and/or spiritual entity named Lucifer but they worship/follow the ideas and associations with Luciferianism principles. </p>

<p>For instance they have read about the power the ideas can have when utilized against the masses and in their quest for power and undying greed and pride, they use them, because they have seen them work for centuries, if not thousands of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I know most people don&#39;t believe in God...&quot; you&#39;re right, and that&#39;s by design. People&#39;s logic of thinking we have no Creator stems from thinking the Big Bang made everything, and that smarter people than them have proved this-and-that. You&#39;re also right that they treat Lucifer, and the religious/metaphysical aspects of life, as real, and that&#39;s because they <em>are</em> real, and they know it. They don&#39;t want us to know it though, it&#39;s better for them if we think we and the world, our reality, is Creator-less, purpose-less, and were accidentally made, and thus imperfect. They&#39;re hiding the fact we have souls, and that there are powers even greater than them. This all sets the foundation for anything else they want, the other agendas. It&#39;s ok to treat us and mother nature like shit because we&#39;re insignificant, right? Humanity isn&#39;t the center of the universe, so that&#39;s how we should be treated, right? Wrong &amp; wrong, and it&#39;s illogical to be an athiest. </p>

<p>How and why do I say these things? Because I heard about flat Earth and researched it, discovered it to be true, and now see Spaceship Earth is their biggest trick. Nothing about what you see outside matches what we&#39;re taught in school, and it&#39;s only because it&#39;s taught in school and reinforced with the media that we reject our senses and logic and instead accept whatever Neil Degrass Tyson says. The globe-Earth model is flawed, and is filled with coincidence and theory. The Biblical (and others), under-the-dome, flat/circular/stationary, model, is reality. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a good chance cognitive-dissodance and a dogmatic love for outer space has stopped a lot of you from reading this far, but if you haven&#39;t here are some things to mull over: One of the main, if not only, proofs of a speherical world that the common man can see for himself is &quot;ships disappear hull-frst&quot;. That would mean having to look down at the horizon, which we don&#39;t do, ever, the horizon always rises to eye-level, whether you&#39;re on an airplane 35,000ft up or looking at amateu weather-balloon footage from over 100,000ft; the horizontal horizon always rises, because we&#39;re on a plane of existence, not a planet that curves 8&quot; every square mile. The sun and the moon are the same size, think eclipses; Scientism says it&#39;s a coincidence. The sun circles us every 24hrs, the moon every 24.5hrs, and the stars every 23.5 hours; the stars are the easiest for us to track, with them always being along the dome. The sun &quot;sets&quot; because it&#39;s only strong enough to light up half the world at a time, and because of perspective; going higher let&#39;s you see further, and you can see two sun sets in the same day via the Dubai tower. IR thermomentors can prove moonlight lowers tempertaures, the opposite of sunlight, so it couldn&#39;t possibly be reflected sunlight. If it were reflected sunlight, then it&#39;d be coming from over 200,000 miles away, and wouldn&#39;t light up the just the clouds that pass over it, which it does if you&#39;ve been outside lately. The sun&#39;s crepuscular rays and reflection on water show its true location, thousands of miles away, not tens of millions. If you say it&#39;s the atmosphere acting as a lens, you should first check to see what convex lenses do to light. The P900 can zoom in on things too far away for us to be on a globre (refer again to ships disappearing bottom first). They say hurricanes spinning this or that way on either side of the equator, and certain pendulems, prove we&#39;re spinning, but those fit into the flat model and it&#39;s strange they rely on such secondary proofs. The stars are the best proof, and I know Australians can&#39;t see the North star, but people on top of Indonesian mountains can, albeit it just over the horizon. </p>

<p>Rant over, God real, celestial bodies revolve around our special selves, we&#39;re all that there is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moloch</p>

<p>The being is used as an archetype in the occult to teach the mindset desired.  Power, control, cycles of birth and death, etc etc.  Once the dogma and lessons are learned it is up to the occult practitioner to realize that it is actually real, that they have never been alone.  I believe they communicate with these beings directly. (and they think they are the illuminated who are brainwashing us)</p>

<p>To answer more plainly see Kevin spaceys portrayal of kaser sose, its actually the last line but watch the whole thing of you haven&#39;t already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It validates God and His word more than anything else. 
Imagine that....  they worship the worldly prince for short term riches while forfeiting their souls for eternity.  I guess that is why it is harder for a rich man to enter God&#39;s kingdom than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.  And, the repulsive filthiness and misery is beyond bearable.  Truly worthy of pity. But what suffering and evil they bring upon the world is truly astounding. Please, Lord God Almighty, bring them down and let Your Will prevail. </p>
