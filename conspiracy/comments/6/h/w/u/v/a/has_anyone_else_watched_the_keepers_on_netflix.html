        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just finished it and find it strange that The Keepers sub has so many posts by ppl saying they don&#39;t believe both church and state could be involved in the cover-up, not possible for there to be so many pedos, etc... Strikes me as fishy that anyone could come away from that documentary and doubt these things when the series showed such a massive amount of evidence and interviews with lawyers, police, etc. saying that up 100 abuse victims have come forward. Also weird that so many posts are focused on Koob as opposed to much more compelling (imo at least) leads like &quot;Skippy&quot; and &quot;Brother Bob.&quot; Do you think it&#39;s purposeful disinfo or misdirection? Just curious if anyone else had noticed this too </p>

I&#39;m kind of new to reddit (lurked for a long time but only started account recently) so I&#39;m not sure how everything works yet, but it looks like my post is already getting downvoted too lol.

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? That is so crazy because I have been thinking all day about this and the other thing that really struck me about this story was how Maskell (main priest) had a psychology background and was using drugs on the girls... anti psychotics and who knows what else as part of his sexual abuse and psychological torture. And so many of the women who were abused by him as kids say their minds just blanked out during certain episodes, they disassociated, repressed memories, etc. Then there is the other suspect in the murder (Edgar) whose wife says that he once stated something like &quot;what if I told you I could kill someone then tell myself I didn&#39;t do it and honestly not remember doing it?&quot; Like wtf. This is all MK Ultra shit. Did this priest really just coincidentally pioneer his own torture methods that happen to be extremely similar to MK techniques, back in the 60s when the program was ongoing and none of the mk info had been declassified/exposed to the public? Obviously I&#39;m just speculating but wow, how crazy would that be. What if all the sick shit that&#39;s come to light about the Catholic Church over the years was actually connected to the mk programs? Could help explain why the church has been able to cover up so much so effectively for so long. And why this case against Maskell was shut down so hard. And so much more. If anyone has any info about this possibility, that would be super interesting. I did some initial quick looking today but couldn&#39;t find anything at all about mk being facilitated through the churches </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that sub seemed absolutely inundated with Koob theories. I think Koob is <em>definitely</em> involved and was turned off by the sheer amount of posts defending him. IIRC, the Keepers Skippy being Podesta has been somewhat disproved based on when he was located in Baltimore. I&#39;m not 100% convinced either way. I&#39;ll try to find the post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. When I heard the name skippy as I was watching my mouth dropped. What are the chances? I&#39;ve seen a bit about this too and yeah not sure what to think yet either. Btw what makes you think Koob&#39;s definitely involved? He seemed to me to be the only suspect who isn&#39;t a proven pedo and who actually left the church and passed a polygraph and had a decent alibi so I&#39;m confused by all of the suspicion on him. But I also wasn&#39;t paying super close attention to every episode so easily might have missed something</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one of the worst parts of this entire story is that Delegate Wilson finally got his bill passed, and then the Baltimore Archdiocese actually had the fucking nerve to take credit for it and act is if they were working together</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArchBalt/videos/10154557759721961/">facebook</a></p>

<p>the sheer fucking audacity it takes to do something like that honestly borders on evil imo, it&#39;s so incredibly disrespectful to every single victim. they&#39;re still lying, they&#39;re still taking zero accountability, and they still absolutely do not give a fuck. </p>

<p>without coming clean about what they&#39;ve done, a great many people will ignore and dismiss all the stories about pedophilia. they&#39;ll continue to trust the church and continue to leave their kids alone with people whom the diocese knows, for a fact, are pedophiles. </p>

<p>what the church is now doing will, with absolute certainty, lead to more children being abused and raped. </p>

<p>they know this, it will happen, and they are consciously choosing to do it. </p>
