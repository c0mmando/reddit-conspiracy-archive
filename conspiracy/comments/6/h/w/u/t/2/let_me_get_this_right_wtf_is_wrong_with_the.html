<p>Hillary was covered morning, noon and night. Every time emails were mentioned, we were told by the media &quot;oh it&#39;s just a over reaction by conspiracy nut jobs&quot;. Otherwise according to the media, her poop was rose smelling solid gold. </p>

<p>Trump was considered a joke with 0 chance of winning the general election... By the media..</p>

<p>Let&#39;s fast forward to this last month...</p>

<p>Media states: Bernie Sanders and his progressive platform is the future of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Media states: Hillary, give it up. You&#39;re embarrassing yourself and the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Media states: How did we end up with Trump?</p>

<p>My message to the media... This is your fault. Do some honest to goodness journalism for a change instead of pleasing your advertisers.</p>

<p>So basically they didn&#39;t have enough under 55s to even use. They are basically stating we were only able to get some over 55s to answer the phone for our stupid poll which we are going to claim represents all of America. Notice how this poll has Clinton leading by almost double?  Well that wasn&#39;t true now was it? This poll was a garbage lie the whole time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree, and the word you&#39;re looking for is <em>biased</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The poll they paid for mysteriously mainly polls people over 55yo and shows Hillary winning by almost double. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not mysterious if you read the methodology. Landline calls skew to an older demographic. If you consider this to be fraudulent or twisted you need to explain it more.</p>

<p>The poll was about debate performance, most commentators strongly agreed that Clinton outperformed Trump. This has no bearing on election results or polling thereof.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there trying not to let the DNC crash and burn. People are mad at them, my cousin that lives in California got woke seeing Bernie get cheated and California going towards Hillary in the primary. The Wikileaks leaks showing they colluded with the media and Hillary s camp, which was disgusting. Hopefully something comes out of the DNC lawsuit. I was kinda leaning Democratic after seeing Ron Paul get screwed by the Republicans. But now all hope is gone for those parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely correct. I held a consulting position looking at broadcast news. Over the years the news has gone from reporting a story to editorializing to now crafting the news to support an agenda. And the directive to do this comes from the ownership of the media outlets.</p>

<p>Every news organization has a bias. They have for decades. But the bias is controlled by the owners and the news is crafted to support their personal agendas.</p>

They just tried to blame Bernie and his supporters for some crazy old fuck shooting up a baseball game. They attacked him for voting against a bill requiring congressional approval if Trump wanted to remove iran/Russia sanctions.  They say he isn&#39;t the future of the dnc and his independent supporters/the 80 percent of registered democrats who like him don&#39;t matter. They pretty much just talk about Russia, man. When asked recently what the DNC should focus on for 2018 Elizabeth Warren said &quot;The Russia thing.&quot; That party has no future any time soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. How delusional can you be.</p>

<p>The MSM coverage of Hillary was <em>overwhelmingly</em> negative. Every time the e-mails were mentioned they said it was &quot;an overreaction by conspiracy nutjobs&quot;? LMAO. Reality check: the e-mails were, by far, the most covered story of the election. That story didn&#39;t just get beaten to death by the MSM, it got turned into unrecognisable mush.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, the MSM is the reason we ended up with Trump. Theur endless drumming on an ultimately insignificant story (da emails!1!!&quot;) and free coverage of Trump rallies and antics did ultimately push Trump ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are just trying to spin this in a trolly way. .</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A total of 521 adult registered voters who watched the debate were interviewed by telephone nationwide. </p>

<p>Crosstabs on the following pages only include results for subgroups with <strong>enough unweighted cases to produce a sampling 
error of +/- 8.5 percentage points or less.</strong>  Some subgroups represent <strong>too small a share of the national population</strong> to produce 
crosstabs with an acceptable sampling error.  Interviews were conducted among these subgroups, but results for groups with 
a sampling error larger than +/-8.5 percentage points are not displayed
and instead are denoted with &quot;NA
&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically they didn&#39;t have enough under 55s to even use. They are basically stating we were only able to get some over 55s to answer the phone for our stupid poll which we are going to claim represents all of America. Notice how this poll has Clinton leading by almost double?  Well that wasn&#39;t true now was it? This poll was a garbage lie the whole time. </p>
