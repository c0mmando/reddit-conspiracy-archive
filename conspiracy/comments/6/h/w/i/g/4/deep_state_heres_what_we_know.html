There are SO MANY issues that the media could spotlight that would be inconvenient for The Powers That Be. Lucky for them, Mr. President is happy to create headlines on an almost daily basis.

<p>When you are investigated for 8 months about a rumor and even with zero evidence </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Y&#39;all keep saying this shit as if you have all the information already. Trump has to fire two head cronies because they were being paid off by Russia. His attorney General had to recuse himself from the investigation after he lied to Congress about meeting with Russian ambassadors. Kushner is still doing business with the Russians. </p>

<p>Then Trump fired the guy investigating all of his cronies and now he&#39;s under criminal investigation for obstruction of justice. </p>

<p>He did this shit to himself. He thinks the government is just another business where you can do shady shit as long as the people working for you are loyal. He&#39;s finding out the hard way that when you work for the American people, you can&#39;t just do and say whatever you want. </p>

<p>So now we have this boogey man the Deep state. Every time Trump fucks up, all you gotta do is pretend he&#39;s being sabotaged by the deep state. This way it doesn&#39;t matter what Trump does. If he does something good, go Trump! If something bad happens, fuckin deep state! It&#39;s a pathetic excuse. Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have tried to hard to shut down this investigation. If he was totally innocent then he had nothing to worry about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democratic party are now the deep state.   We know they&#39;re the deep state because the IRS targeted groups with certain political terms in their names who were seeking tax free status which was an unacceptable methodology that was appropriately responded to when it came to light and which didn&#39;t actually directly target right wing groups or political opponents of the current administration.  Why is this the deep state while the IRS being used by the Bush admin to target political opponents including churches very directly?  Because the Democrats and those nasty leftists are the deep state silly.  Obvious right?</p>

<p>Why is it the deep state when a Trump like Ceaser is killed during a Shakespear in the park production but not when an Obama like Ceaser is treated the same way by Shakespear in the park?  Because those filthy leftist Democrats are the deep state because reasons, that&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Why is it the deep state when initial reports about an attack half a world away in a foreign non English speaking jurisdiction aren&#39;t entirely accurate but it&#39;s not the deep state when a White House spokesperson is literally making up terrorist attacks like the Bowling Green massacre and trying to make people frightened of their own microwaves?  Because Democrats are bad mmmkay?  And the deep state is bad mmmkay?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s really the obvious.</p>

<p>Of course that wasn&#39;t said because who needs to say it when you can make a list that exclusively points at them.  I mean you could have said &quot;massaged intelligence so he could illegally invade a country&quot; but went with &quot;got a question from a tv network&quot;, and somehow you&#39;ve managed to deem that Trump as Ceaser is deep state but no mention of when they did it to Obama who the deep state apparently militarized the IRS for, and of course it&#39;s not worth mentioning the Bush admin brazenly using the IRS to target their political opposition - no deep state there I guess.</p>

<p>No way you&#39;re trying to equate the Democratic party and the deep state.  It&#39;s just a total coincidence you composed a list that exclusively targets Democrats even when much more egregious examples tied to Republicans exist.  Just a little coincidink there...</p>

<p>That has never been established.  Maybe the information made it as far as Clinton, maybe it didn&#39;t.  We don&#39;t know that.  What we do know is that Donna Brazile appears to not be the same person as Hillary Clinton and there&#39;s no reason to believe that Clinton controls Brazile&#39;s brain.

    <div class="md"><p>Go ahead and quote what part of this article you think even suggests Clinton did something wrong much less proves it.  I saw nothing of the sort.  On the contrary, the following quote asserts that it&#39;s not established whether or not this constituted any kind of favoritism.</p>

<p><em>To be fair, it’s possible that Brazile was also tipping off Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign off about coming debate questions. The Sanders campaign (and all of the Republican candidates and the Republican National Committee for that matter) has not fallen victim to the same hacks as the Clinton campaign. While a DNC spokesman did not respond to specific questions about whether Brazile also tipped off the Sanders campaign, Sanders’ former national press secretary offered only glowing praise for Brazile in an email on Monday.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s not known whether or not this was equal treatment for both sides, and I can see nothing whatsoever that implicates Clinton if it was favoritism.</p>

<p>Your own source fails to even hint at what you&#39;re trying to use it to claim (that Clinton cheated in some way, not Brazile a wholly separate individual person with a mind of her own, but Clinton herself).  It doesn&#39;t even establish that Brazile favored Clinton rather than inappropriately sharing this information with both campaigns.  </p>

<p>And you still can&#39;t stop with the temper tantrums.  Name calling is uncalled for.  Save your energy for finding sources to prove your point if any in fact exist (which I doubt).  Try reading the next one before you post it.</p>

<p>And yes, it&#39;s always illegal to send classified documents on an unsecured server and tell when an indictment was ever handed out prior to a crime?</p>

<p>Reddit was not quiet about creating their new &quot;popular&quot; thread. And they also weren&#39;t quiet about the fact that it was to keep T_D off of new. They also made it so you could mute subs for the reason that T_D was on the front page more than they liked. This is not debatable and is a known fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol you are so fundamentally dishonest with your points it&#39;s not even funny:</p>

<p>-it&#39;s not even worth the effort to point out the fact that the media absolutely hates Donald Trump on all sides with the exception of a few right-wing / Fox News pundits, and they most certainly are supporting and subtly normalizing the idea of assassination towards Trump.</p>

<p>-<a href="https://aclj.org/free-speech/president-obamas-irs-scandal-seven-years-counting">Obama DID target conservatives with the IRS</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/14017/report-obama-admin-funneled-billions-left-wing-amanda-prestigiacomo">Obama DID create an illegal slush fund with stolen DOJ money</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@Cernovich/google-takes-out-major-contract-to-de-list-infowars-com-from-its-search-index-e165b92f690a">Google WAS caught censoring and defunding ad revenue for InfoWars</a>.  <a href="https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-06-22/google-is-the-worlds-biggest-censor-and-its-power-must-be-regulated">They were also caught censoring which stories would appear in search results to show those favorable to Clinton.</a></p></li>

<li><p>The dissemination of any classified information without a security clearance is a felony punishable by prison.  No exceptions... unless you&#39;re Hillary Clinton, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s still no evidence of Trump colluding with Russia, no matter how desperately you want it to be</p></li>
<li><p>Whataboutism.  The media and vast majority of sensible people completely condemned any threats towards Obama.  They certainly weren&#39;t defended by the media and encouraged like they are now.</p></li>
<li><p>Nixon wasn&#39;t any different from any of the Presidents before him in terms of his corruption.  They just hid it better than he did and made an example out of him.  The leaks coming out of the Trump campaign are illegal, completely motivated by political ideology and designed to undermine public trust and damage his Presidency.  Don&#39;t think for a second theis people are doing this out of some sort of altruism or public service or you&#39;re just as gullible as the hardcore Trump supporters that think he&#39;s the reborn savior.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>You seriously need to educate yourself on the &quot;IRS scandal,&quot; they targeted Liberal organizations too, it&#39;s just liberal organizations were not breaking the law as much as the conservative ones after the ridiculous CU ruling. With HRC, the rules about private servers were conviently placed after she left, and you still need the intent to pass confidential information, otherwise we would be charging anyone who got compromised. Again, any thing on &quot;95%&quot; of the MSM doing any censoring? You are telling me Google is apart of the MSM?</p>
