        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The House of Orange-Nassau are a high level authority over society and operate as a branch of the Vatican&#39;s Roman empire. The House of Orange-Nassau are former Holy Roman and French nobility that currently rule the Netherlands as a constitutional monarchy. King Willem-Alexander is the blood appointed head of state. They are believed to be extremely wealthy with a large amount of shares in Royal Dutch Shell. The term Shell is a symbol for Venus and Venice. In Sandro Botticelli&#39;s painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; the Roman deity is depicted being born out of the ocean from a pearl&#39;s shell. The city of Venice is named after Venus and was a major merchant and banking center in Europe for centuries. As a merchant family not only do the Orange-Nassau&#39;s have shares in Royal Dutch Shell but also in Royal Philips Electronics, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Holland America Line cruise ships. The reason these companies use the term royal is because they are primarily owned by the royal family of the Netherlands. Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau was a former Vice President of Goldman Sachs International in London and was a financial officer for Urenco Group involved in uranium enrichment. </p>

<p>The House of Orange-Nassua established the Netherlands Trading Society which later established ABN AMRO Bank and ABN AMRO partly owns Saudi Hollandi Bank of Saudi Arabia. Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Parma who is a member of the Dutch royal family through his mother Princess Irene of the Netherlands worked for the ABN AMRO Bank. The name Orange comes from the Celtic principality of Orange in France. The Dutch Royal family are Protestants. The Loyal Orange Institute is an Irish (Celtic) Masonic order in Ireland and was created in 1798 to honor the Dutch born Protestant King William of Orange. King Willem-Alexander is the real head of the Loyal Orange Order today and he is an Illuminati master mason. Beatrix of the Netherlands is a Dame of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Rome and her deceased husband Prince Claus Amsberg was a member of the Nazi Wehrmacht defense force. King Willem-Alexander&#39;s father was a Nazi. The Italian Prince Jamie of Bourbon-Parma is the nephew of Beatrix and he is Knight of Malta and also the Dutch ambassador to the Holy See. Prince Jamie is of the House of Bourbon-Parma which established the Jesuits and this bloodline still has a portion of authority over the Jesuit Order which has deeply infiltrated the United States Department of Defense and US intelligence agencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff. Research around here would benefit from an increased shift of focus towards the Jesuits - Knights of Malta - Black Nobility and their many infiltrations. They have a direct line to the top of the luciferian-archonic Cabal structure.

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is a lot of researchers connect dots like the way op did because they connect seemingly unconnected facts and connect them which form the larger theory.

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you can. But that doesn&#39;t mean that a pattern means anything. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">Correlation does not equal causation</a>. YOu need a standard by which to judge how probable it is for that correlation to occur in a circumstance that has no linkage to what you wanted to measure.

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate some of what this user brings forth. However, I am compelled to clarify the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prince Jamie is of the House of Bourbon-Parma which established the Jesuits and this bloodline still has a portion of authority over the Jesuit Order</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a totally made up fact. The royals of Bourbon Parma expelled the Jesuits in multiple instances: both Ferdinand I and Ferdinand Duke of Parma expelled the Jesuits and confiscated their property. And when Paul III gave the bull establishing the Jesuits that never gave his family any control of the Jesuit Order. </p>

<p>All Jesuits take orders from their superiors leading to the general at the top who is a military commander, because the company was founded as a military order; Napoleon attested to the Order&#39;s military nature in his memoirs. There is no one who instructs or gives orders to the black pope - the Jesuit General, and this is known through their constitutions wherein they say its members are to obey no one but their general and the general has ultimate authority and that its members must follow him as if he were Christ and that the general is elected by other Jesuits. Unfortunately, this user chooses to make up rumors about the Jesuits and ignore history and facts which are irreconcilable with his fantasy of bloodlines controlling the Jesuits. He also will not address the fact that the families he claims control the Jesuits have themselves been members of the Jesuit Order and thus in accordance with their constitutions were completely subordinate to every whisper of their general, rather than their families or fiefs.</p>

<p>Really what irritates me is that I have been posting verifiable evidences of the Jesuits being majorly powerful at <a href="/r/RomeRules">/r/RomeRules</a> and my posts rarely get any attention. But when someone comes along and weaves a grand web of Davinci code style conspiracy theory it is upvoted because of novelty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did some research on Royal European houses a few years ago. The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is much more important than the House Orange-Nassua, imho. Below is some notes I made;</p>

<p>&quot;Windsor (House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Windsors thusly named in 1917, came into power with King Edward the VII in 1901. His mother was Queen Victoria and his father Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.) (Germany, Britain)</p>

<p>House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha - A German dynasty, cadet branch of the Saxon House of Wettin. The current Head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is Prince Andreas, Duke of Saxony (Full name: Andreas Michael Friedrich Hans Armin Siegfried Hubertus). So if Prince Andreas is Head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, then does Queen Elizabeth and King Philippe answer to him? Before you answer that there is another layer of intrigue. Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a branch under the House of Saxony whose current disputed/contested head is Prince Ruediger of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen. Yet there is one more layer. The House of Saxony is a branch of the House of Wettin, whose head is Michael Prinz von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenachl, Prince of the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. So then then we would have Prince Micheal above Prince Ruediger above Prince Andreas above Queen Elizabeth? Is there an established order or is it more just familial relations?&quot;</p>

<p>Imo their is an established order within the European Royal Houses that very much exists today. And also, imo, this would mean that the Head of the House Wettin is the person in charge of all Houses within it&#39;s lineage, which would include the Windsors and thus the UK Commonwealth (and that includes England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and numerous others smaller islands).</p>

<p>The above research was triggered by my investigating &#39;The Council of 13&#39;, below is my research into it.</p>

<p>&quot;Council of 13;
Rothschild (Bauer) (Germany, France,... Europe)
Bruce (Scotland)
Cavendish (Kennedy) (Britain) (The only Cavendish Kennedy connection I could find was Kathleen Agnes Kennedy, sister of JFK, who married a Cavendish and the Kennedy Family was none to happy about this. She died in a plane crash due to bad weather in 1948, at the age of 28.)
De Medici (Italy)
Hanover (Germany)
Hapsburg (Austria)
Krupp (Germany)
Plantagenet (France, Britain)
Rockefeller (USA)
Romanov (Russian)
Sinclair (St. Clair) (Scotland)
Warburg (del Banco) (USA, but of German-Jewish descent)
Windsor (House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the Windsors thusly named in 1917, came into power with King Edward the VII in 1901. His mother was Queen Victoria and his father Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.) (Germany, Britain)</p>

<p>Note: Houses of de Medici, Hapsburg, and Plantagenet considered dissolved.</p>

<p>Partial listing of existing Monarchies;
European monarchies of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. Asian monarchies of Bhutan, Cambodia, Japan, Thailand. The Islamic monarchies of Bahrain, Brunei, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The European and Asian Monarchies tend to be Constitutional whereas the Islamic are largely Absolute.</p>

<p>House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha - A German dynasty, cadet branch of the Saxon House of Wettin. The current Head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is Prince Andreas, Duke of Saxony (Full name: Andreas Michael Friedrich Hans Armin Siegfried Hubertus). So if Prince Andreas is Head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, then does Queen Elizabeth and King Philippe answer to him? Before you answer that there is another layer of intrigue. Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a branch under the House of Saxony whose current disputed/contested head is Prince Ruediger of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen. Yet there is one more layer. The House of Saxony is a branch of the House of Wettin, whose head is Michael Prinz von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenachl, Prince of the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. So then then we would have Prince Micheal above Prince Ruediger above Prince Andreas above Queen Elizabeth? Is there an established order or is it more just familial relations?</p>

<p>Spain, King of Spain - Felipe the VI, from the French House of Bourbon, which has ruled Spain on and off since 1700. I did not realize it still was a monarchy. It seems to play no active role in EU politics. These are the same Bourbons overthrown during the French Revolution. The Head of the House of Bourbon is Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou. Spain is a Roman Catholic nation.</p>

<p>Netherlands, King of the Dutch - Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand, he is also head of the House Orange-Nassau which has ruled since 1815 (old money from Dutch East Indies and Royal Dutch Shell)</p>

<p>Belgium, King of Belgium - Philippe Léopold Louis Marie, all Dutch Royals are from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and have ruled since Leopold I in 1831. Belgium is listed as a Roman Catholic nation.</p>

<p>Denmark, Queen of Denmark - Margrethe Alexandrine Þórhildur Ingrid, from the German House of Glucksburg, ruled since 1863. British King George VI in 1947 pronounced Philip, his son-in-law and a Glucksburg, Duke of Edinburgh. Philip is the father of Prince Charles the heir apparent to the House of Windsor. The House of Glucksburg&#39;s head is Christoph, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein.</p>

<p>Norway, King of Norway - Harald V, also of the House of Glucksburg, ruled since 1905. He is the first cousin once removed of King Philippe of Belgium and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, the second cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and the second cousin once removed of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.</p>

<p>Sweden, King of Sweden - Carl Gustaf Folke Hubertus, he is also head of the House of Bernadotte which has ruled since 1818. Bernadotte is a cadet house that ultimately falls under the House of Glucksburg through the House of Oldenburg.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia, King of Saudi Arabia - Salman, of the House of Saud, ruled Saudi Arabia on and off since 1744 (control OPEC, partner in the petrodollar)</p>

<p>It certainly it is no stretch to say that European Monarchies are quite good friends. But more importantly they&#39;re all tied together by bloodlines. In fact it is no stretch to say that Monarchies would group together, assist one another, work together. For no other reason than the shared desire to maintain their respective Monarchies... or more accurately their Houses. Birds of a feather.</p>

<p>So is the Council of 13 legit? I believe it is so. Though I am certain that the above listing is inaccurate. I&#39;m sure some of the Houses listed are no longer on the council. Certainly it is not the Windsors but the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha that sits on the council, or more likely the House of Wettin. I would not be surprised if the House of Saud now sits on the council, and at least 1 house from Asia, House of Li from Hong Kong perhaps? But to counter my own supposition, the entire power structure we are investigating sources from Europe. The USA was settled and founded by, and therefor is an extension of, Europe. So the question then becomes is this Council of 13 a matter of strictly European bloodlines, or does it have more to do with the mentality of the &#39;Ruler&#39;?</p>

<p>My proposed &#39;Council of 13&#39;;</p>

<p>House of Bourbon
House of Bruce
House of Cavendish
House of Glucksburg
House of Hanover
House of Krupp
House of Orange-Nassau
House of Rockefeller
House of Romanov
House of Rothschild
House of Sinclair
House of Warburg
House of Wettin (House of Saxe-Coburg Gotha (Windsors))</p>

<p>I&#39;m leaning toward the Council of 13 being old European Houses, except for the interloper and current head... Rothschild, and the Rockefellers, who are of European descent.&quot;</p>
