       Never. Religion has been replaced by social media as the opium of the masses and they will never care enough to actually demand the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that spends more than 5 minutes looking into 9-11 knows the official story is ridiculous. Snapchat Twitter facebook et all keep most from spending even 5 minutes looking into 9-11.

       I'd say way more than 75% have never done 5 minutes of research with an open mind on their own about 9/11. It's a shame.

       Meh, I've read a ton of stuff about it, not really buying the whole false flag thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think our gov and intelligence agencies knew an attack was coming and failed to be proactive enough to stop it, but I don't think the ever mysterious "deep state" directly caused it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news showed building 7 on fire all day until it collapsed, the surrounding area got pretty fucked up by debris. Not really surprising.

      <p>
       I'm not willing to say, with the evidence i have seen, that our government had a hand in the attacks, but more than those plane crashes and the resulting fires brought the towers down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say that there is ample evidence that our government avoided and continues to stifle any legitimate investigation into what actually occurred.

       WTC1 collapsed in around 11 seconds which is about 2 seconds slower than free fall. It was the second tower to collapse, and there is considerably more footage of its collapse. Lots of people talk about how the debris fell faster than the buildings, but that's only correct for the North Tower.

       WTC2 collapsed in around 9 seconds which is within few percent of free fall. The debris from 2 did not fall significantly faster than the building, but you might not be familiar with its

       WTC7 experienced at least 2.25 seconds of free fall (confirmed by NIST). Anyone who says free fall didn't occur in the WTC collapses needs to do some homework. You should start with the

       That's where you're wrong kiddo! No steel frame building had ever collapsed from fire alone, so anyone saying it was bound to happen or totally expected is talking out their ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you point out that 7 was also damaged by falling debris not even NIST claims that the damage caused or contributed in any significant way to the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the NIST FAQ:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         22. Would WTC 7 have collapsed even if there had been no structural damage induced by the collapse of WTC 1?
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes. Even without the structural damage, WTC 7 would have collapsed from the fires that the debris initiated. The growth and spread of the lower-floor fires due to the loss of water supply to the sprinklers from the city mains was enough to initiate the collapse of the entire building due to buckling of a critical column in the northeast region of the building.

       My honest answer is that I think it will take generations to make a difference.  Like the JFK assassination, those who were alive while it happened, will forever have the shock imprinted in their brains, but later generations won't have the same emotional attachment to it.  "Bush did 9/11" is a pretty common meme among younger people these days, and I don't think it's always in a disparaging way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would caution to appeal to logic.  "Either you're logical, or you believe the official narrative" is polarizing, especially when really there is a lot of grey area in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liken it to Linux vs Windows arguments.  "Either you use the most perfect operating system ever, or you use Windows because you're an idiot" is a common sentiment on Linux forums.  There are lots of reasons to use either, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we take the analogy that 9/11 Truth is Linux, and the official narrative is Windows, you have to accept that you're up against a huge behemoth that will only change slowly and incrementally, and (probably) won't ever tip the scales completely.

       It fit's perfectly since the buildings in NY that fell had structural damage. Further strengthening the argument that a building can fall when damaged and on fire. Doesn't mean they all do, just that it is a possibility and has happened.

       People started rejecting the Official Conspiracy Theory almost immediately. That's how we ended up with the Operation Mockingbird operatives creating the controlled demolition crapola to sow dis/misinformation in order to deflect attention from the PNAC and those in the US and Saudi governments who orchestrated the attacks.

       The evidence decreased after the Atlanta I-85 collapsed from the heat of burning plastic.  The buildings would have been loaded with plastics, and that's what could have created the high temperature fire.

       I wish that were true. Maybe in the 1960s... We could have touched them. Maybe if we had taken JFK's warning seriously. But they have had 50 years to strengthen their position and solidify their anonymity. Now we watch as our freedoms and privacy are stripped away, this is the final step before enslavement. It has become impossible because nobody can connect them to the evils, barely anyone knows who they are, no court would prosecute, no lawyer would make a case against them.

       Our salvation, in this upcoming age of automation, is universal basic income. These fuckers took all the money before we could make the system that would serve the people, and they will leverage that against us now.

       They can hide behind front organizations and secret billionaire boys clubs all they want, some of us have a pretty good idea as to who is behind the systemic unnecessary evil in our world. They are not untouchable, a well placed bullet, a poisoned drink, a faulty brake in their car is all it takes to end some evil financier's or politician's reign of evil. Only problem the speed in which their positions would be refilled by willing sociopaths.
