    <div class="md"><p>Meh, I&#39;ve read a ton of stuff about it, not really buying the whole false flag thing.</p>

<p>I think our gov and intelligence agencies knew an attack was coming and failed to be proactive enough to stop it, but I don&#39;t think the ever mysterious &quot;deep state&quot; directly caused it.</p>

<p>The news showed building 7 on fire all day until it collapsed, the surrounding area got pretty fucked up by debris. Not really surprising. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not willing to say, with the evidence i have seen, that our government had a hand in the attacks, but more than those plane crashes and the resulting fires brought the towers down. </p>

<p>I will say that there is ample evidence that our government avoided and continues to stifle any legitimate investigation into what actually occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC1 collapsed in around 11 seconds which is about 2 seconds slower than free fall. It was the second tower to collapse, and there is considerably more footage of its collapse. Lots of people talk about how the debris fell faster than the buildings, but that&#39;s only correct for the North Tower. </p>

<p>WTC2 collapsed in around 9 seconds which is within few percent of free fall. The debris from 2 did not fall significantly faster than the building, but you might not be familiar with its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT9Jt85SW38">collapse footage</a>. </p>

<p>WTC7 experienced at least 2.25 seconds of free fall (confirmed by NIST). Anyone who says free fall didn&#39;t occur in the WTC collapses needs to do some homework. You should start with the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-towers-investigation">NIST FAQ.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Not really surprising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong kiddo! No steel frame building had ever collapsed from fire alone, so anyone saying it was bound to happen or totally expected is talking out their ass. </p>

<p>And before you point out that 7 was also damaged by falling debris not even NIST claims that the damage caused or contributed in any significant way to the collapse. </p>

<p>From the NIST FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>22. Would WTC 7 have collapsed even if there had been no structural damage induced by the collapse of WTC 1?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Even without the structural damage, WTC 7 would have collapsed from the fires that the debris initiated. The growth and spread of the lower-floor fires due to the loss of water supply to the sprinklers from the city mains was enough to initiate the collapse of the entire building due to buckling of a critical column in the northeast region of the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My honest answer is that I think it will take generations to make a difference.  Like the JFK assassination, those who were alive while it happened, will forever have the shock imprinted in their brains, but later generations won&#39;t have the same emotional attachment to it.  &quot;Bush did 9/11&quot; is a pretty common meme among younger people these days, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always in a disparaging way.</p>

<p>I would caution to appeal to logic.  &quot;Either you&#39;re logical, or you believe the official narrative&quot; is polarizing, especially when really there is a lot of grey area in between.</p>

<p>I liken it to Linux vs Windows arguments.  &quot;Either you use the most perfect operating system ever, or you use Windows because you&#39;re an idiot&quot; is a common sentiment on Linux forums.  There are lots of reasons to use either, or both.  </p>

<p>If we take the analogy that 9/11 Truth is Linux, and the official narrative is Windows, you have to accept that you&#39;re up against a huge behemoth that will only change slowly and incrementally, and (probably) won&#39;t ever tip the scales completely.</p>
