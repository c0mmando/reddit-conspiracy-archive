       This won't be short, but I'll try to be on point, and I'm not going to fill in every blank. I'm not providing links. This was my journey. I attest to truth within. If you want TLDR, look elsewhere. This is for thinkers and those who care about privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all started, because a couple years ago I noticed a lot of my traffic going through akamaitechnologies.com. It turns out that this is one of a few major companies responsible for publishing "The Internet" for us consumers along with amazonaws, 1e100.net (google), and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every search I look into on this gives the same dead end which is: If you block them most of the Internet won't work, so don't worry about it. They're just hosting copies closer to you to help reduce traffic bloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that I am here posting this with full blocking in effect. Many sites are inaccessible, and for this I am thankful. You will see why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had let all this slide until recently. With it being legal for a certain 3 letter group to hack anyone in the US as of last December, my paranoia got piqued. That alone didn't push me into action, but it did cause me to watch my netstat more frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was FireFox that really got me going. I check my netstat regularly, and I saw that it has two localhost connections upon loading. No big deal right? Of course the public Internet and the mozilla forum says this is no big deal. It's basically a necessity due to Windows not handling Unix code as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did find one conspiratorial post out there though, calling this a stack intercept. It got me wondering about Odin's Eye, and how that alleged secondary processor would be able to intercept traffic without some method of communication with the primary CPU.
      </p>
      <p>
       After some more digging I stumbled upon a little program called TCPView. I live by this now. It is everything you see in netstat, but real time. You see a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this I began to see FireFox making active connections upon loading it, even if I didn't go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this I was able to attribute to add-ons, particularly NoScript due to some advanced settings (I can elaborate on this if asked), but there were connections occurring independently of all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main culprit was the site of map2.hwcdn.com which is owned by Highwinds Content Delivery Network - another one of those companies responsible for publishing "The Internet", and is apparently owned by Akamai. Full circle now. Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Going a step further, Highwinds is based out of Phoenix, Arizona. Ever heard about those massive data centers in the AZ desert having to do with Echelon? I'll bet it's these guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've proceeded to block out every IP block owned by every snooping corporation that has been cited thus far in my post with my router access list. This can be confirmed by connections marked as SYN_SENT instead of ESTABLISHED.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't stop here though. Upon review of my router's IP connection tracker, I found more established connections even when getting a fresh IP address, and not accessing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems my router may also be hacked, even though it is a security focused firewall router.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the IP addresses that it showed as being connected to at some point even when not using the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       216.99.133.23 is the most persistent offender. It pops up with some regularity. I couldn't trace it to anything in particular, but the nearest IP that I could resolve to it was 216.99.131.3 which is in03.sjc.mx.trendmicro.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       TrendMicro, OK that sounds familiar. Apparently it's a multinational security company based out of Japan. Very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next unsoliticed IP I came across was from my ISP in a neighboring state. I've seen that one a few times as well. Neither of these IPs seem to change either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The third and most recent was 216.218.206.114. It took me a minute to figure this out, but it's in the same IP block as
       <a href="http://www.startpage.com">
        www.startpage.com
       </a>
       the alleged safe and private search engine recommended by Snowden, who was obviously in my mind co-opted long before Assange was last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       startpage.com resolves to 216.218.239.62 and 216.218.239.142. Not a dead ringer, but darn close.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might say, but you went to that site purposefully, and that was true, but that was before I changed my IP address the last time (change router's MAC address clone while modem offline to do this) which suggests that startpage hacked my modem simply by going there, even with all this other IP blocking going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting back to the big companies delivering the Internet to us, I went through the trouble of pinging every single OCSP site (for publishing certificates which handle trust relationships on your browser), and about half of them resolved to Akamai. I suspect this is a means of certificate hijack for compromising operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only hope that only allowing connections to valid sites going forward will do the trick. There's not much else I can do besides reformat everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I seem to be at the point where both TCPView and my router logs indicate no unsolicited connections, but I am not confident that will remain the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not security conscious, accept that you are most likely compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy to provide my block list if anyone is interested.

       Here is the most updated information I can provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: Blocking all these will break the majority of your Internet connectivity. You may need to unblock certain ranges to restore functionality. I didn't track what every block was for, so you may need to do some DNS comparisons to figure out what's what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these ranges are based on whois info, but others are the result of my own prodding with nslookup, so this may not be all encompassing, and it may have omissions, but it has sufficed to secure everything desired in my TCPView.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not include the specific IPs in my post above. I also targeted Yahoo, Facebook, and Google specifically for blocking, but not Bing because it didn't get invasive.

       I don't have an account, and pastebin is blocked =] but I posted it as a reply to another comment if you want to grab it and put it somewhere. I should probably dictate what each block is representative of if we're going to disemminate it though. I guess I'll get on that.

       What's your Hardware and software? Intel or amd?  Have you access to any older chips that don't have these?  Do you only use Firefox and windows  ? Why not tails and tails browser? Router brand and os? Were your tests done on a clean install or over a dirty install?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to see these tests on hand built, store bought computers running a secure Linux distribution compiled from signed source.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This presents a problem. How can we ascertain any distribution downloaded has not been compromised when we cannot be sure the sites we're accessing are what we intend to over connections that have not been compromised on hardware that is not compromised?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only absolute way would be to fab our own silicone in house, print our boards and chips, write our microcode, and audit or write our own operating systems from source, which would still require the use of compromised systems that would have be too destroyed to dust after their use in an extremely secure facility.

       It is a stale Windows OS with Intel i5. Only the browser and my router were compromised, not the OS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The router is my bigger concern. I am reluctant to say what it is, but it has not been eligible for firmware updates for over 5 years so that is worth noting and likely the reason it was compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not clear to me whether Firefox is compromised natively or because of browsing, but I suspect browsing. Although that does not close the loop on the potential stack intercept I mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not heard of Tails, will give it a look. Thank you.
      </p>

       The way you can tell if a distribution download has been compromised is by wathcing your TCPView to see what it is doing out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the router connection logs to be much more valuable though, because they show anything your computer is trying to send out even if your computer isn't disclosing it.

       It is a stale Windows OS with Intel i5. I'm not convinced the OS is compromised, but FireFox is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the router is the bigger issue. I am reluctant to say what it is, but it has not been eligible for firmware updates for over 5 years so that is worth noting and likely the reason it was compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not clear to me whether Firefox is compromised natively or because of browsing, but I suspect browsing. Although that does not close the loop on the potential stack intercept I mentioned.

       That's fine. I strongly encourage you to upgrade though. I can't make any recommendations as the go to company I use for work was fully compromised by the CIA as exposed by wikileaks this year. Like you I'm hesitant to name, but they have rolled patches quickly for that and countless other problems.

       Your opsec may be lacking, maintaining good opsec is one of the hardest things to accomplish. I'm happy to talk more about this if you're interested.

       It's probably been compromised. For most people it's strong enough. If you're trying to avoid data collection, tracking, and malware its ample. If you're trying to protect yourself from nation states I suggest you get the out of whatever you're in because you're not prepared for that in any way. No offense.

       Again, this assumes that it is not compromised. To test this fully would be difficult.

       I appreciate your insight. I am not under delusions of being secure from a persistent hacker.
      </p>
      <p>
       My goals were two fold:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stop all the auto-tracking that occurs when you visit a web site (TCPView easily shows which sites invasively hammer you even if you have them blocked)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stop all connections I can see in TCPView and the router logs that I did not initiate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Beyond that, yes I need to use Linux, get a new router, and should ideally run a VM for all web browsing so I can restore it without saving anything to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For now I am OK with just blocking and watching traffic, and get some info out there. I also leave my modem unplugged when I'm not using it.

       Another tool you may find useful is something like deep freeze. It allows temporary changes to a system for the current session but reverts to the original state after logout. It's also available on Linux. Using that, on the os on the metal then on the VM would increase your protection if you need a persistent environment. If you don't need a persistent environment then running the latest tails on a non rewritable CD or DVD offers the best protection from all but micro code attacks.

       So best of all worlds would be accessing a non-RW CD on a VM running on an OS (never enabling autoplay) with Deep Freeze, with the OS drive never being C: after getting a new router, maintaining my block list, and reformatting my PC after wiping the master boot record. And also not installing any OS that is TCP enabled. They don't make it easy do they.

       Another Avenue to pursue is compartmentalizing your network. Eg
      </p>
      <p>
       If you need a persistent environment for work or gaming you could dedicate a PC to that, with a modified block list that only allows the services you can't live without when you're using them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a more restricted PC for all other uses that don't require compromised connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same can be said of wireless networks that should be restricted from your secure network if it's impossible to dedicate a line to them.

       Windows operating systems have telemetry and many background processes that try to reach out to the internet by default.

        216.99.133.23 is the most persistent offender. It pops up with some regularity. I couldn't trace it to anything in particular, but the nearest IP that I could resolve to it was 216.99.131.3 which is in03.sjc.mx.trendmicro.com.

        TrendMicro, OK that sounds familiar. Apparently it's a multinational security company based out of Japan. Very interesting.

       To elaborate on this, the connection is trying to use port 443 which is Trivial File Transfer Protocol, and it was originating from my ISP provided IP address to that IP address, not from my internal IP address which tells me that it was likely my cable modem actually doing this, not my router.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's possible maybe my router was never compromised, but rather my cable modem, which is in fact new.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore TrendMicro provides security for cloud hosting services such as, guess who, AmazonAWS.

       I have a well maintained and extensive block list in my hosts file, nothing out of wack there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have used MalwareBytes in the past, and immediately uninstalled it. Otherwise no other tools of theirs on this PC.
      </p>
      <p>
       My concern is that my router saw this connection but my PC did not. The connection originated from my outward facing IP, not my internal IP, which means that either my computer was stealthing it or that it was actually my cable modem making the connection. In either case, that is not whitehat behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it can be reasonably surmised that the IP is not TrendMicro, since I had to look elsehwere in the IP block to find that name resolution.

       Right, and there's ARP spoofing potentially, or outright looking at the ISP logs which would show what sites you are connecting to unless you are using a VPN. This is only a small step.

       There is a huge amount of data (can be too much to process heavily or store) yet they don't get all of it. It's still plenty. It's a complicated subject and while I'm aware of their mystery boxes (taps) I can only speculate on the metrics including coverage, collection, storage capacity, retention, filtering, processing capacity, selection, etc. Where possible you might want to rely on external retention instead and having access when you need it with live monitoring helping to steer you towards what to requisition. It's not simple. There are hundreds of things to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on the VPN connection. In theory an onion network should be best and/or mesh network.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can actually gleam a fair amount from encrypted traffic from a log of packet sizes and timestamps alone and basic statistical analysis although it's not likely they would be looking at you or put in the effort.

       I don't really like the idea of TOR for security because you are going through someone else's connection who may not actually be secure, but for anonymity sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last remark about not likely being looked at is where I am kind of going with this. If anyone were being looked at deliberately, there is practically no way to be secure on the Internet. But if I can block the automated systems, that's a win.

       Just encryption/SSL tends to do that if they don't have the immediate keys especially. Even when they can exploit it or even have the private keys it isn't cheap. Automated systems already have difficulty even if nothing were encrypted. These agents have for a very long time had very good systems merely for analysing who talks to who without having the content. Graph theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Onion networks with enough nodes and users are close to impossible to crack. The problem is the latency is really high as well. It's really wasteful.

       Right, but that is basically my point. They don't host the originating content. They host a copy so that traffic doesn't have to travel as many hops. This opens the door for possibility of that copy being modified by a middle man.

       Forgive me but the lack of technical understanding in your post is pretty staggering, I am not sure where to begin.

      <p>
       Rather than savage it piece-by-piece I think it would be better for me to say that not a single thing you’ve done has increased your security or privacy. All you’ve done is made yourself paranoid, wasted your time, and inconvenienced your internet experience. It might have been worth it had you achieved a false sense of security, but if you’re going to continue looking through router logs then you haven’t succeeded at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can harden your usual OS and internet access methods, but not in the manner you describe. There are a load of options and considerations depending on you needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you care this much then you would probably be better of with an OS like Tails and/or accessing the internet using Tor. But remember that you can still expose/deanonymise yourself through your own actions.

       Just use a text based browser if you're this paranoid. You'll still probably need connections to akamai and cert revocation lists but you'll be much more secure. Course your UX will be dog turd but using a full-featured browser isn't compatible with the way you think the internet works.

      <p>
       The site itself stated that they can be incorrect, and they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same site also states that hwng.net is owned by feedingbrooklynpotatoes.com and it plainly isn't. By the site's own (incorrect) logic it's owned by akamai so..
      </p>
      <p>
       The correct answer to the question is the raw whois information from the whois system itself:
      </p>
      <pre><code>No match for "MAP2.HWCDN.COM".
</code></pre>
      <p>
       The real problem here is the server record doesn't exist which imho is causing a badly handled feedback loop in their whois logic - I can make any domain look like it's owned by Akamai by your and that site's logic. Take for example the site of the
       <a href="https://myip.ms/info/whois/205.185.216.10/k/607329078/website/thisisnonsense.korea-dpr.com">

       . Basically the site you linked is broken and makes no effort to handle errors.

      <p>
       The information you're

       Relying on a barely competent third party that's giving you invalid data to tell you about some conspiracy of lizard people that's running all the CDN's on the planet is a bad idea. All this information is available from reliable sources if you go looking. Plus again I know people who know Lance Crosby and I know people who work for HW via industry connections.. I wouldn't rule out (or in) Akamai buying HWCDN by any stretch but they don't own it today.

       I'm not relying on anything. I thought I saw a connection, it may or may not be reliable, and as I've already stated, it means nothing. You're wasting your time nitpicking a sidebar that means nothing, because the owner of the website is irrelevant, and changes nothing about the observed behavior.

       Unlikely. More likely is somebody using their services has. You could report it to HWCDN but I don't think this is likely either. You're seeing traffic go to systems they own - that doesn't really mean your browser is "hijacked" - browsers legitimately do things like update checks, check for phishing attempts and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you block things like CDNs aside from the internet looking fairly crappy at lots of major sites you'll do things like block cert revocations that are revoked often because they've been compromised and block updates and open yourself up to the TLAs you seek to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many complicated interactions with the internet and the best way to stay secure is certainly to reduce your attack surface; but there's reducing your attack surface and being paranoid. Again as I said before if you really care use a simpler browser and/or a more secure OS.

       Selling a service isn't the same thing as selling a domain name. Every service provider I've dealt with has other domains they are willing to let you use their procs on, but not their primary web site.

       Not to discredit the idea of mass survelliance, but you should learn about networking first.

       Start with network+ and work your way up to the cisco networking learning material.

       Admittedly, I haven't been certified in Network+ in over a decade so I am a bit rusty. It was an entry level course, OSI model basics. Cisco router programming was a bit more complicated, but conceptually nothing earth shattering.

       I don't think you're on the mark here, and I don't see any substantiation to your opinion. I suspect you are fishing for information by going after my ego.

       I posted something about this a couple of weeks ago and got busy so I haven't re-visited it yet.  I will have time this weekend however.  I am in the process of blocking all outbound and inbound communications from these IPs.  I would be willing to share my PCAP from a fresh windows 10 instance about a month ago.  Would people like to see this?  There are additional IP addresses that are not referenced in the post that my box was picking up.

       I believe you.

       If I was NSA, Akamai would be one of my first targets that I totally pwnd because of their reach. If you hit the biggest CDN on the Internet, you have access to everyone. Akamai is certainly a PRISM partner. And NSA certainly double crossed them like everyone else, on multiple levels. Feed the Akami Execs a line of bullshit about them helping the mission. Then pay them hundreds of millions per year in off the books revenue for their cooperation. Then infiltrate them with CORE SECRETS moles to collect it all. Then hack their asses once you're inside just to make sure they don't wiggle out of complying with PRISM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only web browser I can recommend that is more NSA-proof than anything else is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">
        https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't plan to use it, at least read its README to see how many dozens of ways Chrome phones home to Google. That project tries to remove every trace of Google. I was stunned when I saw all of the ways that Google spies on us. Do not trust Chrome for shit. The whole thing is one giant spyware virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, every other browser is worse. Including Firefox. Maybe the spooks actively make the web suck and help the monopolists at Google and Apple and Microsoft by bloating it up so that no indies can even make a web browser, because a web browser is too perfect of a spy weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ungoogled-chromium is extremely hard to compile yourself. Thanks to Google over-engineering by design.
It will take even skilled programmers a week just to figure out how to build it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you really care about being NSA-proof, that is your best bet until something better comes along.

       Someone else mentioned Tails browser as a viable alternative. I don't touch anything Google. Their privacy policy is a joke. Ironically it seems like Microsoft is the least invasive of the bunch, notwithstanding the OS that is.
