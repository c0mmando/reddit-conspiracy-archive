        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">131</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TimeBandit88.html">TimeBandit88</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This won&#39;t be short, but I&#39;ll try to be on point, and I&#39;m not going to fill in every blank. I&#39;m not providing links. This was my journey. I attest to truth within. If you want TLDR, look elsewhere. This is for thinkers and those who care about privacy.</p>

<p>This all started, because a couple years ago I noticed a lot of my traffic going through akamaitechnologies.com. It turns out that this is one of a few major companies responsible for publishing &quot;The Internet&quot; for us consumers along with amazonaws, 1e100.net (google), and others.</p>

<p>Every search I look into on this gives the same dead end which is: If you block them most of the Internet won&#39;t work, so don&#39;t worry about it. They&#39;re just hosting copies closer to you to help reduce traffic bloat.</p>

<p>Note that I am here posting this with full blocking in effect. Many sites are inaccessible, and for this I am thankful. You will see why.</p>

<p>I had let all this slide until recently. With it being legal for a certain 3 letter group to hack anyone in the US as of last December, my paranoia got piqued. That alone didn&#39;t push me into action, but it did cause me to watch my netstat more frequently.</p>

<p>It was FireFox that really got me going. I check my netstat regularly, and I saw that it has two localhost connections upon loading. No big deal right? Of course the public Internet and the mozilla forum says this is no big deal. It&#39;s basically a necessity due to Windows not handling Unix code as well.</p>

<p>I did find one conspiratorial post out there though, calling this a stack intercept. It got me wondering about Odin&#39;s Eye, and how that alleged secondary processor would be able to intercept traffic without some method of communication with the primary CPU.</p>

<p>After some more digging I stumbled upon a little program called TCPView. I live by this now. It is everything you see in netstat, but real time. You see a lot more.</p>

<p>With this I began to see FireFox making active connections upon loading it, even if I didn&#39;t go anywhere.</p>

<p>Some of this I was able to attribute to add-ons, particularly NoScript due to some advanced settings (I can elaborate on this if asked), but there were connections occurring independently of all that.</p>

<p>The main culprit was the site of map2.hwcdn.com which is owned by Highwinds Content Delivery Network - another one of those companies responsible for publishing &quot;The Internet&quot;, and is apparently owned by Akamai. Full circle now. Coincidence?</p>

<p>Going a step further, Highwinds is based out of Phoenix, Arizona. Ever heard about those massive data centers in the AZ desert having to do with Echelon? I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s these guys.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve proceeded to block out every IP block owned by every snooping corporation that has been cited thus far in my post with my router access list. This can be confirmed by connections marked as SYN_SENT instead of ESTABLISHED.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t stop here though. Upon review of my router&#39;s IP connection tracker, I found more established connections even when getting a fresh IP address, and not accessing anything.</p>

<p>So it seems my router may also be hacked, even though it is a security focused firewall router.</p>

<p>Here are the IP addresses that it showed as being connected to at some point even when not using the connection.</p>

<p>216.99.133.23 is the most persistent offender. It pops up with some regularity. I couldn&#39;t trace it to anything in particular, but the nearest IP that I could resolve to it was 216.99.131.3 which is in03.sjc.mx.trendmicro.com.</p>

<p>TrendMicro, OK that sounds familiar. Apparently it&#39;s a multinational security company based out of Japan. Very interesting.</p>

<p>The next unsoliticed IP I came across was from my ISP in a neighboring state. I&#39;ve seen that one a few times as well. Neither of these IPs seem to change either.</p>

<p>The third and most recent was 216.218.206.114. It took me a minute to figure this out, but it&#39;s in the same IP block as <a href="http://www.startpage.com">www.startpage.com</a> the alleged safe and private search engine recommended by Snowden, who was obviously in my mind co-opted long before Assange was last year.</p>

<p>startpage.com resolves to 216.218.239.62 and 216.218.239.142. Not a dead ringer, but darn close.</p>

<p>You might say, but you went to that site purposefully, and that was true, but that was before I changed my IP address the last time (change router&#39;s MAC address clone while modem offline to do this) which suggests that startpage hacked my modem simply by going there, even with all this other IP blocking going on.</p>

<p>Getting back to the big companies delivering the Internet to us, I went through the trouble of pinging every single OCSP site (for publishing certificates which handle trust relationships on your browser), and about half of them resolved to Akamai. I suspect this is a means of certificate hijack for compromising operating systems.</p>

<p>I can only hope that only allowing connections to valid sites going forward will do the trick. There&#39;s not much else I can do besides reformat everything.</p>

<p>Finally, I seem to be at the point where both TCPView and my router logs indicate no unsolicited connections, but I am not confident that will remain the case.</p>

<p>If you are not security conscious, accept that you are most likely compromised.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to provide my block list if anyone is interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your Hardware and software? Intel or amd?  Have you access to any older chips that don&#39;t have these?  Do you only use Firefox and windows  ? Why not tails and tails browser? Router brand and os? Were your tests done on a clean install or over a dirty install? </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see these tests on hand built, store bought computers running a secure Linux distribution compiled from signed source. </p>

<hr/>

<p>This presents a problem. How can we ascertain any distribution downloaded has not been compromised when we cannot be sure the sites we&#39;re accessing are what we intend to over connections that have not been compromised on hardware that is not compromised? </p>

<p>The only absolute way would be to fab our own silicone in house, print our boards and chips, write our microcode, and audit or write our own operating systems from source, which would still require the use of compromised systems that would have be too destroyed to dust after their use in an extremely secure facility. </p>

<p>I see. It&#39;s possible that Windows is natively compromised. You would need to control for your other hw (router) to be sure. </p>

<p>That&#39;s fine. I strongly encourage you to upgrade though. I can&#39;t make any recommendations as the go to company I use for work was fully compromised by the CIA as exposed by wikileaks this year. Like you I&#39;m hesitant to name, but they have rolled patches quickly for that and countless other problems.  </p>

<p>Your opsec may be lacking, maintaining good opsec is one of the hardest things to accomplish. I&#39;m happy to talk more about this if you&#39;re interested. </p>

<p>Try a different browser on a clean Unix or Linux system and see that persists. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s probably been compromised. For most people it&#39;s strong enough. If you&#39;re trying to avoid data collection, tracking, and malware its ample. If you&#39;re trying to protect yourself from nation states I suggest you get the out of whatever you&#39;re in because you&#39;re not prepared for that in any way. No offense. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s assuming your os or router is not compromised. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, this assumes that it is not compromised. To test this fully would be difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your insight. I am not under delusions of being secure from a persistent hacker.</p>

<p>My goals were two fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stop all the auto-tracking that occurs when you visit a web site (TCPView easily shows which sites invasively hammer you even if you have them blocked)</p></li>
<li><p>Stop all connections I can see in TCPView and the router logs that I did not initiate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, yes I need to use Linux, get a new router, and should ideally run a VM for all web browsing so I can restore it without saving anything to it.</p>

<p>For now I am OK with just blocking and watching traffic, and get some info out there. I also leave my modem unplugged when I&#39;m not using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another tool you may find useful is something like deep freeze. It allows temporary changes to a system for the current session but reverts to the original state after logout. It&#39;s also available on Linux. Using that, on the os on the metal then on the VM would increase your protection if you need a persistent environment. If you don&#39;t need a persistent environment then running the latest tails on a non rewritable CD or DVD offers the best protection from all but micro code attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So best of all worlds would be accessing a non-RW CD on a VM running on an OS (never enabling autoplay) with Deep Freeze, with the OS drive never being C: after getting a new router, maintaining my block list, and reformatting my PC after wiping the master boot record. And also not installing any OS that is TCP enabled. They don&#39;t make it easy do they.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another Avenue to pursue is compartmentalizing your network. Eg</p>

<p>If you need a persistent environment for work or gaming you could dedicate a PC to that, with a modified block list that only allows the services you can&#39;t live without when you&#39;re using them.  </p>

<p>Then a more restricted PC for all other uses that don&#39;t require compromised connections. </p>

<p>The same can be said of wireless networks that should be restricted from your secure network if it&#39;s impossible to dedicate a line to them. </p>

<p>TrendMicro, OK that sounds familiar. Apparently it&#39;s a multinational security company based out of Japan. Very interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To elaborate on this, the connection is trying to use port 443 which is Trivial File Transfer Protocol, and it was originating from my ISP provided IP address to that IP address, not from my internal IP address which tells me that it was likely my cable modem actually doing this, not my router.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s possible maybe my router was never compromised, but rather my cable modem, which is in fact new.</p>

<p>Furthermore TrendMicro provides security for cloud hosting services such as, guess who, AmazonAWS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge amount of data (can be too much to process heavily or store) yet they don&#39;t get all of it. It&#39;s still plenty. It&#39;s a complicated subject and while I&#39;m aware of their mystery boxes (taps) I can only speculate on the metrics including coverage, collection, storage capacity, retention, filtering, processing capacity, selection, etc. Where possible you might want to rely on external retention instead and having access when you need it with live monitoring helping to steer you towards what to requisition. It&#39;s not simple. There are hundreds of things to consider.</p>

<p>It depends on the VPN connection. In theory an onion network should be best and/or mesh network.</p>

<p>You can actually gleam a fair amount from encrypted traffic from a log of packet sizes and timestamps alone and basic statistical analysis although it&#39;s not likely they would be looking at you or put in the effort.</p>

<p>Your last remark about not likely being looked at is where I am kind of going with this. If anyone were being looked at deliberately, there is practically no way to be secure on the Internet. But if I can block the automated systems, that&#39;s a win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just encryption/SSL tends to do that if they don&#39;t have the immediate keys especially. Even when they can exploit it or even have the private keys it isn&#39;t cheap. Automated systems already have difficulty even if nothing were encrypted. These agents have for a very long time had very good systems merely for analysing who talks to who without having the content. Graph theory.</p>

<p>Onion networks with enough nodes and users are close to impossible to crack. The problem is the latency is really high as well. It&#39;s really wasteful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive me but the lack of technical understanding in your post is pretty staggering, I am not sure where to begin.</p>

<p>Rather than savage it piece-by-piece I think it would be better for me to say that not a single thing you’ve done has increased your security or privacy. All you’ve done is made yourself paranoid, wasted your time, and inconvenienced your internet experience. It might have been worth it had you achieved a false sense of security, but if you’re going to continue looking through router logs then you haven’t succeeded at that.</p>

<p>You can harden your usual OS and internet access methods, but not in the manner you describe. There are a load of options and considerations depending on you needs.</p>

<p>However, if you care this much then you would probably be better of with an OS like Tails and/or accessing the internet using Tor. But remember that you can still expose/deanonymise yourself through your own actions.</p>

<p>The main culprit was the site of map2.hwcdn.com which is owned by Highwinds Content Delivery Network - another one of those companies responsible for publishing &quot;The Internet&quot;, and is apparently owned by Akamai. Full circle now. Coincidence?</p>

<p>Highwinds is owned by stackpath which friends of mine work for and I have second level links with the owner of. Definitely not Akamai. Definitely not the NSA or any other TLA. FWIW Akamai isn&#39;t a TLA either but I&#39;m on this train of thought..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Going a step further, Highwinds is based out of Phoenix, Arizona. Ever heard about those massive data centers in the AZ desert having to do with Echelon? I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s these guys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tinfoil hat. Our company has a DC parked right next to the NSA&#39;s in Utah and we&#39;re still not the NSA. These DCs you can walk around if you have space there. I have walked around these DC&#39;s myself. They might have a back room but they&#39;re not full fledged intel centres and you&#39;d be nuts to assume they are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I suspect this is a means of certificate hijack for compromising operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is <em>not</em> how PKI works. You want OCSP results delivered by a reliable vendor in reasonable wall time. OCSP cannot hijack your cert chains in that manner, it only lists revocations.</p>

<p>If you think this is scary go look at your browser&#39;s root cert store. You&#39;ll piss yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can only hope that only allowing connections to valid sites going forward will do the trick. There&#39;s not much else I can do besides reformat everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just use a text based browser if you&#39;re this paranoid. You&#39;ll still probably need connections to akamai and cert revocation lists but you&#39;ll be much more secure. Course your UX will be dog turd but using a full-featured browser isn&#39;t compatible with the way you think the internet works.</p>

<p>The site itself stated that they can be incorrect, and they are.</p>

<p>The same site also states that hwng.net is owned by feedingbrooklynpotatoes.com and it plainly isn&#39;t. By the site&#39;s own (incorrect) logic it&#39;s owned by akamai so..</p>

<p>The correct answer to the question is the raw whois information from the whois system itself:</p>

<pre><code>No match for &quot;MAP2.HWCDN.COM&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>The real problem here is the server record doesn&#39;t exist which imho is causing a badly handled feedback loop in their whois logic - I can make any domain look like it&#39;s owned by Akamai by your and that site&#39;s logic. Take for example the site of the <a href="https://myip.ms/info/whois/205.185.216.10/k/607329078/website/thisisnonsense.korea-dpr.com">People&#39;s Republic of Korea</a>. Basically the site you linked is broken and makes no effort to handle errors.</p>

<p>The information you&#39;re <em>actually</em> looking for is available from the state of Florida&#39;s <a href="http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;amp;directionType=Initial&amp;amp;searchNameOrder=HIGHWINDSNETWORKGROUP%20P060000556390&amp;amp;aggregateId=domp-p06000055639-9a0303f6-9a52-43ab-a8d9-00d35eb023ee&amp;amp;searchTerm=highwinds&amp;amp;listNameOrder=HIGHWINDS%20L150001832650">website</a>.</p>

<p>Relying on a barely competent third party that&#39;s giving you invalid data to tell you about some conspiracy of lizard people that&#39;s running all the CDN&#39;s on the planet is a bad idea. All this information is available from reliable sources if you go looking. Plus again I know people who know Lance Crosby and I know people who work for HW via industry connections.. I wouldn&#39;t rule out (or in) Akamai buying HWCDN by any stretch but they don&#39;t own it today.</p>

<p>Unlikely. More likely is somebody using their services has. You could report it to HWCDN but I don&#39;t think this is likely either. You&#39;re seeing traffic go to systems they own - that doesn&#39;t really mean your browser is &quot;hijacked&quot; - browsers legitimately do things like update checks, check for phishing attempts and more.</p>

<p>If you block things like CDNs aside from the internet looking fairly crappy at lots of major sites you&#39;ll do things like block cert revocations that are revoked often because they&#39;ve been compromised and block updates and open yourself up to the TLAs you seek to avoid.</p>

<p>There are many complicated interactions with the internet and the best way to stay secure is certainly to reduce your attack surface; but there&#39;s reducing your attack surface and being paranoid. Again as I said before if you really care use a simpler browser and/or a more secure OS.</p>

<p>I wonder if you believe people can buy domains that end in godaddy.com too just because godaddy sells domain names.</p>

<p>Your post is riddled with unfounded speculation.</p>

<p>&quot;Unlikely&quot; - means nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;they can hide&quot; - they can also not hide.</p>

<p>I already know how my browser was compromised, but I&#39;m not interested in entertaining you any longer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of what blocking CDNs does. I&#39;ve been browsing that way for a while now. I can access plenty of other OCSPs that aren&#39;t run by unwanted middlemen.</p>

<p>Just because a corporation may have some bad eggs doesn&#39;t mean everyone is bad. The people you know, you yourself, may all be very well intentioned and goodhearted folk, and I would not be the least bit surprised. However, I have no comfort level with my traffic being intercepted.</p>

<p>I know how to clean my OS. You keep making suggestions that I knew 20 years ago. I don&#39;t care to clean my OS, because I don&#39;t need to. I have successfully and happily isolated my computer from unwanted traffic, and a clean OS isn&#39;t going to make me undo that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selling a service isn&#39;t the same thing as selling a domain name. Every service provider I&#39;ve dealt with has other domains they are willing to let you use their procs on, but not their primary web site.</p>

<p>That would be like getting a domain that ends in godaddy.com because godaddy sells domain names.</p>

<p>I know how my browser was compromised. It was not an overt attack on me personally. It was simply a web site that exploited my browser.</p>

<p>If there is someone intending on monitoring my traffic, they will most likely succeed no matter what I do. That&#39;s not my concern. What I am doing is blocking the bots.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of what blocking CDNs does. I&#39;ve been browsing that way for a while now. I can access plenty of other OCSPs that aren&#39;t run by unwanted middlemen. I did a DNS on every OCSP there is, and only roughly half of them use CDNs.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong though. Just because a corporation may have some bad eggs doesn&#39;t mean everyone is bad. The people you know, you yourself, may all be very well intentioned and goodhearted folk, and I would not be the least bit surprised. However, I have no comfort level with my traffic being intercepted. Intention has nothing to do with it. Heck, the company I work for could be worse, but we all have bills to pay, and there are good people who rely on us. Somebody has to do the work to keep society going.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care to clean my OS, because I don&#39;t need to. I have successfully and happily isolated my computer from unwanted traffic, and a clean OS isn&#39;t going to make me undo that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you.</p>

<p>If I was NSA, Akamai would be one of my first targets that I totally pwnd because of their reach. If you hit the biggest CDN on the Internet, you have access to everyone. Akamai is certainly a PRISM partner. And NSA certainly double crossed them like everyone else, on multiple levels. Feed the Akami Execs a line of bullshit about them helping the mission. Then pay them hundreds of millions per year in off the books revenue for their cooperation. Then infiltrate them with CORE SECRETS moles to collect it all. Then hack their asses once you&#39;re inside just to make sure they don&#39;t wiggle out of complying with PRISM.</p>

<p>The only web browser I can recommend that is more NSA-proof than anything else is this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium</a></p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t plan to use it, at least read its README to see how many dozens of ways Chrome phones home to Google. That project tries to remove every trace of Google. I was stunned when I saw all of the ways that Google spies on us. Do not trust Chrome for shit. The whole thing is one giant spyware virus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, every other browser is worse. Including Firefox. Maybe the spooks actively make the web suck and help the monopolists at Google and Apple and Microsoft by bloating it up so that no indies can even make a web browser, because a web browser is too perfect of a spy weapon.</p>

<p>The ungoogled-chromium is extremely hard to compile yourself. Thanks to Google over-engineering by design.
It will take even skilled programmers a week just to figure out how to build it.</p>

<p>But if you really care about being NSA-proof, that is your best bet until something better comes along.</p>
