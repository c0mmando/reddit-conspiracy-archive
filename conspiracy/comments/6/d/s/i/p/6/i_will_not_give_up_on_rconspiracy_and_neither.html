    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your candid attitude but honestly I do not see it as levity but as a cry out for my people, all peoples, as we are all the same in flesh and blood, to rally as many as we can rally, to see that no matter what conspiracy or belief or religious affiliation, we are all in the same struggle together. We have, for too long, been divided by race, creed, color, religion, and arbitrary lines and localized propoganda to see what we have always dreamed of. We, the people, are what has made TPTB what they are, and we have allowed them to make us what we have become, by our own volition (sp?l) and by their deception. It is only a recent development and ability that we have found each other, across all these boundaries, and I cry out for us to find ourselves, outside of their boundaries, so that regardless of beliefs we know that we CAN, AND SHOULD, rely on each other to overcome what has held us down and apart from each other.</p>

That is why we are here, that is why we support each other and that is what will help us to be triumphant.

<p>I do not try to discriminate against what we can or cannot prove or disprove, I am simply trying to bring us together as a force to spread WHAT WE DO KNOW OR WHAT WE QUESTION, and to make others question what we have uncovered. To each his own, but also, </p>
