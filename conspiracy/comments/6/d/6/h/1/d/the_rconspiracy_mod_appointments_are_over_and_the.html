        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">83</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/magnora7.html">magnora7</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you look at the original thread, it now shows the voting results: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a7o4m/we_require_more_moderators/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a7o4m/we_require_more_moderators/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Then a few days later they announced the results:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cf2i0/announcement_new_moderators_and_the_future_of/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cf2i0/announcement_new_moderators_and_the_future_of/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Which included this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the interest of transparency, we selected the top ten upvoted users in the thread, and then we each submitted ballots based on the <a href="https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote#meek-stv">Meek Single Transferable Vote Method</a>, resulting in the four chosen moderators. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they let the users vote, then they included the top 10 instead of just the top 6 or so, and then voted within the moderators and ranked it that way, basically overwriting the desires of the userbase. Someone who was 10th ended up becoming a mod. 63+ people voted for <a href="/u/Orangutan">/u/Orangutan</a>, and 35+ people voted for me (and was independently nominated at least 5 times). Yet they ended up choosing someone who had only +8, and was actually nominated by an existing mod. </p>

<p>I am also surprised that four mods were appointed, and none of them were what the community chose as the top options. Amos_Quito was about 4th in the nomination vote ranking, ShellOilNigeria was 6th or so, Mastiga was about 7th, and JUSTIN_HERGINA was about 10th, and was the one nominated by an existing mod, CelineHagbard (who seems like an decent person, honestly). I am happy to see Amos_Quito [+33 on RES for me, and has always seemed like a great person to me] and Mastiga [+18 on my RES] get put in to mod positions. I don&#39;t know much about the other two, but I can&#39;t say I have a great feeling. But perhaps they will prove me wrong.  Celine sent me this message after I lost:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hey magnora,</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if any of the other mods sent you a note on this, but we&#39;ve invited 4 new mods and unfortunately you did not make the cut this time. No one vetoed you, but you did not end up with a spot in the Meek STV election we held. For the record, I did have you in the top 4 on my ballot, and think you would have made a good mod.</p>

<p>You may still be considered for a position in the future, and I&#39;d just like you to know that I personally very much enjoy your posts and commentary, and find you to be a valuable member of this community as well as CST. Sorry I do not have better news for you.</p>

<p>If you want any more follow up on this, feel free to PM or contact <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> via modmail.</p>

<p>Celine Hagbard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JUSTIN_HERGINA was also upvoted and approved by interesting users as you can see in this sub thread: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a7o4m/we_require_more_moderators/dhcd175/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6a7o4m/we_require_more_moderators/dhcd175/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I just find it interesting, is all. I wanted to document it for everyone to see the process that led to our new moderators, since I was so involved with it. </p>

<p>Honestly, there was already drama with another user throwing a fit because they didn&#39;t get modded and it just proves they didn&#39;t deserve the spot.</p>

<p>I am not saying you wouldn&#39;t make a good mod or not, I hardly know ya, but I&#39;m saying getting modded is not a right, it&#39;s a group thing. The people might have had a vote, but the mods decided against it, not much we can do about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that is how it currently works. I&#39;m saying that perhaps if many users think some certain moderators are the source of the decay of the subreddit, then perhaps this method of selection where the moderators get the final say isn&#39;t the most sensible. </p>

<p>They could&#39;ve chosen the top 6, instead of the top 10. I&#39;m not saying they had to choose the top 4, but something a little more democratic would seem sensible, especially in a sub like this. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just my opinion, as is the OP. Nothing more. </p>

<p>We are dealing with a complete transformation on this sub and the scope of it isn&#39;t even something we can calculate presently. Saying it&#39;s better now is not a statement I can agree with.

    <div class="md"><p>There are many stated reasons for why things were done the way they were,  but honestly it&#39;s hard to be sure what the actual reason is because the top 10 selection followed by the voting system used seems rather arbitrary and post-hoc from where I&#39;m sitting. </p>

<p>Of course I may be mistaken and everyone on the mod team may have pure motives and aren&#39;t misguided at all, but I&#39;ve seen enough subreddits fall through moderator appointments at this point that it seems prudent to ask questions about the process in the subs I care about.

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize; I offered unsolicited advice, for sure :) Didn&#39;t mean to let it turn into an argument, and tried to stop it from getting there. </p>

<p>For something so inherently intangible and therefore non-debatable as a comment about my perception of your emotional state as compared to the person you were going at, perhaps it would be best to just be open to the idea; see if it holds true? I knew it was going to be a touchy subject, but I also saw it as an opportunity to jar you in a way that I believe you need to be jarred, and I tried to keep both in mind when I was deciding on how best to say it. Like totally honestly, no offense intended; looking out for you as a human in a golden rule kind of way :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m arguing.  People had questions about the process, the questions were answered.  I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a touchy subject for me anyways.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any emotions invested in this conversation and I certainly don&#39;t feel jarred or disturbed by your line of questioning.  </p>

<p>To recap the events that are pertinent to the OP, the users nominated and voted for fellow users they feel would be good mods.  That process alone is easily exploitable by any number of special interest groups who might organize an effort to vote their own into a mod position.  We limit that effect by allowing existing mods to veto any nomination.  All existing mods excluding illuminatedwax (the creator of Conspiracy) were voted into their position in the years past.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a perfect system but it&#39;s better than some subs which have clearly been infiltrated and taken over by some odd groups who have seriously altered the organic curation of Reddit.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect everyone to understand or agree with the methods we utilized for mod selection but it has worked for us for years with very few problems.</p>

<p>As far our the two of us and our interactions here... I really have no idea what purpose trying to jar someone serves but you set out to try and I hope it satisfied you inclination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I would like to say I personally have no problem with you posting this. I didn&#39;t get back to your PM—though I planned to—but I wish you had given me a chance or gone through modmail first. If our answers had been unsatisfactory to you, I would have vigorously defended your right to make this post.</p>

<p>Second, I wish you would have asked my permission to share my PM. I likely would have said yes, but when I PM a user, I expect that to be in confidence unless otherwise stated. I know I&#39;m assured of no such privacy, but it&#39;s a courtesy I extend to other and do expect in return.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That out of the way, I think you have some valid concerns that do need to be addressed. In your reply to Fly you said this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would&#39;ve been better if that was stated in the nomination thread, instead of just &quot;All final decisions and selections are at the current teams discretion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree. In hindsight, this should have been made more clear. Simple upvotes/downvotes were too rife for manipulation in an open sub like this, especially with our own hate-club subs and other parties who would like to infiltrate or otherwise disrupt this sub. The mod team agreed before this selection of new mods that we would each have veto power. We could have communicated this to the sub more clearly, and probably should have. </p>

<p>After the veto process, we were left with a number of candidates in the top ten greater than the number of seats we decided to fill. I proposed that we submit questions to these candidates, and then vote by STV to fill the seats. That would ensure no faction of the current mod team could dominate the new seats; it better guaranteed proportionality. This proposal was accepted by majority vote. </p>

<p>In hindsight, this should have been made more clear. Simple upvotes/downvotes were too rife for manipulation in an open sub like this, especially with our own hate-club subs and other parties who would like to infiltrate or otherwise disrupt this sub. The mod team agreed before this selection of new mods that we would each have veto power. We could have communicated this to the sub more clearly, and probably should have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most jarring experience I&#39;ve had here in regards to mods was once, back when shills were first starting to show up and there weren&#39;t all these rules to protect them, there were some good conversations about what we could do to prevent them, as we assumed the mod team would be on our side. I was a part of one of those conversations, and a mod I can&#39;t mention said that shills have just as much of a right to be here as any other user; that they&#39;re just making use of the service that&#39;s offered by Reddit and as such are seen as welcomed by the mod team themselves. Shook me to my core more than anything else that&#39;s happened so far, just because of the shear reach of (((their))) tendrils; how they could take over a sub that was like this one used to be, do it so easily, and then just openly talk about it as if it were par for the course.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>The following is my own personal perspective.</em></strong></p>

<p>Let me start by saying that there are two kinds of &quot;Shills&quot;: Persons that are PAID AGENTS hired for the specific purpose of influencing public opinion, and &quot;<strong><em>ideological shills</em></strong>&quot;, &quot;true believers&quot; that hold strong political (or other) opinions and feel driven to push whatever agenda they have embraced. (These are not &quot;True Shills&quot;, but they are often ACCUSED of &quot;shilling&quot;).</p>

<p>IMO, the latter exponentially outnumber the former (though the gap seems to be narrowing). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a regular on this sub for 4 years, and a mod for <em>8 whole days</em>, and I can tell you that if there is one thing everyone agrees on, it is that &quot;shills&quot; are a PAIN IN THE ASS - they are cluttering and derailing sub, and create a hell of a headache for the mods with their vote brigading and clogging the sub with crap...</p>

<p>And believe me, we hear about it <strong><em>constantly</em></strong>, especially in the realm of politics: Dems accuse us of allowing Teh_Dnoald &quot;shills&quot; to overrun the sub, while Repubs accuse us of allowing CTR and ShareBlue &quot;shills&quot; to run wild. </p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s a fucking circus</strong>, and there is nothing we would like better than to mute the noise... The question is, HOW??? How can we effectively silence the &quot;shills&quot; without DESTROYING the open platform for FREE SPEECH that makes this sub unique and precious?</p>

<p>How does one differentiated between TRUE &quot;shills&quot; and sincere persons who hold strong opinions? </p>

<p>So, to revisit your question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Those are the factors leading me to ask if shills are seen as allowable, in a general way, by the current mod team as well. Do you think that shills are allowed in a general way by the mod team?</em>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. HELL NO. They&#39;re like fucking termites, and there is no way that I can see to eliminate them without burning down the house.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Concerning your usage of the word *shill, though: </p>

<p>I am of the opinion that while language does evolve and should evolve, we should, in this case, stick to the etymologically sound definition of <a href="http://www.learnersdictionary.com/definition/shill"><em>shill</em></a> considering that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68u00v/reminder_google_changed_the_definition_of_fascism/">there is political value</a> to be had in forcing an inorganic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change">semantic change</a>, in this case, from one of &quot;one who is paid to say things&quot; to &quot;someone who says things about things they learned from someone who gets paid to say things&quot;. One is very evil while the other is simply and sadly gullible, and as such, they do deserve a bit of distinction.</p>

<p>If you have the time and interest, I would love discuss how we might take positive steps in identifying and taking action against shills while staying to the true definition of the word shill. After all, you do not want to silence those who were simply fooled but are still sincere; they are able to be persuaded easily anyhow: We want to silence those whose pay-check depends on only saying certain things regardless of truth or personal belief. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t ask you to do that, but if it&#39;s something you are truly interested in, I am as well. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;to talk about or describe someone or something in a favorable way</em> <strong><em>because you are being paid</em></strong> <em>to do it&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I take issue with Webster&#39;s definition. IMO, it would be better stated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&quot;to promote (or undermine) a person, political position, or ideological perspective</em> <strong><em>under the belief</em></strong> <em>that doing so will</em> <strong><em>substantially benefit</em></strong> <em>the shill, whether through monetary compensation, or by advancing the individual interests of the shill, or they group with which he identifies&quot;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Webster&#39;s definition is far too limiting. There are motivations that go far beyond immediate tangible monetary compensation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in this sub 4 years, but I have been engaging/debating &quot;shills&quot; (as described above) online for over 20 years - since the days when USENET was the primary forum for such discourse, and MOST of these have been &quot;volunteers&quot; - people &quot;shilling&quot; <em>(or bootlicking)</em> NOT NECESSARILY because they received monetary remuneration, but because they felt that doing so would serve them, whether directly or indirectly, by promoting the political/ideological agenda of the group(s) with which they identify. </p>

<p>These ideologues are far more insidious than simple paid lackeys. You can teach a $0.50 per-hour Pacific Islander to upvote, downvote as instructed, or to copy-paste snide comments, but effectively applying the &quot;art&quot; of derailing a conversation via <em>squirm, squeal, dodge, obfuscate and subterfuge</em> requires <strong>experience</strong>, and at least a BASIC understanding of history, and the issues being discussed.</p>

<p>It is these &quot;artists&quot; - the &quot;adepts&quot; that are at the root of the &quot;shilling&quot;. It is they who recruit and pay the ignorant idiot lackeys to parrot and vote, and/or create bots that do the grunt work via automation.</p>

<p>In their minds, <strong>the Propaganda war IS WAR</strong>, and they have every intent of winning. The major advantage that they hold is that <strong><em>most</em></strong> people - <em>the peons, the work-a-day rabble</em> - are blissfully unaware that they are under an incessant deluge of Propaganda Attack, neither are they cognizant of the highly refined psychological SCIENCE that has been honed over decades to create maximum effect by subtly appealing to the primitive, impulsive aspects of our consciousness that make us most vulnerable.</p>

<p>The perspective of &quot;reality&quot; in the minds of most folks is shaped <strong><em>not</em></strong> by logic or reasoned contemplation, but by cleverly orchestrated headlines and soundbites - because most of us DO NOT have the LUXURY of devoting the time AND attention required to go beyond that. We&#39;re too busy just trying to maintain a survivable environment for ourselves and our families. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Is it possible that this condition of perpetual &quot;quiet desperation&quot; did not occur spontaneously??? Hmmm...</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Under this paradigm, appeals to reason and logic tend to <strong>fail</strong>, whereas campaigns that trigger reflexive emotions <em>(or other base instincts)</em> tend to <strong>succeed</strong>. The direction taken in the evolution of the <strong><em>advertising industry</em></strong> has made this all abundantly clear - at least for the few who care to look.</p>

<p><strong>Resolved:</strong> Consumerism is grounded neither in appeal to logic nor &quot;reason&quot;, so it should follow that the success <em>(or failure)</em> of political/ ideological campaigns should follow similar reactionary channels within the Human Psyche, <strong><em>no?</em></strong></p>

<p>Sadly, the cold answer is <strong><em>YES</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Sadder still is the FACT that I, <strong><em>personally</em></strong>, find myself unable to stoop to that level of conniving and skulduggery. My personal repugnance for dishonesty, trickery and hypocrisy is overwhelming, inspiring a self-limiting GAG reflex.</p>

<p>Alas, this cold realization tends to refute the platitude that <em>&quot;Honesty is the best policy&quot;</em>; for while embracing honesty might provide <em>some</em> comfort as I reflect on my life as I take my final breaths, it is certain to be challenged by the knowledge that the unscrupulous - <strong><em>the liars, cheaters and scalawags</em></strong> - emerged VICTORIOUS because they were WILLING to recognize <strong><em>and EXPLOIT</em></strong> those base instincts and emotions that I, <em>in my consciousness of character</em>, willfully shunned.</p>

<p>So then, who is the <em>&quot;wise man&quot;</em>, and who is the <em>&quot;fool&quot;</em>? Will we be judged by &quot;History&quot;? <strong><em>History as written by WHO???</em></strong> By the &quot;winners&quot;, according to their narrative, of course... as it always has been, and ever shall be, apparently.</p>

<p>But in the Grand Scheme, whether one ideology prevails over another is IRRELEVANT, is it not???</p>

<p>As it stands, we humans., <em>AS A SPECIES</em>, are THE most advanced specimen of <strong>Consciousness</strong> that exists - at least from the perspective of OUR common knowledge. As such, it is incumbent UPON US, <em>as a species</em>, to ADVANCE the enigmatic interests of Consciousness to a higher level in its evolution.</p>

<p>Failing that, I suppose that we, <em>as a species</em> shall, willingly or unwillingly, step aside, allowing  some other &quot;cousin&quot; in our mutual heritage of life&#39;s evolution to have a go, perhaps succeeding where we, in the frailty of our base character, have faltered.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time. That much is certain.</p>

<p>But hey, LOL!</p>

<p>Usually I drink beer - but tonight I&#39;m drinking WINE. So take my rambling philosophical musings with a <strong>GRAPE of salt</strong>, heh heh!</p>

<p>Back to the topic at hand, if you have suggestions on how we can improve the quality of this Sub without compromising integrity, I am ALL EARS, and I am confident that others would agree.</p>

<p><strong>Happy Memorial Day!</strong></p>

<p>I find myself in a similar situation regularly, and given how regularly language is subverted, this is why I make it a point to be so etymologically rigorous. But, in your expanded definition, it would contain those who know they are lying but exclude those who simply have been mislead, yes? I feel that a clear line must be drawn to avoid conflating those with political opinions with those who have an active hand in knowingly propagandizing for personal gain, you know?</p>

<p>Good god, though. 20 years of shilling experience? Fuck. </p>

<p>Hey do me a solid real quick and say if you think we agree on the definition of shill based on the last paragraph. So long as your definition doesn&#39;t contain those who have fallen victim to shill&#39;s persuasions, and that the shill knows they are promoting an agenda for personal gain regardless of its truth, then I am ok with it, but right now, everything I wanna say about your other stuff is hung up on it.</p>

<p>Of course, but you&#39;d be surprised at how many know they are lying, and deliberately work so spread misinformation and derail discussions. They&#39;re easy enough to spot, as they continue to maliciously lie even after being patiently corrected.</p>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s not so bad. The experience has been very educational. They lie or mislead, that inspires me to do research, and I often find fascinating information that I otherwise would never have known.</p>

<p>So strangely, the ideological &quot;shills&quot; have unwittingly been some of my best teachers, lol!</p>

<p>Of course, most people are not &quot;sinister&quot;, they have just been mislead, and repeat what they have been told - often by those who are <em>intentionally</em> spinning lies, obfuscations and &quot;revisionist&quot; history - but I emphasize that the latter are not <em>necessarily</em> being &quot;paid&quot;, they often do so to promote perceived group interests.</p>

<p>The innocents can, through patient persuasion, often be enlightened. The agenda driven &quot;shills&quot; will only double-down and dig in deeper, and they are far more insidious than anyone who &quot;shills&quot; for pay. After all, who do you think is PAYING them?</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure you get role-players trying to defame the other side. Probably makes it tricky. What singular quality separates a genuine user from a shill that could be found through writing and post habits alone?

<p>Do you think we&#39;re shilled equally by both &quot;sides&quot;? I hate to pick them, but I can see them, and from your perspective you&#39;d be able to see much farther than I can, so if you had to decide, which party seeks to influence us the most, would you say?

<p>I watch the rules change week by week in this sub, both in their wording and how they&#39;re applied, and I see particular members of the mod team writing about how they&#39;re really turning a corner and how they&#39;re really making <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> into what they want it to be, yet they never, ever, ever, respond to the line of thought &quot;do you think that maybe we should let the sub be what <em>it</em> wants to be before we place our own personal judgments as to what it <em>should</em> be then require everyone else to abide by our definition?&quot;.. One thing I&#39;ve learned is that the spirit that the people who we are talking about tend to operate through does <em>not</em> like to be seen, and will create all sorts of rules that amount to &quot;cannot say true things about me or ask the good questions because fuck you&quot;. </p>

<p>Through it all, though, the question that arises in my mind time and again, the thing that I just can&#39;t understand, is whether or not they know they&#39;re evil.

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Do people not understand that the voting system is the cleanest and best form of moderation? Anything and everything should be allowed, the community will decide what is worthy and what is not. The only thing mods should be doing is shutting down vote manipulation and obnoxious bot accounts.</p>

<p>Where do the rules end?</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that removing comments is blatant censorship. </p>

<p>To add to my rant, rule 10 is pathetic. It suggests that users do not have anonymity nor the ability to make a new account. If somebody posts a users personal information then by all means remove that comment and ban that user, but to issue a ban because one user attacked another is a god dam joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, basically, it&#39;s not hard to get into the top ten. We just did not have that many votes. In fact, if I had simply logged into old accounts and voted, I could have been in the top ten. </p>

<p>So they picked from the top ten and made anyone from that list a mod. </p>

<p>That&#39;s sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say we re-vote. No mod vetoes (mods didn&#39;t announce this last time, you lost our trust) either. Also re-voting on what the subs rules are would be beneficial to the sub too (but we know the mods definitely won&#39;t allow that)</p>

There&#39;s being humble, but requiring his accepting that that is just what happens is kind of too much.

<p>That might seem dismissive, but an argument presented without evidence can justly be countered with a lack of evidence. I&#39;m sure you would agree that that is fair. </p>

<p>Problem is cleaning the sub of trash without harming innocent users or squelching their freedom to hold and share their opinions.</p>

<p>If you think this is not an issue that we are concerned about, check out the sticky on the top of the main page right now.</p>

<p>And then there is the matter of <strong><em>&quot;whodunnit?&quot;</em></strong> We get role-playing trolls in here looking to defame the sub or otherwise stir up shit ALL THE TIME. </p>
