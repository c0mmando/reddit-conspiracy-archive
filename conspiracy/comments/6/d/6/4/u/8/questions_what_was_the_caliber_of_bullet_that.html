<p>We can play this game all day. Sometimes they give a lot of detail sometimes they just say what and where and ask for any info.</p>

<p>In my opinion there is a suspicious absence of detail offered by authorities in Seth&#39;s case. It could be because they have almost zero evidence to share, but it feels like they don&#39;t really care to solve the case. If there&#39;s even a chance Seth was leaker I&#39;d expect pressure would be applied to keep the DC police disinterested in solving it. DC is in the unique position of literally being controlled by Congress so I can&#39;t anything out.</p>

<p>&quot;The LAST thing you want is the public to look for information!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No shell casings? CLEARLY AN AMATEUR. Professionals ALWAYS leave shell casings!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Should his Employer undergoing a fraud lawsuit lead the murder investigation? ABSO - FUCKING - LUTELY. You can&#39;t turn down such generous charity!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And whatever you do, DON&#39;T SPEAK WITH THE PUBLIC. We got OUR MAN that will speak for you. Capish, pizano?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lastly, this is about protecting his reputation. Do you want Seth to die a dirty little whistleblower, or a gun regulation champion for the DNC? Don&#39;t honor HIS life, honor what you wish he was.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I track 600 local tv stations on twitter (via a list I made) and 75 newspapers from around the world (Different list for the UK) and that is growing. </p>

<p>And I read a lot of crime stories. They vary all the time based on the police department. I have reached out to some in the past with FOIA when I wanted more details (usually though the best thing to do is just send them an email or call them up, they have departments to deal with requests from the public/media).</p>

<p>Try contacting the DC police:</p>

<p>Here is their unsolved murders of 2016:

<p>The info to contact the detectives is on the flier. You can start there to get the information you seek, I am sure they have an email address as well (can find it if you like).</p>

<p>Approach it as they are seeking assistance, you want to offer some, strike up dialog with them (I would suggest not calling them and saying you want to prove hillary shot him and such, make an inquiry).</p>

<p>I work with a radio station and am not opposed to asking them questions myself if you get nowhere.</p>

<p>They help local media re-enact crimes to be broadcast. They have a committee they work with which helps with that and raising funds.</p>

<p>Get people interested in solving this crime to contact the committee about a re-enactment of it for local broadcast and to raise money directly for a reward (vs someone like oann saying they are offering an award publicly which benefits themselves mostly).</p>
