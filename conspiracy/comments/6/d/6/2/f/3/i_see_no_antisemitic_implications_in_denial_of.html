    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Let me add a final remark about Faurisson’s alleged “anti-Semitism.” Note first that even if Faurisson were to be a rabid anti-Semite and fanatic pro-Nazi — such charges have been presented to me in private correspondence that it would be improper to cite in detail here — this would have no bearing whatsoever on the legitimacy of the defense of his civil rights. On the contrary, it would make it all the more imperative to defend them since, once again, it has been a truism for years, indeed centuries, that it is precisely in the case of horrendous ideas that the right of free expression must be most vigorously defended; it is easy enough to defend free expression for those who require no such defense. Putting this central issue aside, is it true that Faurisson is an anti-Semite or a neo-Nazi? As noted earlier, I do not know his work very well. But from what I have read — largely as a result of the nature of the attacks on him — <em>I find no evidence to support either conclusion.</em>&quot;    </p>

<p>Italics mine.  From the last link.  That is an article that Chomsky himself wrote.  Faurisson wrote a book on Holocaust denial and Chomsky is saying he sees no evidence that he is an anti-semite.   </p>

<p>The quote in the title is from correspondence between Chomsky and the author of the article that wrote the second link.  Sorry, you&#39;ll have to read the article as the pages aren&#39;t numbered.</p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about?  It&#39;s a Noam Chomsky quote.  There is nothing dishonest going on here, and I don&#39;t know what mental gymnastics you had to go through to make it seem that way.   </p>

<p>How on Earth could you possibly know what percentage of Holocaust questioning is based on anti-semitism.  It&#39;s just wild conjecture on your part based entirely on stereotypes you have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chomsky, &quot; Even to enter into an arena of debate whether the Nazi&#39;s carried out such atrocities, it is already to loose one&#39;s own humanity. So I don&#39;t think people aught to even discuss the issue - If you want to know my opinion! But if anybody wants to refute Faurisson there is certainly no difficulty in doing so.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/H7VKQQCw_oc?t=9m39s">https://youtu.be/H7VKQQCw_oc?t=9m39s</a></p>

<p>The claim is pure bulshit. Faurisson was taken to court. A petition of academics was signed protesting, and affirming his right to free speech.  Chomsky was signed to pen a statement on free speech. He wrote it, and later it was included in a book which is a collection of arguments Faurisson gave in court. </p>

<p>Now the issue is really this one:</p>

<p>If one denies the gas chambers, or a plan of extermination then one is a Nazi, and an anti-Semite. </p>

<p>Meaning is it possible to question these things purely on historical grounds?</p>

<p>Watch the whole video, it provides a lot more context. </p>

<p>Chomsky is just as controlled, just as brainwashed, just as cowed, as everybody else, with the exceptions of a few brave individuals such as Faurisson.</p>
