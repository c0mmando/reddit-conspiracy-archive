But war has changed forever. Israel has little value anymore and sending massive amounts of military support their way just angers the rest of the middle east. Israel benefits far more from this relationship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s almost as dumb as Flat Earth. </p>

<p>There is a minimum yield for any nuclear device. There is a critical mass to volume ratio that has to be achieved in order to get a true nuclear detonation. Nukes are so powerful because some of the mass is converted directly into energy. </p>

<p>&quot;The yield equivalent was between 10 and 20 tons of TNT; considered to be the smallest practical size for a fission warhead.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point is irrelevant. The demolition devices were approximately 150kT -- that&#39;s equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. They were deployed subterranean, 77m underneath each building - and each blasted about a 100m crater in very hard rock (&quot;Manhattan schist&quot; &amp; granite).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.  And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.  <strong>I will bless those who bless you, and him who curses you I will curse; and by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.”</strong></p>

<p>When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel encamping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him,  and he took up his discourse, and said,</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“The oracle of Balaam the son of Be′or,
    the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,</p>

<p>the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
    who sees the vision of the Almighty,
    falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:</p>

<p>How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
    your encampments, O Israel!</p>

<p>Like valleys that stretch afar,
    like gardens beside a river,
like aloes that the Lord has planted,
    like cedar trees beside the waters.</p>

<p>Water shall flow from his buckets,
    and his seed shall be in many waters,
his king shall be higher than Agag,
    and his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>

<p>God brings him out of Egypt;
    he has as it were the horns of the wild ox,
he shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
    and shall break their bones in pieces,
    and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>

<p>He couched, he lay down like a lion,
    and like a lioness; who will rouse him up?
<strong>Blessed be every one who blesses you,
    and cursed be every one who curses you.”</strong></p>

<p>Even if I could accept that such a large explosion happened and didn&#39;t cause a proportional earthquake it&#39;s still stupid. </p>
