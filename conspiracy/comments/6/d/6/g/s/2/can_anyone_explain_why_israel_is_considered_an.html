       I maintain that Israel is far from an ally, and our "special relationship" is an absolute fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       A second question is, why do we allow dual citizens in positions of power in this country?

       Wholly unrelated? I thought Israel and Judaism were somewhat related.

       I worry about Israel's nukes and lawlessness. Not much, because I've lived a pretty 50+ years so far, and am generally prepared to meet my maker.

       It's fucked. No argument here. But that's the strategy... to cause disruption in the ME so that no one single power can control the region. Why else do you think we fucks with SA and Turkey? Because we're scared Iran will dominate if we don't

       I went to Israel for a conference years ago.  It was so weird being in Jerusalem as an American.  They definitely have a pipeline of American Jews returning to the "homeland".  A lot of Israelis assumed I must know Hebrew because I was American.

       My understanding is that when Israel was formed in the post WWII era the allies wanted a beachhead in the middle east. Israel was a good way to ensure that. But war has changed forever. Israel has little value anymore and sending massive amounts of military support their way just angers the rest of the middle east. Israel benefits far more from this relationship.

       There is a minimum yield for any nuclear device. There is a critical mass to volume ratio that has to be achieved in order to get a true nuclear detonation. Nukes are so powerful because some of the mass is converted directly into energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The yield equivalent was between 10 and 20 tons of TNT; considered to be the smallest practical size for a fission warhead."

       Your point is irrelevant. The demolition devices were approximately 150kT -- that's equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. They were deployed subterranean, 77m underneath each building - and each blasted about a 100m crater in very hard rock ("Manhattan schist" &amp; granite).

       Apparently you're just not grasping the energy release you're talking about. You clearly said that this bomb only 200 feet below the incredibly hard New York bedrock was larger than either of the bombs used in WWII.

       Yes the bedrock is tough below Manhattan but it is sold rock. All that energy has to go somewhere.

       Again, energy isn't going to be contained by a little bit of rock. Even if it is as tough a Manhattan bedrock.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did they get the bomb down there? If there was a tunnel all that energy would have had a easier path to dissipate into.

       You didn't answer whether you were a Flat Earther as well. Seems to me that such crazy unsupported ideas are kinda your thing.

       Obviously, there is a discrepancy somewhere. Seems pretty obvious to me that a nuclear bomb didn't go off in Manhattan. Just curious about how someone might believe such bullshit.

       Seems to me that it's quite possible that those who are promoting such bullshit don't even believe it themselves. They may be just trying to get someone to believe it. That might bring them jollies....

       Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you.  And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
       <strong>

       When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not go, as at other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.  And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel encamping tribe by tribe. And the Spirit of God came upon him,  and he took up his discourse, and said,
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       “The oracle of Balaam the son of Be′or,
    the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
      </p>
      <p>
       the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
    who sees the vision of the Almighty,
    falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:
      </p>
      <p>
       How fair are your tents, O Jacob,
    your encampments, O Israel!

    like gardens beside a river,
like aloes that the Lord has planted,
    like cedar trees beside the waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water shall flow from his buckets,
    and his seed shall be in many waters,
his king shall be higher than Agag,
    and his kingdom shall be exalted.
      </p>
      <p>
       God brings him out of Egypt;
    he has as it were the horns of the wild ox,
he shall eat up the nations his adversaries,
    and shall break their bones in pieces,
    and pierce them through with his arrows.
      </p>
      <p>
       He couched, he lay down like a lion,
    and like a lioness; who will rouse him up?
