    <div class="md"><p>The content of the petition of these concerned Smiths:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet is smothering innovation, damaging the American economy and obstructing job creation. I urge the Federal Communications Commission to end the bureaucratic regulatory overreach of the internet known as Title II and restore the bipartisan light-touch regulatory consensus that enabled the internet to flourish for more than 20 years. The plan currently under consideration at the FCC to repeal Obama&#39;s Title II power grab is a positive step forward and will help to promote a truly free and open internet for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, definitely not written by a comcast lobbyist.</p>

<p>I noticed so far two or tree variations of &#39;copypastas&#39; that have been used in literally every petition I saw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#39;t. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn&#39;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.  The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#39;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#39;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error. </p>

<p>They were soliciting members of the industry for thoughts on some upcoming changes and they basically told us outright that they were ignoring form letters sent in.</p>

<p>They said they got hundreds of identical letters from clients of a certain law firm that was hired to flood them, but what they wanted was <em>actual</em> feedback on how to make the regulations better. They basically just ignored all of these forms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Comcast is a shit company.</p>

<p>But Title II Net Neutrality is <em>open censorship of freedom of speech on the internet.</em></p>

<p>The government applied Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 to ISPs in order to achieve &quot;Net Neutrality&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>Read Section 223 (under Title II, just ctrl+F 223)</strong></p>

<p>(a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity, <strong>shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</strong></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe me, please, read it for yourself.</p>

<p>The FCC under Obama applied obscenity laws to the internet by applying Title II to ISPs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>February 26, 2015 - FCC passes the Title II Net Neutrality Rules. “In a 3-2 party-line vote, the FCC passes open internet rules applying to both wired and wireless internet connections grounded in Title II authority.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Net Neutrality is important, but we can never sacrifice our First Amendment rights on the altar of Net Neutrality.</strong></p>

<p>There are better ways to go about Net Neutrality than Title II.</p>

<p>Comcast is a shit company, nobody is going to argue with you there. That doesn&#39;t mean we should blindly accept Title II Net Neutrality in America. </p>

<p>Read Section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934. </p>

<p>I am more than happy to answer any questions anyone may have. My posts are about informing you, the reader, about Title II and why you should be concerned about being goaded into defending it under the guise of &quot;Net Neutrality.&quot;</p>

<p>That would be a matter of opinion, but I will say that in general there is literally no law or policy that is more important to life in civil society than Freedom of Speech. </p>

<p>A lot of people seem to think that Net Neutrality is a very important law. I&#39;m sure there are very good reasons for it, and have no problem with the concept of Net Neutrality.</p>

<p>But what we&#39;re talking about here is the government applying censorship laws to the internet under the guise of &quot;Net Neutrality.&quot; You can&#39;t allow these fuckers to just do whatever the fuck they want, in backroom deals and regulations by unelected bureaucrats, and call it &quot;Net Neutrality.&quot; Just because they tell you something is good for you, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good for you.</p>

<p>I have provided clear evidence that FCC&#39;s Title II regulations will force censorship laws onto the internet. We can argue the merits of Net Neutrality all day, but that&#39;s really not my point here - my point is that Title II is a direct threat to Freedom of Speech on the internet. </p>

<p>Bargaining with your First Amendment rights is a dangerous road to go down, no matter the reward.</p>

<p>I am talking about the <em>threat</em> of censorship, independent of whether censorship has actually occurred. I am not aware of any lawsuits pertaining to Title II as it relates to the internet - at least, not yet.</p>

<p>The larger point is that the door has been opened to obscenity lawsuits on the internet. If someone wanted to fuck you, they could go through your post history with a fine-toothed comb and pull comments that could reasonably be construed as &quot;harassing&quot; or &quot;obscene&quot; to file suit against you, costing you time, money, and smearing your name (even if you&#39;re not convicted.)</p>

<p>That&#39;s the danger here, the chilling effect, the door being opened to speech lawsuits over obscenity online.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not true. </p>

<p>There are no obscenity laws that apply to ISPs, other than Title II. If there are, find them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so what sort of speech do you think this regulation has curtailed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>initiates the transmission of, <strong>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,</strong> or other communication which is <strong>obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Title II literally makes &quot;lewd comments&quot; punishable by a $50,000 fine and 2 years in jail. Title II literally makes &quot;indecent images&quot; punishable by the same.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what laws you&#39;re referring to, the ones that make &quot;lewd&quot; comments and &quot;annoying&quot; speech criminal behavior on the internet. </p>

<p>If you could please cite a single source to back up your claims?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this goes <em>way beyond</em> slander/harassment, which have been illegal, in all forms of communication, since forever. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>Title II explicitly makes offensive language illegal online. Not threatening, not slandering. Offensive. If there are other laws which do the same, please show me. Otherwise I&#39;m going to assume you are misinformed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s about the <em>threat</em> of litigation. It <em>opens you up to lawsuits.</em> If an unscrupulous lawyer wants to fuck you, they could parse through your comment history and find &quot;lewd&quot; or &quot;annoying&quot; comments, and drag your ass through the mud with them in court, citing Title II. </p>

<p>You just completely gloss over the second half of that sentence to suggest that this criminalizes all obscene content. So far as I can tell your reading of the law is completely wrong, since it would criminalize porn, and nobody is suggesting that&#39;s the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, you think that I need to support the claim that it&#39;s already illegal to shout obscenities at someone in public with intent to harass them? I didn&#39;t realize you were so completely ignorant of the law.  </p>

<p>My favorite with regards to public harassment is probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words">&quot;fighting words&quot;</a>, which is a case of restricted speech whereby language is intended to provoke a verbal or physical confrontation.</p>

<p>More applicable are <a href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SSH-KnowYourRights-StreetHarassmentandtheLaw-20131.pdf">street harassment laws</a>, in which it is criminal to shout lewd or obscene comments at people on the street.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_obscenity_law">obscenity laws</a>. At one point pornography itself was strictly illegal, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the time to go find laws pertaining to the intentional showing of pornographic material to another individual with intent to annoy, harass, or disturb that person, but guaranteed you will get arrested and probably prosecuted if you try it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a slew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-bullying_legislation">anti -bullying laws</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I think you&#39;re right that obscenities and harassment shouldn&#39;t have been mixed in Title II, but I think your understanding of the law is sorely lacking. Maybe you don&#39;t go outside much and that&#39;s why you&#39;re surprised that it&#39;s illegal to shout obscenities or lewd language at someone with intent to annoy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try this again:</p>

<p>This law isn&#39;t about just &quot;harassment,&quot; which you correctly point out is already illegal. </p>

<p>It says, I&#39;ll quote it a third time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to <strong>annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, since we&#39;re having reading comprehension problems here, I bolded it. Notice the &quot;OR&quot; there before &quot;harass.&quot; We&#39;re talking about more than &quot;harassment.&quot; It says &quot;intended to <strong>annoy,</strong>&quot; As in, if you use obscenity in speech that can be construed as annoying, you are committing a felony punishable by up to 2 years in jail. It doesn&#39;t <em>just</em> say harassment, it goes well beyond that. </p>

<p>You correctly point out that in the past this law has been used to censor pornographic material (phone sex companies.) Let&#39;s ignore the fact that it also says &quot;annoying&quot; speech is illegal - is that not enough of a problem already? In other words, how comfortable are you that a law which has been used to censor pornographic material in the past would make its way to the internet? </p>

<p>The law doesn&#39;t work like that. You are clearly twisting words around, and your original post doesn&#39;t even acknowledge the annoy/harass part of the law, and instead you insisted that this criminalized all lewd or obscene language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Intended to annoy&quot; is unimaginably vague. In an actual court of law, the Prosecution would need to establish that the Defendant intended to annoy the Plaintiff. What kind of speech would they look for in constructing their case?</p>

<p>Well, language that <em>can be construed as annoying,</em> of course. You establish intent by finding language that can be construed as establishing said intent.</p>

<p>This comment thread ceased being productive several replies back. The law is <em>very, very clear</em> as to what kinds of speech is verboten. I will link it again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a fundamental level, your entire argument is intellectually dishonest, as you seem to be saying that <strong>only</strong> harassment is outlawed by this when it is very obviously not what the law says. </p>

<p>I asked you to provide a source that, as you say, other laws prior to Title II have made obscenity illegal online. You did not provide any sources, because there <em>aren&#39;t any laws other than Title II that outlaw obscenity on the internet.</em> </p>

<p>And now you want to play word games and misconstrue the meaning of the law, which is actually not very difficult to understand at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person intends a consequence when they 1) foresee that it will happen if their given series of acts or omissions continue, and 2) desire it to happen. The most serious level of culpability, justifying the most serious levels of punishment, is achieved when both these components are actually present in the accused&#39;s mind (a &quot;subjective&quot; test). A person who plans and executes a crime is considered, rightly or wrongly, a more serious danger to the public than one who acts spontaneously (perhaps because they are less likely to get caught), whether out of the sudden opportunity to steal, or out of anger to injure another. But intent can also come from the common law viewpoint as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a very complicated legal subject that you clearly don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>I said lewd or obscene speech used with intent to harass was generally illegal and gave examples of it happening in public, then provided sources that linked to a bunch of state laws saying it was illegal in public or in workplaces. I never said it was illegal online, although there are of course various cyber-bullying laws coming into force.</p>

<p>And, you keep cutting off the rest of the sentence: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re the one that keeps cutting clauses in half with the intent to show that Title II criminalizes online pornography or free speech in general or whatever it is you&#39;re trying to prove, since you keep dodging the question and refusing to say precisely what types of speech you think are being curtailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw you originally posted the full language of the section of the law, but you probably deleted it when you realized it was a federal law targeting interstate harassment and abuse and that it doesn&#39;t support your argument.</p>

<p>The prosecution has to prove <em>intent</em> to annoy, abuse, harass, or threaten. Clinton was let off because they couldn&#39;t prove intent (according to Comey&#39;s recommendation). Intent is crucial in determining which murder laws apply.</p>

<p>So, this entire thread is based on your misunderstanding of the law. First you completely ignored the intent clause, then you separated the two to suggest that annoying content itself could be criminalized, you still act like any random forum post or website can be prosecuted when the law is clearly designed to stop targeted harassment. There is no way a reasonable person can read that entire section and conclude that it generally restricts lewd or obscene content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not just say that obscenity laws are applied to the internet. Obscenity laws don&#39;t require intent to annoy, abuse, harass, or threaten. Since your brain seems incapable of holding two separate clauses together at the same time, you can just come away with this understanding that I do not agree with your claim that Title II applies obscenity laws to the internet, that you have not proven this to be the case, and that your entire argument hinged on ignoring the second (and crucial) clause which specifically requires intent to harass.</p>

<p>Reading comprehension is clearly not your strong suit. That explains why you keep making these fallacious claims and get downvoted in top level threads when you do so.</p>

<p>Newsflash: when lawmakers try to criminalize porn (like they&#39;ve tried in Britain) it makes international headlines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people on reddit favor net neutrality. The alternative is to buy the bullshit being sold by the telecoms, that they are going to use their unrestricted powers for good to bring us better service somehow. It&#39;s never clear how exactly that would work because it&#39;s always just a bunch of free-market nonsense.</p>

<p>We know what happened when Telecoms were unrestricted. They formed one giant monopoly and fucked the American consumer as long and hard as they could. Now Ma Bell has been putting itself back together again while taking over the internet at the same time.</p>

<p>All net neutrality says is that companies have to treat all customers the same. They can have tiered service, but they can&#39;t charge Netflix more for a service tier than they can charge some other company. It&#39;s not clear why giving the massively powerful telecom companies the power to selectively screw over any company they don&#39;t like is going to make things better.</p>

<p>It strikes me as odd that these threads quickly get upvote counts in the thousands, with very little commentary. I understand Reddit is in favor of Net Neutrality in general, but it still strikes me as odd (look at the other threads on the front page, none of them have anywhere near the upvotes these have and most of them have way more discussion than this thread.)</p>

<p>It looks like astroturf, is what I&#39;m saying. It looks like astroturf.</p>

<p>And considering the obscenity regulations in the FCC&#39;s version of &quot;Net Neutrality,&quot; it makes me worried there&#39;s something else at play here than just &quot;well, reddit really likes Net Neutrality.&quot; That&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the least controversial topic in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right now. We know that there&#39;s a concerted effort by telecoms to get rid of net neutrality. Comcast appears to literally be astroturfing the FCC petition site using customer data to spam comments, which is what this post is about.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re suggesting that there&#39;s a counter-astroturf movement spamming <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to fight against the telecoms? Who would be behind it? Maybe Google or Netflix. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not possible, but there aren&#39;t that many big money players that have come out for net neutrality. It could also be vote spamming by a few motivated individuals who don&#39;t like the telecoms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair interpretation on balance, but let me just say that corporations <em>already censor content online.</em> </p>

<p>Look at the comment section of <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> after a terror attack for example. </p>

<p>Look at how Google manipulates its algos and &quot;curates&quot; its news.</p>

<p>Same for Facebook and Twatter.</p>

<p>Corporations exercise extreme amounts of control over what you are &quot;allowed&quot; to say online, <em>already.</em></p>

<p>The last thing we need is obscenity laws applying to the internet also.</p>

<p>Internet service providers are subject to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 now - that&#39;s how the FCC passed &quot;net neutrality.&quot;</p>

<p>Section 223 of that law regulates obscenity online. Title II has been used to censor pornography in the past (phone sex companies, before it applied to ISPs or the internet.)</p>

<p>Now, under the FCC&#39;s rules, the same obscenity laws apply to online speech and conduct. </p>

<p>In my opinion, the last thing we need is the government criminalizing obscenity online. Corporations are <em>already</em> fucking over the First Amendment openly online. And there is actually not a whole lot we can do about that, other than migrating to platforms that actually respect free speech.</p>

<p>When the government steps in with Title II, there&#39;s literally no place you can hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So in your opinion, is removal of government restriction actually better if it allows for more corporate control and censorship/manipulation? I guess what I&#39;m saying is even though removal of government control might give more freedom from obscenity rules and other restrictions, it also allows corporations to step in even more which in turn removes free reign of the internet. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>My opinion is that obscenity laws have absolutely no place on a free and open internet.</p>

<p>I would also like to curtail Google/Facebook/Twitter/Reddit&#39;s ability to control speech online (I think Google is way overdue for some anti-trust laws.)</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some kind of &quot;either this or that&quot; kind of proposition where either you allow corporations to fuck you, or the government. What we need to do is regulate the internet in such a way that it both respects freedom of speech <em>and</em> consumer protections.</p>

<p>The idea that we somehow need to apply Title II to ISPs to achieve Net Neutrality is a falsehood.</p>

<p>I&#39;m opposed to any law that regulates obscenity on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ISP market is very competitive. I worked for them at the ground level dealing with locating their lines. End of the day only 3 or four companies own all of the lines in the ground and only because BELL got broken up. If they ever tried to do ridiculous price hikes like the fearmongering idiots are claiming anyone new could just come along and bury a fiber in your front yard and run it to your house for way less money. Just like what is happening with the newest fastest speed rated internet start up company in America in Minnesota named US internet. They saw an opportunity bought a few strands of fiber from an established ISP and started laying fiber all over the place and pricing better service at a much lower price to all of their customers. They install around 500 fiber to house connections a week in minneapolis right now. It is only a matter of time before they choke out Comcast and Centurylink in the area. There are laws on the books right now that allow them to buy up old lines or current lines and use them for themselves and their own business. If net neutrality gets passed those laws will be superceded by the new law and there will be no more new internet startups. There will only be the small monoploly of choices we already have and they will no longer have the fear of competition keeping their prices low. We will all be much more fucked then before. But I am sure whoever concocted this horrible bill and is trying to sell this atrocious lie to the American public has already come up with an excuse to explain it all away to the dumb sheeple after the fact in order to maintain what they gain from the law passing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as long as people dont communicate we will all be taken advantage of. That is how it works. Do a media campaign to push your new freedom stealing law and give it a catchy name the public will eat that shit up. I work in one specific sector and have first hand knowledge that in the case of net-neutrality nothing could be farther from what they are pushing in this bill will actually happen if it is passed. Imagine if there was no medium with which we could all communicate knowledge like that to others . Knowledge that we may have but will never reach a larger audience outside of our small social and work circles we currently live our day to day lives in. We would be a dumb pacified populace succeptible to the will of people with more power than us who seek only to enrich themselves and keep us down. Kinda like we were before the internet. Exactly like they hope we will be again if net neutrality becomes law.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not true. </p>

<p>There are no obscenity laws that apply to ISPs, other than Title II. If there are, find them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so what sort of speech do you think this regulation has curtailed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read the law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>initiates the transmission of, <strong>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,</strong> or other communication which is <strong>obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Title II literally makes &quot;lewd comments&quot; punishable by a $50,000 fine and 2 years in jail. Title II literally makes &quot;indecent images&quot; punishable by the same.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what laws you&#39;re referring to, the ones that make &quot;lewd&quot; comments and &quot;annoying&quot; speech criminal behavior on the internet. </p>

<p>If you could please cite a single source to back up your claims?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, this goes <em>way beyond</em> slander/harassment, which have been illegal, in all forms of communication, since forever. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>Title II explicitly makes offensive language illegal online. Not threatening, not slandering. Offensive. If there are other laws which do the same, please show me. Otherwise I&#39;m going to assume you are misinformed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are still openly white nationalist and neo-nazi sites online, so what sort of speech do you think this regulation has curtailed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s about the <em>threat</em> of litigation. It <em>opens you up to lawsuits.</em> If an unscrupulous lawyer wants to fuck you, they could parse through your comment history and find &quot;lewd&quot; or &quot;annoying&quot; comments, and drag your ass through the mud with them in court, citing Title II. </p>

<p>There is so much stupid in your posts it hurts. And you wonder why people downvote you.</p>
