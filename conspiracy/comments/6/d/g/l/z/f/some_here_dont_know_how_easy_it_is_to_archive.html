<p>This isn&#39;t a valid concern. You can see the source of the post by clicking the archive link, which is fully risk-free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your train wreck of a comment is a hot mess, but here goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You want real, professional journalists? But you don&#39;t want them to get paid for the content they create?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m advocating limiting traffic for known propaganda websites. You twisted my wording and embellished drastically, saying I &quot;don&#39;t want professional journalists getting paid&quot;. I never said that, nor even insinuated it. You are using a non-existent position I never espoused as an example and are arguing against it as if I had. You&#39;re either really confused or intentionally muddying the waters.</p>

<p>As an aside.... real, professional journalists definitely should be paid.</p>

<p>Problem is, any journalist spreading propaganda for the government isn&#39;t a real journalist, nor are they professional. Their postulated lack of income isn&#39;t my concern, because they are working towards the oppression of not only me, but you as well. Your position that journalists working for MSM companies are &quot;real and professional&quot; is thoroughly uninformed.  You are arguing a propaganda-induced mainstream ideology in a subreddit which inherently knows better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the money doesn&#39;t even come directly from your pocket?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kind of ridiculous argument is this?  I&#39;m not supposed to be concerned with the wretched abuses of corrupted corporations if the money to fund their endeavors doesn&#39;t come directly from my pocket? I&#39;m just supposed to look the other way because I don&#39;t fund them directly?</p>

<p>You have absolutely no idea what you are saying. The point you are arguing has no merit whatsoever. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly I don&#39;t know why you would use an article from a source you don&#39;t like</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How are we to discuss conspiracies if we don&#39;t reference the disinformation, the propaganda, and the outright disprovable lies they put forth?  </p>

<p>Your arguments are entirely nonsensical. </p>

<p>While internet archives like archive.is and archive.org are indispensable tools for investigators and researchers, using them routinely to deny clicks and views is a big mistake for the following reasons:</p>

<li><p>Archive sites may decide to shut down at any time, leaving us with large numbers of dead links for posterity.</p></li>
<li><p>Archive sites may be forced to shut down through legal processes, particularly on copyright violations, again, leaving us with dead links. Copyright protection lasts so long that it is effectively forever -- so this may happen at any time.</p></li>

<p>MOST data will not disappear that way. We can usually tell the difference. In the comments, this was discussed further.</p>

<p>You seem to believe that <em>everything</em> should be archived or nothing should be. I am saying some things shouldn&#39;t be archived, and some things should be, based on factors like the ones mentioned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6dhbgd/the_dangers_and_problems_of_linking_to_archived/di2n82o/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Are you referring to my discussion of the meanings of the words &quot;routinely&quot; and &quot;properly&quot;? They are different words with different meanings, but you have nothing more to say on this now -- except to use the most valuable propaganda trick of repetition.</p>

<p>Reddit provides valuable data for Search Engine Optimization. By archiving sites that you <em>disagree</em> with, you are essentially censoring the internet to favor your side. (&quot;LMFAO&quot; is just more ridicule, btw. Just ask the question.)</p>

<p>Credibility attack, and one that assumes you are somehow pure and objective (even though your intransigence about the meanings of simple words indicates otherwise), while I am not.</p>

<p>I took a moment to look at your submission history. You have used exactly three sources. I will respect your choices of sources as independent. Now, take a look at my history. I live by practicing what I preach with many years of independent sites and very few partisan or MSM sites over the years. So much for your credibility attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are aiming for the subconscious as well with their ads. It does have a small effect, even if only a tiny effect. Perhaps it is just the product in a store catching your eye. You most likely will not remember the ad from the internet consciously, but it may have been the reason your subconscious made it stand out in the first place. I&#39;m no neurologist or psychologist but it is just one scenario I imagine these ad guys have to think about in today&#39;s world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point of clarification from my earlier comment: What I am opposing is the routine <em>submission</em> of archived posts -- not the archiving itself. For those who archive, keep it up. More power to you. That outta the way ... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>waste my time picking apart and responding to a word salad post which clearly contradicts itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you referring to my discussion of the meanings of the words &quot;routinely&quot; and &quot;properly&quot;? They are different words with different meanings, but you have nothing more to say on this now -- except to use the most valuable propaganda trick of repetition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Doesn&#39;t make sense, that&#39;s not what is happening with archive at all)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blanket denials are another time wasting trick of propagandists. This is especially funny coming from someone who complains about wasting time. </p>

<p>In fact, right here in this very submission is an example of someone who would distort the internet to favor a side. I refer to the agreement post that then links to Breitbart directly. Breitbart! Nuff said on that! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>LMFAO, what does that even mean?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit provides valuable data for Search Engine Optimization. By archiving sites that you <em>disagree</em> with, you are essentially censoring the internet to favor your side. (&quot;LMFAO&quot; is just more ridicule, btw. Just ask the question.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone with an ounce of discernment can see you are desperately grasping at straws</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ooh, that&#39;s quite a condemnation. I don&#39;t speak that way because it adds nothing to the discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have a dog in the fight</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Credibility attack, and one that assumes you are somehow pure and objective (even though your intransigence about the meanings of simple words indicates otherwise), while I am not.</p>

<p>I took a moment to look at your submission history. You have used exactly three sources. I will respect your choices of sources as independent. Now, take a look at my history. I live by practicing what I preach with many years of independent sites and very few partisan or MSM sites over the years. So much for your credibility attack.</p>
