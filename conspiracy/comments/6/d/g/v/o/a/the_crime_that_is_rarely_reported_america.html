<p><a href="http://www.brotherjohnf.com/obama-administration-intervened-canadian-british-french-elections/">http://www.brotherjohnf.com/obama-administration-intervened-canadian-british-french-elections/</a></p>

<p>Russia trying to influence the U.S. elections is something known since the 60s. The CIA already has effective programmes to combat Russia&#39;s information propagation. The Iranian nuclear threat didn&#39;t work well as a distraction, but the Russia one is more interesting.</p>

<p>The establishment/deep state (especially the democrats) are trying to blame all their failures on external factors again. This leads me to a number of questions and observations.</p>

<p>We know that the Democratic Party lost not only the Presidential Elections, but also the elections into the Senate - where the majority are Republicans. The Congress - where the majority are Republicans. Was this also Russia&#39;s effort? No evidence or reason has been given to think this is the case. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pattern in our elections that when one party is unable to solve a number of domestic problems, the other major party is more likely to win. And when a party solves a lot of problems, a candidate from the same party is more likely to win.</p>

<p>Also, two electors didn&#39;t vote for Trump, but four didnt vote for Hillary - so they lost on absolutely all fronts, and still they look for somebody to blame on the side.</p>

<p>So all this points to was that the Obama administration had systemic problems. There is a disparity of opinion between what is good or bad for the elite - as opposed to the masses.</p>

<p>There was the call between Naruto and the ambassador, but it was in no way &quot;instructing&quot; anyone. </p>

<p>Clearly the US is exercising influence in Ukraine, and it would be foolish not to. But, the article&#39;s claims of the US supporting Nazis are unfounded.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll ask again, if the US supported actual Nazis, then why was the actual Nazi party of actual Nazis voted out of power <em>after</em> Euromaiden?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always blows my mind that Clinton supporters play dumb about her role in the ongoing middle east crisis. I mean, are you actually dumb? Do you need me to explain it to you? Did you not know she voted for the Iraq war? Did you not know that she did so without even reading the classified intelligence report? Do you know that she considered herself the architect of the Libya intervention before it went bad, then blamed it on Obama (lol!)? Did you not follow her campaign, when she was running on doing another Libya in Syria? Clinton fanatics somehow managed to ignore or forgive all that while simultaneously thinking they&#39;re compassionate anti-war progressives. Truly impressive cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>Bob Creamer was on video talking about coordinating with the Clinton campaign. That&#39;s against the law. If the video were fraudulent as you initially suggested, there would have been no reason to fire him.</p>

<p>You say the Trump administration firings are evidence, and I keep asking: EVIDENCE OF FUCKING WHAT?! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware of the fact that there are well over 5,000 US companies, including most the very largest and important ones that presently have ongoing and major operations and outlets in Russia and that people in the head offices of all those US based companies communicate with people in all those branches as well as with officials in all of the major Russian banks and financial institutions that handle their international accounts, transactions, and transfers of funds on a routine and regular basis? </p>

<p>Branches that are run for those US companies by Russian executives and management with Russian employees who work for them selling their products and services to Russian customers. </p>

<p>Do you have any idea at all of just how many people you could accuse of &quot;colluding with the Russians&quot; because that&#39;s exactly what all those companies and all those people in them are doing all the time, except that there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong, reprehensible, or sinister about that kind of collusion and communication at all. It&#39;s all quite simply &quot;business&quot; and prospecting for new business, no different from all kinds of business and prospecting for business that constantly goes on with all kinds of other countries as well.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea or appreciation of just how many Americans have large investments or own valuable commercial real estate in Russia, just as they do in many other important European countries? Do you think that they don&#39;t communicate back and forth or have all kinds of Russian associates and contacts that keep them abreast of business trends and developments or not pass similar information along about what they presently are in the US? </p>

<p>In short, do you have any real idea of just how ludicrous and preposterous looking for so-called Russian connections and attempting to condemn anyone that happens to have some under those circumstances actually is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, for anyone who didn&#39;t know... we were stuck with Mr. Little USA aka Harper for 9 years.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Canada has no term limits for prime-minsters. We had king for 21 years and Macdonald, Trudeau, and Laurier all served more than 15 years each.</p></li>
<li><p>Harper was the first prime minister to come from the modern Conservative Party of Canada, which was formed by a merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This was their cheeky way of &quot;hacking&quot; the election. In Canada, we had a number of parties (even more than this) but it basically breaks down into: quebecois (nationalist), NDP (socialist), Liberal (left), PC (right), and Alliance (far-right).</p>

<p>While most elections would see a fairly spit vote between conservative and liberal, with a chunk voting for NDP, Alliance and Quebecois. Then the two conservative, right leaning parties joined forces, which no longer split the conservative vote.</p>

<p>Suddenly we had one part on the right, and 4-5 parties on the left. They wont easily with this division of votes.</p>

<p>Harper wanted to be America&#39;s best friend, and did everything they said. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYfDTsjwE58">He even gave the same speech during the Iraq invasion as the British PM, word for word.</a> He hooked up his oil buddies out west, and destroyed our environmental protections/reputation.</p>

<p>Even if you want to argue that he was great at economics and saved Canada from the 2008 housing bubble/banking collapse... I&#39;d have to disagree. We would&#39;ve survived with any PM, and the only reason CAD was par with USD was because the US dollar had decreased, not because CAD had increased.</p>
