        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Looks like it&#39;s about to pop-off folks.  Everything is building to a crescendo just as one of the most volatile times of year approaches.  Rich, Russia, terrorism, government corruption/cover-up at the highest levels across the globe.</p>

<p>Schools will be out which means scores of radical leftists will have nothing to keep them busy during the long and hot dog days of summer.  The media is nudging them towards the edge a little more each day.  Pure political propaganda in the form of outlets such as MediaMatters, WaPo, CNN and the rest of the DC media elite.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been creating a tinderbox of unrest, waiting for the perfect moment to drop the match.  Problem, reaction, solution in plane view.  MSM through their blatent lies have been creating problems where they do not exist and ignoring real problems where they do, knowing brainwashed lunatics will react in the most emotional and animalistic fashion; on the left <em>and</em> the right.  </p>

<p>Divisiveness is their goal, and If you look around you, I&#39;d say it would be hard to argue against the notion that they have us just about where they want us; at each other&#39;s throats.</p>

<p>Terrorist attack?  Political assassination?  Police shooting?  Gang-rape of a child?  Maybe a wholecloth lie.  </p>

<p>People are waking up en-mass.  TPTB don&#39;t like that and can&#39;t stop it through media manipulation any longer, so they will force their hand upon us with nothing to stop them.  History shows us this is how it works, and nothing about our era is any different than those that came before.  </p>

<p>There is no need to freak out and run for the hills but, be safe these next few months by brethren .  Maybe buy an extra couple of cans of food next time you go shopping.  Candles/lighters, some water, try to keep cars filled with gas.  Just basic preparedness steps that everyone should take ICoE.</p>

<p>Hopefully nothing happens and we ring in 2018 with a calmer and more united world.  But what are the chances of that?</p>

<p>Spez: Martial*  It was super freakin early, wasn&#39;t thinking straight; as witnessed by the above post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying they are a shill (most their karma is from the donald but that is because the donald has upvote bots, their posts are varied more than that though).</p>

<p>What I am saying is that the post is heavily projecting and partisan - it is, after all, conservatives who have rushed us into the last 3 wars and pushed for things like patriot act, etc. They have been the ones that neonazis join and lie, they push hatred of groups (non-whites, immigrants, jews, muslims, etc) - and here he/she is calling liberals divisive, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, but people can have extreme views without being a shill. </p>

<p>Calling someone a shill is basically invalidating them as a person and their opinion. Often can lead to more radicalization.</p>

<p>As a organic trump troll from the USA, there was no CTR or Shareblue on the GOP side. CTR/Shareblue are funded posters, that&#39;s they self-proclaimed mission.</p>

<p>There is mountains more evidence to support the notion of actual bots/fake opinions on the left/liberal/democrat side at this point.</p>

<p>This is not a left/right issue, it is an us vs them issue.  They use the media to divide us and to make us think there are actually people fighting for <em>us</em> in DC.</p>

<p>And fyi, I voted Obama twice and Bernie in the primary.  I care about my country, not a party; the way they want you to see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Registered to vote as an independent in 1984. I get that in some ways the parties are in cahoots.</p>

<p>But they are different on many issues. I voted republican from 84-2000 (fed level, local have always, save once, voted a very mixed ticket). Last election I went with a third party again president.</p>

<p>As far as cracking down on rights? Usually conservative far right (and religious) pushes for that (from muslims to fundies here). Do some on the left sway that way on certain issues? Yep. But talking overall. </p>

<p>And it isn&#39;t party. It is persuasion. Conservative more restrictive, liberal more open. Democrats don&#39;t have a perfect history either because, as I said, it isn&#39;t party per se.</p>

<p>Right now we have had a hard push from the far right to gain power for years. The people who call themselves the &#39;real conservatives&#39;. More power to companies, more military, pushing for more wars, pushing for more suspicion of people who aren&#39;t white and christian.</p>

<p>So, yeah, I see differences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In congress.  A push towards more authoritarian laws are pushed by the right in congress, not by every day conservatives.  It&#39;s a game.  The left &quot;fights&quot; against it but, oh whadya know, it just so happened to get the votes it needed. If the public are vocal enough the Dems get to swoop in and play good cop, making the Reps out to be the bad cop, but they&#39;re both still the cops.</p>

<p>The whole thing is a charade meant to blind and separate us.  The Democrats in congress are funded by the exact same people as the Republicans.  Obama and the Dems had a <em>Super Majority</em> for their first two years in power and did absolutely nothing for their constituents. </p>
