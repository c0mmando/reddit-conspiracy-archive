       Why would there be any evidence of his murder if it was a failed robbery attempt? He was alive when the police found him. Wouldn't he have said "these two dudes tried to rob me" which led them to conclude it as a failed robbery attempt. Not an attempted murder where they had to go thru his home and personal things to find said murderer

       Perhaps the police looked over the laptop to assess if Seth had any enemies or secretive parts of his life that could have led to his death.

         John Podesta’s Ex-Sister in Law is On D.C. Police Foundation Board

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What looks like a coincidence, is the fact that John Podesta’s ex-sister in law is on D.C. Police Foundation Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s ex-sister in law Heather Podesta serves on the Board of the Washington DC Police Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heather Podesta serves on the board alongside recent Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier, who served as police chief when DNC staffer and widely-reported WikiLeaks source Seth Rich was murdered in July 2016. Lanier stepped down as police chief the next month.
      </p>
      <p>
       D.C. power broker Heather Podesta is the ex-wife of John Podesta’s lobbyist brother Tony, whose Podesta Group is one of the most powerful lobbying organizations in the world.

       I don't understand why the physical possession of the laptop is even relevant. As a matter of practice, any computer forensic examiner would make an exact duplicate of the data to analyze it. The tools do this have existed for decades.

       <p>
        The FoxNews.com story on the case also cited a "federal source" who said the FBI had conducted a forensic analysis of Rich's computer and discovered thousands of emails with Wikileaks. But a law enforcement official told CNN that the FBI never had possession of Rich's laptop and did not conduct a forensic analysis of its contents.
