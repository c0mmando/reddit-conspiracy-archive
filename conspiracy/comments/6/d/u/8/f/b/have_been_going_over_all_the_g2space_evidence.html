   r/conspiracy: Have been going over all the g-2.space evidence - VERY compelling case that DNC created Guccifer2.0 to preemptively discredit imminent DNC leaks as "Russian hacking". Hard to explain any other way. Obvious, dangerous loose end would be the actual internal leaker/s who could debunk the whole charade. | /r/Conspiracy Archive

       <em>
        The U.S. Intelligence Community concluded that some of the genuine leaks that Guccifer 2.0 has said were part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC were committed by two Russian intelligence groups.

        READ THE ANALYSIS. So wild claims, but some corporations made them (!!!) not government but some crowdstrike LOL. Crowdstrike has been proven to be wrong many times. Its not even FBI, FBI wasn't allowed to access dnc servers...funny isn't it? Remember that you can't trust some corporations. If i was multimillionaire i could pay them too. You know how they concluded that? Those "experts"? They found Russian "modified by:" metadata in docs guccifer2.0 sent to media. It's all about metadata. But this "guccifer2.0" forgot to delete his own metadata - dncworker metadata. There are very good analysis available at the article. About all metadata and why in this case it's 100% useless.

       Click on the orb &gt; prepare &gt; properties.

       Now I can edit metadata too.

       Now, if you've never heard of Ars Technica and put the smear quotes around "experts", you aren't qualified to lecture me about metadata.

       I'm saying that it's they way they found out that they were russians. While actually it was a guy from dnc that placed all metadata there. I highly suggest you to read the article.
