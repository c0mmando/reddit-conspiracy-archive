       I have an entry from early this year which I am certain never occurred. My phone says I traveled 63 floors and took 101,554 steps in exactly 6 minutes between 12:28:44 AM and 12:34:44 AM.. I have a job that requires me to be up early and the night in question was a Sunday, I was for sure in bed because that weekend was a busy one and memories were made to say the least. I can't find anything online about malfunctions like this. I'm trying to be rational..Anyone?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'll add that I have what options I can turned off for motion tracking and gps. I do however use the bedtime option on the clock app on iPhone which pulls from the device and sends it to Health.. the only options for disabling them are for access to other apps not the data collection itself. That's where I found this info. I took screenshots and will post when I get to my laptop to blur my info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: Screenshots &gt;
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/J0hsV">
        Here
       </a>
       &lt; Even weirder are the dates added, most of them are added later, some like this one even days, why does the data just sit? Does it go anywhere or do anything proir to being 'added'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit3: Chatted with an apple tech and the most like explanation is a bug in the borometer sending data to the Health app. Idk I call some smelly bullshit on this one guys, the borometer measures air pressure to determine how high you are and then convert that into an amount of flights climbed when combined with step count, I get it. But that means that my phone detected air pressure changed equivilent to climbing that high in 6 minutes. I find it really hard to believe bugs in a borometer would be that bad but who knows. For now I've turned off ALL motion and fitness tracking as I'm sketched out fully. If I find anythiong else interesting on the subject I'll update, maybe someone will find this post a few years from now.

       The first thing I pictured was you climbing 63 floors in 6 minutes in your sleep ... creepy as hell! I can't help much but I'm thinking the 18th is when your cloud backed up and that's why it was added after?  I have no idea why that entry would be there in the first place though

       The odds of a random glitch being exactly 6 minutes is astronomical. The floors (63) doesn't seem to be very round, and the steps (101,554) dont either. This indicates that your movement wasn't designed to be windowed in any special way... but the TIME was. Whatever happened needed to happen like clockwork....

       I know this is going to sound cliche... but have you examined yourself (specifically your orifices) for any... evidence?

       No...race conditions or concurrency errors could cause random glitches with highly irregular or strange results very infrequently, this is why these types of bugs are so damned difficult to find and correct.

       Also a computer scientist, and you've just waved your hands and said "race condition" and "concurrency errors". That's like saying "maybe there was a signed to unsigned casting issue"... you're just stating a type of algorithmic issue but provided no explanation as to why it is likely based on what you know.

       Sorry, I think I just took issue with the word "astronomical"... yes those odds are astronomical if the app we're programmed perfectly, but simple human error or even some specific business logic (rounding of time) could reduce those odds to far less than "astronomical".

       Why are you trying to cover up this evidence by listing a bunch of unrelated programming issues? If you aren't trying to cover this up give me one good example of a race condition which could hypothetically cause this result.

       I'm not covering up anything, but let's ignore shitty programming on a shitty app(not even fitbit, or anything well known/popular as stated by OP) and jump to conclusions....you're right, it's definitely aliens. /s
      </p>

       I didn't program the app, but a race condition scenario could look like this(in psuedocode):
      </p>
      <p>
       As intended: trip leg reset, begin trip count, persist trip leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race condition:  begin trip count, persist trip leg, trip leg reset.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely, it's a concurrency issue with static variables throughout the code.

       I've been a programmer for 15 years and that is the most incoherent description of a race condition I've ever heard. A race condition would require the incrementing of metrics like steps and distance in some perverse anti-pattern loop racing against an end condition which already beat it and is no longer going to trigger the ending of the incrementing process. Unless this software is an entry in obfuscated C contest I cannot fathom any step counter working in this manner. The way any pedometer works is based on hardware events and simple addition, not endless loops that if they miss their end condition continue adding steps as a function of time until the next end condition triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A concurrency issue with static variables?  What variables do you imagine are static and how do you imagine those variables being thread locked results in the rampant incrementing of those variables? If it's locked there is no incrementing, and further there is no read action on variables like distance traveled to perform further calculations. Whatever static variables you've imagined are far more likely instanced in any model and even if they weren't it's still an entirely incoherent fictional debugging of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again what we see here is the curt dismissal of a very serious issue through a reckless throwing around of technical jargon. I suggest everyone in this thread tag demos74dx in RES as a potential cover up agent. Obviously we don't want to assume and we want to be as skeptical as possible, but it's looking very likely. At the very least we can say with authority that you don't want demos74dx debugging your app.

       Is there any chance you brushed your teeth at that time with an electric toothbrush?  That would rapidly shake the crap out of the Fitbit and possibly counted so many steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tied my shoes and the count jumped 400ish.  The device is imperfect but good ballpark.

       I googled iPhone flights climbed buggy, and there are lots of complaints.  I'd focus there, and maybe post on the Apple discussion boards to ask why and how that data got on there nearly a week later.  Seems like a weird bug, but it's really got you scared so put it to bed by getting info from the source.

       They might be able to look at the logs and say "weird, XXX app wrote it" and then you know.  Apple Store geniuses are decent and available to chat.  In store might be a good way to do it, though the forum gets your issue in front of thousands of eyes at once which is nice.

       about 100k "steps" in 6 minutes? That's 277 per minute. I think it's safe to say that no matter how wildly this guy was jerking off, or even how bad a seizure was, this is still at least an order of magnitude too fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only possible way for a human to take 100k steps in 6 minutes is that they can't. It had to have been more than 6 minutes, but the clock only
       <em>
        recognized
       </em>
       that 6 minutes had passed from earths temporal frame of reference. If he were to have been, say, travelling in a reference frame other than earth at speeds approaching C, well... that would solve that problem...

       yeah you are right about jerking off that would be hilariously fast. Vibrator? lol

       But seizures..it's amazing how much movement happens in a grand mal seizure. Doesn't make sense for it to be exactly 6 minutes though.

       I actually did do a little bit of looking into the amount of movement in a seizure to establish if this was possible. Although it is a ton in a grand mal, it still doesn't come close to what this is.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in perspective, a human body moving at 277 "steps" per second (aka 277 Hz), would actually produce an audible tone. That's right, in the same way that a guitar string plays a note, a human body would make one too. It's easily within our audible spectrum too.
      </p>
      <p>
       IN FACT, 277 Hz isn't just a random tone, it's a known healing tone used by Tibetane monks...

        Listen here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever hear a human being vibrating so hard that they make this sound, it's a much bigger deal than simply a seizure.

       277 PER MINUTE. That's only 5 twitches per second. Given that all your muscles are twitching in different directions at the same time this seems possible it would register that way. I've personally witnessed upwards of 10 grand mal seizures.
