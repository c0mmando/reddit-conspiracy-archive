       I bet you ten bucks there's just as many Trump shills. Best part about that, is there's probably more Trump
Shills because people do it for free. Add the Russian click farms and you got a shill stew brewing.

       Pretty sure you'd lose that bet. I also searched for some other random redditors and didn't find any entries, only for people who posted to the_donald. However I just found this 20 minutes ago so could't check that many accounts yet, but this is fishy as hell.

       Fucking shit most of the "Trump shills" are conspiracy oldtimers because a huge part of the conspiracy theory subculture are john birch types. The foreign and alien influences are the liberals and shareblues. It is nothing personal towards the liberals (and there are a lot more liberal conspiracy theorists which is great) but most of the shilling is pro neocon/neoliberal pro MSM bullshit. Frankly I like the shilling because it keeps us all on our toes and shows us we are on to something. Also, there are great people from T_D and I am getting tired of the shilling against them.

       There's so many trump supporters here. I've been called a shill about 800 times this week. I started asking people if they worked for Cambridge and was reprimanded for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think those trump supporters are old time conspiracists. I think they are young kids who think it's cool to be edgy.

       Well you shouldn't have been reprimanded for what you said, though Cambridge Analytica is a data mining group that is hired by special interests. I should also add that the globalists are the ones (using things like social psychology and other nefarious sciences) who invented the tools Cambridge Analytica uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah there are a bunch of edgy fadora wearing twits here... I cannot deny that. I can say though that those conspiracy types that I have dealt with are either old timer conspiracy theorists (some are very religious, some the opposite) with a hatred for both American political parties and pretty libertarian in bent. The other group of conspiracy theorists I know are the younger and more liberal ones who came from the Truther movement. All of them are cool people, and no they are not shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there are assholes from T_D, but there is a special place in my heart for the imps. There undoubtedly is some small pockets of infiltration, but no compromise that I can see. If anything there is a discordian vibe in it that is growing that I thoroughly dislike.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it is hard for liberals to comprehend this, but the political parties of the united states are genuinely corrupted, and corrupted to such an extent that it is largely impossible to repair it. This has been the case for many decades and has nothing to do with Russian meddling (they are compromised too!). The intelligence apparatus of the US is more powerful than most could possibly imagine. I am afraid that the rot comes from centers like that.

       They have a discord/private chat they use to manipulate reddit
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, lets say the Colbert youtube page uploads a new video slamming Trump, one of their guys will link it to the TV sub, then they make a post in the discord directing traffic, next thing you know you have an anti-Trump post at the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       with a controlled comment section
      </p>
      <p>
       They've done the same on this sub with their "Breaking this will be the end of Trump!" type stories, where they direct all the traffic towards here and they shill their story.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Trump threads on completely different subreddits all read the exact same way. Its the same people making the same comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       They follow around prominent users and try to goad them into arguments, get them banned, decrease their influence via mass downvoting, etc.

       Yep. With 700 people you can basically control any comment section on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the state of the reddit admins, theres no real option to combat it aside from forming your own reddit manipulation squad to fight back.

       Attention: All SorosShills, BrockBots, and Killary TrigglyPuffs: DELETE YOURSELF OFF DISCORD. HIT THE GYM. LAWYER UP. PUT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ON HOLD. FOREVER.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I am going to hack it using NSA viruses that I just bought from Guccifer_12. I plan to steal all of your nicely archived chats. Everyone. And all of your email addresses. Then I'm going to cross correlate it against the NSA UPSTREAM databases, which Guccifer_10 sold to me for free, and connect your dots and unmask your real identity. Then I am going to FedEx printouts of your Discord chats to your bosses, your grandma and your neighbors, whom I will find via LinkedIn and Facebook and the DMV, which I have also hacked because Guccifer_10 gave me the NSA's SQLServer and Oracle backdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah, if you're an idiot and you re-use your Discord password on your email and other services, well,  you kind of deserve having your name memorialized eternally on the web as traitors of America.

       There's so many trump supporters here. I've been called a shill about 800 times this week. I started asking people if they worked for Cambridge and was reprimanded for doing so.
