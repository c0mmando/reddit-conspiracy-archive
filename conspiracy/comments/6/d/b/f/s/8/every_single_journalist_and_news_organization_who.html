       I've tried to find a journalist who is critical of the Seth Rich/Wikileaks connection, but was open to the possibility that the DNC was rigging it's primary prior to the DNC Leaks proving it. I can't find a single example. Does one exist?

       Everyone citizen should believe in conspiracies given that shit like MKULTRA was confirmed. We only found out about that one because they fucked up in destroying the evidence and lost track of a box of documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, people tell themselves "That was
       <em>
        decades
       </em>
       ago. That was basically a different government back then!" and treat it as a silly fact. Well I guess when shit leaks 50 years from now about today's government people will say the same thing again.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That was
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       back in 2017! Our government isn't up to stuff like that anymore, silly."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you don't believe in 99% of the conspiracy theories posted on this sub, it's simply idiotic to believe the government stopped doing things on the level of MKULTRA.

       The voting registrations of literally THOUSANDS of people were also tampered with. Over 120,000 were purged in Brooklyn, NY alone, but this happened all across the country too. Some were deleted altogether, while others had their party affiliation changed without their permission. During the primaries, there were fucking tons of people in r/sandersforpresident talking about their registrations being changed/deleted every single day. Never saw a single complaint about a Clinton supporter, so it appears the registration tampering was highly targeted too.

       And look at what they did to Sanders in 2016, the shit Wikileaks exposed. Every terrible thing they did was the norm, I'm sure, and I think that's why they're responding to the class action lawsuits the way they are. They don't think they did anything wrong, they just did what they always do. I bet that shit happens in both parties every presidential election. I know Ron Paul had a similar media blackout against him when he ran in 2012 and I wouldn't be surprised if they employed other similar tricks to keep him down that were used against Sanders. We just never saw the documentary evidence proving this shit happens until this year.

       Here's what I don't get, Republicans control Congress so why do T they investigate it? They investigated benghazi with what 46 members of the house during the 7th investigation?  If 9-2 senators can look into trump and then why can Republicans look into Seth Rich? Same way I feel about trump, get warrants etc and get to the bottom of it. Either clear him or charge him. With Seth Rich's murder, get to the bottom of it.

       Conspiracies work when you have massive cover up and little public evidence such as aliens and stuff. With benghazi we had many investigations. With all of that they hadn't found much then to me personally I forget about it.

       They did an investigation into 9/11 as well. Just because an investigation is performed doesn't mean it was performed well. Any findings on Seth Rich need to be as transparent as possible so that we really can put it to rest.

       I mean, that's not the only example I can come up with. Consider the Warren Commission on JFK's assassination. The point is that any investigation is susceptible to corrupt forces. That's why transparency is crucial

       Yup. I'm sure there are more but I only mentioned benghazi because that's the only one I know off hand which had been investigating by everyone to death. 
I have found when providing a source for your argument on reddit it is best to have a few strong sources. Otherwise even if your argument is good, your approach is right, your conclusion is right, and if you try to stay neautral it will all mean crap if the one thing you use to back it up is shit =/

       Even if there was a congressional investigation that found no evidence of wrongdoing people would still use that as a sign of a coverup and a conspiracy. We've wasted enough money on partisan witch hunts in this country.

       I think it depends. If everyone testifies publicly, the guilty person is caught and there is a plethora of video evidence etc. But if this really was a cover up then the real evidence is gone and everyone will suspect any new evidence. Is that what you mean? There will always be too much doubt?

       I am 100% convinced Benghazi was a set up to cover up HRC as SOS gun running to ISIS as "rebels" because we flipped out not buying their false flag gas attack and refused another invasion.  She wanted to destabilize Libya im order to topple the gates holding back Muslim invasion into Europe so she could ride WWIII as POTUS and give famous war speeches etc.  This plan for destabilizing was in her emails with her "mentor" that were leaked.
      </p>
      <p>
       For whatever reason they needed to cover up the CIA safehouse used to run arms and called it an Embassy and arranged for Ambassador Stevens to have no security.  In fact she went so far as to hire the efficient locals they used for years and brought in some newly bid, from a brand new company called Blue Mountain, and not arm them at all.  Then again the new head of security at the compound was the brother of the leader who raided the "embassy" and someone claims they opened the doors for them and then left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone here also issued a stand down order when rescue was being mobilized.  She claimed there wasn't enough time but of course we found out that was a lie and they would have had time to at least end his torture sooner.  Strange how 9/11 had mysterious stand down orders too.

       Because the Republicans and Democrats are the left and right hands of the only political group which matters- the oligarchy. They want theater, they don't want to actually tear the system down because then change might actually occur and upset their business plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if everyone's worst dreams or delusions about the top Democratic brass were true. Imagine this was all proven, and they all went to jail for it. The resultant power vacuum would open the party up to the Sanders wing (or even actual leftists). This would threaten the Democrats' donors, the Republicans' donors, and pretty much anybody who relies on the current deluge of corporate fun money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's in the Republicans' best interest to rile up their base against the Democrats to maintain their support without actually doing anything about the shit they're accusing they opponents of. It's about money, not politics.

       Oh I agree with you 100%. If you read my comment history you will see I try not to speculate. But your point about the Democrats not actully being left, sanders leftist would benefit most from a vacume, and money exerts more control than most realize I believe isn't speculation.

       This is literally a true thing- the point of that part of that trial is to say "Even if the otherside is 100% correct, why should this be thrown out?" and they're making the
       <strong>
        legal
       </strong>
       argument that even if the DNC 100% rigged the election, they are, in purely technical legal terms, aloud to do that. That doesn't mean they're doing it or even want to do it, but when push come to shove, that's what they're legally claiming and is probably true.

       They are a private organization, so they could technically just pick their preferred candidate without even bothering with a primary. That's entirely their prerogative. But that's not how it was done.

        [I]f you had a charity where somebody said, ‘Hey, I’m gonna take this money and use it for a specific purpose, X,’ and they pocketed it and stole the money, of course that’s different. But here, where you have a party that’s saying, ‘We’re gonna, you know, choose our standard bearer, and we’re gonna follow these general rules of the road,’ which we are voluntarily deciding, we could have – and we could have voluntarily decided that, ‘Look, we’re gonna go into back rooms like they used to and smoke cigars and pick the candidate that way,'” DNC attorney Bruce Spiva argued. “

        As leaked emails show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice-chair, and the Clinton campaign about town hall questions, a top aide to Bernie Sanders' campaign is coming to the defense of the party official.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tad Devine, who was a senior aide to Sanders, said this week it was not unusual for Brazile, who is currently the interim chairwoman of the DNC,  to contact their campaign and give guidance.
       </p>
       <p>
        "She would get in touch all the time for guidance, so I can verify her recollection on this issue," Devine told NBC News.

        Then in October, a subsequent release of emails revealed that among the many things I did in my role as a Democratic operative and D.N.C. Vice Chair prior to assuming the interim D.N.C. Chair position was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign. I had been working behind the scenes to add more town hall events and debates to the primary calendar, and I helped ensure those events included diverse moderators and addressed topics vital to minority communities. My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen. But sending those emails was a mistake I will forever regret.

        As leaked emails show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice-chair, and the Clinton campaign about town hall questions, a top aide to Bernie Sanders' campaign is coming to the defense of the party official.
       </p>

        Tad Devine, who was a senior aide to Sanders, said this week it was not unusual for Brazile, who is currently the interim chairwoman of the DNC,  to contact their campaign and give guidance.

       <p>
        "She would get in touch all the time for guidance, so I can verify her recollection on this issue," Devine told NBC News.

       They haven't admitted to rigging the election though. They are saying the suit should be dismissed on the grounds there is no applicable law that says they cannot do so.

       Say someone is accusing you committing X, but there is a question of whether X is even a crime or not. Without admitting you did X, you would save a lot of time and money buy getting the case thrown out before it comes to the stage were you will be tried for X.

       Well there is a class action lawsuit going on right now. It was not dismissed out of hand immediately. Though anyone who even paid a little bit of attention could tell the primary was rigged. You do not leak debate questions to any of the candidates. That action alone made the process rigged. The only thing you can do now is argue HOW rigged was it.

       Donna Brazile was caught feeding debate questions to HRC. She has so far admitted it, denied it, apologized for it, and blamed it on the Russians. But we have the verified emails proving it. That's called rigging, my friend.

       That's not true. When the Podesta emails were first released showing she shared debate questions, she denied the emails were true. She claimed anybody could've tampered with them, she implicated the Russians, and she even stated she was being persecuted because she was a Christian.

        As leaked emails show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice-chair, and the Clinton campaign about town hall questions, a top aide to Bernie Sanders' campaign is coming to the defense of the party official.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tad Devine, who was a senior aide to Sanders, said this week it was not unusual for Brazile, who is currently the interim chairwoman of the DNC,  to contact their campaign and give guidance.

       <p>
        "She would get in touch all the time for guidance, so I can verify her recollection on this issue," Devine told NBC News.

       Your behavior is really suspicious. Do you have any refutations to my actual post? Donna Brazile lied, and I showed the proof for it. As for your quote, it says:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Guidance doesn't mean she gave exact debate questions to both camps, but you're making that claim elsewhere in this thread. However, that's not even really the issue in my opinion (politics is politics and I'm sure the Republicans are just as guilty for stuff like this). The bigger issue is that she lied and tried to blame it on the Russians, and this was proven false (as I showed in my previous comment)

       You're trying to distort reality by claiming she was only involved with one debate question. Here's a direct quote from WaPo on the matter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Martin, or people close to him, evidently sent the question to Brazile, who passed it on to Podesta and Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. The question was later asked at the town hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The circumstances behind the second question are somewhat murkier. Brazile told Podesta March 5 to expect a question from a resident of Flint, Mich., about the city’s water crisis, writing in an email, “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.”

       Question from the email:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?

       Question from the town hall:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through
heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I'm sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now.

       Nope, it was Tad Devine, Chief Strategist for the Sanders Campaign, who came to her defense a number of times over the issue.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As leaked emails show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice-chair, and the Clinton campaign about town hall questions, a top aide to Bernie Sanders' campaign is coming to the defense of the party official.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tad Devine, who was a senior aide to Sanders, said this week it was not unusual for Brazile, who is currently the interim chairwoman of the DNC,  to contact their campaign and give guidance.
       </p>
       <p>
        "She would get in touch all the time for guidance, so I can verify her recollection on this issue," Devine told NBC News.

       That link does not at all support your claim that she 'also gave them to Sanders' camp.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Devine is saying that Brazile provided guidance to both campaigns, so he apparently believed she'd provide equal guidance to both claims. Later in the article it says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I don't think she gave anybody the questions," he told NBC News.  "I was in touch with her all the time."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anywho, this article was written before Brazile
       <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/brazile-admits-forwarded-debate-questions-to-clinton-camp.html">
        <strong>
         admitted
        </strong>
       </a>
       that she passed on the questions.
      </p>

       So it turned out she was lying, who would'a thunk it??

       Because she didn't give the actual questions, she gave topics, which is the same "guidance" the Sanders camp received, according to Devine.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also isn't the only time he's come to her defense over this. He has multiple appearances from October into November saying the same exact thing.

       The exact questions weren't passed on, it was the topics of questions. We have the emails, and we have video of the debate, so that is incontrovertible.

       The fact is Bernie Sanders would have lost worse than Hillary. He wouldn't have won the popular vote like she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a socialist and an athiest. He's been in government his entire life with no significant legislation passed or accomplishments. He'd written a questionable essay which would have been taken out of context to show that he thinks women want to be raped. He spent time in the USSR with his wife. He's praised Fidel Castro and Cuba as well as Venezuela and Hugo Chavez. Another negative for him is his age and his Jewish background. His wife might have financially ruined a university or embezzled money from it for personal gain. He had no support from minorities. He relied entirely on the  white male 18-30 voter demographic which is arguably the least reliable voting demographic in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie is a nice man but a terrible candidate for president and that's the simple reason why he lost to Hillary by more than three million votes.

       Question from the email:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Question from the town hall:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I'm sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now.

       Yes, one of the questions was asked. According to
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/02/donna-braziles-misleading-statements-on-sharing-questions-with-the-clinton-campaign/?utm_term=.79c4b60dddf0">

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Martin, or people close to him, evidently sent the question to Brazile, who passed it on to Podesta and Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. The question was later asked at the town hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        The circumstances behind the second question are somewhat murkier. Brazile told Podesta March 5 to expect a question from a resident of Flint, Mich., about the city’s water crisis, writing in an email, “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.”

       There was no extra help, according people in Sander's campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is from November 1st, well after everything was already out, and entirely separate from the
       <strong>
        original
       </strong>
       defense of Brazile and her even-handedness.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I've known her for 30 years, I was in constant touch with her for the campaign," Devine said.
       </p>
       <p>
        "If Bernie Sanders had been the nominee of the party and the Russians hacked my emails instead of John [Podesta]’s, we'd be reading all these notes between Donna and I and they'd say Donna was cozying up to the Bernie campaign. This is taken out of context. I found her to be a fair arbiter, I think she did a good and honest job."
       </p>
       <p>
        Sanders allies have flocked to Brazile's defense over the past few days, with former press secretary turned CNN commentator Symone Sanders calling her "even-handed" in an interview with Politico.

       She never said that. She said she provided questions (that weren't really questions, but just the topics themselves) and according to Devine, she did it for them as well.

       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?

        As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I'm sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I'm sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now
       </p>

       And how is that not leaking a question to Hillary's campaign? They gave her the exact topic it would be about, and Roland even used points word for word that were in the email. But I'll keep asking, why do you keep defending Brazile and this behavior?

       Because I think it's shitty of people like you to lie and spread falsehoods to push an agenda. And because a whole lot of right-wing people love pushing this narrative that the primaries were rigged against Sanders
       <strong>
        with thise sole point
       </strong>
       , when multiple high ranking officials in the Sanders' campaign said it was nonsense, and Brazile treated them very fairly. It's an obvious means to divide the left, by the right, and it unfortunately worked way too well.

       Begin at 4:55 mark and you'll see all of her lies including trying to implicate Russia in modifying her emails. It's all there and you're still here defending it. Your cognitive dissonance is so strong that you can't see the truth through your partisan blinders. Wake up, man. Both parties are fucking over America and we'll never make significant progress until we can start being honest with ourselves

       What a load of bullshit. The only statement she made in reference to that email was "CNN did not provide me with any questions" over and over again. The rest of the time she said she wouldn't speak to the validity of the emails.

       The entire reason candidates have debates is to attempt to influence the primary in their favor. That's the whole point. When caught cheating it is not an appropriate defense to claim that you only cheated a little bit and it probably didn't move the needle.

       They are not. Think of Deflategate. Now we can go all day about what the Patriots meant to do or whatever. But the actual charge is that they deflated maybe a couple of balls, that everybody used, and only in the first half of an absolute blowout where the second half was 28-0. Final score 7-45.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to believe through very murky evidence that the Patriots are slimy and dishonest, be my guest. But the idea that the Patriots "rigged" the game and therefore "stole" it is just completely laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same here. First, again, there is no evidence I'm aware of that Donna Brazile game actual word for word questions to one side and not the other. But even if they did- the idea that Hillary Clinton's answer to whatever that question was was made so unbelievably better than Bernie's that the minds of
       <em>
        3 million people
       </em>
       were instantly and irrevocably shifted in her direction, is just absurd. It just did not happen.

       They absolutely are. You can't simultaneously not know what would have happened because the amount of interference was so great, and also be sure that the margin of victory was so wide. They're full-on mutually exclusive.

       Please provide evidence of this. All I've ever heard:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is this Donna Brazile thing in which it's unclear whether she actually gave more information to one side over the other-We know that she gave 'guidance' to both sides, topics- please show any evidence that she gave more information to the Clinton campaign, actual questions for instance.

          May
         </strong>
         that seemed to show that some DNC staffers preferred Hillary.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That's it. The idea that either of those (the second apparently retroactively for the most part) swung the primary literally millions of votes is just laughable and nonsensical. If you have any other real evidence of tampering, I'd like to see it.

       Haha, fair enough. It happens.

      <p>
       If they'd tried and succeeded (or failed) to literally hack into voting machines or some other truly nefarious thing, I'd probably agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       My base issue is that the actual "efforts" seem minuscule and grey area at best. Evidence of DNC staffers waaay late in the game- when things were all but decided- showing their personal bias, and the mere plausibility that the Clinton campaign received question(s?) in a single debate- which again I've not seen evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardly Boss Tweed stuff. And what do you do? Millions more people voted for her. Do you throw out her campaign and utterly disenfranchise millions of voters to try to "make things right"?

       I was a Bernie supporter, and people were complaining about things being unfair WAY before the leaks.  I mean, there was talk of that before I voted and that was March 22.

       Its amazing how suppressed this is, but just explain the DNC lawsuit filed by bernie donors to them.

      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-rigged-hillary-clinton-dnc-lawsuit-donald-trump-president-609582%3Famp%3D1">
        article
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The most recent court hearing on the case was held on April 25, during which the DNC reportedly argued that the organization's neutrality among Democratic campaigns during the primaries was merely a "political promise," and therefore it had no legal obligations to remain impartial throughout the process.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The DNCs first defense was that the
       <strong>
        primaries didn't have to be fair.
       </strong>
       If that and the fact that I'm 99% sure they'll have no idea this lawsuit even exists doesn't open their eyes to the idea that somethings off here, nothing will. Some people truly don't want to know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer your question, they sent voters from bernie sander's website to fake polling stations.

       Its fine, most people who can think for themselves can see through all this bullshit and can see the blatant news narrative manipulation thats currently going on. I don't have any more evidence of my claim than you or anyone else has of Trump colluding with Russia, but that hasn't stopped every media outlet from peddling that narrative.
       <strong>
        I encourage everyone reading this to look at both sides of every political argument, do their own research and form their own opinions.

       Here are some sources which led me to my claim about Sanders voters being sent to fake or faulty polling stations:

      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no concrete proof. But i have a brain and can read between the lines and draw my own conclusion without needing an 'authority' figure, be it a politician, tv news analyst, or heavily
       <sup>
        athough, artificially
       </sup>
       upvoted reddit comment or post, telling me what happened and what I should think happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I can't verify that Claudia Kash actually said that, no I can't verify Seth Rich's entire timeline. But I can see the absurd response to people trying to investigate an unsolved murder, and the suppression of any information related to his case or the DNC lawsuit (one in the same if you ask me).
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, do your own research people, form your own opinions. If something doesn't make sense to you, trust yourself and your intuition and look into it.

       I respect your opinion, but to me the Russian collusion thing seems was more plausible than the Seth Rich story. I think both are incredibly interesting, and of course I hope one day we can have credible answers for both.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for whatever it's worth, as someone who works in IT Security for a major organization in the United States, collusion with the Russians to spread disinformation and hacking seems extremely plausible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course no one has the smoking gun for Seth or Russia, but I try not to criticize anyone for believing either conspiracy as well. I think it's completely reasonable to be questioning both.

       Man I don't know. It could be totally fucking made up or 100% real. I'm not trying to pretend that I am an all knowing source. Idk how they have their machines/network setup at the dnc. It could've been a wide open network for all I know that Timmy down the street hacked together a couple scripts to steal some emails or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know is that state-sponsored Russian hackers have a history of running heavy disinformation/hacking campaigns, whether it be through brute force hacking or just merely phishing email accounts, planting false information and spreading that shit out. That's not a secret and has been pretty well covered since early 2000s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously no one has a smoking gun, but to act like it's not a very realistic possibility is extremely naive. It's literally the same naivety that you accuse people who deny the Seth Rich murder investigation shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said though, I respect your opinion. It's just my take on it. Not a shill, just my opinion.

       Again this is just my opinion, you can have yours, I can have mine and it's all good, but I think two things regarding the msm, their supposed biases and this Russian/Rich thing.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Msm is going to msm and there is nothing we can do about it. I can't control it, so I'm not going to get upset about what they do and do not cover. There are so many viable outlets for news coverage thaw days whether it be fake or real that it's okay for it to be like that. And whether you're democrat or republican you're prbly going to get news that best suits your viewpoint if all you do is consume msm.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It's getting to be about a year since Seth died and truthfully we don't really have much new information to go off of since it went down. Which sure we can debate that part, some might say that's not true. But obviously it's nothing that has spurred any sort of new investigation, and the family seems to acknowledge the fact that they still have no new information.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       With Russia I just think it's pretty different circumstances to the Seth story. It's not so much that anyone knows Trump &amp; Russia colluded, but it's just the blatant attempts at covering up a bunch of small things. Whether it's Sessions, Manafort, Page, Flynn, Kushner or whoever the fuck else They've all had their little coverup things, and they're all involved with Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the liberal side blow up the Russian thing way to much at times? Absolutely, I think it's pretty ridic to call for impeachment at this time but I don't think it's ridic for a proper investigation to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it's ridic for Fox News to act like this Russian thing is just not a deal at all and we're besties with Russia. That's crazy too so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, State sponsored Russian hackers have a long history going back to the past 20 years spreading disinformation and trying to fuck shit up.

       Hey u/Busybyeski I think it was you who corrected my post on Claudia Kash. I looked into it and saw that the facebook post was tweeted by Jack Posobiec and that was the only real source for that info. I would've edited my post to highlight my mistake if it didn't get removed, but I wanted to say thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like having my mistakes corrected because it gives me an opportunity to learn more. Shouldn't have posted it here without confirming it first but as I'm sure you understand, there has been a lot of info to try and sort through these past couple months and just going mostly off memory makes it tough.

       I also think its possible (or even probable) Russia was able to obtain the same emails that were leaked to Wikileaks, though I don't think Russia gave them to Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish we had some kind of laws mandating certain privacy measures were taken to prevent this type of hacking. Maybe if they had protocols for servers hosting classified information, they wouldn't have been able to hack the Democrat's communications. I'm sure if laws like that were in place, everybody would've followed those laws, right ........?

       At the end of the day, unless we're talking some crazy bleeding edge military grade technology, nothing is going to be 100% secure. And if someone/group was determined to hack HRCs servers or the DNC or just whatever.. someone could do it.

       If you don't mind, I'd like to share with you Hillary's official stance:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr; reschedule marijuana to Schedule 2 and allow states to decide what's right for them regarding legalization
      </p>
      <p>
       "Focusing federal enforcement resources on violent crime, not simple marijuana possession. Marijuana arrests, including for simple possession, account for a large number of drug arrests. Significant racial disparities exist in marijuana enforcement—black men are significantly more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts, despite the fact that their usage rates are similar. Hillary will allow states that have enacted marijuana laws to act as laboratories of democracy and reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance."

       Aww, you Shareblue guys are still hilarious.

       No, everyone already knew he was an Independent before running.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he ran
       <strong>
        in the Democratic Party
       </strong>
       as a
       <strong>
        Democrat Presidential nominee
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, because you don't like his politics doesn't magically mean you guys are allowed to rig the election to remove him.

       Yes he joined the Democratic party. He said in April of 2015 that he's still an independent. For 40 years prior to the 2016 election he was an independent. He's left the Democratic party after it served his purpose of increasing his profile.

       Like I said, I voted for him in the Democratic primaries, so I like his ideas.

       I don't understand the question. I believe every person should treat every other person fairly and with honesty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders was/is a Democrat. Those who donated to his campaign were also most likely Democrats. Those who voted for him in the primaries were Democrats. And if the primary was intentionally built and run to favor Hillary I don't think thats fair to any of the 3 Democrat examples I listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rephrase and maybe I can answer better, but also ask yourself this:
      </p>
      <p>
       99.9% of voters would have bet their life savings that the President come Nov. 8th would be a Democrat or a Republican. If the primaries don't actually need to be fair, then doesn't that really mean that we only get to choose between 2 pre chosen options? If the Republicans rigged the primary successfully (I beieve they tried to bring down Trump with money, ads, and political backing of other candidates the entire primary) and it came down to Jeb Bush vs Hillary Clinton, what kind of bullshit Democracy is that? I'd rather pick a homeless man with good morals off the street than vote for either of those 2.

       Bernie Sanders only joined the Democratic party in 2015. For 40 years before that he was an independent. After the election, he changed affiliation back to independent. Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat, he is a socialist. That's fine. The Democratic party, as a private organization, has no obligation to be fair to an independent socialist who only joined the Democratic party to increase his brand and name recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the result of the primaries show how Democratic voters felt about Bernie Sanders, as he lost by more than 3 million votes to Hillary.

       And if I asked for evidence that the Democratic primary was rigged, you would point to what exactly? Donna Brazile? Someone suggesting that they ask Bernie is he's an athiest? (He is) Someone saying that Bernie isn't a real Democrat (he's not).
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the standards to rigging an election are real low these days, aren't they? I used to think rigging an election involved actually changing votes or providing fake ones. Got any proof of that? Or is that not required anymore?

       There was no live coverage of her falling.

       An random guy filmed it on his own camera because the media had all left despite the breaking story (which they also refused to cover at the time).

       Everyone found out about it

       I wasn't lying, I was wrong. There's a difference. I had misremembered that day, I thought they'd been on air during the ceremony and we're recording her because she'd suddenly decided to leave early.

       That was hilarious when it happened. It's why they lost the mass media influence so fucking hard during the election, it wasn't just other news outlets drawing away their viewers, it was that their narrative kept being refute
       <strong>
        by their own reporting
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They would brazenly lie
       <strong>
        in their own reports
       </strong>
       on things to the point they were debunking and countering their own claims
       <strong>
        in
       </strong>
       their same reports while concluding the opposite. Let alone the media they pushed out where they heavily pumped out a narrative and then denied it while trying to spin it the
       <strong>
        next day
       </strong>
       . Even their own supporters stopped believing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where did they turn? They turned to the news outlets that had objective video evidence and verifiable claims that consistently were stating the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their own "fake news" narrative was one of the biggest back firers. They spent months,
       <strong>
        after
       </strong>
       people overwhelmingly stopped trusting them no less, detailing every news outlet that had been telling the truth had been lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then turned around
       <strong>
        immediately
       </strong>
       after that failed and everyone started refuting their own lies and calling the MSM "fake news" that they declared the term "fake news" was a Russian conspiracy theory invented to attack them.

       Because typically professional journalists aren't going to report on conspiracy theories. So if at this time last year the DNC corruption was a conspiracy theory, and they didn't report on that... then why would they report on a Seth Rich story that is still technically a conspiracy. At least they're being consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell does it matter to yall if the media covers it or not? You have a great conspiracy in the Seth story. I don't see how whether the MSM covering it or not, validates the conspiracy?

       And they were right. None of the DNC leaks proved "primary rigging," only bias on the part of DNC officials. There's not a shred of evidence Seth Rich was killed by DNC-connected murderers.

       "Conspiracy Theory" was a term developed to polarize people against ideas contrary to what they want you to think. It's brilliant if you think about it but with all of the proven conspiracies, it doesn't carry the same stigma.

       There was no extra help, according people in Sander's campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is from November 1st, well after everything was already out, and entirely separate from the
       <strong>
        original
       </strong>
       defense of Brazile and her even-handedness.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I've known her for 30 years, I was in constant touch with her for the campaign," Devine said.
       </p>
       <p>
        "If Bernie Sanders had been the nominee of the party and the Russians hacked my emails instead of John [Podesta]’s, we'd be reading all these notes between Donna and I and they'd say Donna was cozying up to the Bernie campaign. This is taken out of context. I found her to be a fair arbiter, I think she did a good and honest job."
       </p>
       <p>
        Sanders allies have flocked to Brazile's defense over the past few days, with former press secretary turned CNN commentator Symone Sanders calling her "even-handed" in an interview with Politico.

       Question from the email:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?
       </p>

      <p>
       Question from the town hall:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through
heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I'm sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now.
       </p>

       Are you going to stop lying now?

       The talking points and figures are exactly the same as in the Wikileaks email. Then the audience member's question as a whole reflects the question provided by Brazile. Why be so daft?

       No sweat, I'm guilty of the same thing and it feels awful when you take the bait on any garbage information. Glad to help.
