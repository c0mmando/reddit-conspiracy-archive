    <div class="md"><p>Everyone citizen should believe in conspiracies given that shit like MKULTRA was confirmed. We only found out about that one because they fucked up in destroying the evidence and lost track of a box of documents.</p>

<p>But no, people tell themselves &quot;That was <em>decades</em> ago. That was basically a different government back then!&quot; and treat it as a silly fact. Well I guess when shit leaks 50 years from now about today&#39;s government people will say the same thing again.</p>

<p>&quot;That was <em>way</em> back in 2017! Our government isn&#39;t up to stuff like that anymore, silly.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t believe in 99% of the conspiracy theories posted on this sub, it&#39;s simply idiotic to believe the government stopped doing things on the level of MKULTRA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The voting registrations of literally THOUSANDS of people were also tampered with. Over 120,000 were purged in Brooklyn, NY alone, but this happened all across the country too. Some were deleted altogether, while others had their party affiliation changed without their permission. During the primaries, there were fucking tons of people in r/sandersforpresident talking about their registrations being changed/deleted every single day. Never saw a single complaint about a Clinton supporter, so it appears the registration tampering was highly targeted too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And look at what they did to Sanders in 2016, the shit Wikileaks exposed. Every terrible thing they did was the norm, I&#39;m sure, and I think that&#39;s why they&#39;re responding to the class action lawsuits the way they are. They don&#39;t think they did anything wrong, they just did what they always do. I bet that shit happens in both parties every presidential election. I know Ron Paul had a similar media blackout against him when he ran in 2012 and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they employed other similar tricks to keep him down that were used against Sanders. We just never saw the documentary evidence proving this shit happens until this year. </p>

I have found when providing a source for your argument on reddit it is best to have a few strong sources. Otherwise even if your argument is good, your approach is right, your conclusion is right, and if you try to stay neautral it will all mean crap if the one thing you use to back it up is shit =/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 100% convinced Benghazi was a set up to cover up HRC as SOS gun running to ISIS as &quot;rebels&quot; because we flipped out not buying their false flag gas attack and refused another invasion.  She wanted to destabilize Libya im order to topple the gates holding back Muslim invasion into Europe so she could ride WWIII as POTUS and give famous war speeches etc.  This plan for destabilizing was in her emails with her &quot;mentor&quot; that were leaked.</p>

<p>For whatever reason they needed to cover up the CIA safehouse used to run arms and called it an Embassy and arranged for Ambassador Stevens to have no security.  In fact she went so far as to hire the efficient locals they used for years and brought in some newly bid, from a brand new company called Blue Mountain, and not arm them at all.  Then again the new head of security at the compound was the brother of the leader who raided the &quot;embassy&quot; and someone claims they opened the doors for them and then left.</p>

<p>Someone here also issued a stand down order when rescue was being mobilized.  She claimed there wasn&#39;t enough time but of course we found out that was a lie and they would have had time to at least end his torture sooner.  Strange how 9/11 had mysterious stand down orders too.</p>

<p>Martin, or people close to him, evidently sent the question to Brazile, who passed it on to Podesta and Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. The question was later asked at the town hall.</p>

<p>The circumstances behind the second question are somewhat murkier. Brazile told Podesta March 5 to expect a question from a resident of Flint, Mich., about the city’s water crisis, writing in an email, “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question from the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question from the town hall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through
heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I&#39;m sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you going to stop lying now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, it was Tad Devine, Chief Strategist for the Sanders Campaign, who came to her defense a number of times over the issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As leaked emails show communications earlier this year between Donna Brazile, then-Democratic National Committee vice-chair, and the Clinton campaign about town hall questions, a top aide to Bernie Sanders&#39; campaign is coming to the defense of the party official. </p>

<p>Tad Devine, who was a senior aide to Sanders, said this week it was not unusual for Brazile, who is currently the interim chairwoman of the DNC,  to contact their campaign and give guidance. </p>

<p>&quot;She would get in touch all the time for guidance, so I can verify her recollection on this issue,&quot; Devine told NBC News. </p>

<p>Devine is saying that Brazile provided guidance to both campaigns, so he apparently believed she&#39;d provide equal guidance to both claims. Later in the article it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think she gave anybody the questions,&quot; he told NBC News.  &quot;I was in touch with her all the time.&quot;</p>

<p>Anywho, this article was written before Brazile <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/17/brazile-admits-forwarded-debate-questions-to-clinton-camp.html"><strong>admitted</strong></a> that she passed on the questions.</p>

<p>Because she didn&#39;t give the actual questions, she gave topics, which is the same &quot;guidance&quot; the Sanders camp received, according to Devine. </p>

<p>The article says nothing of the sort. That&#39;s twice that you are blatantly <em>lying</em> about it - everyone can read the link for themselves.</p>

<p>Even <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/03/20/finally-donna-brazile-apologizes-for-passing-debate-questions-during-clinton-sanders-primary-battles/">Salon</a> isn&#39;t on your side on this, and they bend over backwards to defend her. The questions are passed on in Wikileaks, her weasel-worded &quot;potential topics&quot; dismissal (read: questions) directly contradicts her earlier denials. So she has no credibility (especially as, again, it was revealed through Wikileaks anyway).</p>

<p>She also claimed that the Wikileaks emails were altered, when it was later proved that they weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>So what credibility does Brazile have at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is Bernie Sanders would have lost worse than Hillary. He wouldn&#39;t have won the popular vote like she did. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a socialist and an athiest. He&#39;s been in government his entire life with no significant legislation passed or accomplishments. He&#39;d written a questionable essay which would have been taken out of context to show that he thinks women want to be raped. He spent time in the USSR with his wife. He&#39;s praised Fidel Castro and Cuba as well as Venezuela and Hugo Chavez. Another negative for him is his age and his Jewish background. His wife might have financially ruined a university or embezzled money from it for personal gain. He had no support from minorities. He relied entirely on the  white male 18-30 voter demographic which is arguably the least reliable voting demographic in the country. </p>

<p>Bernie is a nice man but a terrible candidate for president and that&#39;s the simple reason why he lost to Hillary by more than three million votes.</p>

<p>The circumstances behind the second question are somewhat murkier. Brazile told Podesta March 5 to expect a question from a resident of Flint, Mich., about the city’s water crisis, writing in an email, “One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.”</p>

<p>Since she gave &quot;extra help&quot; though, I&#39;m sure you can provide me a single actual instance of that happening, right? Because aside from the question topics, which Sanders camp said they got to and Brazile was fully above board, you have literally nothing at all.</p>

<p>We have the emails, so provide even a <strong>single one</strong> that backs up your baseless claims.</p>

<p>Question from the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question from the town hall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I&#39;m sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s clearly not? And according to multiple people in Sander&#39;s camp, she did the same for them too. </p>

<p>The death penalty? Yeah, they really gave it all away there. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because I think it&#39;s shitty of people like you to lie and spread falsehoods to push an agenda. And because a whole lot of right-wing people love pushing this narrative that the primaries were rigged against Sanders <strong>with thise sole point</strong>, when multiple high ranking officials in the Sanders&#39; campaign said it was nonsense, and Brazile treated them very fairly. It&#39;s an obvious means to divide the left, by the right, and it unfortunately worked way too well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not. Think of Deflategate. Now we can go all day about what the Patriots meant to do or whatever. But the actual charge is that they deflated maybe a couple of balls, that everybody used, and only in the first half of an absolute blowout where the second half was 28-0. Final score 7-45. </p>

<p>If you want to believe through very murky evidence that the Patriots are slimy and dishonest, be my guest. But the idea that the Patriots &quot;rigged&quot; the game and therefore &quot;stole&quot; it is just completely laughable. </p>

<p>Same here. First, again, there is no evidence I&#39;m aware of that Donna Brazile game actual word for word questions to one side and not the other. But even if they did- the idea that Hillary Clinton&#39;s answer to whatever that question was was made so unbelievably better than Bernie&#39;s that the minds of <em>3 million people</em> were instantly and irrevocably shifted in her direction, is just absurd. It just did not happen. </p>

<p>Please provide evidence of this. All I&#39;ve ever heard:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this Donna Brazile thing in which it&#39;s unclear whether she actually gave more information to one side over the other-We know that she gave &#39;guidance&#39; to both sides, topics- please show any evidence that she gave more information to the Clinton campaign, actual questions for instance. </p></li>
<li><p>and emails from <strong>May</strong> that seemed to show that some DNC staffers preferred Hillary. </p></li>

<p>That&#39;s it. The idea that either of those (the second apparently retroactively for the most part) swung the primary literally millions of votes is just laughable and nonsensical. If you have any other real evidence of tampering, I&#39;d like to see it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, fair enough. It happens. </p>

<p>If they&#39;d tried and succeeded (or failed) to literally hack into voting machines or some other truly nefarious thing, I&#39;d probably agree with you. </p>

<p>My base issue is that the actual &quot;efforts&quot; seem minuscule and grey area at best. Evidence of DNC staffers waaay late in the game- when things were all but decided- showing their personal bias, and the mere plausibility that the Clinton campaign received question(s?) in a single debate- which again I&#39;ve not seen evidence. </p>

<p>Hardly Boss Tweed stuff. And what do you do? Millions more people voted for her. Do you throw out her campaign and utterly disenfranchise millions of voters to try to &quot;make things right&quot;? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-rigged-hillary-clinton-dnc-lawsuit-donald-trump-president-609582%3Famp%3D1">article</a></p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most recent court hearing on the case was held on April 25, during which the DNC reportedly argued that the organization&#39;s neutrality among Democratic campaigns during the primaries was merely a &quot;political promise,&quot; and therefore it had no legal obligations to remain impartial throughout the process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DNCs first defense was that the <strong>primaries didn&#39;t have to be fair.</strong> If that and the fact that I&#39;m 99% sure they&#39;ll have no idea this lawsuit even exists doesn&#39;t open their eyes to the idea that somethings off here, nothing will. Some people truly don&#39;t want to know the truth.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, they sent voters from bernie sander&#39;s website to fake polling stations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>u/TheWiredWorld you&#39;re welcome buddy, want you to see this comment too...</p>

<p>And shadowmind, <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1495446545235m.jpg">I get that you&#39;re being paid to discredit all of this, and that you have a script you have to stick to to try to keep eyes away from the DNC.</a>Its fine, most people who can think for themselves can see through all this bullshit and can see the blatant news narrative manipulation thats currently going on. I don&#39;t have any more evidence of my claim than you or anyone else has of Trump colluding with Russia, but that hasn&#39;t stopped every media outlet from peddling that narrative. <strong>I encourage everyone reading this to look at both sides of every political argument, do their own research and form their own opinions.</strong></p>

<p>Here are some sources which led me to my claim about Sanders voters being sent to fake or faulty polling stations:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4esx70/urgent_majority_of_new_york_polling_places_dont/">r/sandersforpresident post from April 14, &#39;16</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-voting-problems-20160607-snap-htmlstory.html">LA Times article from June 7, &#39;16</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1495256469355.jpg">Facebook post citing Claudia Kash (Seth Rich&#39;s gf) as the source</a></p>

<p><a href="http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/126530210/srg-seth-rich-general">SRG thread from 4chan</a></p>

<p><a href="http://riggedit.com/seth-rich/">Rigged it - compilation of evidence uncovered on reddit and 4chan</a></p>

<p>Or just google search in r/SandersForPresident with the date range set from like 4/1/16 to 7/1/16 and you can find plenty more sources to support my claim.</p>

<p>Again, I have no concrete proof. But i have a brain and can read between the lines and draw my own conclusion without needing an &#39;authority&#39; figure, be it a politician, tv news analyst, or heavily<sup>athough, artificially</sup> upvoted reddit comment or post, telling me what happened and what I should think happened.</p>

<p>No I can&#39;t verify that Claudia Kash actually said that, no I can&#39;t verify Seth Rich&#39;s entire timeline. But I can see the absurd response to people trying to investigate an unsolved murder, and the suppression of any information related to his case or the DNC lawsuit (one in the same if you ask me).</p>

<p>So again, do your own research people, form your own opinions. If something doesn&#39;t make sense to you, trust yourself and your intuition and look into it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your opinion, but to me the Russian collusion thing seems was more plausible than the Seth Rich story. I think both are incredibly interesting, and of course I hope one day we can have credible answers for both. </p>

<p>But for whatever it&#39;s worth, as someone who works in IT Security for a major organization in the United States, collusion with the Russians to spread disinformation and hacking seems extremely plausible to me. </p>

<p>Of course no one has the smoking gun for Seth or Russia, but I try not to criticize anyone for believing either conspiracy as well. I think it&#39;s completely reasonable to be questioning both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man I don&#39;t know. It could be totally fucking made up or 100% real. I&#39;m not trying to pretend that I am an all knowing source. Idk how they have their machines/network setup at the dnc. It could&#39;ve been a wide open network for all I know that Timmy down the street hacked together a couple scripts to steal some emails or whatever. </p>

<p>What I do know is that state-sponsored Russian hackers have a history of running heavy disinformation/hacking campaigns, whether it be through brute force hacking or just merely phishing email accounts, planting false information and spreading that shit out. That&#39;s not a secret and has been pretty well covered since early 2000s. </p>

<p>Obviously no one has a smoking gun, but to act like it&#39;s not a very realistic possibility is extremely naive. It&#39;s literally the same naivety that you accuse people who deny the Seth Rich murder investigation shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To quote the officer from that DWS laptop video that popped up on this sub yesterday, yes and no. Sorry this is kinda long...</p>

<p>Again this is just my opinion, you can have yours, I can have mine and it&#39;s all good, but I think two things regarding the msm, their supposed biases and this Russian/Rich thing. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Msm is going to msm and there is nothing we can do about it. I can&#39;t control it, so I&#39;m not going to get upset about what they do and do not cover. There are so many viable outlets for news coverage thaw days whether it be fake or real that it&#39;s okay for it to be like that. And whether you&#39;re democrat or republican you&#39;re prbly going to get news that best suits your viewpoint if all you do is consume msm. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s getting to be about a year since Seth died and truthfully we don&#39;t really have much new information to go off of since it went down. Which sure we can debate that part, some might say that&#39;s not true. But obviously it&#39;s nothing that has spurred any sort of new investigation, and the family seems to acknowledge the fact that they still have no new information. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>With Russia I just think it&#39;s pretty different circumstances to the Seth story. It&#39;s not so much that anyone knows Trump &amp; Russia colluded, but it&#39;s just the blatant attempts at covering up a bunch of small things. Whether it&#39;s Sessions, Manafort, Page, Flynn, Kushner or whoever the fuck else They&#39;ve all had their little coverup things, and they&#39;re all involved with Trump. </p>

<p>Does the liberal side blow up the Russian thing way to much at times? Absolutely, I think it&#39;s pretty ridic to call for impeachment at this time but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ridic for a proper investigation to take place. </p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s ridic for Fox News to act like this Russian thing is just not a deal at all and we&#39;re besties with Russia. That&#39;s crazy too so. </p>

<p>Besides, State sponsored Russian hackers have a long history going back to the past 20 years spreading disinformation and trying to fuck shit up. </p>

<p>If you made it this far and read all that, then I thank you! </p>

I would&#39;ve edited my post to highlight my mistake if it didn&#39;t get removed, but I wanted to say thanks.</p>

<p>I like having my mistakes corrected because it gives me an opportunity to learn more. Shouldn&#39;t have posted it here without confirming it first but as I&#39;m sure you understand, there has been a lot of info to try and sort through these past couple months and just going mostly off memory makes it tough. </p>

<p>I just wish we had some kind of laws mandating certain privacy measures were taken to prevent this type of hacking. Maybe if they had protocols for servers hosting classified information, they wouldn&#39;t have been able to hack the Democrat&#39;s communications.

    <div class="md"><p>Who was the anti-marijuana Democrat?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like to share with you Hillary&#39;s official stance:</p>

<p>Tldr; reschedule marijuana to Schedule 2 and allow states to decide what&#39;s right for them regarding legalization</p>

<p>&quot;Focusing federal enforcement resources on violent crime, not simple marijuana possession. Marijuana arrests, including for simple possession, account for a large number of drug arrests. Significant racial disparities exist in marijuana enforcement—black men are significantly more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white counterparts, despite the fact that their usage rates are similar. Hillary will allow states that have enacted marijuana laws to act as laboratories of democracy and reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II substance.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand the question. I believe every person should treat every other person fairly and with honesty.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders was/is a Democrat. Those who donated to his campaign were also most likely Democrats. Those who voted for him in the primaries were Democrats. And if the primary was intentionally built and run to favor Hillary I don&#39;t think thats fair to any of the 3 Democrat examples I listed above.</p>

<p>Rephrase and maybe I can answer better, but also ask yourself this:</p>

<p>99.9% of voters would have bet their life savings that the President come Nov. 8th would be a Democrat or a Republican. If the primaries don&#39;t actually need to be fair, then doesn&#39;t that really mean that we only get to choose between 2 pre chosen options? If the Republicans rigged the primary successfully (I beieve they tried to bring down Trump with money, ads, and political backing of other candidates the entire primary) and it came down to Jeb Bush vs Hillary Clinton, what kind of bullshit Democracy is that? I&#39;d rather pick a homeless man with good morals off the street than vote for either of those 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie Sanders only joined the Democratic party in 2015. For 40 years before that he was an independent. After the election, he changed affiliation back to independent. Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat, he is a socialist. That&#39;s fine. The Democratic party, as a private organization, has no obligation to be fair to an independent socialist who only joined the Democratic party to increase his brand and name recognition.</p>

<p>I think the result of the primaries show how Democratic voters felt about Bernie Sanders, as he lost by more than 3 million votes to Hillary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if I asked for evidence that the Democratic primary was rigged, you would point to what exactly? Donna Brazile? Someone suggesting that they ask Bernie is he&#39;s an athiest? (He is) Someone saying that Bernie isn&#39;t a real Democrat (he&#39;s not).</p>

<p>Well the standards to rigging an election are real low these days, aren&#39;t they? I used to think rigging an election involved actually changing votes or providing fake ones. Got any proof of that? Or is that not required anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was hilarious when it happened. It&#39;s why they lost the mass media influence so fucking hard during the election, it wasn&#39;t just other news outlets drawing away their viewers, it was that their narrative kept being refute <strong>by their own reporting</strong>.</p>

<p>They would brazenly lie <strong>in their own reports</strong> on things to the point they were debunking and countering their own claims <strong>in</strong> their same reports while concluding the opposite. Let alone the media they pushed out where they heavily pumped out a narrative and then denied it while trying to spin it the <strong>next day</strong>. Even their own supporters stopped believing them.</p>

<p>So where did they turn? They turned to the news outlets that had objective video evidence and verifiable claims that consistently were stating the truth.</p>

<p>Their own &quot;fake news&quot; narrative was one of the biggest back firers. They spent months, <strong>after</strong> people overwhelmingly stopped trusting them no less, detailing every news outlet that had been telling the truth had been lying.</p>

<p>And then turned around <strong>immediately</strong> after that failed and everyone started refuting their own lies and calling the MSM &quot;fake news&quot; that they declared the term &quot;fake news&quot; was a Russian conspiracy theory invented to attack them.</p>

<p>What the hell does it matter to yall if the media covers it or not? You have a great conspiracy in the Seth story. I don&#39;t see how whether the MSM covering it or not, validates the conspiracy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question from the email:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That’s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question from the town hall:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As stated, I did spend thirty nine years of my life in prison for a crime, a murder I did not commit. And, um, it was only through
heroic efforts of the Ohio innocence project, at the University of Cincinnati, that I was ultimately exonerated and am able to stand before you today. Senator, I spent some of those years on death row, and um, excuse me I&#39;m sorry, I came perilously close to my own execution. And um, in light of that what I just shared with you, and in light of the fact that there documented cases of innocent people who have been executed in our country, I would like to know how can you still take your stance on the death penalty, in light of what you know right now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you going to stop lying now?</p>
