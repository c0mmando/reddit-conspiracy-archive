       Not so much as me having a conspiracy just want to know your general thoughts on dentists. Like I've been to the dentist for cleanings and they were like ok no cavities. Then the orthodontist comes in for one minute poking around and is like you have 3 cavities. Within one minute just diagnoses me with dollar signs in his eyes. My girlfriend went to the dentist the other week with no pain or anything. The dentist says she has cavities and now she has pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are dentists really just shady people trying to make a buck? I know root canals are bogus as there are better alternatives. What's your guys thoughts on dentists?

       A lot of people have experienced this with their dentists including me on multiple times. They are only looking to juice us and also they don't advertise their pricing on the wall so they can charge you anything and you can't really compare it to the competition so it keeps the rates real high.

       there's alot of cookie cutter corporate dentist chains, and I have reason to believe they liberally offer their services to maximize on insurance claims. I think im a victim of insurance fraud, had 18 cavities filled when i was 18, parents had really really good insurance from their jobs.

       Going to disagree with you here. If you tried to drill out a cavity or abscess that went into the nerves you'd be in excruciating pain for years, maybe even a lifetime. Try living with a "hot tooth" for even a week and then tell me root canals are quackery. You'd be begging for one.
      </p>

       It's just that they're expensive, and they freak people out. 2 things that would make people question them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they're not over-diagnosed, and i'm not saying that the "dangers" of an abcess aren't
       <em>
        greatly
       </em>
       exaggerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy is dental insurance. Dental insurance coverage has been fixed at $1500 since its conception over 70 years ago. Unless you get free dental through your job, you're getting a couple hundred bucks
       <em>
        tops
       </em>
       covered. And anything expensive comes right out of your pocket.

       Some times you don't need them removed. But they do grow in funky. Mine literally was sideways and it was a bitch to get out. The price is unreal though for sure. So wisdom teeth are case by case. But they definitely are pushing for everyone to get theirs removed. My dad never had his removed although he only grew 2 instead of 4.

       i still have mine in my mouth. mine came in as functional teeth. due to evolutionary changes and human behavior and development, those teeth get all sorts of fucked up that can cause you pain down the line. You can wait for that pain to come to get em out, but you won't be able to go in for emergency dental surgery, so plan ahead

       Lucky duck. I had mine removed while I was awake. It was the worst thing ever. I started choking on my own spit and the dentist was like you need to stop moving. I was literally choking and he was mad. Then the next 3 weeks were the most painful as hell. I hope no one has to ever go through getting them removed, especially awake. Fucking sucked

       I had the same thing happen, mine were impacted. I was awake and he crushed one of my wisdom teeth. Felt really weird but the whole process took like 5 mins. I think they were just so rotted and crammed in there, it was a relief to have them gone. After that, I got my front teeth pulled, and that was a bit scarier! Honestly though having my teeth pulled is way better then any kind of modification, like root canals. Although not everyone is comfortable with missing multiple teeth and having it very visible.

       I totally believe dentists just profiteer off people. In the last 5 years Ive had over 36 dental operations, and my teeth continue to rot away at an excellerated rate. It's gotten to the point where I just ask them to remove teeth, cause I know they will just prolong my suffering to make a dollar. On the other hand, they've done some phenomenal work, and maybe even saved my life, so Im very grateful for that.

       what sucks for some people is just genetically our teeth can be terrible, regardless of our diets and habits.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are dentists that will remove em all and give you a denture appliance of sorts, but know that those start at 1500 and go up to 100k, depending on your needs and procedure

       Yeah, my mom had dentures at 30 so I think a large part of it is genetic, however she also drank and smoked. My teeth melted away when I started to drink and smoke too, I think malnutrition, dehydration, drug abuse, high sugar diet, total lack of hygiene all contributed to my teeth problems. I literally went from having perfect teeth to massive cavities in about 1 year. Sometimes I wonder if braces damaged the enamel or roots of my teeth.

       Yeah, to me braces seem so unnatural, but I think the real issue is what causes peoples teeth to be crooked in the first place. I think it's about nutrition in the early years, both in utero and the first few years of development. If you achieve optimal levels of nutrition your jaw will be wide and your teeth will be correctly aligned, however if you don't then you end up with a narrow jaw and crooked teeth. Today people eat lots of food, but are getting less and less nutrition. As well as all those chemicals disrupting out bodies proper functions. When people take steroids, it expands their bones and jaws due to the muscles pulling on them, and I think coupled with an excellent diet, this is what allows them to function or achieve the optimal form in later stages of development. I think if people try steroids but don't eat properly it will cause major health problems.

       If your orthodontist finds cavities, he's going to send you back to the general dentist. The orthodontist will not profit from this diagnosis at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the matter is that different doctors have different criteria
 So for one doctor the tiny amount of decay is not enough to consider it a cavity, since simply brushing could potentially arrest the decay. To another doctor, they know patients aren't great with hygiene, so it is best to tell the decay now and maybe do a small filling instead of letting it get bigger and then doing a root canal or losing the tooth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth if the matter is fillings are not where dentists make their money, t is a very cheap procedure that insurance companies don't reimburse much for. If your dentist is trying to give you a filling, he/she is honestly saving you a lot more money in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this. There are 100000% some shady dentist out there. I wan to dispel the idea that there is a huge conspiracy with dentist trying to steal your money, but there are some dentist who do exactly that. Make sure you go to a trustworthy dentist, and stay away from corporate offices. This gives you the best shot of finding someone who legitimately cares about doing good work.

       I had the same thing.  Went to a new dentist, had "three cavities", he wanted all the payment upfront.  I didn't have dental at the time, so I went to my childhood dentist when I was visiting my parents. Miraculously, I had no cavities.

       Maybe it is like there are some good dentists, just like some good and bad mechanics.  Some give it to you straight, and some not.  Seems like my poor friends that use dentists that are paid by government insurance do more work... but might be that poor people let things fester longer as they don't realize it is cheaper to get it done asap.

       The one person not mentioned here is Doctor Weston Price, who found the National Dentist Association, going around the world studying how native diets maintained good dental health vs. first-generation city-folk of those same natives whose oral health went to total shit (see:

       very interesting topic as i've experienced the same thing...
      </p>
      <p>
       went to my dentist after years of not going, said i needed to get my wisdom teeth removed because they had cavities that were beyond repair. i got a second opinion - guess what - THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY CAVITIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       but it's odd, because what would my dentist have to gain by sending me to an oral surgeon? unless there was some kind of "kickback" for every customer they refer to the oral surgeon.

       Forget that. Went to a second dentist.

       She wanted to do all the X-rays from new. She was just going to take out the tooth. Gave an injection, all was fine, but my taught er panicked when her lip became numb. She said her lip feels like rubber, which is normal. The dentist refused to proceed saying she will have trauma and we should come again. Had to pay her anyway for the X-ray and consultation.
Went to her a week later again, and the same thing happened. Still had to pay her.
Asked for her to make an appointment with a dentist who uses gas. She knew one. So I took my taught er there expecting it to be a follow on.

       New dentist insisted on new X-rays. I told him to get them from the other dentist. No, he made new. Also he began like she was a new patient. After all this, she finally got in the chair and he looked inside. He somehow found another two cavities that the other two dentists missed. Then he said, ok, we are finished. I sad, what about the tooth ? He said this is just first visit, he will do the tooth next time. Also insisted that she uses toothpaste with fluoride. I told him I never use fluoride, and I have never lost a tooth or had a filling. He still insists. Charges me another hundred for this visit.

       Now after 4 dentists and 600 euros, my daughter still has her cavity.

       Dentists are also "doctors" and go through the same routine indoctrination as all MDs do.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a dentist can indeed make a great deal of money with the right kind of clientele, just as any MD can and there are probably just as many unscrupulous dentists out there who are only in it for the money as there are unscrupulous doctors out there who order completely unnecessary tests and treatments or prescribe all kinds of unnecessary drugs in order to fatten-up their bank accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most, however, are well meaning and believe in what they are doing but the onus is always on the patient to know his own body and to personally decide what they believe is or isn't good for it after reviewing as much information about their situation as they possibly can.

       I'll tell you this, in the south they are overcharging scallywags, the place near my house has advertisements on the ceiling!! Classy! I also believe many overuse x-ray, if all I want is a cleaning just clean them it should not be mandatory to get bite wings and especially is bullshit if they require a panorex.

       That's cheesy, my dentist has flat screen TV but not on the ceiling, he laughed when I told him. When I told him what they wanted to do he said "someone has a kid in college at that place". His fees for a crown are less than half of my city.

       Dentists are known for fraud. If you have a medical spending account, chances are, you would have to prepay and submit a paper form, rather than using the card associated with the MSA.  Most MSA cards won't work at dental offices.

       tl:dr : Dentist conducted research into root-canals over 25 years.  The real cause he found was bacteria.  Findings were covered up and research ignored by mainstream.
