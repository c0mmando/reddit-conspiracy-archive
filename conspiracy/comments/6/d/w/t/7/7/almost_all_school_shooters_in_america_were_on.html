       It isn't focused on as much as the violent video games and media narrative. And the little that it is discussed the "days following every shooting" nothing comes from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mainstream there is no discussion about rolling back on the amount or types of prescription medication that is available for children, rather the opposite with hormones, opiates and amphetamine becoming more available for people younger and younger.

       It's possible that in some cases the medicine does have adverse effects, the way these kinds of medications work is delicate and requires follow up and communication with trained professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       For people who don't have access to effective/consistent treatment, abuse their medication, or try to stop taking it all together abruptly there is a high probability of worsening symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not the medication causing it in the sense of the medicine being at fault, it's the medicine not being utilized correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       More often then not violent/psychotic outbursts are caused when patients go off of their medications because they feel like they don't need them anymore when they are actually serving as an important stabilizer for their extreme tendencies.

       It's been shown that many anti-depressants actually increase suicidal thoughts. It's difficult to isolate which is the larger contributing factor, but I think it's safe to say that both play a role.

       Increasing suicidal tendencies is possible, but it's also a sign the medication is not working correctly. Those are the exact kinds of symptoms that should be immediately reported to either your PCP or Psychiatrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Properly working medications will not cause that response. It's often a matter of working with your health are provider to find the type of medication and dose that works effectively for an individual.

       It's not so much about the medication working or not.  It's that any user who has been on the drug for long enough will suffer bad withdrawal when they stop dosing.  I know more than a couple people who've said getting off anti-depressants/psychotics is a horrible experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the issue linking the shooters, They go on rampages when in a state of withdrawal from the medication.

       Or the problem is over prescribing medicine just because someone got depressed one time.  Depression is normal, and most people don't need a pill to deal with it.  Plus there are plenty of stories of people still tapering off antidepressants and still having bad withdrawals.

       This... Isn't quite accurate. If you're suicidal, but also don't have enough energy to follow through, the medication sometimes "cures" the energy more quickly than the "suicidal thoughts" symptoms. In that period you may be more likely to have enough energy to go through with killing yourself, which is why *good* doctors watch patients very closely during this period

        In general, it is assumed that antidepressants are beneficial for all symptoms of depression, including suicidality. However, some evidence suggests that Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors [SSRIs] may cause worsening of suicidal ideas in vulnerable patients.

       My youngest is a mess, ended up moving to Stratera and Zoloft-plus a few others.
      </p>
      <p>
       First hand experience, he went bat-shit violent crazy within 72 hours. Suicidal and severe anger issues. He told the psychiatrist he was being pushed to hurt people. Who? Everyone.

      <p>
       Within 3 months we had to find a facility have to him locked down and get cleaned up from the meds. Now imagine that happening to an adult with access to weapons? Mental health issues are a major problem in this country.

       Why put a kid on these medicine to begin with?  We know that drugs (recreational) are bad for kids developing brains, but ssri's and the likes are all of a sudden ok?  It just never made sense to have all these chemicals affecting a growing brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drs are so quick to over prescribe and guilt their parents into using the medicine if they want to considered a good parent.  Zoloft has some horrible withdrawals and I'm sure other antidepressants does as well.

       Because we'd then have to expand the scope of our discussion to include the material conditions facing millions of working and poor people which also contributes to these tragedies. Violence -- deranged, confused, individual violence -- has existed since long before the pharmaceutical industry, though, so if we do have this discussion, we do have to move beyond simple finger-pointing. The issues dealt with herein are of a structural, not conjunctural, nature.

       Look up the statistics of people in America taking anti-psychotic. You can't just say the medicine is the main cause of it because then there would be a bunch of school shooting or shooting in general. It definitely can be a contributing factor but there is alot of variables that go into seeing if it is the main cause.

       There's no one answer to this issue.  It starts with handling mental illness.  Unfortunately we just started dismantling the mental health safety net further including programs for substance abuse at a time when they're very much needed.  No worry, though.  There will be plenty of space in our for profit prisons.

       So true.  Even at an early age, going to the Dr I always questioned why the Dr kept giving me and my siblings free trail medicine, when he said that we were all healthy kids?  This was 20+ years ago and I'm sure it is much worse.

       Between 6 out of 10 Americans, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association, or almost 7 out of 10 Americans, according to the Mayo Clinic, take prescription medication.

       I was on psych meds when i was in high school for  few months, and when i quit cold turkey my brain felt like it was on fire. I have never felt so dissociated, psychopathic, and unstable before in my life. It felt like i'd been doing some dirty speed and not sleeping for a few days, my brain just was burning and going 100mph, became very unhinged and on edge I can definitely see the correlation of kids quitting their psych meds cold turkey and doing violent acts. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the case for a few shootings.
Even when i experimented one time with a larger dose of my SSRI's, i had to be sent home from school, because i felt like i was out of my body.
I can't stress how odd it was quitting cold turkey, and i even have another friend who did the same thing and he also related to me his experience of going batshit crazy from quitting, having a similar brain on fire experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say mental illness is the foundation for these incidents, but psych meds can definitely act as a catalyst for one to become even more psychotic in some cases. The way these psych meds are prescribed so easily is evil in my opinion, and is silently ruining a lot of peoples lives.

       The first few weeks on any medication can be a roller coaster of weird thoughts and feelings. I'd say it's played a part in more then a few crimes, if your not used to your thoughts being your own and not drug fuelled then I can see people doing a lot of out of character stuff.

       Forums where people discuss coming off of benzos, or ones discussing coming off SSRIs are very interesting. Most morons would dismiss them all outright as ''just a bunch of non professionals posting random whatever''.
       <br/>
       They seem like the only places discussing such things.
       <br/>
       No mass media outlet has ever discussed benzo withdrawals.
       <br/>
       I bet that most people in the US have literally no idea that withdrawal symptoms exist with stopping the use of benzos.

       Ah..........WT actual F?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given how liberal the US medical system is with its prescribing and dispensing of opiates, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants and anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) this is startling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benzos have been reported to be far harder to quit than opiates, alcohol, methamphetamine and tobacco and reach addiction potential at a mere 6 weeks.....
      </p>
      <p>
       For a drug that is dispensed so freely in such a medicated society the level of unawareness re its addictive potential is incredibly inept in that the "health authorities" should be educating people about the associated risks of prolonged use. Actually this is r/consp. of course they wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean look at how weed is considered there both by normies and the "health authorities" generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange tension/cog. diss. between the actual reality of the two re effects and long term outcomes.....

       I was thinking about this recently. If we know to some extent how different chemicals can affect the brain in regards to depression/anxiety/paranoia/etc. Would it be safe to assume that a pill could be engineered to actually increase these symptoms instead of reduce them? And if so, how hard would it be to get those pills into the hands of someone that is already seeking treatment for such issues? Especially if they looked identical to legitimate medications. Couple that with how easy it is to target individuals with very specific advertising, (introducing different types of media to a person that might influence their beliefs) and It would seem not too far fetched that an organization with adequate resources could increase the number of shootings quite effectively. I believe that there are several people/organizations that could potentially benefit from the aftermath of these shootings. Both anti-gun advocates as well as the arms manufactures that profit from increased sales every time people begin to panic that their 2nd  ammendment rights will soon be taken away.

       We pretty much know absolutely nothing at all about the brain. we have some evidence that certain chemicals in certain people may be related to certain illnesses. We have some broad range medications which are almost no longer prescribed ( xanax, and vallium come to mind. ) which simply work on completely unrelated areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       but even if you ask the most up to date expert in neuro-chemistry or any related field as to why a SSRI works ( or why it dosnt work in some people. ) you will always get a vague answer.

       Good point. I know from my own experience that medication can have personality altering effects. A few years ago I took Adderal for ADD (not ADHD, no hyperactivity). I'm in my 40s. I am normally a very nice person (look through my posts). But while I was taking Adderal, I became a very angry person. I actually picked verbal fights with people! (And if you know me in real life, you would know this is not me at all!) I eventually put 2+ 2 together and realized it was the medication. I stopped taking it immediately. After a few days, I was back to normal.

       A much larger discussion on prescription meds needs to be had in this country. No fucking bullshit. It doesn't matter if there are links to violence. There are links to all kinds of things, and we don't know what those links mean at this point.

       Does this take into account the school shootings by black teenagers? I doubt it. Because they label it as gang violence and don't cover it. Most school shooters are not white kids on dope. Sorry

       This is why medications need to constantly be monitored and not prescribed so easily. I've been on several medications all my life for my disorders ever since I was a young child, and from my experience I can say that my medications have never been monitored enough as they should of. Medication is vital for people with illnesses regardless, but the direction pharmacies in America are taking it is only about money.

       IIRC on SSRIs big swings in medication (stopping, starting, etc.) is associated with violence, especially in adolescents. In fact there is some evidence that less violent people are more affected. Supposedly using tapering (in- or decreasing dosage slowly) should prevent this from occurring. (

       We pretty much know absolutely nothing at all about the brain. we have some evidence that certain chemicals in certain people may be related to certain illnesses. We have some broad range medications which are almost no longer prescribed ( xanax, and vallium come to mind. ) which simply work on completely unrelated areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       but even if you ask the most up to date expert in neuro-chemistry or any related field as to why a SSRI works ( or why it dosnt work in some people. ) you will always get a vague answer.
