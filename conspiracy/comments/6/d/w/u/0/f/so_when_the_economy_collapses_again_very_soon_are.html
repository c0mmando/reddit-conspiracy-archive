    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get two blocks with your &quot;guillotine&quot; before an Israeli-trained, up-armored SWAT team with &quot;Protect and Serve&quot; decals cuts you down. Know why?</p>

<ol>
<li>45% of federal taxpayers pay no taxes.<br/></li>
<li>70+% of households receive or have received government benefits.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>You&#39;re going to pitch scrapping the <em>status quo</em> to <strong>those people</strong>? What replacement are you offering?</p>

<p>Joe NASCAR and Jane Soccermom will be on the phone seein&#39; and sayin&#39; as soon as they spot &#39;troublemakers&#39;. Remember &quot;Boston Strong&quot; where they <em>cheered</em> being searched at gunpoint in their own houses? How about the 2014 Ferguson unrest, where Joe&amp;Jane were burning up the phones to Congress calling for <em>more</em> and <em>more militarized</em> police every time a black face appeared on their TV.</p>

<p>Some old Chinese Commie said &quot;The people are the sea that the revolutionary swims in&quot;. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re high and dry until things get a lot more uncomfortable for Joe&amp;Jane. </p>

<p>The trouble with OP&#39;s scenario is that it&#39;ll already be too late to generate popular support for the &#39;resistance&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People will be too scared and confused to organize into doing anything. People will be trying to buy groceries; they will be standing in line at banks to rescue their deposits. A curfew will be implemented, and everyone will obey. They will do so because the government will tell them that if they &quot;behave&quot;, the government will fix the problem. By the time everybody figures out that they have been lied to, it will be too late. People will lose everything. They will lose their homes, their savings, their cars, etc. There will be a federal law banning being homeless. If you can&#39;t afford to pay rent in one of &quot;Bloomberg&#39;s Apartments&quot; then you will have to live in a government facility where it is a safe and you have a meal. There is nothing to stop what is coming. People have to learn the hard way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Plan&quot; was submitted years ago on the net by a gentleman named Art Miller. He worked most of his life for the Treasury Department and he posted on the net &quot;The Treasury Department&#39;s Plan When the Dollar Collapses&quot;. Art told people on the net to make a copy as quick as possible because every time he posted the plan, the Feds took it down. He was dying of cancer, and he wanted people to know what was going to take place. The &quot;Plan&quot; is some pretty scary shit. But, I don&#39;t think the majority of Gentiles would care, even if they knew.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what jurisdiction does the Treasury Department have over the National Guard? Seems like if anything this would have been done by FEMA which was established by Carter. Why does a plan submitted by the Treasury have no mention of methods which the Treasury themselves could actually undertake? e.g. printing new currency etc? i tried DDG this and didnt get any hits on any of it. </p>

<p>Germany will probably be the catalyst that puts China in the drivers seat through the climate change meetings. (My theory)</p>

<p>Regardless of what Germany says politically about Russia, trade between the two countries is fairly healthy.</p>

<p>Merkel has already made a public statement regarding the US, pretty much saying the EU will have to go its own way.</p>

<p>Why would that concern you? The leadership of both nations is far more virtuous than the disgusting perverts in Washington and London.</p>

<p>Germany is basically a puppet of the US-UK banker&#39;s regime. Look into Operation Gladio. Around the time of the Berlin wall, we shut down their attempts to go on their own and engage in real economic development, by murdering the economic minister.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I&#39;ve studied Gladio. Mainly Sibel Edmonds. I&#39;m concerned, because as a US citizen I will be dramatically affected.</p>

<p>Important thing to note...China, Russia and Germany have focused on acquiring gold as of late.</p>

<p>Most of Germany&#39;s was owed to them, but they made a pretty big stink about it to make it happen.</p>

<p>The US and UK have proven to the global community that they can&#39;t be trusted to honor any type of foreign relations agreement in the long run.</p>

<p>Their Middle East strategy is unrealistic, will not achieve any type of stability, quite the opposite. Nonetheless, I believe they will pursue it.</p>

<p>It will bankrupt the US and take decades to recover from.</p>

<p>The pursuit of oil is a dead-end. We should have taken the trillions we spent on the Middle East and used it on solar and wave energy.</p>

<p>Coal is a dead end. Even China realizes it. They used their fast and furious coal powered manufacturing period to put themselves in a position to change technologies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not too hopeful at this point for the US. </p>

<p>Seriously, if it happens again we all have to come together, show respect towards one another and peacefully march to the capital. Other countries have done so (think Brazil, South Korea, Venezuela). It&#39;s time we Westerners wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I think that the internet is so controlled that there isn&#39;t even a way for momentum to happen to occur.  I think chances are the things going viral are more for our distraction but if we wanted to try to make a change by banding together, our communication would be throttled. I SINCERELY hope I&#39;m wrong and would happy to be proven such. This country is in some major hurt and is MUCH different now than before the shitstorm of &#39;08.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!” Rev 6:6 ESV. A denarius is a standard days wages, a quart of wheat is around 3600 calories, 3 quarts of barley roughly 10,800 calories. This means food will be so expensive a minimum wage laborers entire pay will go to feeding their family. Notice the oil and wine (luxury foods in that time for the more wealthy) are to remain untouched. The poor will suffer greatly, the wealthy will hardly have to adjust their lifestyles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree. I&#39;ve studied Gladio. Mainly Sibel Edmonds. I&#39;m concerned, because as a US citizen I will be dramatically affected.</p>

<p>Important thing to note...China, Russia and Germany have focused on acquiring gold as of late.</p>

<p>Most of Germany&#39;s was owed to them, but they made a pretty big stink about it to make it happen.</p>

<p>The US and UK have proven to the global community that they can&#39;t be trusted to honor any type of foreign relations agreement in the long run.</p>

<p>Their Middle East strategy is unrealistic, will not achieve any type of stability, quite the opposite. Nonetheless, I believe they will pursue it.</p>

<p>It will bankrupt the US and take decades to recover from.</p>

<p>The pursuit of oil is a dead-end. We should have taken the trillions we spent on the Middle East and used it on solar and wave energy.</p>

<p>Coal is a dead end. Even China realizes it. They used their fast and furious coal powered manufacturing period to put themselves in a position to change technologies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not too hopeful at this point for the US. </p>
