        Mars/Moon/Space anomalies from NASA photos - the best evidence.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ladies and gentlemen, space enthusiasts and good people of Reddit. If you would permit me, I would like to engage your brains, and your eyes, for a few moments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my current complete collection of images of space anomalies. To the best of my knowledge, all of these pictures originally were released by NASA or JPL, with the exception of a few low res photos taken by the soviet lunar probe from the 1970's, and a photo of the earth pyramid in Bosnia that doesn't really belong in the folder but I'm going to leave anyway.
      </p>
      <p>

        https://imgur.com/a/mg2xI
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What do these images show?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       These are photos of objects and structures that indicate intelligent design. Most of them appear to be ancient and in ruin. The vast majority of the images are from Mars, from the Opportunity and no longer functioning Spirit rovers, as well as the Mars global surveyor orbital satellite. Of the remaining images, most are from Earth's moon, some from comet 67-p, one of an object on Eros, one of Buzz Aldrin's 'monolith' on Phobos, two of the surface of Venus, and two objects captured by the ISS feed that look like craft (terrestrial craft, to my eyes - most likely classified and made by skunkworks. No need to assume aliens! Included because NASA refuses to comment on them). With or without official confirmation, it is entirely up to the viewer to decide if the images are artificial or natural, though in my experience even the most buttoned down of believers in the idea that we are alone and that no evidence from exploration of our system exists to suggest otherwise are at a loss to explain some of the things in the images presented here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do these photos prove the existence of aliens?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a mistake to assume so. The simplest, most logical explanation is that in the distant past, humans had reached a level of technological development sufficient to colonize the solar system before being nearly wiped out, most likely by the same event that decimated Mars and left it a desert planet where once had been oceans. There are many natural and man made disasters that could wipe out our civilization and send the survivors back to the Stone Age, some of which we couldn't have imagined a generation or two ago. It is quite possible, judging from these photos, that the human race originated from Mars instead of Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do these photos belong in r/space?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely. All of these photos originate from official sources, any that are discovered to be hoaxes I will remove. Many reference the official source #, though some do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Are these photos enhanced?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are. Most are magnified from the original source. Whenever possible, I have included multiple image views of the same object for comparison's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Enhanced" means the images have been monkeyed with to make it seem like something instead of nothing.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It can mean that. For comparison I offer a 'pareidolia' if you will, of a sculpture in front of a cliff face. When I look at it I see a badly eroded figure of a human female with a baby at breast.  (
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LywlLZD.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/LywlLZD.jpg
       </a>
       ) In the enhancement, I still see an ancient statue of a woman with babe at breast, but the picture has been cleaned up a bit. A different 'enhancement' from an overly enthusiastic online UFO rag reveals a painted scene of a buff blond Martian dude with the 'baby' morphed into a green lizard bursting out of his stomach(
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ycb3CUZ.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/ycb3CUZ.jpg
       </a>
       ). The picture makes a good contrast to the other, so I left it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What about the pareidolia argument? Aren't you just seeing what you want to see?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pareidolia doesn't apply to geometry. Geometrical forms in images can easily be measured and confirmed. For the most part, the pareidolia argument was used against faces, starting with the original cydonia face imaged by the Viking orbiter in the 1970's. The weight of argument for artificial constructs lies with the many instances of circles, squares, rectangles, spheres, cubes (boxes), isosceles and equilateral triangles, pyramids, tetrahedrons and other geometric forms. The number of perfectly aligned 90 degree angles forming vertices to be found from the rover photos alone is enough to make case for artificiality.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Are there photos of faces or figures here?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. When I first began collecting images of anomalies, I deliberately avoided pictures of faces or of humanoid figures, focusing instead on geometry. Over time, however, the weight of compelling examples of faces or figures that were clear and in focus led me to decide that it would be a disservice not to include them. I draw no conclusions and make no claims about what these actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Are you affiliated with the Mars Moon Space web group?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       No, though I do follow them on Facebook. You will find some of their images here.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Where did you get these images?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Most from Facebook groups, some from websites found via google image searches for "Mars anomalies", etc. In some cases I tracked down and cropped the image personally from the original NASA pics. A few others were taken directly from NASA sites as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        These are just photos of rocks!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah. Mostly. For an image to be included it had to have something interesting, but it could just be a rock with a 90 degree angle in a field of other ordinary looking rocks. If I had a talent for visual interpretation I might be working for a defence contractor analyzing satellite data. I don't, something has to show up clearly for my untrained eye to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        How many images are there in the collection?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 1200 and counting, with more being added as I get them. I know there are doubles, but it would be too much work to sort through and delete them. The best ones should still catch the eye and appear artificial with a rapid scan of the thumbnails. At some point I may whittle them down to the 100 or so best ones and repost.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What do some of the most compelling ones show?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Buildings, most looking like ancient ruins or foundations, some looking modern and intact.  Various pieces of decaying machinery, at least 3 small boat hulls, at least 3 rectangular 'cave' doorways cut into mountainsides, a wire brush, a handgun, cannon turrets and artillery pieces, military style helmets, tanks, symbols and letters etched into rock (the letter z appears multiple times), two examples of threaded machined screws, boxes crumbling as well as relatively intact, a metal finger ring with a setting for a stone, an object that looks like a toilet seat, another that resembles a birdhouse, two examples of an ornate sarcophagus, vehicles, plants, animal corpses, bones and footprints, water both running and stagnant, stairs, a spoon, an Egyptian ankh or Celtic cross, 3 Christian style crosses, numerous stone and glass spheres of various sizes, metal tubes and pipes, a shoe, artistic rock carvings of various subjects, many more broken bits and pieces of things whose function is unclear. The number 58 appears to show up in satellite photos of both Mars and our moon. If I had to pick a single image to make the argument for artificiality, it would be the orbital photo of the circular building with window bays jutting out from the top of a cliffside that closely resembles the Jupiter II spacecraft from the old Lost in Space TV series (
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/CtCCMXj.png">
        https://i.imgur.com/CtCCMXj.png
       </a>
       being circular, it often gets referred to as a "crashed UFO"). From the rover it would be the large instillation in the distance laid out in a distinct 90 degree angle at the foot of Mt.Sharp (
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kqbuXkS.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/kqbuXkS.jpg
       </a>
       ). Multiple images of both anomalies are included, adjusting the colour and contrast can really bring out the outlines of faraway buildings and is used often.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why are you posting this?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I want answers. I want to know everything I can about this lost civilization. Even if the people who built these things were not human, the overwhelming evidence indicates we were and are more alike than unalike. Their history is our history. I think it's time for the human race to grow up and face the truth about itself, whatever it may be, and start dealing with it. Considering the amount that this knowledge could disrupt all of human culture, it's not surprising that the US government is remaining silent. Consider for a moment the effect of finding a vast archive of knowledge recovered from an ancestral space faring civilization and releasing it to the public would be. It would change everything, but I think it worth the potential risk. This is reclaiming our own heritage, and even if the majority of Earth's people were to focus on learning about the extraterrestrial cultures of the ancient past (or present), interest in preserving our own terrestrial culture and history will never die out, as long as our civilization continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a few of these images have become well known and are generating interest online, hence this post. There are new ones being found every day, the curiosity rover is still working at this time. It is my hope that the best of these get widely distributed in the interest of creating serious debate among scientists and laypersons without accusations of being mentally deficient or sniggering comments regarding tinfoil hats and anal probes, etc.
      </p>

       Thank you for your time, and thanks in advance to the mods of r/space for not deleting this post (posted on Sunday in accordance with the rules). I understand the cognitive dissonance and stress to the brain that these images can cause to humans regardless of one's personal beliefs. However this is the twenty-first century, is it not? Science fiction has been a popular genre in entertainment for over a century now, we should be able to get over any conflict with our primitive pre-spacefaring notions and start boldly going forward. If we refuse to confront the discoveries we find out there and the implications they have for humanity, we might as well believe that the earth is both flat and the entire universe, cease exploration altogether and just stay away from the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: as expected, the mods at r/space had the post removed within half an hour. No message or explanation. Sigh.

       Wow, that's quite the list. Pretty high quality post. What's your take on the whole Mars thing? Do you have any theory? Do you gravitate towards the anomalies being in fact on mars, or more towards them being a result of the images not having been taken on mars (I'm a pretty big Mars skeptic myself).

       Oh, I think it's really Mars, alright. I do think that the loose wreckage appears to be closer to  10k years old rather than the 65 million years proposed by Richard  Hoagland and others. Just my unqualified  opinion.

       The whole premise may be ludicrous, we all know the earth is flat and mars/moon are illusions, but still good work.

       You're really saying that for thousands of years the moon, stars, and planets have been illusions. Projected by what exactly and why? Why is it we just got the ability to create colored television less than 100 years ago but have had the technology to project a universe since before history?
      </p>
      <p>
       And who exactly profits off of this? Has there been a lineage which dates back farther than the Antediluvian period that somehow has been able to dupe the entire world while keeping it secret and staying out of the limelight?

       I do agree though, this is a great and high content post, we need more like these, even if they're absolutely insane.

        document
       </a>
       recently digitized on the CIA archive site that describe a remote viewing session performed in 1984 with a target of
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YAnX0Ul.png">
        Mars 1 million years BC
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As they move the viewer (who I believe to have been Ingo Swann, but not sure) around through space and time in Mars, they bring him/her to coordinates that line up to Cydonia where they see pyramids and other large structures. They then describe an impeding disaster where a group escapes to what appears to be Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've done some amazing work here, and regardless if the CIA's experiments were bogus or not (which they themselves say were a resounding success), this is valuable to understanding our real past so thank you. This general idea fits into Graham Hancock's work as well.

       Thanks, but credit for the work goes to the anomaly hunters pouring over the raw gigapans looking for anything unusual, and the image enhancement specialists Martine Grainey and Rami Bar Ilan for distributing their work on Facebook.

       The timeline is perhaps the most interesting question here. When was Mars last a living, flourishing world? What happened? These and other questions gnaw at me ceaselessly, and anything I can do to generate interest in this line of inquiry I will do.

       Plz don't downvote me - I had heard that the CIA was performing disinformation toward the Soviets because they wanted them to believe we had an army of psychics so they would create false instances such as the Mars Remote Viewing session. Though I know there's a video of the guy who claims to be the remote viewer (and I whole heartedly believe Mars had advanced life), it is a plausible debunk theory.

       Definitely plausible, but Russell Targ himself was one of the experimenters at SRI and he to this day defends the accuracy of the experiments. You can watch his banned tedx talk where he discusses some of the results. I also read one of his books which definitely have it some credence in my eyes, but you're right that there's no way of knowing without more testing.

       I also think it's interesting that the US would go that route for disinfo as opposed to maybe leaking fake high tech weaponry like powerful lasers or even remote mind control with psychics. It's strange that they would choose such a specific instance with Mars, and go into such detail with what the viewer experienced. I mean reading it felt almost too real to be able to fake with scifi writing.

       Might I remind the gentlemen of this subreddit that interest in geology does not necessarily make one a nerd and therefore the subject of henpecking from über nerds involved in the hard sciences. As explained in the prologue, there exists indeed a rare feast for the eyes for those of us with a keen interest in the burgeoning field of exo - geology. It's still science. And might I suggest as an intellectual exercise for those without a passion for geology, to try and look for an example of geometric form or partial form hidden among them there ordinary rocks. Think of it as kind of "Where's Waldo" but with rocks. Are you worried this might distract people from other, more important subjects here? Nothing to see here folks, just rocks. Satisfied?

       The things you see in those photos were never meant to be seen by us, and could very well be signs of semi-intelligent life: human life right here on earth. Have you considered the chance there may be no probes or rovers really out there, and all of these could be taken on earth deserts or Devon island, Canada, where they "practice" the Mars rover, similar to how they "practice" spacewalks on the ISS in a scuba tank?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is more likely? That governments continue to lie and scam us and that the one Mars photo with the squirrel is really a picture of a desert in Southwestern USA and was a mistake by the photo editors? Or that the squirrel is really an alien on Mars? Maybe one will have a McDonalds cheeseburger wrapper, and then you'll surely agree with me.

       That we all can agree on. I used to believe in these images before the space agencies lost my trust, and I thought the pictures may be faked or taken on earth because it's a big scam. Then I considered they may be throwing bits here and there in pictures like bones, faces, pyramids, right angles, wreckage etc, as part of some plan which may lead to either bullshit disclosure at best, or false flag fake alien invasions at worst. Either way, I won't believe them.

       That would be funny, but the usual NASA apologists around here will have some excuse why it's there. "Oh
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       was taken on Devon Island, but the others are real, we swear!" Considering all they get away with it, it won't make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the Chinese Moon pictures posted yesterday, I put the pictures in my PS and changed the levels. I saw in the black background there were straight cut-out shapes, as if someone had lazily used the square lasso to cut out the background, and used paint bucket tool to make it look like pure black. Also, a plateau shape (table maybe) appeared in the black space background. I don't know if these are evidence of faking the pictures, and I could be wrong, but even if they are, there's always shills and excuses. They say things like "Oh there were real pictures of the earth or from the real Moon, they just wanted to touch them up to make them look pretty (for some reason)."

       Yes and no. I believe all photos of the earth are composite photos, taken from high-altitude flights. There is reason to believe satellites and anything else purportedly in orbit, are not really in orbit, if they are there at all.

      <p>
       Most pictures and video of (space) rockets being launched that I've seen very quickly arc until they are horizontal seemingly to a similar altitude as the high-altitude flights. Then the various stages of those rockets then separate and land in the ocean, as usual. I've seen the videos of non-government rockets that go straight up and they never get very high, supposedly 60 miles, but the high detail of the terrain below suggests to me that it's probably not much higher than high altitude balloon flights, around 20 miles.

       Past us may have develop our current level of tech (on its own). They attempted to colonize mars which was successful to some extent(?)
      </p>
      <p>
       But some thing happened which fucked up the Earth human society badly enough for them to lose all progress which in turn makes the Mars "colony" slowly waste away

       There are many possibilities that present themselves. The number of examples of recognizable numbers, letters and symbols is particularly baffling and would be something one would expect from a science fiction story, yet there they are:

       I thought this post was excellent. As far as friendly constructive criticism goes, I'd suggest more captions to try to let people know why you've selected each photo for your collection. I'd love to see a top 100. Thanks!

       If anything, it proves that none of these pictures were taken on Mars or the moon. Much more probable than any ancient advanced beings having been there before.

       In terms of pure probability? Given the distances involved, etc, surely it's more likely that they filmed it on earth and overlooked these smoking guns?

       I believe humans have been around for a lot longer than we're told, for sure, and that they've attained some heights, but travelling to Mars I don't believe, and the "pyramids" and "face" at Cydonia is a pile of shite.

       Mars was like our civilization millions of years ago but they destroyed themselves because they were very aggressive and they were constantly fighting each other (that's why Greeks/Roman called Mars 'God of War').
      </p>
      <p>
       Some martians had survived and they came to the Earth and they tried to not only survive but control it. It's a long story but check for Drunvalo Melchizedek - 'The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life' 1/2.

       being circular, it often gets referred to as a "crashed "
The surrounding landscape around Jupiter2 is an exact match.

       Are there any examples of perfect geometrical natural formations on earth? Like triangles and right angles, etc. Because if there are not, then that would make the Mars anomalies more intriguing and believable as human creations.
