       </a>
       during Sunday's This Week with George Stephanopoulos was eye opening. The narrative of Trump-Russian "collusion" has evolved now to any mere
       <em>
        semblance
       </em>
       of impropriety beyond Trump-Russian collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't find any evidence so they are moving on to uncovering ANYTHING and making a mountain out of a mole hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention to the "He's right" line.

       While this is true, if they did something wrong, there should be punishment.  This President chose not to divest assets, release tax returns or stop profiting from the Presidency.  As a result he's got no one but himself to blame for putting his own interests above the American people.

       Do you not understand what's going on? They are using the fake Trump-Russia narrative as a guise to unseat a sitting president for any mere impropriety. If ANY, ANY, former president were held under the same light and had the same teams—the intelligence community, the elite establishment and the mainstream media—working together to unseat him then any administration would fall.

       This is a silent coup.

       It's actually a pretty loud coup.  Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one.  He made very few friends on his way to that office, insulting everyone along the way.  Shocking that they're readily willing to turn on him for his behavior.  I love that "mere impropriety" is okay with you.  Stop downplaying crimes and love your country over one man.  Checks, meet balances.

       Do you deny that any of the other 44 presidents in our histort could have also been undermined and unseated given the same scrutiny?

      <p>
       When our elected officials are subject to political hitjobs by the unelected then we aren't a Republic any more. When our elected officials can be blackmailed and held hostage or be subjected to political witch hunts if they don't tow the line is when America isn't America any more.

       You're calling it a coup.  This is, in reality, checks and balances.  No one branch of government or person should be unquestioned or all powerful regardless of how much you happen to like them.
       <br/>
       Let's look at WHY he has a special counsel.
       <br/>
       1.  He fired Comey and said Russia was on his mind when he did it.
       <br/>
       2.  His comms department threw Rosenstein under the bus implying it was him who initiated the firing.
       <br/>
       3.  Rosenstein not wanting to be implicated (because he knew Trump was firing Comey before he sent the memo they were going to use as justification) assigned a special counsel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we are, now.  Who fired Comey?  Who didn't get the message straight?  Who said Russia was on their mind.
       <br/>
       He gave them all the justification they need to investigate.

       Point 1. is way out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump says something like he doesn't like that Comey went along with the Russia narrative since it was made up by the DNC. Also at this point it is clear that Comey wasn't investigating Trump for Russian collusion considering he explicitly said that in the firing letter and Comey has yet to deny it.

       This is about people close to Trump potentially committing crimes.  You should be in favor of those people being caught for possibly trying to manipulate the POTUS and undermine his Presidency and so should he.
       <br/>
       Instead, he's used to getting his way with everything like in his businesses so he asked them to stop the investigation which is a no no.  Then he fired the person who wanted to impartially investigate.   It just doesn't look good at all.  It's why we're where we are at with a special counsel.

       Yes, the rabid onslaught of hysteria by the corporate media to influence and sway the populace, the politically motivated leakings of classified information by Obama administration officials, and the McCarthy era style of creating fear of Russians and the appearance of even being seen talking to a Russian means you

       So when Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress and admitted presenting false evidence to Congress and was held in CONTEMPT by Congress, that's nothing campared to "OMG! Sessions spoke to the Russian ambassador twice in his capacity as a Senator! OMG! Treason!"

       The justification to investigate a crime is evidence of a crime. There isn't evidence of a crime. You are mixing your narratives up.

       You're going to keep making excuses for him.  I can see that.  Truthfully each side can look at a situation differently but no one is above the law including the President.  I fully expect Mueller to follow the law, find facts and reach a fair conclusion.  It could well exhonerrate everyone and I'd accept that.  I'm glad that justice will be served and the government is working the way the founders designed it.

       Rosenstein was being prudent.  The White House Comms team put out a false narrative.

       What recent two year long FBI investigation involved people invoking the 5th Amendment and the Justice Department handing out immunity deals?

      <p>
       Right, the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Who went to jail? No one. But wait, using your logic if there is an investigation and people invoke the 5th Amendment that means a crime has actually been committed and there's evidence.

       The Reagan election team for colluding with Iran to continue to hold the hostages,

       And what looks like evidence of the W. Bush Administration collusion with Israel and the Saudis for 9/11.  (Note these nations are both allies, so they were not colluding with enemy nations.)
       <br/>
       Yes they all should have been punished, only Nixon was and for another reason, that reason was covering up the burglary of the Democratic Party's Office in the Watergate building and the recording where he requested that the IRS be used to harm his political opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Adm seems to have colluded with a nation that is openly hostile to the U.S. both for election meddling, (Russia did meddle) no proof given yet about actual collusion but the back door communications is shocking and un-precedented.
      </p>

       Russia is not an ally they are actively hostile to U.S. and our EU allies.

       You can keep thinking it is all a witch hunt and what wil you think if it is proven that they were intending to work together against U.S. interests and against our current allies, while not advising the U.S. Citizens.

       What did I write that seemed to float directly over your head? This:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        could have also been undermined and unseated given the same levels of scrutiny?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The intelligence community. The establishment. The media. All working in tandem to unseat a president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Reagan have all three against him? Bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.

      <p>
       And you blather on and on. This is like a murder investigation where there is zero evidence against the accused and where there actually hasn't even been a murder. 😂

       Don't worry. There have been many "silent coups" in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       1876 -- Republicans lost both the popular vote and electoral vote, but set up a scheme to steal the White House -- and succeeded. The people did not like it and brought the former incumbent back in 1880.
      </p>
      <p>
       1896 -- Republicans and Oligarchs joined together to illegally and secretly fund a coup. This time, they threatened workers and literally
       <em>
        watched
       </em>
       them vote under threat of unemployment -- and succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       1933 -- Oligarchs planned to send 500,000 men to remove popularly elected Democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt. Traitor to the traitors, General Smedley Butler exposed the scheme. Coup failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       1968 -- Republicans secretly negotiated with North Vietnam to sabotage peace process. Richard Nixon elected. Coup succeeded. (Not to mention the assassination of Robert Kennedy in June.)
      </p>
      <p>
       1972 -- Republican operatives and Watergate. Coup succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       1980 -- Republican VP candidate George Bush made a secret deal with hostage holding Iran to keep the hostages until after the election. Coup succeeded. Incredibly, hostages were released within minutes of Reagan inauguration.
      </p>
      <p>
       2000 -- Republican partisan Supreme Court voted 5-4 to override state law and stop a the vote count, declaring George W. Bush president. Coup succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       2004 -- Republican operatives gamed election in both Ohio and Florida, stealing both states. Coup succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       2016 -- Republican operatives illegally purged voter lists and took full advantage of 5-4 Supreme Court coup against voting rights act. Coup succeeded.

       Kennedy? That's it? That's all you got?
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Nixon pursued recounts. After early tests, Republicans did not like the results, so they had to swallow the loss. So that was another attempt by Republicans at a "secret coup." That one failed ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        GOP leaders had reason to conduct even a doomed campaign. Even if they ultimately lost, they reasoned, they could still taint Kennedy's victory. They could claim he had no mandate, galvanize their rank and file and build a winning issue for upcoming elections.

       But then, JFK was assassinated -- arguably the top conspiracy ever discussed here. Some thought that VP Lyndon Johnson would be more willing to support the oligarchs, as he was a southerner from Texas and had once campaigned for segregation. Whoops, they were wrong. Turns out Johnson carried out the economic and social agenda of Kennedy.

       Here's two more:
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1868, Republicans impeached Democrat Andrew Johnson for refusing to apply a law. He was almost removed. Later, the Supreme Court determined that Andrew Johnson was correct and the Republicans were wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1998, after years of investigating under an "independent counsel" law, Republican Kenneth Starr finally found a reason to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton -- lying about a blow job. Knowing they did not have the vote count for removal, they impeached him anyway for a political propaganda "silent coup." After Bill Clinton was not removed, the Supreme Court declared the law permitting Kenneth Starr to investigate to be unconstitutional.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sure you can't think of any time that Democrats did anything like these things that I listed?

       Reading over your list I realize you don't even understand what coup means. And you forget that Democrats in the 1800s and 1900s aren't in any way—ideological or otherwise—the same as Democracts today or the last 30 years. Nice try though. It looked good because it was a wall of text.

       No it is not legal.  The Logan Act says it is illegal for a private citizen to  meet with a foreign government and that

       [McMaster, a decorated three-star Army general, was asked whether he would be concerned if an official on his National Security Council staff or elsewhere in the Trump administration sought a back-channel communications system with the Russian embassy or the Kremlin in Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No,” McMaster said. “We have back-channel communications with a number of countries. So, generally speaking, about back-channel communications, what that allows you to do is to communicate in a discreet manner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       He continued, “No, I would not be concerned about it.”](

       And people seem to forget that podesta and hillary had always used "Trump is too close to Russia" as a strategy since the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       And within 24 hours of Hillary's loss, whistleblowers demonstrated that "Trump and Russia colluded to win the election" became the MSM talking points.

       That's the line now but you can go back and look at articles with dates to June and July of last year right after Wikileaks released the DNC emails and there are quotes from Clinton's campaign manager pushing the narrative even back then.

       I feel that they "can't touch this" because they would have to go after Kushner, who is the "Russian contact" at the heart of everything. It's "hands-off" where Kushner is concerned. I laugh at how the liberal media goes easy on Kushner; even The Young Turks kiss his ass when his name is brought up. It's hilarious! The administration will have to come up with a "fall guy" to take the blame for the whole thing to protect Kushner (Bannon? Now, wouldn't that be a riot?). If I was in Trump's inner-circle, I would be real nervous right now. It's like reading a murder mystery and wondering "Who done it?"

       The Logan Act is from 1799. No one has ever been prosecuted under it. Every upcoming administration talks potential policy with foreign officials before the inauguration. Kid yourself and think otherwise.
