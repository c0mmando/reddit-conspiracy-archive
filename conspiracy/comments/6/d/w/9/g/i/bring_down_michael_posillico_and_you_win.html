        Every email hosted by Wikileaks from Michael Posillico's U.S. State Department email address
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why Michael Posillico? Two fold:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.)
       <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-posillico-8a86b579">
        32 years and counting as Senior Advisor in the Office of Protective Intelligence at Diplomatic Security Service in the State Department.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Translation: He's the guy who puts CIA operatives into our overseas embassies and consulates abroad under cover as diplomats and State Department employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) He was integral in the State Department's role on 9/11 and in matters like Benghazi. Posillico is also how the Awan brothers got their fraudulent diplomatic passports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact of the matter is, however, that he was careless when emailing with Stratfor (CIA, Inc.) about highly sensitive (and often illegal) matters and operations. Oh yeah, he's also heavily connected to the Bonnano Crime Family.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, we used his email as an integral piece in the Twitter blitz which got Comey X'ed. Here's how.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       If you can, go back and find a recording of the Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee Hearing from two days after Comey was fired. They spent a good 30 minutes talking about citizen activism via OSINT gathering being a factor in Comey's firing. Then go take a look at what we started blasting out on Twitter at 6:00 AM EST the morning Comey was fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no coincidences in politics and the Trump administration has more leaks in it than the Titanic. If Comey's firing had been pre-meditated, it would have leaked to the press. It never did, hence why everyone was blindsided.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what would be so jarring as to get Comey fired?
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence we tweeted that morning to Trump, Putin, Medvedev, Assange, Wikileaks, Pieczenick and Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a serial tweeter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin and Medvedev were having an "off day" while enjoying Russia's annual VE Day Parade (meaning they and their aides were going to see the Twitter blast)
      </p>
      <p>
       Pieczenick has Trump's ear
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange and Wikileaks were insurance in case nothing came of it
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary was tagged because Michael J. Posillico, 32 year State Department veteran and member of the Bonnano Crime Family,
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/37/379092_fw-wtc-i-.html">
        sent this email to Stratfor in 2010 under Hillary's watch
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Translation? Posillico fucked up by sending that email unencrypted and by inference, deduction, analysis and additional research we concluded the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The U.S. State Department was involved with the execution of 9/11 via Posillico.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Posillico used Stratfor ("CIA, Inc."), his Sicilian Mafia ties to enlist the help of the Russian Mafia (which is really just the Jewish Mafia), and one of Marvin Bush's companies in order to quietly get Mossad operatives the required construction permits to rig WTC I, WTC II, WTC 4, and WTC 7 with explosives for the days of the attacks.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How'd Posillico do this? His family owns a construction company heavily involved with the Bonnano Crime Family. A few bribes here, a few bribes there and boom, you've got a construction permit for Mossad operatives masquerading as "Israeli Art Students"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hillary knew about all of this because her and Bill were involved in carrying out 9/11. Whether willingly or unwillingly, I don't know and don't care. All I know is that Bill's victory in the 92 election royally fucked up H.W.'s plan.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Comey was appointed as US District Attorney for the Southern District of NY under W. Bush. Comey knew the truth about 9/11 and, whether by coercion through threats of violence or of his own accord, he covered the asses of everyone involved within our government who carried out 9/11 and murdered 3,500 innocent people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On 9/11 and in the weeks after, Trump himself claimed there was no way a plane could have taken down the towers and that people saw explosions shortly before the towers collapsed. Trump lost a lot of friends on 9/11 and he's been out for blood for 16 years.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why do you think Jeb! was so desperate to become the GOP nominee? Because he handed Florida to his brother in the 2000 election. If Al Gore had won, 9/11 most likely never happens. To ensure 9/11 would happen, George W. Bush
         <strong>
          <em>
           had
          </em>
         </strong>
         to win in 2000. The New World Order was a few hanging chads away from collapsing. Maybe now this offers context to why Scalia died of a "heart attack" with a pillow over his face while at a hunting ranch and spa in brush country of Texas. It should also explain why an autopsy wasn't conducted. Scalia was about to blow the whistle on everything.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for Pieczenick have Trump's ear, we need to address their relationship. Pieczenick is ex CIA. He and Trumo knew each other back in the day through Trump's uncle. Trump's uncle was a Professor of Physics at MIT and Pieczenick was get ing his PhD at MIT while getting his MD at Harvard. Trump's uncle introduced Donald to Piczenick and they stayed in touch over the years. Pieczenick and other white hats in the USIC (current and former) started their "quiet revolution" in 2015 and ultimately, through Pieczenick, recruited Trump to run for POTUS. These were the "better sources of information" to which Trump made reference on the campaign trail when he refused daily intel briefs and knocked the Joint Chiefs of Staff and JSOC.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When we found that Posillico email, we knew it would be the move  for Trump to get Comey off the board and deliver a serious blow to The Deep State / Shaddow Government....IF the information got to the right people simultaneously and at the right time for all to read the tweets.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Putin and Medvedev were added as additional insurance because had Trump done nothing, Putin would have blackmailed him or would have gone ape shit on the United States in a very public manner to the rest of the world.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everything we did was to ensure that the only realistic option for Trump was to fire Comey.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now the FBI rank and file are free to do their jobs without restriction (comparatively speaking) and leaks re: Seth Rich are flowing like the leaks at the Oroville Dam.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That, my friend, is how you use the USIC playbook against The Deep State. That's "16-D Chess".
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and white hats within the USIC quickly discerned this was our move because they're trained to quickly analyze situations in such a way. "Who? What? When? Where? Why?". They answered those questions and figured out our logic...and that's how we started getting "walk in" sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you still do not trust me, then there's little hope you ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never underestimate what a few people can do when they're so fed up with the bullshit that they take matters into their own hands without care for their own safety. 🥃

       Sorry for the delay... I got sucked into a Benghazi rabbit hole... these documents led to a private security firm named "Blue Mountain Group" that has plenty of interesting stuff going on... I'm not sure where it is gonna lead me yet... but I think maybe they hired on terrorists as guards at Benghazi? Something weird was up with them... they are primarily interested in money and not talking to the press from what I see in the state dept documents... but I haven't gone off and Googled anything about them yet.

       Ah yes. A few months ago there were articles/reports of how hillary authorized that small relatively unknown British company to handle security at the embassy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going off of memory, they then they put ads in the paper there and hired locals without background checks. Some of those that were hired had clear ties to al qaeda in the area..
      </p>
      <p>
       The insinuation being that the attack was a setup..

         Trump is being negatively influenced by Kushner and since Kushner is a Zionist, this is bad. How can we overcome Kushner? Is Kushner a plant or just a sympathizer? I just can't see Trump fucking over the whole world for Kushner even though it's his son in law.

         On a scale of 1-10, how panicky are the elite right now? I'm guessing 6.5 since they still seem to have time on their hands.

       It's not PGP.  The == at the end shows that it is uuencoded.  Search

       From a friend recently in Jordanian intel:
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;&lt;this guy was found drunk in little manila downtown Amman the eastern
part and he dared the people that he can walk on the rail thats why he
fell from the third floor there was no criminal act in the subject &gt;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       He tends to tell the truth, no matter how painful, so I am wondering as
to whether or not the cover up is all-inclusive? Or perhaps this was
truly a mishap?

       I understand that overseas embassies serve another purpose as a sort of "spy hub" for our foreign intelligence. I've always wondered though how many of our "diplomats" are really employed for diplomatic purposes or are CIA assets (spies) whose sole purpose is to go undercover, collect intel, "take care" of things/people.

       I'm going to share something with you. In the summer of 2001 in The Oregonian...under personal ads.

      <p>
       Coded communications between a number of users.

       They all had "Autumn" before a number...ranging from 10 - 19.

       It made the news not long after 9/11.

       Wouldn't surprise me given that Oregon itself was intended to be a Third Reich style land long before the Third Reich came into existence.

       For such a beautiful state, hipsters there don't seem to understand the dark origins of Oregon. It truly was meant to be the American experiment for an Aryan Nation.

       My father's side of the family moved there in the 1850s. When I lived there...on the coast in a very small town, I found out it was a retirement area for ex-spies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use to bring people back in the country by small boats right up to the beach.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some very strange activity with Middle East men in the area before/after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't too hard to spot them...they really stood out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways..those personal ads are the most solid paper trail I ever encountered..I didn't have the ability/knowledge then to understand what I had stumbled across.

       Someone had to pay for those ads.

       To understand Bill and Hillary regarding 9/11 it helps to research Mickey Kantor.
      </p>
      <p>
       His name is on a list of 158 names that took part in the 9/11 cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was a featured speaker at the "Rebuilding Iraq Conference" that pretty much decided who was going to get what.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also serves on the Congressional Oversight Strategy Group which I can find next to nothing on.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is an senior board member on the Pacific Council on International Policy..pretty much another Council on Foreign Relations think tank.
      </p>
      <p>
       His history with the Clintons goes way way back.

       Very nice post.  Linking the Awan passports is critical here to close the loop.  Now we can investigate the US Attorney who was just murdered in the context of both DNC, State Dept, and Congressional involvement.  Wasserman Schultz is looking awfully vulnerable on this issue.  Perhaps she's outlived her usefulness to the powers that be...

       I just wonder, then, why haven't they done it yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've pondered whether they're trying to do so by so-called "formal" means (i.e. the Russia conspiracy). What particularly has me bothered is the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel. It's no coincidence that Mueller became Director of the FBI on 9/4/01, one week prior to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see how interconnected Comey is/was with the Deep State. So Trump ousts Comey, and within a matter of days Mueller is brought in? Something is fishy. If you have any insight into Mueller you'd like to share, please do.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if Trump is removed in this way, he become a
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       liability. I only see one way of making that go away. But then why go through with the Russia narrative? I can't seem to connect the dots.

       What does Posillico have to gain from all of this? Where does he fit within the hierarchy of all this?
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you're saying is true, he is highly implicated in the planning of 9/11 and getting the Awan brothers into the United States. I understand why HW Bush and other high ranking government officials would have motives for these types of things (i.e. the engineering of the collapse of the USSR and the subsequent cover up), but it seems like Posillico is much closer to the actual operations here. If his fingerprints are on things like building permits and illegally obtained visas, etc. he is taking on so much of the risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it just as simple as getting him on these things and making him talk?

       OK- so he isn't just some asset that the "deep state" uses to carry out things. It seems like he's a big time insider. I've never heard of him before so I just had to clarify that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another question, I've read through all of your posts and have seen some other threads here on the topic as well but I'd just like some clarification: was 9/11 planned in order to kill two birds with one stone? From what I've read, it seems that it covered up the Brady Bond scheme orchestrated by Bush senior's administration and it also created an environment where war could be waged in the middle east, which opens up limitless possibilities for MIC, etc. Is that accurate?

        Why do you think Jeb! was so desperate to become the GOP nominee? Because he handed Florida to his brother in the 2000 election. If Al Gore had won, 9/11 most likely never happens. To ensure 9/11 would happen, George W. Bush had to win in 2000. The New World Order was a few hanging chads away from collapsing. Maybe now this offers context to why Scalia died of a "heart attack" with a pillow over his face while at a hunting ranch and spa in brush country of Texas. It should also explain why an autopsy wasn't conducted. Scalia was about to blow the whistle on everything.

       Dude, what's with the huge jump from Jeb! to Scalia? He just randomly throws that shit in there and you don't call him out? I mean like wtf was that?!

       All roads lead to Texas.

       Also, Scalia was on the bench in 2000 and probably played ball or knew what was going down. To think that SCOTUS Justices are above manipulation and bribery is naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point though is that Scalia was offered a free trip out to a remote ranch and spa in Texas where a ton of political big whigs flock to.

       I'm sorry, you've just thrown a bunch of facts around with nothing connecting them. Yes, Scalia was on the bench in 2000, but so were eight other justices. In fact, one of them, Sandra Day O'Conner said she
       <em>
        would've
       </em>
       decided otherwise on
       <em>
        Bush v. Gore
       </em>
       seeing how things went off and how the SCOTUS had effectively decided the presidency. Nothing happened to her. Why Scalia?

       Bush didn't even know about the plan for 9/11 until the evening of 9/10 when his father filled him in.

       They couldn't risk him folding..so they isolated him with the 3rd graders.

       There was another man in that room that night. He died in Florida from anthrax (official story).. but what really happened was he was hit as he was entering the back sliding glass door of his home.

       Nope. I'm looking at piles of them from the 14th - 19th. Twitter is taking it's sweet time to continue loading beyond where it stalled on the 14th (and I don't feel like logging in there right this sec).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you didn't see anything relevant, I question whether or not you actually read through all of the tweets; when they're combined with the posts OP has done here, there's a metric cunt-ton of info. The decision to take it all in and evaluate everything is, of course, your choice.

        www.twitter.com

       OP is telling the truth about something to do with their family or has overheard 'somebody'.  I can tell you that much. If I'm wrong then they are one lucky litttle LARPER.  Chances are slim but if I'm wrong I'd actually have to congratulate them on making up something that they don't even know is a reality.

       This is the type of shit we need to be seeing every single day. This can turn very ugly, very quickly when the good guys rise up. They keep dreaming of this "purple revolution" as if the people of America would ever have a prayer of doing a ME style overthrow of a President who is beloved by our soldiers and 2nd Ammendment supporters. This ain't Lybia dumb fucks.

       All roads lead to Texas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Scalia was on the bench in 2000 and probably played ball or knew what was going down. To think that SCOTUS Justices are above manipulation and bribery is naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point though is that Scalia was offered a free trip out to a remote ranch and spa in Texas where a ton of political big whigs flock to.

      <p>
       Stratfor, which like I said is just CIA, Inc., is based out of Austin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig through the Stratfor email files (Global Intelligence series on Wikileaks) and you'll find where they send out "wet work" lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stratfor is the Deep State's corporate CIA counterpart in all facets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, people need to be paying a lot more attention to the role Texas truly plays in all the corruption and war profiteering.

       From a friend recently in Jordanian intel:
      </p>
      <p>
       &lt;&lt;this guy was found drunk in little manila downtown Amman the eastern
part and he dared the people that he can walk on the rail thats why he
fell from the third floor there was no criminal act in the subject &gt;&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
       He tends to tell the truth, no matter how painful, so I am wondering as
to whether or not the cover up is all-inclusive? Or perhaps this was
truly a mishap?
