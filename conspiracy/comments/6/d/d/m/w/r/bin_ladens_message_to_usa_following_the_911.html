        "I was not involved in the September 11 attacks in the United States nor did I have knowledge of the attacks. There exists a government within a government within the United States. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; to the people who want to make the present century a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity. That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks. ... The American system is totally in control of the Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States."

       I don't even know if there is an actual video interview. I haven't seen it in 16 years of there was an actual video. But he definitely did an interview with a newspaper that seems to be authentic

       Still have the downvoted record but no comment. And I cant remember the post I commented on.

       I agree. It's extremely difficult to find the original source of this quote. And it's become exponentially more difficult since 2001 as the COG laws were activated giving the US government an insane amount of hidden, extrajudicial power to cover up their crimes and convince the public their chosen narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The little spoken rumor of the last decade and change was that UBL was actually killed in December 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain his dramatic and little explained change from Freedom Fighter to Terrorist Mastermind, because it wasn't him but a CIA created imposter (see: ISIS 2017)
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was an inside job after all. That much is now glaringly obvious to anyone who watched the three buildings fall and watched the grainy frames of a missile hitting the Pentagon. Let's not forget the Israeli art students who were photographed next to boxes and boxes of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the best attempt at a 9/11 summary that I've personally seen. (Yes it refers to the Pentagon missile as Flight 77, it didn't really matter whether it was a plane or missile, all the Pentagon surveillance was either turned off/destroyed save a few grainy frames....indicating an inside job.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a "date specific" event?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The "Eldorado Task Force" was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of "Securities Clearance" laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under "National Security." There were 4 parts to this "National Security" scheme:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble

         What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a "National Security" event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Were the several planes targeting specific locations?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How is this cover-up maintained?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The event was a "National Security" event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that "National Security" is and was at stake and that's all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who was involved?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.

       These people referred to themselves as the "Vulcans." The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.

       Caveat:  I beleive 911 was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this:
      </p>
      <p>
       911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes
      </p>
      <p>
       makes no sense to me.  Securities are investments--stocks--trade on the stock market.  How could they be "due" to the U.S. Treasury.  Are you talking about Fraudulent US bonds that were coming due on which the Treasury would need to pay?  Because THAT might make sense.

       I remember reading a similar quote from Bin Laden in a book that was I believe written pre-9/11 but post-WTC bombing, in the 90s.  Bin Laden said something to the effect of he wouldn't stop fighting the US until they stopped financially supporting Israel.  It was certainly an unfamiliar narrative, and despite reading it in what was essentially a small textbook I found it hard to corroborate with anything online. Kinda wish I still had the book.

       Usamah [Osama bin Laden]:
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/interview-with-osama-bin-laden-denies-his-involvement-in-9-11/24697">
        In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful.
        <strong>
         Praise be to Allah, Who is the creator of the whole universe and Who made the earth as an abode for peace, for the whole mankind.
        </strong>
        Allah is the Sustainer, who sent Prophet Muhammad for our guidance. I am thankful to the Ummat Group of Publications, which gave me the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people, particularly the valiant and Momin true Muslim people of Pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon.
        <strong>
         I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people. Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle. It is the United States, which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women, children, and common people of other faiths, particularly the followers of Islam.
        </strong>
        All that is going on in Palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of God upon the United States and Israel. There is also a warning for those Muslim countries, which witnessed all these as a silent spectator. What had earlier been done to the innocent people of Iraq, Chechnya, and Bosnia? Only one conclusion could be derived from the indifference of the United States and the West to these acts of terror and the patronage of the tyrants by these powers that America is an anti-Islamic power and it is patronizing the anti-Islamic forces. Its friendship with the Muslim countries is just a show, rather deceit. By enticing or intimidating these countries, the United States is forcing them to play a role of its choice. Put a glance all around and you will see that the slaves of the United States are either rulers or enemies of Muslims .
        <strong>
         The US has no friends, nor does it want to keep any because the prerequisite of friendship is to come to the level of the friend or consider him at par with you. America does not want to see anyone equal to it. It expects slavery from others. Therefore, other countries are either its slaves or subordinates.
        </strong>
        However, our case is different.
        <strong>
         We have pledged slavery to God Almighty alone
        </strong>
        and after this pledge there is no possibility to become the slave of someone else. If we do that, it will be disregardful to both our Sustainer and his fellow beings. Most of the world nations upholding their freedom are the religious ones, which are the enemies of United States, or the latter itself considers them as its enemies. Or the countries, which do not agree to become its slaves, such as China, Iran, Libya, Cuba, Syria, and the former Russia as received .
        <strong>
         Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed.
        </strong>
        According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US government has stated. But the Bush administration does not want the panic to spread. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system, but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology could survive. They can be any one, from Russia to Israel and from India to Serbia. In the US itself, there are dozens of well-organized and well-equipped groups, which are capable of causing a large-scale destruction. Then you cannot forget the American Jews, who are annoyed with President Bush ever since the elections in Florida and want to avenge him.  Then there are intelligence agencies in the US, which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the Congress and the government every year. This funding issue was not a big problem till the existence of the former Soviet Union but after that the budget of these agencies has been in danger.
        <strong>
         They needed an enemy. So, they first started propaganda against Usamah and Taleban and then this incident happened.
        </strong>
        You see, the Bush administration approved a budget of 40bn dollars. Where will this huge amount go? It will be provided to the same agencies, which need huge funds and want to exert their importance.

       So.... where exactly did you get this quite from? Are you claiming this is what he said verbatim or just the general gist? Because if you're claiming this is a direct quote then you must certainly have a source... so let us examine the source that you posted this quote from.

       [Usamah [Osama bin Laden]: In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful.
       <strong>
        Praise be to Allah, Who is the creator of the whole universe and Who made the earth as an abode for peace, for the whole mankind.
       </strong>
       Allah is the Sustainer, who sent Prophet Muhammad for our guidance. I am thankful to the Ummat Group of Publications, which gave me the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people, particularly the valiant and Momin true Muslim people of Pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon.
      </p>
      <p>
       **I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle. It is the United States, which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women, children, and common people of other faiths, particularly the followers of Islam.** All that is going on in Palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of God upon the United States and Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a warning for those Muslim countries, which witnessed all these as a silent spectator. What had earlier been done to the innocent people of Iraq, Chechnya, and Bosnia?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one conclusion could be derived from the indifference of the United States and the West to these acts of terror and the patronage of the tyrants by these powers that America is an anti-Islamic power and it is patronizing the anti-Islamic forces. Its friendship with the Muslim countries is just a show, rather deceit. By enticing or intimidating these countries, the United States is forcing them to play a role of its choice. Put a glance all around and you will see that the slaves of the United States are either rulers or enemies of Muslims .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The US has no friends, nor does it want to keep any because the prerequisite of friendship is to come to the level of the friend or consider him at par with you. America does not want to see anyone equal to it. It expects slavery from others. Therefore, other countries are either its slaves or subordinates.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, our case is different.
       <strong>
        We have pledged slavery to God Almighty alone
       </strong>
       and after this pledge there is no possibility to become the slave of someone else. If we do that, it will be disregardful to both our Sustainer and his fellow beings. Most of the world nations upholding their freedom are the religious ones, which are the enemies of United States, or the latter itself considers them as its enemies. Or the countries, which do not agree to become its slaves, such as China, Iran, Libya, Cuba, Syria, and the former Russia as received .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US government has stated. But the Bush administration does not want the panic to spread. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system, but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology could survive. They can be any one, from Russia to Israel and from India to Serbia. In the US itself, there are dozens of well-organized and well-equipped groups, which are capable of causing a large-scale destruction. Then you cannot forget the American Jews, who are annoyed with President Bush ever since the elections in Florida and want to avenge him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are intelligence agencies in the US, which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the Congress and the government every year. This funding issue was not a big problem till the existence of the former Soviet Union but after that the budget of these agencies has been in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They needed an enemy. So, they first started propaganda against Usamah and Taleban and then this incident happened.
       </strong>
       You see, the Bush administration approved a budget of 40bn dollars. Where will this huge amount go? It will be provided to the same agencies, which need huge funds and want to exert their importance.](

       No fucking way did America supposedly kill someone supposedly responsible for the deaths of that many Americans and then get rid of his body without flying it home for verification. No fucking way. And I think it's insulting that they think the entire world is stupid enough to buy that.

       "“Why doesn’t Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted poster make any direct connection with the events of September 11, 2001?”  The FBI says on its Bin Laden web page that Usama Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7, 1998 bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya.  According to the FBI, these attacks killed over 200 people.  The FBI concludes its reason for “wanting” Bin Laden by saying, “In addition, Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorists attacks throughout the world.”
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 5, 2006, the Muckraker Report contacted the FBI Headquarters, (202) 324-3000, to learn why Bin Laden’s Most Wanted poster did not indicate that Usama was also wanted in connection with 9/11.  The Muckraker Report spoke with Rex Tomb, Chief of Investigative Publicity for the FBI.  When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on Bin Laden’s Most Wanted web page, Tomb said, “The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden’s Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.”

       I agree. It's extremely difficult to find the original source of this quote. And it's become exponentially more difficult since 2001 as the COG laws were activated giving the US government an insane amount of hidden, extrajudicial power to cover up their crimes and convince the public their chosen narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The little spoken rumor of the last decade and change was that UBL was actually killed in December 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would explain his dramatic and little explained change from Freedom Fighter to Terrorist Mastermind, because it wasn't him but a CIA created imposter (see: ISIS 2017)
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was an inside job after all. That much is now glaringly obvious to anyone who watched the three buildings fall and watched the grainy frames of a missile hitting the Pentagon. Let's not forget the Israeli art students who were photographed next to boxes and boxes of explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the best attempt at a 9/11 summary that I've personally seen. (Yes it refers to the Pentagon missile as Flight 77, it didn't really matter whether it was a plane or missile, all the Pentagon surveillance was either turned off/destroyed save a few grainy frames....indicating an inside job.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a "date specific" event?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The "Eldorado Task Force" was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of "Securities Clearance" laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under "National Security." There were 4 parts to this "National Security" scheme:
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble
      </p>
      <p>
       c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev
      </p>
      <p>
       d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a "National Security" event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Were the several planes targeting specific locations?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         How is this cover-up maintained?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The event was a "National Security" event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that "National Security" is and was at stake and that's all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who was involved?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I'm going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.

       These people referred to themselves as the "Vulcans." The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US taxpayer expense.

       Usamah [Osama bin Laden]:
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/interview-with-osama-bin-laden-denies-his-involvement-in-9-11/24697">
        In the name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most merciful.
        <strong>
         Praise be to Allah, Who is the creator of the whole universe and Who made the earth as an abode for peace, for the whole mankind.
        </strong>
        Allah is the Sustainer, who sent Prophet Muhammad for our guidance. I am thankful to the Ummat Group of Publications, which gave me the opportunity to convey my viewpoint to the people, particularly the valiant and Momin true Muslim people of Pakistan who refused to believe in lie of the demon.
        <strong>
         I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children, and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children, and other people. Such a practice is forbidden ever in the course of a battle. It is the United States, which is perpetrating every maltreatment on women, children, and common people of other faiths, particularly the followers of Islam.
        </strong>
        All that is going on in Palestine for the last 11 months is sufficient to call the wrath of God upon the United States and Israel. There is also a warning for those Muslim countries, which witnessed all these as a silent spectator. What had earlier been done to the innocent people of Iraq, Chechnya, and Bosnia? Only one conclusion could be derived from the indifference of the United States and the West to these acts of terror and the patronage of the tyrants by these powers that America is an anti-Islamic power and it is patronizing the anti-Islamic forces. Its friendship with the Muslim countries is just a show, rather deceit. By enticing or intimidating these countries, the United States is forcing them to play a role of its choice. Put a glance all around and you will see that the slaves of the United States are either rulers or enemies of Muslims .
        <strong>
         The US has no friends, nor does it want to keep any because the prerequisite of friendship is to come to the level of the friend or consider him at par with you. America does not want to see anyone equal to it. It expects slavery from others. Therefore, other countries are either its slaves or subordinates.
        </strong>
        However, our case is different.
        <strong>
         We have pledged slavery to God Almighty alone
        </strong>
        and after this pledge there is no possibility to become the slave of someone else. If we do that, it will be disregardful to both our Sustainer and his fellow beings. Most of the world nations upholding their freedom are the religious ones, which are the enemies of United States, or the latter itself considers them as its enemies. Or the countries, which do not agree to become its slaves, such as China, Iran, Libya, Cuba, Syria, and the former Russia as received .
        <strong>
         Whoever committed the act of 11 September are not the friends of the American people. I have already said that we are against the American system, not against its people, whereas in these attacks, the common American people have been killed.
        </strong>
        According to my information, the death toll is much higher than what the US government has stated. But the Bush administration does not want the panic to spread. The United States should try to trace the perpetrators of these attacks within itself; the people who are a part of the US system, but are dissenting against it. Or those who are working for some other system; persons who want to make the present century as a century of conflict between Islam and Christianity so that their own civilization, nation, country, or ideology could survive. They can be any one, from Russia to Israel and from India to Serbia. In the US itself, there are dozens of well-organized and well-equipped groups, which are capable of causing a large-scale destruction. Then you cannot forget the American Jews, who are annoyed with President Bush ever since the elections in Florida and want to avenge him.  Then there are intelligence agencies in the US, which require billions of dollars worth of funds from the Congress and the government every year. This funding issue was not a big problem till the existence of the former Soviet Union but after that the budget of these agencies has been in danger.
        <strong>
         They needed an enemy. So, they first started propaganda against Usamah and Taleban and then this incident happened.
        </strong>
        You see, the Bush administration approved a budget of 40bn dollars. Where will this huge amount go? It will be provided to the same agencies, which need huge funds and want to exert their importance.
