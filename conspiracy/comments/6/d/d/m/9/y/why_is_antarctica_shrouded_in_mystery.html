       I've just recently gotten into many of the conspiracies surrounding government/political involvement regarding Antarctica and I find it very interesting. There is a lot of unanswered questions: Why are so many nations cooperatively stationed there instead of being claimed like other continents? Why is middle Antarctica completely censored on Google Earth? Why are there ancient pyramids there? Why is it illegal to fly over the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       It baffles me that such a large continent is unable to be seen by anyone outside of major political entities in 2017. Hell, even Area 51 is less censored than this continent.
      </p>
      <p>
       All sorts of conspiracies admittedly arise because of this (i.e. flat earth, hollow earth, UFO's, underground bases, weather/climate manipulation, etc.) and there is some really compelling evidence to support these claims (some more than others).
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe this is where the anthropogenic climate change agenda arose. I also believe this is where much of the undisclosed technological advancements are being held/tested/utilized. I'm also open to the idea of some "hole" near the south pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still searching for more interesting information, so if anyone knows of anything I'm leaving out I'd love to hear. Also if anyone can debunk any of my questions, that would be appreciated. I'd just like to separate the facts from fiction so I can try to better speculate any/all possible connections.

       I truly think that is the case, tbh. I've entertained them all. Don't know, but I'm leaning to possibly a combo of both expanding and hollow.

       It is interesting - and as no one can freely go there to explore, that adds to the mystery.  It has a weird treaty countries signed years ago, has the mystery regarding Admiral Byrd, and google maps does appear spotty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it isn't that the continent is very censored so much as it isn't profitable to have satellites swing by to scan - as those in orbit have paths over populated areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids is unproven, but the pics are compelling.  @secureteam10 is good at showing those.  He showed an interesting looking saucer thing that looks like an old school UFO - which recently looks exactly like one he found on the moon in another of his videos.  I am unsure how to take him.  He seems to have his heart in the right place.

       I agree almost entirely besides your possible justification for the lack of satellite images. I only say this because there has been reports of areas closer to the south pole that are not a frozen wasteland (look at Admiral Byrd's Diary entry dated in December 1956). Regardless of that even, I would still expect to find at least some early photographs or satellite images of it, however you don't.

       I imagined the military has it mapped out, but google gets their sat maps commercially, not through military channels.

       I read thru like 1000 old CIA files about Antarctica from the 50s, 60s, and 70s... From what I gathered the whole thing was like a modified "Space Race"... the USA knew that the USSR was really into poking around down there... and we didn't want to be embarrassed if the russkies found a use for Antarctica before we did. So USA went all in on figuring out what good shit could be done down there... and it turns out there was not much of interest. About the only use for it was related to some sort of satellites... since there were strict controls in place for any kind of offensive/missile related development. Though there were
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5nB2aTv.png">
        reports of USSR finding something under the ice...

       Eh... Everything I read was from the CIA... and that time frame there is pre-CIA... Maybe I could poke around and see what was going on pre-50s down there... but everything after the 50s seem to be science/satellite related... but Byrd was still kicking around in a lot of the other files I read.

      <p>
       Its not.  If you're referring to the low res images, its probably because taking a high res shot of frozen nothingness still looks a low-res shot of frozen nothingness.  If you remember Google Earth early on, the majority of it was really poor quality outside of major cities and metropolitan areas.  Give it some time and they'll probably update it , but I assume they have more interesting stuff to improve before they get to the white wasteland.

       Its not.  Commercial flights dont take that route cause its dangerous, and flying below a certain latitude requires a bunch of special survival equipment that airlines have no reason to carry when they could just go around.

       Thats not true at all.  Its just prohibitively expensive for most people.  You can book flyovers out of Australia, or charter a boat from Chile, or book a spot on a resupply ship.  Its not like there are hotels there and a booming tourism industry there to attract people.  Theres no real infrastructure besides the science outposts.

       It is restricted, look up ETOPS. Also, just from simply observing worldwide routes, you will see that no flights cross over the poles, despite it being a more direct route in many cases.

       Yes, I have looked before, which is precisely why I, and many others, believe what we do. You can slow down with the superiority complex, I'm not being ignorant. Once again, you can't claim a definitive when there has been blatant proof of this censorship/masking, and the fact that you don't know that tells me you must not have done any searching into my argument. The best decisions can be made when you have looked into both sides of an issue.

       I agree almost entirely besides your possible justification for the lack of satellite images. I only say this because there has been reports of areas closer to the south pole that are not a frozen wasteland (look at Admiral Byrd's Diary entry dated in December 1956). Regardless of that even, I would still expect to find at least some early photographs or satellite images of it, however you don't.
