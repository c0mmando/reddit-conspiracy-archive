        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve just recently gotten into many of the conspiracies surrounding government/political involvement regarding Antarctica and I find it very interesting. There is a lot of unanswered questions: Why are so many nations cooperatively stationed there instead of being claimed like other continents? Why is middle Antarctica completely censored on Google Earth? Why are there ancient pyramids there? Why is it illegal to fly over the country? </p>

<p>It baffles me that such a large continent is unable to be seen by anyone outside of major political entities in 2017. Hell, even Area 51 is less censored than this continent. </p>

<p>All sorts of conspiracies admittedly arise because of this (i.e. flat earth, hollow earth, UFO&#39;s, underground bases, weather/climate manipulation, etc.) and there is some really compelling evidence to support these claims (some more than others). </p>

<p>I personally believe this is where the anthropogenic climate change agenda arose. I also believe this is where much of the undisclosed technological advancements are being held/tested/utilized. I&#39;m also open to the idea of some &quot;hole&quot; near the south pole. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still searching for more interesting information, so if anyone knows of anything I&#39;m leaving out I&#39;d love to hear. Also if anyone can debunk any of my questions, that would be appreciated. I&#39;d just like to separate the facts from fiction so I can try to better speculate any/all possible connections.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting - and as no one can freely go there to explore, that adds to the mystery.  It has a weird treaty countries signed years ago, has the mystery regarding Admiral Byrd, and google maps does appear spotty.</p>

<p>I think it isn&#39;t that the continent is very censored so much as it isn&#39;t profitable to have satellites swing by to scan - as those in orbit have paths over populated areas.</p>

<p>The pyramids is unproven, but the pics are compelling.  @secureteam10 is good at showing those.  He showed an interesting looking saucer thing that looks like an old school UFO - which recently looks exactly like one he found on the moon in another of his videos.  I am unsure how to take him.  He seems to have his heart in the right place.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting stuff on youtube on Antarctica. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree almost entirely besides your possible justification for the lack of satellite images. I only say this because there has been reports of areas closer to the south pole that are not a frozen wasteland (look at Admiral Byrd&#39;s Diary entry dated in December 1956). Regardless of that even, I would still expect to find at least some early photographs or satellite images of it, however you don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read thru like 1000 old CIA files about Antarctica from the 50s, 60s, and 70s... From what I gathered the whole thing was like a modified &quot;Space Race&quot;... the USA knew that the USSR was really into poking around down there... and we didn&#39;t want to be embarrassed if the russkies found a use for Antarctica before we did. So USA went all in on figuring out what good shit could be done down there... and it turns out there was not much of interest. About the only use for it was related to some sort of satellites... since there were strict controls in place for any kind of offensive/missile related development. Though there were <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5nB2aTv.png">reports of USSR finding something under the ice...</a></p>

<p>Its not.  If you&#39;re referring to the low res images, its probably because taking a high res shot of frozen nothingness still looks a low-res shot of frozen nothingness.

<p>Thats not true at all.  Its just prohibitively expensive for most people.  You can book flyovers out of Australia, or charter a boat from Chile, or book a spot on a resupply ship.

<p>With all due respect, you can&#39;t make a definitive claim like &quot;it&#39;s not&quot; and then back it with subjectivity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You mean kind of pyramid shaped mountains? or is there something else I&#39;m missing.</p>

<p>That does not in any way <em>prove</em> they are mountains. From the pictures, nothing disproves the idea that they could be pyramids. It&#39;s arguably more believable than mountains.</p>

<p>It is restricted, look up ETOPS. Also, just from simply observing worldwide routes, you will see that no flights cross over the poles, despite it being a more direct route in many cases.

<p>Having the shape of a pyramid doesnt imply human construction.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware of ETOPS as well.  Perhaps you should look into it further, because they explain <em>why</em> its against regulation for commercial aircraft to fly over.  None of that applies to private jets anyway.  Its not illegal</p>

<p>Why is middle Antarctica completely censored on Google Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Satellites don&#39;t orbit in an exact polar orbit, meaning that they can&#39;t get proper imagery of the poles. You&#39;ll find the same thing at the north pole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are there ancient pyramids there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There aren&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it illegal to fly over the country? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not, and they used to do flyovers for sightseeing until they sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_New_Zealand_Flight_901">flew the plane into a mountain</a>.</p>

<p>You are free to fly over Antarctica if you want, you just need to find a plane with an 8,000 km endurance.</p>

<p>It is claimed, by several countries, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System">Antarctic Treaty System</a> means that everyone plays nice, for now.</p>

<p>And New Zealand is certainly not a major political entity.</p>

<p>Because they agreed to share it?</p>

<p>All those questions are based on pure bullshit.</p>

<p>You&#39;re baffled because you believe the bullshit that liars tell you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only company that offers flights to Antarctica.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree almost entirely besides your possible justification for the lack of satellite images. I only say this because there has been reports of areas closer to the south pole that are not a frozen wasteland (look at Admiral Byrd&#39;s Diary entry dated in December 1956). Regardless of that even, I would still expect to find at least some early photographs or satellite images of it, however you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, you could simply see for yourself that most of the continent surrounding regions near the south pole are extremely low resolution and in some spots it is very evident that there was image manipulation. I can&#39;t even find high resolution photos of Antarctica from the Landsat satellites, besides <a href="http://content.satimagingcorp.com/static/galleryimages/landsat-satellite-image-antarctica.jpg">this one</a>, which you can clearly see signs of editing. Anyone who is even slightly familiar with image editing software can see it.</p>
