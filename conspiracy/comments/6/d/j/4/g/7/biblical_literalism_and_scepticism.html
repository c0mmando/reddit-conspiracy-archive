Anyway my question here is to people here who believe the bible is literal/ the word of god. I&#39;ve seen quite a few people here who claim the bible is 100% factual (even though  it is contradictory, incomplete and  plainly wrong in many places)</p>

<p>So as people on here I&#39;d assume you would be sceptics, willing to question everything so why does the bible get a free pass by several on here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible gets a free pass because we are not into banning books. As a general defense of the Bible, it wasn&#39;t written for the purpose of fundamentalists to bash people over the head. The fact is they do that but that&#39;s hardly the Bible&#39;s fault, is it? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not productive to suggest that because someone is a Christian that they cannot use interpretation of prophecy to explain a conspiracy. I don&#39;t think they should be using it as a platform for evangelical work, but I&#39;m not going to police them because frankly I&#39;ve got better things to do. I don&#39;t mind if people want to talk about Nostradamus or Cacey or the Bible. I&#39;m open minded and I think there are good grounds to reject hard skeptical positions that such things are impossible. Atheism doesn&#39;t inpress me, it&#39;s full of it&#39;s own contradictions and bad ideas so I don&#39;t think we should be bashing cult A only to promote cult B even if it&#39;s implicit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you have a problem. </p>

<p>As an athiest you believe in evolution, correct? Let&#39;s look at Dawkins he&#39;s a biologist who coined the term meme - an idea that has the power to shape reality as in a gene. So he is introducing the idea that evolution shapes us in ways beyond biology. Yet religion is clearly a meme and the Bible is even more obviously so. Today we have this understanding of &#39;truth&#39; as shining a light on ignorance and creating a path to &#39;good&#39;. This arrived to us through Christianity and for atheism to deny these things is down right ignorant. It&#39;s like denying the influence Shakespeare had on the English language. Not to mention for Dawkins to call religion a mere superstition and nothing more violates his own concept of the meme. So yeah it&#39;s a metaphorical book burning to deny the role religion specifically the Bible has played. I&#39;m not at all defending Christians, they certainly are due some push back for what is superstitious in their faith. It&#39;s very wrong and ignorant to label everything as superstition. </p>

<p>Science is not a way of life. That idea needs to be addressed as well. Science can&#39;t tell you how to live or what matters to people, or what is right and wrong. It&#39;s totally ambuguos on the business of being a human. So no, actually you can&#39;t merely root out your heritage and call it stupid. What you&#39;re really looking for is neo-marxism i.e. that everyhing that matters is made up: gender isn&#39;t real at all that&#39;s made up. Morality is exactly the same as practicality, except that&#39;s not actually how we developed it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not actually aiming this at you at all. You&#39;re basically right to reject Christianity as a personal faith, absolutely, it&#39;s terrible. But as western white people that&#39;s our fucking culture as well. We did some amazing things with christian philosophy. There are certain deeper ideas like the logos which are actually Greek, and other ideas which are really important. So I guess I&#39;m kind of trying to make a case for balance in this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t decide one day to just start believing in God.  I followed the breadcrumbs of some conspiriacies (p-gate and babylon deities) and spent months looking into the threads that linked up.  I saw a whole lot of things that showed me this world is not what we believe.  Humanity is not in control here.  I absolutely freaked out because of this realisation.  </p>

<p>I asked (begged) God to help me.  And He did.  He lifted the veil completely.  And things have never been the same for me.  </p>

<p>People may scoff, that is their free will to do so.  But I know what I know.  As for the Bible being 100% true,  I don&#39;t know.  But the more I look the more it seems to be.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t expect my belief to do anything for anyone else.  As i said, I only came to this position after months of searching for something else unrelated.  </p>

<p>I think we all have to come to our own beliefs.  That&#39;s why forced conversions or raising people in a belief-system rarely succeeds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible starts veering off course right from the very first chapter.  There were supposedly 3 days before god even created the sun and moon.  That makes sense...  He also created all vegetation, and trees with fruit before there was even a sun.  If trees can suddenly sprout up in a frozen void with no sunlight, well that&#39;d be a first.</p>

<p>It only continues to get worse, from the first chapter.  A literalist must deliberately disengage their brain to force it to make sense.  And even then, the best argument they can come up with is ad-hoc handwaving and mental gymnastics, trying to deny the obvious.</p>

<p>There is a warped logic here.   If God created people, and created them with free will -- in other words, to choose good or to choose evil, because he didn&#39;t want to create automatons -- then how is it <em>his</em> fault when people do things which he doesn&#39;t want them to do?</p>

<p>Humans have no one to blame for the mess this world is in but themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up with Bible believing, church-attending parents.  I eventually grew away from it, because it seemed all the churches we went to had too much drama going on, but mainly because I couldn&#39;t see how a God that was so good could ask the Hebrews to exterminate entire cities of people, including the women and children.  It seemed so cruel.</p>

<p>However, now I see it as God&#39;s way of trying to help mankind out.  I see that I don&#39;t understand everything He does.  How could I? He is God,  all-knowing, and I am just a tiny human.  Even if those cities were into something like beating their women and children, it could make sense that God would choose to exterminate that city, because the practice will only become more and more prolific as time goes on.  Now imagine something infinitely worse, like child sacrifice, socially accepted rape, or other horrors.  Makes sense to get rid of it.  And honestly, if God can do anything and is merciful, perhaps he gives those children another chance in a family who won&#39;t subject them to such horrors.  Either way, he isn&#39;t a petty and mean God, he&#39;s cleaning up our messes.</p>

<p>Or take Sodom and Gomorrah.  I mean, is homosexuality really THAT bad to destroy a whole city?  Well, we don&#39;t really know.  Maybe the whole city in their promiscuity was contacting and spreading STDs and it was God&#39;s way of protecting the rest of the population from disease.</p>

<p>We just don&#39;t know.  We are small with small brains.  Sometimes my kid throws a fit because I do something to keep her safe.  And for a short amount of time, she hates me and I&#39;m a terrible person.  She doesn&#39;t see that I just kept her from burning her hand off on the stove, or getting run over by a car, or getting sick from a bunch of candy.  I think that is how we are to God, only to a much greater extent.</p>

If you&#39;re convinced it isn&#39;t true, then chalk it up to people being crazy and move on.  If you think there is some truth in it, then read the Bible yourself, and ask God for understanding.  If you are truly convinced God is a big hoax, then why spend all this time trying to convince people who believe in Him to &quot;think rationally&quot;? If you truly believe that you were made by chance or evolution, then nothing you do or say really matters at all, and you can go ahead and move on and don&#39;t worry about what other people believe.

    <div class="md"><p>I am also blessed with a physical experience with God. I asked God to make the rain stop and he did. There is no way I can deny that. This happened before I became a Christian, I was agnostic at the time, and just got done having a discussion about God with my friends who were believers. At the end of the convo I was like ok I think I get what you are saying. Later that night I went to my car to get something, I step outside and it starts to rain lightly. Once I get in my car it starts to pour down rain. I was in an open parking lot and you know how you can hear the rain beating down on your car. In that moment I asked God, if you are really exist make the rain stop, and before I could get the word stop out, it was silent for a second or two and then it started to rain again with the same intensity. Now I know this sounds hard to believe but it is true. This the reason I will never doubt the existence of God. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your problem with the bible/God being like Santa Clause in the Sky is very accurate and I think many Christians would agree that the cartoon caricature that you take issue with is not real. Jesus refers to his teachings found in the New Testament to be &quot;the milk&quot; of wisdom. As in &quot;breast milk&quot; for babies. Its not &quot;the meat&quot; which is necessary for adult nourishment. </p>

<p>The way I see it, the meat is that humans <em>must</em> have a society. We are social creatures with limitations and needs. To satisfy these needs within the constraints of our own personal limitations, we need hunters <em>and</em> gatherers (i mean that in a literary sense, not necessarily actual hunters and gatherers) to do the work necessary to support a society that is large enough to protect against elements and enemies. A society needs shelter, which creates cities, which need protecting from those that have given themselves to base animalistic tendencies - rape, murder, theft - which would be the Babylonians and other gentiles. But those base animalistic tendencies are present in all of humanity. What separated the Jews from other nearby civilizations or religions was that other societies had celebrated these tendencies, which will often lead to the decay of a society or at a smaller level, in the time period, a family. Which is just a building block or microcosm of society.</p>

<p>For example, homosexuality in the times of Moses, in my view is a sin because if celebrated or embraced means that the homosexual would not have children to take care of them in their old age and would become a burden on society or other members of the family when an old man is unable to work in the field or build a home (for the record I dont believe homosexuality is any greater a sin than any other and literally everyone sins, I wont be casting any stones over what someone does in their bedroom). All the laws of the bible have practical and tangible benefits to them and the Jews either forgot that was a thing or realized how powerful manipulation could be to maintain power and control. Another example, no eating pigs. Pigs had parasites that couldnt be cooked off which didnt really matter anyway because they didnt have germ theory, and they didnt know what was causing people to get sick or go crazy because they didnt have the scientific method yet. They had other means of food so it was easier to just say &quot;dont eat pigs&quot; than to figure out the safest way to butcher a pig. </p>

<p>I think this was a fairly common understanding of the bible 200 years ago but when generations of fathers (traditionally the leaders of the Church) were destroyed one after another in WW1 then again in WW2 the practical applications and reasons for following these beliefs were lost because sons couldnt be taught by fathers what it really means to &quot;love thy neighbor as thyself&quot; - not drinking alcohol in front of an alcoholic, embezzling from schools, taking care of the environment and so on and so on. Look at how William Jennings Bryon was the populist preacher renowned the world over for his oration and <em>liberal</em> ideology raising awareness about the plight of the poor and the needs of the masses as means of stabilizing society despite also being the guy from the Scopes Monkey Trial. Christianity used to be different. And I think that difference and immaturity in how it is practiced as well as perceived goes back to fathers not teaching their sons for decades and decades. </p>

<p>To support that, I suggest that the reason the most persecuted people in human history are still around is because they knew the importance of family, staying close to one another and limiting outside influence. As one in the tribe prospers, the rest does too. When one becomes successful they extend opportunities to family. This is why Hollywood and Banking is run by jews. Not because they are evil. But because they know what it means to take care of family. This was a more common practice of protestants and Catholics in 1890. So Jesus meant it when he said to love thy neighbor and take care of the sick and poor because it strengthens your society and improves the living standards of those participating in that society.</p>

<p>So I disagree that it is literal, but that a literal interpretation allows for self corrections in the errors of interpretation that can lead to the bastardization of religion like what Jesus saw in the Temple. For me it comes down to a question that has nothing to do with spirituality - Is propaganda <em>inherently</em> evil? If Jesus propagandized the world with the &quot;milk&quot; so that they could see they need to be loving of one another for the benefit of all man kind... I suppose I could accept that propaganda.</p>
