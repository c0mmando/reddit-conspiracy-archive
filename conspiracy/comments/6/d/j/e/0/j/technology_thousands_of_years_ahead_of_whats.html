       You're giving me hope, r/conspriacy.  Some of you saw my post about
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cv4gm/an_attack_occurred_at_2233_bst_on_the_22nd_at_22/">

      </p>
      <p>
       Today I'd like to share one of the biggest pieces that helped me put the puzzle together: technology.  TPTB have some sort of electromagnetic destabilizer that we've seen used on at least three occasions.  Forget what you've been told, open your mind, and sharpen your

       Oklahoma City.  The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing">
        official story
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At 9:02 a.m. the Ryder truck, containing in excess of 4,800 pounds (2,200 kg) of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Picture it.  Picture a Ryder (moving) truck jampacked with explosives.  Drive your imaginary truck and park it in front of
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Alfred_P._Murrah_Federal_Building_before_destruction.jpg">
        a nine-story, steel-and-concrete building.
       </a>
       Now, make your truck explode.  Put yourself right in the middle of the blast radius, see the explosion expand around you, and picture the damage as it hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the damage you've done.  What does the building look like?  Is there an almost-circular explosion centered around the bomb?  Did your explosion make the building collapse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your building in mind when you
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gv6D4xv.jpg">
        look at what was left of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building after the attack.
       </a>
       Notice how symmetrical the damage is from top to bottom, the lack of debris, and how there's no damage to the street where the bomb supposedly went-off..  Also of note is
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0FmldaP.jpg">

       .  You already know the official story.  Some never-flown-before pilots hijacked passenger planes, made point-perfect course adjustments while flying at a speed exceeding the structural integrity limits of the plane then slammed them into two towers causing fires so magically-awesome they brought down 7 buildings.  Meanwhile, another batch of hoodlums managed to hijack a third plane and make it invisible before slamming it into the Pentagon.  (And
       <em>
        how the fuck

       did I believe that was true for so long?  Oh right, I forgot to ask questions.)

        'official' story:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On 19 January 2017, a fire started on the ninth floor at around 07:50 local time (04:20 GMT). The building was occupied at the time by its residents, workers at the garment shops, and various tour groups that were being shown around the building. Ten fire brigades arrived to fight the blaze. The combined brigades had been trying to stop the fire for hours—while assuring that the building had been evacuated—when the building's north wall collapsed without warning, leading to the collapse of the rest of the building a few moments later.

       Once again, a burning skyscraper suddenly collapses upon itself.  This event isn't nearly as well-documented as 9/11, but there is

       This electromagnetic destabilizer is only one of the toys TPTB have at their disposal.  And if they're capable of such incredible manipulation of our physical world, just imagine what our society could be like if it weren't being secretly used to keep us scared.

       You can't have thermonuclear without any radiation and as far as I know none has ever been found at those sites. Also it's impossible to build a thermonuclear device that has that small of a blast radius.

       I personally think all three technologies were used. Thermite for a 2nd cover story (limited hangout), and the last two to make sure the event happened as planned. Those two are the only ones which explain what we saw on that day.

       Interesting, but a bit too much hearsay.
      </p>
      <p>
       The premise that thermonuclear devices were installed in the 60's to satisfy building codes is something I am particularly skeptical about. If a requirement was to prove how the building could be demolished before construction could begin, using a thermonuclear device would absolutely be off the table. It was not, and has not been shown to be an efficient way to bring down a building without causing any collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was a requirement of the building codes, it would be easier to say it would be manually dismantled. This was the method used when the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singer_Building">
        Singer Building
       </a>
       was demolished in 1968. The NYC building codes are posted online, I don't have time to go through them now but will later.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original WTC Towers construction would likely fall under their

       Is the idea that the DEW was mounted on a satellite? The ones we know about are currently mounted on battleships and take the entire power capacity of the nuclear engine. (Which raises the question: Why not just use the nuclear power directly, using a tried &amp; true technology -- field tested thousands of times?) How'd they lift it to orbit? What's the power source?

       Maybe the DEW technology has gotten to the point where it could be a smallish type device and placed inside a building or area. Sounds pretty sci-fi, but we know the Deep State is years, and years ahead of the private sector. Think secret space program.

       Okay, but we're hypothesizing multiple technologies not known to exist. Could be interdimensional sonic disintegration pistols for that matter. Why DEW, in particular, if we have no idea what tech they might have? (This is all making me think maybe they're not as far ahead of us as we're lead to believe -- that could all be a psyop. David Wilcock sure hasn't blown me away with his credibility...)
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, we have well-known, field-tested nuclear technology that explains 99% if not 100% of what was seen that day -- and the remaining 1% may be chalked up to psyop information haze.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pretty straightforward:
       <strong>
        Ground Zero
       </strong>
       was the culmination of the
       <strong>
        Manhattan Project
       </strong>
       . The Deep State loves their nukes and radiation -- indeed it seems to be their favorite weapon of mass terrorism.

       I personally lean towards nuclear demolition, just to be clear. I just think there was a bit more to that day. That's all. In the end, I don't think we will ever truly find out the truth, though.

       There's more to it, but it's mostly stagecraft. I think this one's nailed:

       Pretty good breakdown. But what about the "spire" that turns to dust as it's falling. I think probably none of us are able to answer this, based on experience, but can thermonukes do that? I think it's possible you have to throw in some DEW dustification tech into the terror soup served up that day.

       The whole structure of the building was disintegrated -- that is, it still looked like steel, but it had the consistency and strength of soft charcoal. You could crumble it with your hand. (That's why the still-solid top section fell down through it and made huge clouds of dust.) The same would be true of the spire.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit: The spire is what got me looking. I spent about a week at DEW, but thermonuclear is just such a more complete, more reasonable explanation. With DEW, you have unknown technology upon unknown technology. Nuclear technology is 70 years old and has been field-tested thousands of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it makes sense that the PsyOp machine has gotta spin up some kinda story to placate the folks that have noticed, "But... the buildings turned to dust! What happened to all the steel, the elevators, filing cabinets, carpet, bathroom fixtures, thousands of miles of pipe and wiring...??"

       The short answer is molecular destabilization.  At least, that's what happened to the buildings.  The cars are basically collateral damage-- due to them being separated from the ground by rubber tires turns, they became
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage">

       and melted.  There's an especially-damning pic from 9/11 (that I can't currently find) of one of these melted cars sitting next to a completely-unharmed tree.

       From the damage pattern, it seems more like a death-from-above kind of weapon.

       It's possible that one of the reasons planes were used on 9/11 was to clear the skies so there'd be no witnesses to this technology being used.

       OP as I read your post the thought came in that these dates are picked as a distraction from actual advanced technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       By using numerology and mythical symbolism, we can be manipulated it is something we are powerless to oppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the chains were tightend to beyond being ignored, the wage suppression, the theft of our wealth, the denial and removal of individual rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories began in earnest, Illuminati, aliens, secret religions, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while using technology developed by humans and paid for with our own tax money and former wages and the wealth that was stolen from us via:
      </p>
      <p>
       farm bubble bust, several stock market bubble busts,
      </p>
      <p>
       two housing bubble busts, one in the late 80s that flopped and the really big one in the 2000s,
      </p>
      <p>
       severral periods of mass unemployment, early 1980s, late 80s, post tech crash, post 2007 worldwide economic crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deceit and deception to hide the technology that we paid for that is being used to oppress us.

       Ok but how much do we know and there is the now spreading awareness that there was at least one advanced civilization on earth, maybe they are using technologies discovered  and not revealed and there is a not often mentioned  understanding of just what our intelligence is and the source of what is knowledge/intelligence, only hinted at and shared sparingly.

       I am glad you responded,  I was afraid that in my usual blunt style I had offended you, when I agree we are being subjected to and manipulated with technologies that are kept secret.

       I am not so certain about genetic manipulation  much as I am aware of  how plastic our brains actually are and how our thinking can be manipulated to change the brain pathways.

         they really must work harder to keep us duped.

         they are trying to replicate human intelligence and they need more data.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         it will be really dangerous if they learn how, and they intend to replicate it, thought I don't know if the physical tools can be used too do so but I don't think it is impossible, human thought is a physical reality, both a product of a reaction and the creation of an action, mirroring the creation of the universe from nothingness to its vastness.

       If that was produced by an ancient genetic manipulation to us earthbound humans the result became something that spun out of control once knowledge was lost to what was possibly  an astrological event that caused centuries of geologic disruption, all combined with our living earths natural machinations.

       But there is. If you had an unlimited budget, and could basically kidnap the most intelligent scientists on the planet, stick them in the desert in an underground lab for as long as you need, and have them just work on ONE thing you could solve just about any problem IMO (Gravity, Electromagnetism, Quantum Physics, Mind Control, ESP, ET, etc.)
      </p>

       If I was TPTB that is one of the 1st things I would have done.

       Given that if this has occurred it would have been spread out over many years and from many different countries, many of which have shall we say less developed record keeping, I believe this would be difficult if not impossible to know for sure. Add to that the people that willingly signed up for these types of positions and it's kind of besides the point.

       It is possible and even likely is the point I am trying to make.

       what you should instead be looking at is grad-student dissertations. take AI for example -- find the US schools with leading AI research programs, then look at the past graduate student work. You'll see some reeeally interesting stuff (but won't understand it lol. I generally just read abstracts and skim randomly). Look at where the students go after leaving the University. No where! Some go to private sector stuff, but many don't. No linkedin, no personal website, nada.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many years and so much effort spent on their schooling, and then they fade out of the job market/public research sector.

       No one can tell me why the space elevator is so mind blowingly -earth shattering"ly-improve our lives beyond our wildest dreams necessary.

      <p>
       What's the point, if there was a space elevator next door to me I would not care enough to use it, I have to use for one anymore than if my neighbor had a regular elevator .  There is nothing up in space for me, I don't need an elevator anymore than m town needs a monorail.

       Put solar panels into space, produce 10x as much energy from the same panel, completely clean energy at a 90% discount to current costs, whole industries emerge from the cheap electricity, and then you start mining asteroids.
      </p>

       In other words, something like 25% economic growth.

       Solar panels get produce more energy by being positioned out of our atmosphere/closer to the sun? That doesn't make sense to me, the panels already get more sunlight than they can utilize. The panels can only take in so much energy from the sun.  The most cutting edge top of the line panels can make approximately 290-300 kilowatts on earth. In space they would make the same, 290-300 kilowatts. They might get more UV radiation in space, but they can only take in 300 kw

       Ok, so the cars thing and rubber insulating. Did people wearing rubber soled shoes that day get dustified? Or if it only effects metal, did their glasses or jewellery gut dustified? There's something missing there. Maybe the rubber had to be tyre thickness, I dunno...

       Because heat travels a long way? Explosions create
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       amounts of heat, and the second it is released into the atmosphere it begins to dissipate. That doesn't mean go away, but it means it spreads out. I'm no explosive technician, but I would guess that half a mile away from an explosion you could still feel a lot of the heat. Half a mile isn't really that far.

       Thank you for sharing. I'm with you on the DEW rabbit hole, and I'm intrigued by the Plasco incident in Iran. How curious, it was built by the first Jewish Iranian to be sentenced to death, AND stuxnet apparently has a reference to his death in its code.  What was the motivation for taking it out?

       The short answer is
       <em>
        I don't know
       </em>
       but there's certainly alot of symbolism surrounding the building and its destruction.  There's no coincidences in this worldwide play we're watching unfold-- Stuxnet, Mr. Elghanian, DEWs, and the buildings destroyed all tie together somehow.

       I've always digged this conspiracy but pretty much right it off as disinfo due to the fact the information on such technology's is theoretical. And to 100% believe it would require faith for fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conspiracy clears up allot of the things that people over look. Like the burnt cars with nearly pristine rims and surviving foliage, Inward collapse of the cars and buildings, Molten steel, and the steel being turned into dust, and lastly why building damage at ground zero is

       It does require you to stop just thinking about technology you know exists and start to consider technologies that could possibly exist.  IMO, alot of things start to make more sense when you factor in advanced technologies like the DEW and weather manipulation.  Even

       Absolutely! You truly can't write off such possibility regarding black project technology. That's why this is probably my favorite version of the events. And as time goes by the theories around this version only get more plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just hard to break this one open to people when we already have a decades and a half's worth of "ingrained" theories.
      </p>

       It's nice seeing other people give this one more credence, thought, and research like you have. Cause until we know 100% what happened everything must be examined.

       Have you ever wondered if this has all happened before?  I can't help but think there were technologically advanced civilizations similar to ours thousands of years ago. However, there is no trace of them in our geological record. Is this kind of technology why there is no trace ?  I really started to wonder about this when Dr Wood talks about the melding of unlike substances.
