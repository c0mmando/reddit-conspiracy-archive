        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here are my reasons. I am open to any questions or rebuttals you may have.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Although anecdotal, there are so many people who report problems with their kids after certain vaccines. You could search YouTube and see people&#39;s home videos of the difference in their kids. Keep in mind these were PRO-VAXXERS. They willingly took their kid to get the shots. Do you choose to believe all these people are stupid?</p></li>
<li><p>The national vaccine injury compensation program. Aka &quot;vaccine court&quot;. Pays out billions to children found to be vaccine-injured. Not with the manufacturer&#39;s money, but with taxes. Protects the manufacturer from all liability. As a citizen, you are literally <strong>not allowed</strong> to sue a vaccine manufacturer. Isn&#39;t that at all fishy to you? Crony capitalism at its most obvious. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court</a></p></li>
<li><p>The CDC was caught hiding evidence of the MMR causing autism in African American boys. People argue that it&#39;s not enough to prove anything, there are so many other studies that prove no correlation, blah blah blah. But the fact that they were <strong>caught covering something up</strong>(!!!) should raise some alarm bells in people. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377033</a></p></li>
<li><p>The current vaccine schedule has never been studied for its safety in its entirety. Each individual vaccine has been studied for safety, but not all together. What about when they get 5 at once? No FDA tests in that regard, no studies. (Well, actually, there was one very recent pilot study that <strong>linked vaccination with an increase in neurodevelopmental disorders</strong>...but it was pulled from the journal and &quot;erased&quot; from the internet. Archive, bitches! <a href="https://archive.fo/DC1mj">https://archive.fo/DC1mj</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Contaminated vaccines are nothing new. Yall ever hear of the <strong>cancer causing SV40 virus in polio vaccines</strong> from 1955 to 1961? You should have! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10472327</a></p></li>
<li><p>Many vaccines are grown in cultures using the lung cells of an <strong>aborted human fetus</strong>. Literal human cells are in vaccines. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/aborted-fetuses-vaccines/story?id=29005539</a> Religious people may have a problem with that. But hey, the pope commented and said it&#39;s okay, so everyone should just relax right?</p></li>
<li><p>But vaccines work! True, but actually, disease has been on the decline either way. Polio was already on the decline because of sanitation and nutrition before the vaccine came out. Measles cases remained stable, but the death rate had plummeted to almost zero (due to better standard of living and medical care) before the vaccine came out. Think of the diseases that are gone now without vaccines: what happened to scarlet fever and stuff? <a href="http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964">http://vaccines.procon.org/view.additional-resource.php?resourceID=005964</a> </p></li>
<li><p>What about vaccines like chickenpox? Chickenpox is not a deadly disease (except for super immunocompromized people). Back in the day, everyone got chickenpox. Every time they were exposed to someone else who had it after that, it was like their &quot;booster&quot; shot. You didn&#39;t get shingles later, because you got your booster when you took care of your sick grandkid, for example. If a baby got sick, mom&#39;s immunities were passed to baby through her breastmilk. These days, if you&#39;ve had chickenpox, you&#39;re unlikely to be exposed since your children will be vaccinated. So without a shingles vaccine, you could get shingles. Purposely created dependency.</p></li>
<li><p>Live vaccines shed. You CAN catch mumps, measles, etc. from someone who was just recently vaccinated. That&#39;s many places like NICU&#39;s and oncology wards have a policy that recently vaccinated people may not visit. Why was it that the mumps outbreak at Harvard was <strong>ALL vaccinated people</strong>? How could they blame the source on unvaccinated students, when the only people sick were vaccinated? <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/harvard-mumps-outbreak-continues-commencement-will-go-n575526</a> What sucks about that, is mumps is a relatively harmless illness when you&#39;re a kid. It can make you sterile if you get it as an adult. So we&#39;re vaccinating kids, the immunity wears off over time, and they become susceptible when they&#39;re older.</p></li>
<li><p>The theory behind vaccine injury is that there is a certain population with a genetic predisposition for having an autoimmune reaction after some of these shots. Until we can discover and test for it in advance, it&#39;s not fair to play Russian roulette with our kids. Another example: the MTHFR gene. People who have it have less glutathione, which allows you to detox. There are real doctors out there who prefer not to vaccinate children who are homozygous for MTHFR, but they&#39;re all quacks right? Crazy anti-vaxxers right? Oh, and here&#39;s a study showing <strong>increased risk of adverse reactions to the smallpox vaccine in kids with that mutation.</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680</a> Why haven&#39;t we studied this in other vaccines?</p></li>

<p>&quot;Consequencing people for declining injections manufactured by companies whom cannot be held legally responsible, keep their safety data confidential, and have a revolving door policy with the agencies that regulate them...
That would be pure fucking madness.&quot;</p>

<li>Kids are getting shots throughout their childhood, any time something goes wrong, there is a good chance it is going to happen around the time they got a shot. So the fact that it is coincidental is neither surprising nor even remotely conclusive of anything. So I don&#39;t think they are stupid, but it is possible that they are confusing coincidence for causality.</li>
<li>If you understand the reason for this, no, it doesn&#39;t sound fishy. For good reason, the government has decided that vaccines are vital to public health. They don&#39;t want anything to interrupt the supply. If they were open to lawsuits, many manufacturers wouldn&#39;t want to take the risk and a lawsuit could get something to shut down, which would leave the population exposed.</li>
<li>No, this is untrue. They weren&#39;t &quot;hiding&quot; any evidence. They get tons of data, and have to decide which data is good data and which is bad. In the case you are referring to, it was decided that the reporting was not very reliable due to a lot of the information being incomplete. Like a lot of data they get, it got dumped, but there is no evidence that this was done maliciously or incorrectly. Only an internal person disagreeing. <em>Which is a good thing,</em> it is healthy for scientists to disagree.</li>
<li>You are correct. Because any such experiment would be unethical, because it would have to be done on children. However, we have a lot of data on the safe amounts of these ingredients, and the recommendations are kept well below the number determined for kids with unhealthy kidneys (meaning they can&#39;t filter it as quickly or effectively).</li>
<li>Yes, vaccines are not perfect. But considering you have to go back over a half century to find a case, you are pretty much revealing how safe they are.</li>
<li>Not accurate. The cell line was started from aborted fetuses, but they have been self propagating for over 50 years. There is no fetus in it any longer, certainly none that have been aborted. But I could still see how some religious nutters would be upset by this. But religious nutters being crazy isn&#39;t a good argument against vaccines.</li>
<li>It&#39;s true that other things help decline them as well. But if it were simply hygiene, we would have seen all the diseases go away at the same time, or at times completely unrelated to the introduction of the vaccine. However, they all went away at different times. <a href="https://medium.com/@visualvaccines/graphic-proof-that-vaccines-work-with-sources-61c199429c8c">And &quot;coincidentally,&quot; we saw the precipitous declines happen right after the introduction of their vaccines.</a></li>
<li>While chickenpox is a relatively benign disease, it did kill something like 100 people and caused tens of thousands of hospitalizations a year, before the introduction of the vaccine. We can argue whether or not it was &quot;worth it,&quot; but this did decrease hospitalizations and death due to the disease.</li>
<li>This seems like a weird point. We know that the mumps vaccine isn&#39;t as good as the measles part. However, these people didn&#39;t recently get the vaccines, they all received them when they were younger, before school. It isn&#39;t like this was linked to anyone getting the shot.</li>
<li>&quot;The theory behind vaccine injury is that there is a certain population with a genetic predisposition for having an autoimmune reaction after some of these shots.&quot; This isn&#39;t a &quot;theory,&quot; it is a hypothesis that no one has yet to produce a solid study to support. Could it be possible? Sure, no one has &quot;disproved&quot; it. But floating it as a valid concern at this point doesn&#39;t make much sense because there is nothing to support it.</li>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So a child gets the shot, then gets lethargic that night and never speaks again? Yeah, total coincidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are 4 million kids born each year in the US, if autism rates are as high as people claim they are, and it is around 1 in 40. Assuming an equal distribution of when they first show symptoms, that would mean 273 are showing their symptoms <em>per day.</em> It should come as no surprise to anyone who understands statistics that <em>a lot</em> of kids are going to start showing symptoms soon after they get a vaccination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;ve explained their reasoning, that it&#39;s in the interest of public health, but that doesn&#39;t make it right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You claimed it was &quot;suspicious&quot; without pointing out why they say they do it. They could be lying, but considering the benefits of vaccination, the reasoning makes perfect sense. &quot;They might be lying&quot; isn&#39;t a great argument supporting the claim that it is &quot;suspicious.&quot; It&#39;s more &quot;suspicious&quot; that you withheld the stated reason for this in your point. Doing so would have weakened your position, so it doesn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can say it&#39;s not true all you want but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are correct. But this cuts both ways. Just because you say they were intentionally trying to hide the data doesn&#39;t mean they are. And considering they gave very good and valid reasons to disregarding the data, and no one of any substances has backed up claims by Thompson that this was done unfairly, I find it hard to believe your position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said we are using new fetuses. It&#39;s still DNA and cells from a fetus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said, and I quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many vaccines are grown in cultures using the lung cells of an aborted human fetus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not saying &quot;they share the same DNA as some aborted fetuses from 40 years ago.&quot; It is saying they are using cells from an aborted fetus, which is untrue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Source? Because college students get vaccinated all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are correct, I do not have a source. Although, the article you linked to talked about the problem of the vaccines losing efficacy from when they were given at childhood. But where is your source that the spread originated from an actual vaccination?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are doctors saying this, not just a random bloggers hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your <em>first study</em> is by Graham Ewing. This man isn&#39;t a doctor nor a scientist. He is a businessman, according to his own website. I&#39;m not going to bother to wade through the rest of the gish gallop when your first link isn&#39;t even one of a doctor, as you claimed it was.</p>

<p>But I would question the morals of any religious person who would be willing to let millions of children get sick and/or die each year because the cells used to make the vaccines came from a fetus over 40 years ago.</p>

<p>Can we agree also agree that, despite your claim that they were all done by doctors, that the very first study you linked to was not done a by a doctor, but by a business person who has a financial incentive in alternate medicines?

    <div class="md"><p>Way to not address any of their arguments and instead claim they&#39;re  &quot;going around in circles.&quot;</p>

<p>I have a few things to add:</p>

<p>3: As the other guy said, there was no cover-up.  There was an issue with data reporting. Basically low birth weight is a confounder for neurodevelopmental disorders, so the authors preferred birth certificates to confirm birth weight, but there was not accurate reporting of that for African American males for some reason.  That&#39;s my understanding, at least.  There&#39;s no hard evidence that the data was covered up, other than the testimony of one co-author who has yet to produce any hard evidence of his claims.</p>

<p>4: There&#39;s no reason to perform such complicated studies when there&#39;s no evidence they need to be performed.  Multiple large cohort studies conducted on multiple continents using 1000s of children found no increased risk of any disorders in vaccinated children vs unvaccinated.  There&#39;s no reason to study this issue further.
5) That&#39;s more of an issue with good manufacturing practices of medical products as opposed to an issue with vaccines themselves.
7. Common misconception.  Mortality for polio declined before vaccines but morbidity did not.  That was thanks to the invention of the iron lung.  Morbidity didn&#39;t decrease until the inactivated polio vaccine was introduced. 
8. You&#39;re free to not get the herpes zoster vaccine if you don&#39;t want it. You do risk complications of a zoster infection like blindness, however.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to parents who have anything bad happen to their children regardless of what the cause is but let me tell you a little story about my child...</p>

<p>I have a child who seemed perfectly normal right up to the day he was due to have his 18 month vaccinations, and then wham, bam I had a child who lost his words, lost his self-feeding skills, started having melt downs and began displaying very autistic like symptoms. But there&#39;s a twist to my story...because we were in a not very medically progressive country when my child was due his 18 month vaccinations, he didn&#39;t actually get them until he was 20 months old and his regression had already kicked in hard. </p>

<p>The regression was so sudden, so shocking, I can now completely understand why many a parent would come to believe that the vaccinations did it. I thank the fates everyday that I didn&#39;t have him vaccinated at 18 months because if I had I really can&#39;t be certain I wouldn&#39;t have become an anti-vaxxer myself. It would have seemed so obvious, so difficult not to think that the vaccinations were the cause and then I would have gone online and read over &amp; over again the stories of others who had experienced the same tragedy.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s not proof that vaccines don&#39;t cause autism, but it is something to keep in mind. It is completely understandable that parents (like me) would be certain that the vaccine did it but it is still very possible that it didn&#39;t, and the timing of the vaccine just made it look like that.</p>

<p>But as I said at the start, I&#39;m not particularly pro-vax regardless because the vaccine schedule compared to what a lot of us had when we were children has gotten very aggressive. We pump a shipload of this stuff into our very young and the campaigns against anti-vaxxers are also very aggressive &amp; unforgiving. The former concerns me because when you are pregnant my god you are not supposed to do so many ordinary life things because it might harm the baby but apparently once the child is born it&#39;s open season on injecting all sorts of things into them. The latter concerns me because it stifles debate and the last thing society should do is bend its ass over to the ruling class and let them inject stuff into us without question.</p>

<p>Anyway, I said above that the vaccine schedule has changed a lot at least since I was a kid. And for those that really want to think about this issue properly I&#39;ll list here what it was for my children just a few short years ago. I do this because I don&#39;t think a lot of people have any idea how many vaccinations they get these days.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it goes:</p>

<p>My youngest received vaccinations for 8 different illnesses before he was 3 months old (1 was non-mandatory but advised strongly). This was repeated at 4 months as a top up, then another top up of the same at 6 months. </p>

<p>Another 5 illnesses were vaccinated against at 12 months. And then a top up for 4 of those illnesses again at 18 months, plus 1 more new vaccination. </p>

<p>So just a few years ago in Australia your child was required to have vaccinations for 13 different illnesses (though one is taken orally) before they are two. I believe the schedule has changed slightly since, but I think that was more to do with timing.
They are:
1. Hepatitis B x 3
2. Diphtheria x 3*
3. Tetanus x 3*
4. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) x 3*
5. Polio x 3*
6. Hib x 4
7. Infant pneumococcal x 3
8. Rotavirus x 3 (Oral)
9. Measles x 2
10. Mumps x 2
11. Rubella x 2
12. Meningococcal x 1
13. Varicella (Chicken pox) x 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Requires a repeat at age 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Thankfully or worryingly there is not a separate injection for each one.</p>

<p>It also concerned me as a parent that there is no adjustment done to the schedule for premmie babies, so when one of my sons had his two month injections, he technically was only 3 weeks old as he was born 5 weeks early. I hope they do adjust the schedule for more extreme premmie cases! </p>

<p>So despite my initial rebuttal who knows? My eldest son who shows very mild autism symptoms was three weeks premmie, my younger son with much more problematic autism traits was five weeks premmie. </p>

<p>Perhaps they were too young to start getting vaccines. Or they they just inherited autism via myself, as I have autistic tendencies myself. As non-scientific plebs we just can&#39;t say. But that is why debate should be allowed, why people should be allowed to express concern and why governments &amp; corporations must always be accountable. :)</p>

That is difficult to research. <a href="https://www.pop.org/bad-blood-in-the-philippines/">https://www.pop.org/bad-blood-in-the-philippines/</a><br/>
There are no &#39;&#39;reputable sources&#39;&#39;. I found Philippines Times articles years ago, and they were posted on reddit by me, but all disappeared soon after I posted them.<br/>
Anyone wishing to knee jerk dismiss me with &#39;&#39;scientists checked it out&#39;&#39; has obviously not looked into the intricate details of this &#39;&#39;science&#39;&#39;.<br/>
3 countries did not conspire together to come up with an identical story from people from their poorest areas. That would be quite absurd to postulate that slant.<br/>
&#39;&#39;Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua. In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12346214">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12346214</a><br/>
&#39;&#39;In a statement released last week by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, the medical organization said it had ordered laboratory tests of tetanus vaccines being administered in Kenya by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). “The unfortunate truth is that the vaccine was laced with [sterilizing agent Human Chorionic Gonadotropin] HCG just like the one used in the South American cases,” Dr. Wahome Ngare said in a statement for the Catholic doctors group that helped expose the scheme after the test results came back positive. “Further, none of the girls and women given the vaccination were informed of its contraceptive effect.” &#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of points on there OP and I don&#39;t want to address them all.  I will however address a select few.</p>

<ol>
<li>You admitted yourself that&#39;s all anecdotal.  The information from an anecdote is incomplete and, by nature, unreliable.  Not to mention when parents report these things, human memory is fallible and subject to cognitive biases that distort the truth. That&#39;s why anecdotes are a very low form of evidence.  How do we know exactly what happened with these children?  We don&#39;t, and that&#39;s the problem with anecdotes.</li>
<li>This is incorrect.  An early draft of the Destefano study suggested an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in black male children. The final published draft controlled for a confounder known to be associated with those disorders, low birthweight, and the increased risk went away.  The issue in the earlier draft is that the study authors didn&#39;t have birth certificates to confirm birth weight in that population. The CDC didn&#39;t hide anything, William Thompson was a co-author who simply disagreed with the final results.</li>
<li> There&#39;s no reason to perform such complicated studies when there&#39;s no evidence they need to be performed.  Multiple large cohort studies conducted on multiple continents using 1000s of children found no increased risk of any disorders in vaccinated children vs unvaccinated.  There&#39;s no reason to study this issue further.</li>
<li>That&#39;s more of an issue with good manufacturing practices of medical products as opposed to an issue with vaccines themselves.</li>
<li>They&#39;re used to MAKE vaccines, they aren&#39;t used IN vaccines.  It&#39;s up to the individual if that bothers you.</li>
<li>Common misconception.  Mortality for polio declined before vaccines but morbidity did not.  That was thanks to the invention of the iron lung.  Morbidity didn&#39;t decrease until the inactivated polio vaccine was introduced. </li>
<li>You&#39;re free to not get the herpes zoster vaccine if you don&#39;t want it. You do risk complications of a zoster infection like blindness, however.</li>
<li>Hypotheses, not theories.  The influence of genetic mutations on neurodeveopmental Disorders is still ongoing.  So far there&#39;s no way to predict and prevent adverse vaccine reactions.  More research needs to be done.</li>
</ol>
