       I guess the only way to get to the top is to do favors for those already at the top. If you don't, they will never allow you to get there. I don't think a lot of the grassroots movements are legit, especially ones that gain a lot of traction because those at the top are always one step ahead of everyone and would immediately shut down any organically growing movement in a heartbeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organizing within your community does help though, at least locally, so it's not good to be complacent either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really mean protesting either. Sometimes protesting is just fruitless, and is sometimes used by those at the top to ridicule those with a voice. They'll take advantage of this situation and turn it into something in their favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe just start your day with more positive attitudes towards everyone. If you're a Trump supporter, and you see someone wearing an article of clothing advocating for the other team, don't start having negative attitudes towards the guy. Just treat him like a normal human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       And likewise, if you can't stand Trump and you see a MAGA hat, don't get all riled up. Just smile at the guy, start a conversation with him and find out more about his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone's life has worth, regardless of their political affiliation. Everyone has a story for why they think the way they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organize with people you wouldn't normally agree with. Find people who share different perspectives, find a common ground and work from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unity is the answer, not division.

       I like this a lot. The paradigm of conflict and teams keeps us stuck in this cycle where the "elite" stay in control. Choosing to be decent, kind, and compassionate to all beings while encouraging people to wake up and make the changes they want to see in their own life will help change in the long run.

       To be honest I support trump, not because he is the greatest thing since sliced bread, just that of the two choices he was the better as far as i can see. If bernie ran against trump he would have won, but he also would have driven the economy into the toilet so fast. He is part of it as well, but I would put him on the same level as trump in terms of corruption and being on the take. Clean as a politician can get i suppose. He got fucked by his own party and hasn't really put up a fight about it which leaves some questions open but still would have preferred him vs trump and to have a real discussion on where the world is headed rather than clinton vs trump and the discussion on who is going to lead us to ww3.

       Corrupt elites?  Like the several billionaires in the president's cabinet?  The elites voted for him, they don't want him gone, and all he's actually gotten done as president is make it legal to sell your internet history, and allow for more pollutants in our children's air and water.  His secy of state is the CEO of the largest oil&amp;gas company in the world.  So, you're talking out your ass.

       dude believe it or not there are actually some good people out there.  they are VERY hard to find in politics... almost all politicians are truly scum-of-the-earth assholes.  but bernie is still fighting the good fight.  he has not toned down his rhetoric.  just the other day, while on TV with Tom Perez, he said that we need to "point the finger at the ruling class".  Ain't nodoby inthe DNC leadership who likes Bernie's anti-corporate, class-conscious, proudly-Leftist rhetoric.  Whenever he is on CNN and they try to dereail him with their shitty coroprate talking points, he brings the convo back around to the big issues facing our country, like poverty and a weak social safety net, income inequality.... And he is still loudly calling for single-payer!!  Even though the leadership of the DNC refuses to endorse the single-payer policy!

       His consistent voting record for 40 years and continuing to fight after he lost tells me all there is to know. He drives like a 1990 Toyota or something, if he's on the take he's not doing it right. That's part of the game, they don't want you to trust anyone especially if they are actually trustworthy. He did plenty of things I didn't like like suggesting a third party vote would be wasted, but him supporting Clinton did get several positions changed in the DNC platform. He isn't perfect but I think he is truly one of the honest few. I also think Tulsi Gabbard is another one, the only one fighting the Saudi Arms deal.

       Bernie's good. 
If the DNC didn't rig the primaries, we would have had Bernie kicking ass right now.
Controlled opposition would never spill the truth like Bernie has, that's how I know he's on our side but remember this....
Anyone can be controlled partially or fully.
I think Bernie is somewhat controlled but NOT full on "controlled opposition".
He's a genuine person who was probably attacked by the establishment.
I.e. maybe he's not allowed to say certain things about Israel and 9/11 (or simply he wouldn't say it out of being called a conspiracy theorist).
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way, never put 100% trust in any one person.
Bernie was threatened somehow.
Morally, physically, contractually/legally, etc. who knows.

       I don't trust Ron Paul's bullshit far right libertarian economics but there's a part of me that thinks "maybe he just wants to win to end the FED and then the bullshit libertarian mask falls off and he'll actually do good economics like democratic socialism or social democracy or at least centrist economics".
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not holding my breath. It would be interesting plan to run like Ron Paul only to disguise
his intentions of just ending the FED to get the ball rolling, to "I'm a libertarian, I'm different you guys".
But it's about as convincing as Donald Trump being anti-establishment....
You feel there's a chance....but it's not going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust Bernie more than Ron Paul.
Bernie says what he means and means what he says.
But trust your instincts first and foremost.
I hold no grudge against Bernie.
Whether he was threatened in some way or not (remember that brick thrown in one of his offices? FALSE FLAG, probably the damn DNC did it to scare Bernie/his staff, not some random punk jackass.)
      </p>
      <p>
       but I refuse to tarnish Bernie's legacy of redpilling the nation on the truth about economic/social corruption in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not controlled opposition but he may be somewhat controlled.
Hence why I tell people to STOP tarnishing his legacy
but DO question ANYTHING and everything ANYONE says.
If Bernie said "trust Ron Paul, vote for him",
I would automatically be weary.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my view.

       Pretty sure he was heavily pressured.  I mean he did just watch them kill a young supporter (Seth Rich) with no problem.  All it would take is a "watch the news tomorrow.  Sad news. You REALLY should endorse Hillary".  I'd fold too.  They have the entire media industry, deep state, and every dirty politician on both sides.  What could you do against the entire shadow government?

       That would work if they threatened you directly, but these snakes never work like that.  It's always indirect and vague.  They're too slimy to catch and, once again, they have the entire media industry to teach people what to think. There is no win.  Ref. DSW "There will be consequences".

       I bet he didn't expect to be cheated out of a candidacy when he said that.  That dirty information stream you so detest is the reason we've learned about the corruption and the propaganda is what is being used to cover up the "basic facts".

       Your "facts" try and spin the truth. Plenty of Anti-Trump bullshit on Reddit without me adding to it.  Doesn't mean I'm a fan.  Wtf does that have to do with bernie.  The fact that you went there not only shows your inability to argue it also speaks volumes about your maturity level.  "He's making sense!  Quick!  Call him a Trump supporter!".  Haha.  Grow up.

       Your history defies your "not a fan" claim. You're like all those Republican Senators running for re-election who suddenly went from supporting Donald Trump to opposing him, then a few days later, all waffled back to supporting him. A snake.

       He was not controlled opposition from the start.
No way in hell would the establishment allow someone to blurt out
THAT much truth.
Bernie woke up the nation.
Also, Bernie has a fairly consistently record.
He's not a fake CIA asset or controlled oppositon.
He's an honest man who has been taken advantage of by the establishment.
Or the contract he signed to get into the DNC/media coverage,
required that he endorse whoever won.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNC rigged the primaries....Bernie got screwed over.
It's so easy to act tough behind the keyboard but
I don't think anyone would find it so easy to go against those satanic pieces of shit.
Bernie was damn couragious as it is
with how he was so public and threatened, smeared, etc.
      </p>

       I'm proud of what Bernie has done.
He's done us a favor, no matter what anyone says.
He's spread the truth like no one before him in his position.

       Well, on the bright side,
Bernie's message has spread to millions of people worldwide.
That is something I thank Bernie for greatly as no mainstream candidate
(in the two party system) has ever spilled so much truth in modern times in the U.S..
The truth that Trump or Obama spilled was absolutely tiny in comparison.
Superficial even.
Bernie would have destroyed Trump had the DNC not rigged the primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do think that Bernie was in pain when he endorsed Clinton.
I think he may have had to sign a contract where he must
endorse whoever wins, or he wouldn't be allowed to join the
private corporate DNC party, and therefore not have ANY corporate media coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching the video when he endorsed Clinton,
it looked SOOO psyop-y
with Clinton looking sort of innocent (for once)
with her hair and makeup done differently....it was surreal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie is no backstabber in my opinion, 
I don't think he had a choice and quite frankly,
I think him being allowed to spread his message was worth
it.
Otherwise we'd have the same
"Obama like candidate VS Romney like candidate"
which is barely a choice as the policy differences were minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look how disgusting that bitch Clinton looks.

       I don't care what anyone says,
Bernie is a hero with a legacy.
I would still be weary of what comes out of his mouth
because he can be restrained like anyone can be,
but I will never smear his decades long honest legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitches and shills online will still parrot
behind their keyboards that they'd never endorse Clinton
even if there was a sniper in the audience or would go to prison for going against the contracts or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care what anyone says,
Bernie has done us a massive favor by spreading the truth for several months.
Even if he becomes completely compromized tomorrow,
I won't forget what Bernie has done for this country and potentially the world
if the social democracy movement spread to other countries.
He got the ball rolling.
The U.S. went Bernie-mad and then the DNC rigged the primaries.
This could be a new era but we have to campaign for a Bernie-like candidate
EARLY or we'll be screwed again by the elite's bullshit tactics.
End the two party system.

       Sarah, you know Bernie doesn't actually trust Clinton/DNC.
He's been fighting against Obama/Clinton/Trump/Bush type policies for decades/
He only ran as a Democrat to avoid a corporate media blackout.
I agree with you that the two party system is utter shit
but I disagree that Bernie is a "bitch/loser".
He did all he could do and honestly, even though there are still fucking retards who think he's a communist dictator, millions have still woken up to the anti-establishment truth about the skewed crony capitalism to socialism ratio for the common man. (Laissez-faire economics is also a bad idea though let alone crony type capitalism.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Bernie doesn't buy the idea that the DNC can be changed from the inside,
I think he's gotten enough physical/political threats to understand the DNC is unredeemable.
And as a counter balance, the Republicans, even with Trump cannot be trusted.
I hope Trump is doing the so called "24D chess" bullshit theory but I'm not holding my breath,
he's screwing us big time and I'm perplexed at how you can be a Bernie primary voter
yet hang around in the cult echo chamber The_Donald where it's zionist controlled,
not allowed to criticize "god emperor trump", Pinochet-loving retards making frog kek jokes like they're that funny and not allowed to criticize zionist Israel......that's what I call controlled opposition,
not Bernie 40 year consistent record Sanders.
Just super saiyin. :P
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO Trump is either 100% controlled (perhaps owing Rothschild a favor for maybe bailing
him out or something) or only slightly anti-establishment like Obama was....which was barely any improvement.
Bernie's legacy shouldn't be tarnished, that act actually screws us over because
it attempts to wipe the good that he's done.
The last hurdle was disappointing but to smear his entire legacy just because he was
threatened is not a good idea.

       You would have to be more specific as to your meaning.  Saying you support someone who is corrupt automatically damages your integrity.

       You shouldn't support anyone in office, only approve or disapprove. Obviously elections are different but the election is over and we should hold our leaders accountable no matter who it is or if you voted for them.

       I honestly don't believe it matters who sits in the oval office, their agenda, or what they believe.  I think the moment the "winner" is decided they're sat down with the shadow government, told how it's gunna be, and then shown the "lost" confiscated JFK footage of what happens to someone not following their agenda.

       I think there is cultural shift happening right now. The problem with a lot of voters is we're fighting the last war. We glorify the 60s and 70s and their cultural movement without laying any of the blame to our current crises on their feet. It's time to stop clinging to archaic policies and policies that have been proven to not work. The solution is in the youth, and a culture that scape goats their youth is a dying culture.
      </p>

       It feels like in America we're all in this crypt with all the old guards and they would rather we all stay in that crypt then let new and young people try it our way. They do this because as a society we are clinging to past America.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said I'm hopeful though because I think more people are becoming aware of this everyday. It is a waste of time to fall into melancholy and nihilism.  We matter and our voice matters. Someday soon it will be a new people governing America, one not married to the past and to themselves.
