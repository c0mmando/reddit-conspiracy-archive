<p>Anytime you see a post here get over like 500 upvotes means it shot up fast enough to show up on the first couple pages of <a href="/r/all/">/r/all/</a>... we used to have bots/brigades just thrust stuff up into the quadruptle digits, but I think they caught on to how artificial it looked and toned it down a little. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t usually visit this sub but I&#39;m asking a sincere question, isn&#39;t this a legitimate conspiracy? In the past 40 years politicians talk about getting &quot;tough on crime&quot; and that refers to the drug wars. People get locked up in private prison where wealthy people at the top profit. Marijuana has proven to be helpful in treating diseases and disorders so if that becomes legal big pharma will see a cut in their profits. It&#39;s also a good Boogeyman to increase government power and push us closer to a police state. I usually lurk and have some complaints about the sub... but I think reviving the Drug War is worthy of outrage.</p>

<p>Sure, but by not visiting this sub you miss the context that causes me to make my comment. The combination of account age, content and now it&#39;s abandoned are clues. </p>

<p>The biggest factor though is that was being pushed as one of the daily coordinated hits against people associated with Trump and if you read the source memorandum or even watch that video, he never mentions &#39;drugs&#39; once. </p>

<p>I sometimes wish we could setup a database of trusted friends of friends.  I have a list of people I respect as clear thinkers.  I am sure each of them have a list of people.

    <div class="md"><p>I know, false tags happen.  Just because you mark me as that, doesn&#39;t mean you ignore me - just that you might be biased against my posts.  And over time if you see that I am actually neutral and you just tagged me during a Trump positive stretch - you can always change the tag.  I&#39;ve done that for people I misread.</p>

<p>Try RES out sometime.  It really is helpful.  Only negative is that the database is stored only on that computer.  So if you get on another computer in the house, or mobile, tags are not available.  Would be nice to have a roaming profile, like how bookmarks travel in chrome when logged in.</p>

<p>Fuck Right wing Fuck Right wing. </p>

<p>But apparently the argument goes independent media is against MSM and Donald Trump is against MSM therefore all independent media is right wing.Fuck that noise. </p>

<p>Look at: 
* Corbett Report. 
* Ha Goodman. 
* Tim Black. 
* George Webb. 
* Styx. </p>

<p>theres thousands of others but those are on the top of my mind. Reply or PM if you want more independent sources..... and remember just because someone agrees with Trump on one thing doesn&#39;t mean they are a trump supporter. </p>

<p>MSM is pushing drivel daily. Don&#39;t fall for it. There are solid voices out there if you look. </p>

<p>If you put your partisan politics aside and look at the big picture, you&#39;ll see the source of the problem is corporate and banker money controlling both parties. We need to rally behind any candidate from any party that will fight to get money out of politics. Only then can we hope to regain control of our democracy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are some candidates that get this. And there is a moment <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com/28th">to cut the strings that the corporations use to control their politicians.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you insinuating that I&#39;m a reptillian shill who&#39;s trying to throw people off the trail or whatever?  If so, I am oddly charmed and will take that as a compliment!</p>

<p>Anyway, if you reread, you will notice that I mentioned the Seth Rich IP thread.  Just that thread.  If you had read it, then you would remember that someone was claiming that they knew Seth Rich&#39;s IP address and that it had pinged Skype at an abandoned hospital after he died.  The issue is that the IP address that they claimed was a very generic one and not Seth&#39;s and the &#39;abandoned hospital&#39; is in fact now a homeless shelter.  That post was wrong.  I didn&#39;t say that the Seth Rich conspiracy is totally fake in that post, though I do personally think that people are making it super partisan.</p>

<p>As for why I&#39;m here, it&#39;s because I find conspiracies interesting, the weirder the better.  It&#39;s like an interesting alternate fiction story that I can ponder.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll need to look those up.  My personal favorites to thin about are related to cryptozoology and the potential of an extinct species somehow managing to stay alive despite everything.  For instance, Tasmanian tigers aka the thylacaine, the Washington&#39;s Eagle, the Florida panther, etc.</p>

<p>The Santa Marta Toro was one of those too and God, I was so convinced that it had managed to somehow make it.  Scientists recently managed to actually get pictures of one and it was like Christmas for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is pretty awesome, man. Cryptozoology is fascinating. I saw something not too long ago about a famous strange looking dog that is sighted in certain places around here in the US. One guy gave a pretty good theory about it being a rare genetic anomaly of a certain species of fox called the sampson fox. They grow extremely large for their species type. Oh and you cannot forget about the okapi... love them.</p>

Which is why /new is where I go to see actual content suited for this sub.

<p>There can be a dozen Seth Rich posts on the front page, but major stories on the subject (Fox News retracting their story, Rich&#39;s parents&#39; WaPo piece) will just get buried in Controversial.

    <div class="md"><p>Amen! Dorfaladin, don&#39;t you see that we&#39;re not telling people to stop posting things about our politics and their corruption, but the fact is that so much of this sub has been subverted into ONLY talking about it, that it gets to be a bit much, especially when no real leads are presented. Everything&#39;s on the table to talk about here, but we will demand that new evidence be presented and not just more of the same, seems pretty legit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the front page is mostly reposts about the same subject, just different wording, even I find myself going to the New page often.</p>

<p>But I feel this is a good thing as well, especially the constant reminder that the ISPs are desperately trying to take down Net Neutrality by posting their own customer data. </p>

<p>In other words, although it is pretty boring to see the same story, the awareness is important. Mainly because these are things happening <em>right now</em> and <em>will</em> have a huge impact in the near future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They changed the reddit algorithm. </p>

<p>A few years ago, content was always fresh. Then posts on all subs started hanging around for hours longer than they normally would. </p>

<p>The front page (of reddit) went from having posts that were new to posts that last anywhere from 8-15hrs.</p>

<p>And this was a few years ago. The front page of every sub is way more static than it used to be. </p>

<p>And slightly off-topic but used to weight the subs in 3 tiers if I remember correctly, so it was highly unlikely a post from this sub would even make the front page. </p>

<p>Now they changed it again so posts get way more up votes. Top posts went from 10k+ to 25k+ and most of us think it was a way to promote advertiser interests and hide subs they don&#39;t want making the front page. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all just a big mess. You can&#39;t blame the mods for the state of our front page imo. I know we&#39;ve had a ton of politically focused stuff but we just had an election and this always happens and considering how crazy this one was I&#39;m not surprised. </p>

<p>I believe you are right, that aliens may hold that key. There&#39;s just so many weird instances of imagery throughout history that seems an awful lot like extraterrestrials have visited us. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop there. What I realised by paging through this subreddit is that there are plenty of genuine conspiracies that are being drowned out by these political posts. I&#39;m not calling the posters I&#39;ve listed above, shills or disengenious but some of them are using this subreddit as an attack platform. I really want to read about actual conspiracies but it&#39;s near impossible with this much spam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so glad this thread is a thing. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been trying to talk about for months. There have been many people who agree with me, but also a steady stream of Trumpist/Russians willing to copypasta reply to me and put me down for even mentioning it. With fake outrage at my suggestion and concern trolling.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not just paid upvoting, it&#39;s also a team  of brigaders to steer the narrative towards one particular partisan narrative. </p>

<p>Do you guys get it now? The Republican side of politics needs to start being looked at now. Why are they doing this? How much are they colluding with the Russians? How many Democrats are also siding with the Republicans on certain legislation? </p>
