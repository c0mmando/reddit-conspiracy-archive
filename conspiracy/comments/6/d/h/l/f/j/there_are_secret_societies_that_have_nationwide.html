       Maybe all that talk about "the pizza pages" and credit card processing in the leaked Stratfor emails (WikiLeaks) was about extortion.

       Maybe the whole thing is about extortion.  Someone once theorized that they drug anyone they want to control, place them in a situation considered pedo, and use it against them to get what they want.  Thus the need for children.  Fill me in on the credit card processing - I think I missed it.

       That's crazy. I don't think it's designed for that, more like dues tracking software and like an organizational membership tool, but it definitely could be used like that and I don't see how it wouldn't be.

       Wouldn't surprise me. Most organizations are like that. Even in fiction, do you really think every Imperial Stormtrooper knew the Emperor was building a space station to blow up planets? Probably not. People with power tend to abuse it and those without don't always have the perspective to see it.

       This is a great opportunity for me to tell everyone who is a fan of Star Wars to go check the novel titled Lost Stars. It's amazing and it explores ideas around that question. The underlings don't necessarily know about the evil going on at the top.

       Well I mean the timelines already diverged in a major since they didn't go right from Endor to Bakura to fight the Ssi-Ruuk. Plus VIII is like 34 ABY and by that time there'd also been the Yevetha, Centerpoint Crisis, Thrawn, all kinds of stuff. Plus Chewbacca was dead by that point thanks to the aforementioned Yuuzhan Vong.

       Oh they've changed plenty of stuff in the new canon, I just meant that I don't think there's anything necessarily in Lost Stars in particular which contradicts past events of the old universe. Some of the new stuff slides in comfortably, some of it tears the old stuff apart and replaced it completely.

       I mean, it may be arguing semantics, but it's certainly not proof that they are, in fact, up to what you imply they are, but rather that they COULD BE up to those things using their network.

       Before you see conspiracy in my downvote, note I did it because your idea about this site being used for sinister reasons like finding a killer doctor to activate sounds unreasonable.  Think more like the mafia.  If they want to do something out of their area, they would reach out to the mafia of that area and make a deal.  Local mafia knows about what resources they have and process accordingly.  No complicated database that needs huge amounts of manpower  updating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, the updating - think of all those people moving jobs, going on maternity leave, dying, changing lines of work, going to jail, etc.  You really think that is done manually?

         Freemasons and the Scottish Rite are NOT secret societies. They own large buildings and operate websites, and are registered 501.c3 organizations. While they might be an organization with secrets, that's very different from being a secret organization.

         It's a membership database. Just like the Rotary has one, or your local chamber of commerce, and your name and occupation is most likely listed there as well.

       Just like any other religion or spiritual path, most of the things being told are allegorical and/or metaphorical. Symbolism and words are not meant for literal interpretations (and if religious fundamentalists understood that, the world would be a more peaceful place, but I digress... that's another discussion).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any grips, secret words or rituals have no meaning out of context. You can find almost everything online nowadays, just ask your good friend Google. But that doesn't mean you understand the context, nor would it give you anything of value.
      </p>

       Not sure what kind of "evidence" your are talking about, but by all means, regardless of what religion or spiritual path an individual belongs to, if they are planning atrocious acts, do let us know.

       You're right and you're wrong. The literal meanings are true, there is a real God that created us. There are also symbolic meanings, like Jesus being the stone that the masons rejected.

       I was at an acquaintance house one night, he's a mason, fathers a mason, grandfather and I'm guessing so on. I decided it was time to leave and he said "can't leave yet" told him too bad. 15 minutes down the road I got pulled over and put through the whole sobriety test. Cop was a mason. I passed, but I couldn't help but feel as if my acquaintance had me pulled over. I was even asked if I was a terrorist by the officer. It was the strangest encounter I had with masons.
