       The simple truth of the matter is that this particular period in time is a complete clusterfuck. Trump is scum, he looks and feels slimy and dirty. I dunno why some americans think he's charismatic. Comes off as the exact opposite every time I've seen him talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary fucked up, the collusion to defeat Bernie and then her eventual implosion as her stuff came to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will get impeached by the end of the year, look at the speed and severity of the accusations coming out against him, plus some of those russia links are good. Also I can't believe that people forgot that r/thedonald was taken over in between, during the height of his campaign. I remember one of the OG mods saying that he'd been ousted by someone who had taken over the sub.

       If you though 2016 was crazy believe me you, you ain't seen nothing yet.

       One last thing, to any truth seekers here, you won't find anything here, it's been astroturfed. Look at the sidebar and see the number of subscribers, see the number of active users its ~2000 to 3000. It's a big sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know what's really going on either climb up the ranks or start looking at the documents and do your own research. Peace out.

       This sub does seem to be having way more Seth Rich posts compared to anti trump posts being started. It seems pretty obvious that it's suspect and that it all hit like a brick wall on here at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said the majority of the people who contribute to this sub seem to be sick of discussing these same political left vs right issues BS so you can't get mad when people just don't give a fuck about it cause it's exhausting. It's the only shit you will ever hear on the news and people come here for a little something else with more factual substance than he said this and she said this from my anonymous source

       so you're trying to tell me the russians hacked the elections? and seth is just some random dude?  so tell me then, why would the russians do that? what is their end game? cold war? or this ends in war? i don't think anybody wants a usa russian war... so why would they hack the elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       on the other hand, clinton and her group of cabals lost the elections because they're too dumb and naive and corrupt to get away with everything, you can probably think of a hundred different motives to hack the elections, which we all know cia/nsa has the tools to do, since they were released on fucking github
      </p>
      <p>
       ok, i'm sure there are dozens of reasons why the russians could do that and why is trump connected to much to russia then? i don't know, probably just business, contract here, contract there, billions to me, billions to you yada yada like corrupt bastard do. but collusion for what reason? war? i don't buy it i don't know maybe i just didn't dig deep enough
