<blockquote>
<p>Why did the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the same? Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.</p>

<p>Though it’s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice, much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book, “National Security and Double Government,” he catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability, transparency, or checks and balances of any kind. He uses the term “double government”: There’s the one we elect, and then there’s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked. Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Glennon cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added 30,000 more troops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The quote that pretty much says it all for me was... &quot;something else is going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W. Bush administration.&quot; </p>

<p>The glue that holds that holds and strings all those administrations all together is the still ongoing &quot;State of Emergency&quot; and &quot;Continuance of Government&quot; provisions that the entire country has been living under since they were illegitimately and unconstitutionally passed into law and allowed to continue to this very day because there is every indication that the Bush administration was either complicit or else allowed 9/11 to take place to fulfil that ambition.</p>

<p>And of course all those police-state fascist policies are all directly related to 9/11 and were all forecast well <em>before the event</em> by the equally fascist members of PNAC who wrote those policies as well as about them and needing a &quot;New Pearl Harbour&quot; type incident to overcome the kind of Constitutional barriers and public resistance that nothing short of such a dramatic and traumatic event would allow them to put those plans permanently into place. </p>

<p>Mussolini wasn&#39;t wrong when he said that people shouldn&#39;t think of what the Axis powers were trying to achieve as &quot;fascism&quot; but rather &quot;corporatism&quot;  and a corporate dictatorship that goes beyond any national boundaries and which is precisely what the US has become and is trying to promote.</p>

<p>It&#39;s resulted in the imposition of a &quot;Big Brother&quot; government that could have served as an even more ideal model for totalitarian control than the one Orwell tried to warn everyone about.</p>

<p>This was all perpetrated by the same kind of people and even some of the same ones that were responsible for assassinating JFK in order to create the Cold war and arms race against the Soviets and Chinese and why they are still hammering away at that same propagandistic line despite the passage of time and all that has occurred that has made them far less adversarial than they ever were. What is dubbed as being &quot;adversarial&quot; is no more than the defence of their own nation states against the global ambitions of the US to subjugate and exploit their economies.</p>

<p>Obama couldn’t have changed policies much even if he tried.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was so bummed when I realized that, but I&#39;m glad I did sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>My very first election as an adult was GW vs Kerry. I voted Kerry and moved on with my life as normal when he lost, since I was already &quot;used&quot; to Bush.</p>

<p>Then Obama popped up, and he seemed at the time like a godsend to me and all my hipster-y liberal friends, who were at that point really fucking tired of Bush and being at war for the majority of our early 20s. He won, we couldn&#39;t have been happier, and I&#39;m now embarrassed to say we actually hung an American flag on our porch..but we lived in a big liberal city at the time so everyone else did as well, probably for the first time since 9/11 when basically <em>everyone</em> had an American flag hanging somewhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty conspiracy-minded by nature and most of my family are the type who believe in UFOs, Bermuda Triangle, Bigfoot, ghosts, etc (and I&#39;m really glad I grew up with a family like that), so it didn&#39;t take me too long to figure out how much of a scam our elections are and that it doesn&#39;t actually matter <em>who</em> is in office.</p>

<p>It was a disappointing and painful lesson, and still is really, but I&#39;m eternally grateful that places like this subreddit exist and that more and more people are realizing what&#39;s actually going on in our government. I very much hope i live to see the day when enough people know and care enough to <em>do</em> something about it together.</p>

Will Smith can&#39;t even make a movie that makes money anymore, and the pictures and video of him abusing his son immediately disqualifies him. Kanye West and Katy Perry are jokes and wouldn&#39;t garner 1% of the vote.</p>

<p>Oprah, however....she might do well. But she&#39;d have to run as a Democrat and I think Tulsi Gabbard would kick her ass.</p>

<p>Winfrey will be starring in an adaptation of &quot;&#39;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,&quot; so that could possibly propel her back into the limelight. But seems like almost every movie is a crapshoot nowadays, so it&#39;s unlikely it will propel her back into A-list territory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;ll tell you: I met Will Smith and spent time with him once in the late 90s and he was incredibly friendly, gracious, funny and cool. I&#39;ve met many Hollywood types and he was one of the best and most down to earth. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s happened to him in the past decade or so, but he&#39;s really fucked up his kids, IMHO, and when I see things like that, it just weirds me out to no end. </p>

They will preach their ideas like &quot;universal income&quot; the Same way zukerberg did and will try to get the masses approval.

<p>Trump was able to relate to the common worker and some of the youths vote. But for others, how will they relate when they are constantly out of touch.</p>

Oprah is yhe closest but i think she likes her cush life.  She doesnt want to decide who to drone &amp; who not to drone.  Being president is stressful &amp; probably sucks most of the time.
