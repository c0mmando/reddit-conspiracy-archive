        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe a focused effort is being put forth to control the online narrative refer to my post history where I considered the possibility of entire posts populated with shills to create fake consesus. </p>

<p>Is it possible posts could be completely sh11ed?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6duuvx/is_it_possible_posts_could_be_completely_shilled/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6duuvx/is_it_possible_posts_could_be_completely_shilled/</a></p>

<p>This undermines the credibility of Reddit as a whole. The point of this online community is to foster discussion and ideas where value and reach is determined by upvotes AKA public opinion. </p>

<p>My evidence of this claim
This great analysis by <a href="/u/52NUKE">/u/52NUKE</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6dw12j/do_you_know_what_happened_when_you_mention_the/">https://pay.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6dw12j/do_you_know_what_happened_when_you_mention_the/</a></p>

<p>The List of Shi1l Bot Downvoters <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8sOoS">https://imgur.com/a/8sOoS</a></p>

<p>A post doesnt generate that many comments and get downvoted in the way shown in those charts.</p>

<p>My post was a short and simple theory posts were being artificially upvoted and filled with shi1ls so that lurkers see a fake consensus among supposed peers.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)</a></p>

<p>These shi1led posts are influencing a much much larger amount of people than just the commenters and whoevers controlling these narratives knows that. Reddit is severely compromised. Am i wrong to think my small post being buried this aggressively is pretty definitive evidence that Reddit as a whole is compromised?</p>

<p>The subscriber count of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> alone is 458,000 and i assume most lurkers wouldnt use accounts so the unique visitor count is much higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason stated for why this topic is being removed is nothing but pure horseshit! &quot;The site might possibly dox someone, and it might possibly make us dox by affiliation.&quot; That&#39;s not how it works. You cannot control what other people put on their sites. If they link it as a resource it is outside of reddit TOS and should bear nothing on the site rules. It is a cop out to pedophile admin pressure.</p>

<p>The admins have shadow deleted posts of mine before on 9/11. They love to be sneaky little weebs and think they are clever. A spez model of business where whoever can bend over and let the most be shoved up their anal cavity is rewarded the most. Hate the word, but literal definition of a cuck.

<p>Police seized a folding knife and three guns from the scene, including a Colt .38 handgun, a Colt AR-15 rifle, and a shotgun.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, yes, certain elements of this story don&#39;t add up, particularly the &quot;one bullet to the floor&quot; causing &quot;$1000 worth of damage&quot;. It&#39;s also weird that this Alefantis, college dropout, restaurant owner has been invited to the Whitehouse. </p>

<p>With the damage, I think that it&#39;s way more likely that they are trying to commit insurance fraud and get a new door, computer, etc, than them having a pedophilia ring. </p>

<p>For the Whitehouse invite, I suppose that if Alefantis has donated tons of cash that would make sense, although it&#39;s kind of unethical. </p>

<p>If this was a cover-up of pedophilia, then you&#39;d have to assume Obama, the DC police, Podesta, Clinton, the traffickers, the abusers, everybody would have to be in on it and sworn to secrecy. We&#39;re talking about dozens of people, they would all have to be extremely loyal, secretive, competent. No leakers could be allowed, no evidence of child abuse could be shared, etc. It seems like this very large organization would require an extraordinary amount of professionalism to avoid FBI detection, and that makes it extremely unlikely. Unless you think the FBI is also full of pedophiles, but at that point if you believe that what is there left to believe in? </p>

If you want to read about a way that this all fits together in a real life scenario, read the banned for no reason topic and discovery of the Art for embassies program. Which just so happens to be able to bypass all customs and formal cargo investigating through transportation. Also along with the fact that art is known to be infiltrated by the CIA and a great way to launder money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re seeing with reddit insight is vote fuzzing. It&#39;s part of reddit&#39;s backend. Essentially, rather than report the actual number of votes a post has received, it returns the actual vote count plus or minus a small randomized number, roughly proportional to the total votes. So if a post has about 10 points, if you keep refreshing the page, it will display between 8 and 1. If it has about 1000 points, it might show between 900 and 1100. </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s ostensible reason for this is to prevent shadowbanned vote bots from knowing they&#39;re shadowbanned. I don&#39;t really buy that, but that&#39;s their reasoning. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t vote bots operating on this sub, but your screenshots aren&#39;t proving that. </p>

<p>If you want to demonstrate this to yourself, go find a submission from a couple months ago, one that has a percent-upvoted between say 55-95% and run reddit insight on it. Pick a relatively benign and low-traffic sub that you would expect vote manipulation. You&#39;ll notice the same pattern, where the votes seem to fluctuate around a given point. </p>

<p>At that point, you have to consider two options: there are voting bots voting on months-old posts in low-traffic subs, on issues that no one cares about; or what you&#39;re seeing is just vote fuzzing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s two issues I have with reddit insight for doing what you want it to do: the labels on the x-axis are ill-defined, and it doesn&#39;t show how long it&#39;s been between when the post was made, and when it started collecting data. </p>

<p>Reddit vote fuzzing is somewhat ill-defined itself. Reddit&#39;s own FAQ says it&#39;s not happening how I described, but a simple perusal of months-old posts seem to confirm that it is. Being ill-defined, there are a few issues with bringing in no-context insight graphs. Apparently, vote fuzzing only begins a certain amount of time after a post is created, and after a certain numbers of upvotes. </p>

<p>You say there&#39;s immediate fuzzing on the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> post, but because reddit insight doesn&#39;t show when it started tracking, your screenshot doesn&#39;t actually show that. On the <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> post, it does look like there is fuzzing on the right-hand side of the graph, and the time scale you sampled is also much smaller. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was asking if merely bringing up the topic of shilling will get you banned, and if so, why have they not included that in their list of rules. I understand that certain groups may have forced the rule to not personally call out shills, so that the shill organization can better operate stealthily, but I was asking if saying the word &quot;shill&quot; itself is forbidden, because it appears that the OP was afraid to do so. </p>

One of top comments on a higher up post in this sub is from a 9 day old account whose activity is in <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. If that isn&#39;t a blatant attempt to discredit us by association then I don&#39;t know what is. Mods should delete and ban accounts that are so blatantly shills or bots. It&#39;s really not that hard to notice the characteristics either.</p>

That day, I also learned that a couple of the mods are actually good guys which gave me a little bit of hope. I also now have renewed determination.   </p>

Why is there such a discrepancy between the two post, both were in rising and around the same stats yet the votes are dramatically different. I feel like it&#39;s an attack on the sub as a whole. If the whole sub is being systematically downvoted can you guys &quot;disable&quot; downvotes or can bot go around that too?</p>
