<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6acvqy/the_catholic_vatican_hoards_the_worlds_gold_for/?st=j33v8r8b&amp;sh=0e1c5a34">Original post</a> by <a href="/u/Dogetor_Doge">/u/Dogetor_Doge</a></p>

<p>What we know from the OP post.</p>

<p>1: It is a deposit Receipt from the Vatican&#39;s Institute for Works of Religion. Made on March 10, 1954.</p>

<p>2: The deposit was of gold bars. With a quantity of 14,000 metric tons. At a Cash value of 15.064.840.000 million (15 quadrillion) US Dollars.</p>

<p>3: The owner of this deposit is a (His Majesty) Muhammad Esmail E. Kiram</p>

<p>4: It has a due date of 20 years. Or March 10th, 1974.</p>

<p>5: According to OP, the Sultan made enormous profits on this.</p>

<p>Now, this is all very fascinating, but it leaves some unanswered questions I can&#39;t shake, so I decided to do some more research.</p>

<p>Firstly, this claims that the Sultan deposited 14,000 metric tons of gold! Let me say that 1 more time. 14,000 metric tons of gold. According to <a href="http://www.usfunds.com/investor-library/frank-talk/top-10-countries-with-largest-gold-reserves/#.WSZVOdy1u70">USfunds.com</a> The USA currently sits atop the world in Gold reserves. Holding only a mere 8,133.5 tonnes (not tons) or 74.9 % of the (supposed) worlds gold reserves.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>OK, so this guy was a Sultan right? Sultan of where?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.royalhouseofsulu.org/history-of-the-sultanate.html">Sultan</a> of <a href="http://imgur.com/a/IDknv">Sulu</a>, and Sabah as well, after his family aided Sabah from a revolutionary army invasion.</p>

<p>So they owned the northern tip of Malaysia, and the southern part of the Philippines. (Noting that this is the area that just declared Martial Law.)</p>

<p>So this was literally the door between Catholic Philippines, and Islamic Asia.</p>

<p>Even more interestingly, the date of this transaction, He would have been between 4-10 years old. So where would the young Sultan get that much gold?</p>

<p>Well after WW2, there was a Pro-Japan group trying to claim Sulu, and the young Sultan was with the royal family of Sulu, who were anti-Japan. I am thinking that there may be some sort of connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamashita%27s_gold">Yamashita&#39;s Gold</a> although that is mere speculation.</p>

<p>Lastly, do you remember the date that the re-payment, plus interest was due? March 10th, 1974. Seems odd that it is the same year the young sultan died! So did the Vatican play a long con? Did his family ever get the initial 15,064,840,000 million (15 quadrillion) US Dollars, plus interest back?</p>

<p>Judging by how the Royal Sulu family are merely Philippines politicians, and leasing their land to the Philippines, and Malaysia. I would say not.</p>

<p><strong>In summary</strong> (<strong>TL;DR</strong>), the Vatican took a deposit of 14,000 metric tons of gold, at a value of 15 quadrillion US dollars. They agreed to pay it back plus interest, which would have amounted to somewhere like (according to OPs math) $12,975,000,000,000,000,000. When it time to claim the payment, the holder of the receipt died.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Any other questions you can think of, for me to look deeper into. It is somewhat hard finding all the details. I am guessing there are more in Tagalog, Spanish, Malaysian, ect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? Just look into ancient civilizations (Graham Hancock and the like). Then look into Thoth, Hermes Trismegistus, and the occult along with alchemy. Things will start to come into focus. I promise you, I will make a post fully detailing what I&#39;m saying (in due time), I have some posts coming after the fall of Egypt-&gt; Cleopatra -&gt; Jesus, the Tri-Sovereign states and the creation of Abrahamic religions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is no one entity, it&#39;s all energy. They reign, because we have been blinded (third eye).. They are sons of the Serpent (and no I&#39;m not getting religious). These fuckers&#39;, imo, create the Great deluge, because of their arrogance/inferiority. </p>

<p>I need to circle back to things like the ancients. I got really into the new age energy chakra stuff, then the current geopolitical conspiracies, then post-1900 conspiracies, then the nature of reality conspiracies, and now ETs/babylonian stuff... and now it all seems to be coming together into one giant conspiracy. Everything is linked together, all of it.</p>

To quote the great Tankian &quot;the future will view ALL history as a crime.&quot; But please be wary, the parasitic mind has perceived the awakening of humanity and planned accordingly. &quot;New age&quot; is collectively just another attempt to appropriate the narrative and take control of humans and their power.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! I&#39;m reading the Rig Vedas at the moment. I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Hinduism--so much so that I recite the Gayatri mantra on a weekly basis (in Sanskrit, of course). </p>

<p>You are familiar with the Devas and Asuras? In Greece you can see them as the Olympians and the Titans. </p>

<p>My theory is that the last Golden Age/Kalpa ended after a great war between these two factions of demi-Gods. In both cases, Soma and ambrosia was what turned the tide--making Indra/Zeus so powerful that he was able to smite the Serpent. I think this Serpent is a relic of the Titans/Devas--a symbol of the Antediluvian civilization that we&#39;ve called Atlantis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, I used to find them incredibly detailed and full of vivid imagery. Your comparison with Greek mythology is very interesting comparing the devas and asuras. Also interesting is that both sides in both mythologies were grey rather than the cut- and-dry black and white of the abrahamic religions. Unfortunately I am not as knowledgable as you with the 4 vedas, however the parallels you have drawn not have me thinking 🤔 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think, considering that it is written in Italian using American money and the listed value is 1,000,000 times higher than it should be, that it is far more likely that the actual intended value of the deposit is 15 billion USD rather than 15 quadrillion.  Considering the entire global economy today is still an order of magnitude below that figure and this was 60+ years ago, 15 billion makes more sense and was still a staggering figure for the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree that it&#39;s weird and it is what it says on the receipt, I just think the 15Q number leads to far more questions that don&#39;t make sense (not that the answers wouldn&#39;t make sense, that&#39;s different).</p>

<p>A 5 year old has no real concept of numbers that large. I have 3 kids and they are very smart.  At 5 none of them had a concept of anything more than 100.  They literally use million and billion and gazillion interchangably.  They don&#39;t know what they mean, they just know it means &quot;a lot&quot;.  Why put that number there for a child?</p>

<p>That leads you to believe one of three things:  Either it&#39;s fake (which is not the point of this sub so we throw it out), it&#39;s not actually for him (it&#39;s for his parents/guardians/handlers), or it&#39;s a typo/misunderstanding/mistranslation.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s intentional you head down a <em>gigantic</em> rabbit hole because that number is literally nonsense.  There isn&#39;t that much wealth in the world, there never has been.  Even that much gold is damn near worthless because it can&#39;t be transacted, only held, which is a very fun avenue to explore because it leads directly to assassination, but again it&#39;s a big stretch.</p>

<p>The other possibility of it being a &quot;typo&quot; returns the quantity to the realm of reality.  Now this is something that could actually be a legitimate deposit certificate for realistic amounts (although still huge) and lends more credence to this theory and takes us down another deep hole, but one with more side tunnels.  Those are generally more likely to have some truth to them and don&#39;t require such a huge initial mental acceptance.  That valuation <em>could</em> lead to assassination (I think it does) but it could also lead to simple tragedy or political moves and is easier to swallow.</p>

<p>They are both interesting avenues to explore, I just think the whole theory is more palatable and probably has more leads if you assume it&#39;s 15B and not 15Q.</p>

<p>Again, fun stuff and thanks for doing the research, OP.</p>

<p>Okay, let&#39;s do that for a sec.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s real, but suppose it is.  Maybe it&#39;s not so outrageous.  Maybe it&#39;s just calculated to take hyperinflation into account.</p>

<p>Maybe the Vatican knew that the US dollar wouldn&#39;t last until 1974, and that America would resort to rampant money-printing that would make that number seem reasonable before then.  Maybe they even planned to help the process along.  Maybe their special agent JFK was on the case.  Maybe he planned to return to the silver standard, and to take the money-printing ability away from the Federal Reserve, because he planned to initiate this hyperinflation on behalf of the Vatican.  Maybe assassinating him was not an act of treason after all, but an act of patriotism.  Maybe the CIA even found out about all of this, and did it themselves.</p>

<p>Maybe this is not so unusual.  Maybe the Vatican has done this before.  Maybe they&#39;re doing it now.  Maybe there are other of these types of certificates floating around with similarly outrageous values on them, targeting other countries.  Maybe the &quot;counterfeit&quot; bonds found in Italy several years back are a part of the same type of scheme.</p>

<p>Maybe they just screwed up.  Maybe they vastly underestimated just how prosperous and stable and middle-class America really was in the 50&#39;s.  Maybe they calculated that the US was an extension of the British empire, and therefore the British Pound, and that the US currency would go down along with it, on schedule.</p>

<p>Maybe they even instigated the unrest of the 60&#39;s in order to pave the way for American financial collapse by &#39;74.  And maybe they expected it to result in a complete coup before then.  Maybe the &quot;leftist&quot; &quot;socialist&quot; &quot;Marxist&quot; protesting in the US in the 60&#39;s was in fact none of those, and &quot;Catholic&quot; &quot;aristocratic&quot; &quot;banker&quot; &quot;gold-bug&quot; scheming instead.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s fun to hypothesize.  From where I sit, Catholicism is just a weird form of collectivism.  But a lot of people seem to think they are this vast right-wing conspiracy of bankers and patriarchs, or at least have been in the past.  Maybe there&#39;s a reason for that.</p>

The record price of gold was on September 5, 2011, when it hit the peak of an incredible bubble at $1895 US per ounce.  That means that even in that bubble after many years of inflation, the value of that deposit would be $935,817,097,600 US, which isn&#39;t even a trillion, let alone 15 quadrillion.

<p>If the Vatican wanted 14000 metric tons of gold, they could have just bought it on the open market and saved themselves most of 15 quadrillion dollars, so it has to be a problem in converting those commas over to decimals. </p>

<p>1 metric ton (long ton) = 32,150 troy ounces</p>

<p>14,000 (long tons) = 450,100,000 troy ounces</p>

<p>1 troy ounce of gold = $1257</p>

<p>$1257 x 450,100,000 = $565,775,700,000 or $565.8 billion</p>

<p>Obviously the receipt is bogus and this theory is debunked.</p>

<p>The value in USD on the certificate states quadrillion. Clearly they are using a much different price per ounce than what is being offered today in the &#39;market&#39;. Considering we know the mega banks and therefore central banks are artificially keeping the price of gold down in the futures market, your statements are incorrect.</p>

<p>Imagine the power that you would wield as a church with the ability to overrun the world&#39;s economy ten times over. Countries, kings, everyone would bow down to you just so that way they can still be rich by comparison. How entirely perfect, maintenance free, no forcing people to fuck kids to keep them loyal, just being a few steps above the system itself and therefore immune to anything used within it, because you would encompass it. All they&#39;d have to do is keep it secret who holds which purse strings where, then they&#39;d be immune to assassination or infiltration and even retaliation itself would seem futile. </p>

<p>Man. Shit. We are well and truly fucked as long as we use money as a way to motivate each other reliably. </p>
