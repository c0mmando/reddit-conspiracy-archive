       It's true. The NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act, is a highly treasonous and fully unconstitutional piece of garbage that Barack Obama signed each and every year into law. So when you see General Hayden on tv this Sunday morning saying "no President has ever tried to establish backdoor communications" and you wonder; "then what about JFK or Reagan with the Russians or Obama with Iran?" Well, you're then reminded that Hayden is simply being a complete lying piece of shit and is gaslighting the American people because Barack made it legal for him to do so. Yup, that's right. The former President was such a corrupt fuck that he wanted to make sure he could lie to you with impunity. #HopeAndChangeYouCanBelieveIn

       There have been so many of them today, or not so many people but many accounts; most made to push anti-Macron stuff at the same time. They're not interested in anything more than pushing their message so there's no honest discussion to be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       The republicans never had a problem with that part of the NDAA, nor will Trump. The Smith-Mundt act was pretty pointless as all the stations it covered could still be received by short-wave in the US, and even sillier in the internet age when sites and broadcasts were accessible to all.

       Here's an interesting exercise for you, can you cite me the section of the original Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 that would have prevented these three from lying on public television?
       <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/177574.pdf">
        Here's the full text of the bill to help you out (PDF)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: you can't, because the act only applied to the State Department and Broadcast Board of Governors, and to no other executive department. The 2013 NDAA relaxed some of the restrictions, but the original bill in no way made intelligence officers lying on TV or propagandizing the American public illegal. Or prove me wrong.
