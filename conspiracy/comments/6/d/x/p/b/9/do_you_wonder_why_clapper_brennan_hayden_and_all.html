        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s true. The NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act, is a highly treasonous and fully unconstitutional piece of garbage that Barack Obama signed each and every year into law. So when you see General Hayden on tv this Sunday morning saying &quot;no President has ever tried to establish backdoor communications&quot; and you wonder; &quot;then what about JFK or Reagan with the Russians or Obama with Iran?&quot; Well, you&#39;re then reminded that Hayden is simply being a complete lying piece of shit and is gaslighting the American people because Barack made it legal for him to do so. Yup, that&#39;s right. The former President was such a corrupt fuck that he wanted to make sure he could lie to you with impunity. #HopeAndChangeYouCanBelieveIn</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting exercise for you, can you cite me the section of the original Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 that would have prevented these three from lying on public television? <a href="https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/177574.pdf">Here&#39;s the full text of the bill to help you out (PDF)</a>. </p>

<p>Hint: you can&#39;t, because the act only applied to the State Department and Broadcast Board of Governors, and to no other executive department. The 2013 NDAA relaxed some of the restrictions, but the original bill in no way made intelligence officers lying on TV or propagandizing the American public illegal. Or prove me wrong.</p>
