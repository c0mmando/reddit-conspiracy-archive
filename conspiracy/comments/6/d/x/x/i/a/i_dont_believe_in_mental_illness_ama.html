       I would agree drugs are given to anaesthetise or control symptoms only. Mental illness or brain damage is just that damage or bad wiring, and not something a drug will fix!

       Yes, I was thinking that people express they feel a certain way or have some natural response to an unnatural situation like anxiety in our society, and they become pathologized by professionals who prescribe medications that damage the brain and body, and as a result we label their worsening symptoms as a progressive mental illness like Bipolar Disorder or Schizophrenia. I mean we give Ritalin to kids at a young age for being bored or hyper, and then wonder why we have so many people in society who are addicted to crack or meth.

       Pointing out that your diagnosis of "bad wiring" leads me to believe you're not qualified to make such claims. Working as a security guard at Intel doesn't make you a computer scientist

       I never claimed drugs cure mental illness. OP claims mental illness is fake, and caused by pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, it's well documented that humans have been mentally ill predating man made drugs by hundreds, to thousands of years.

       So, a traumatic upbringing or bad parenting couldn't possibly be the reason for "bad wiring"? It's all big pharmas fault for the Salem witch trials too? Not religious fanatasism? The list can go on and on, I think OPs point is just plain short sighted.

       That's not completely true, as classified drugs like marijuana contain many beneficial properties and healing agents. That's indisputable, but there are others as well, for instance -

       I don't think mental illness as we know it has existed for much longer than the pharmaceutical companies have. Sigmund Freud, the Jew, invented a whole new school of thought that facilitated our modern understanding of mental illness. In my opinion this was a deliberate thing to undermine Western society and culture. Same thing with the Frankfurt school. Same thing with Marxism.

       So, your first instinct when you have power is to abuse it? I think you're proving a point that, you fit into the category of not being able to distinguish the difference between right and wrong, with no trace of empathy or compassion. That would be a sociopath or psychopath.

       "Treating Mental Illnesses6
      </p>
      <p>
       At this time, most mental illnesses cannot be cured, but they can usually be treated effectively to minimize the symptoms and allow the individual to function in work, school, or social environments. To begin treatment, an individual needs to see a qualified mental health professional. The first thing that the doctor or other mental health professional will do is speak with the individual to find out more about his or her symptoms, how long the symptoms have lasted, and how the person's life is being affected. The physician will also do a physical examination to determine whether there are other health problems. For example, some symptoms (such as emotional swings) can be caused by neurological or hormonal problems associated with chronic illnesses such as heart disease, or they can be a side effect of certain medications. After the individual's overall health is evaluated and the condition diagnosed, the doctor will develop a treatment plan. Treatment can involve both medications and psychotherapy, depending on the disease and its severity.

       I appreciate the attempt at reasonable discussion, it's a shame that not everyone is capable of contributing in a positive manner. Personally I think that the problem stems from our medical system as a whole. It seeks to treat rather than cure or prevent. The management of illness and symptoms, doesn't address the root issues causing them, and is more likely to be used for exploitative reasons. Again, I think it mostly is caused by immediate gratification as opposed to commitment and responsibility. When we are in pain, we usually just want a pain killer, we don't want to hear how we shouldn't sit around on the couch for 40 hours a week and waste away while eating potato chips and drinking diet cola. Id even argue though, that if someone wanted to be in the best shape they could be in, they may not always have the ability to achieve it due to external reasons, and this limits them. Maybe, in this example, potato chips and diet cola is all the food they can afford to buy. Maybe they spend their money on their sick mother, who needs a hip replacement. Maybe they work 3 full time jobs, etc.

       I understand exactly where you are coming from and yes lifestyles, upbringing, environment and well living in a world/system that doesnt use and discard people as cattle would do more to help mental health than anything you could find in a hospital. I dunno why people are nit picking at my simple generalisation but i think they might be mentally ill hahaaha

       I think people just want their way of perceiving the world to be the only right way, which Imo is the definition of mental illness (not the DSM). People don't want to change and grow, they just want to be right and comfortable. I definitely think we need to question some of the things we are doing in the world, but everything is changing so fast, it's hard for everyone to keep up, and most people are too busy just trying to make ends meet to petition against international companies like Monsanto modifying their foods.

       Well as someone that's had mental illnesses passed down generation to generation and is also currently dating someone with borderline personality disorder among other things, I believe that people with mental illness have no control over that and that there are chemical imbalances in our brains that cause these illnesses and disorders. I also believe that people that take medications such as Zoloft, Prozac, and countless other medications can be permanently affected by these medications. These medicines try to bridge the gaps in our brains to try to change the imbalances that we face. When taken off of these medicines, however, it can lead to a change for either the better or for the worse. I suffer from acute anxiety and chronic depression and have for years and was only recently prescribed Zoloft back in November following a traumatic event. I ran out of the medication and was unable to get a refill at the time and my friend pointed out to me that there was an obvious difference between how I was on it and off it. I believe that we can sort of become dependent on these medicines and that they change us but I don't believe that they are the sole cause of mental disorders.

       Reminds me of a podcast I listened to about a small village in Belgium where they integrate the mentally ill among the population. They are fostered by the locals and basically they just let them be as they are. They're seen as having different personalities more than as someone with a problem that needs treatment. It was very interesting and I wish more places in the world took this approach.

       I wonder too how common what we consider mental illness today was in the past, like during Jesus' time or the dark ages. I think despite all the hardships people had back then, they would of been much more connected to their communities and spiritually, that they probably didn't experience as many negative states as us. I think the biggest cause other than drugs being prescribed to treat false conditions is that we live in a society in which we are powerless to effect anything and our contributions are becoming far more detached. At least in the past if you fixed someones shoes or chopped wood, you could see the effect that brought to people and the community around you. Today, not so much. If you buy something, it was probably made by 50 other people in 50 different countries.

       I wouldn't forgive them, and I don't think you have to either. But things kill other things all the time in nature, and to expect that humans wouldn't do it either is a bit of a stretch. Doesn't mean that that person was mentally ill, maybe they had a reason to kill.

       I definitely agree "mental illness" has been expanded and applied loosely in many ways in which it shouldnt have.... Obviously there is true mental illness, however i believe medication is rarely the answer. Life changes are needed or you will continually unhappy but medicated to state of functionality.

       I'll bite. I suffer from depression and anxiety/agoraphobia (passed on most likely from my mother and grandmother, I have dug into my family's history and it's there). Around the age of 13 I began taking Zoloft. Around the age of 18 I stopped taking Zoloft because I was done with it. A few months later I became sick as a dog, waking up in cold sweats, terrible brainzaps and the kicker (I developed O.C.D.) I was more or less forced to go back on Zoloft to live my life. I now suffer from all these things but am working on helped ease the symptoms. It's pretty much confirmed that some sort of mental illness was passed on from my mother (bless her heart) and my grandmother on my father's side. Are you saying this is all made up quackery?

       No, not at all, but I wonder how much of it was a response to the drugs you were given. Maybe if you had never started taking drugs in the first place it wouldn't have progressed as far as it did. Who is to say that the depression and anxiety are unnatural responses to our very unnatural society?

       Right, but I think the condition was originally created by pollution or chemicals that we were exposed to that created these symptoms. Maybe too these people function in ways that others don't, but I don't believe the intention was pathological, it's just in our society we expect everyone to conform to a norm, and if the won't or can't then we decide they are sick. Maybe they are just hyper functional or unique, able to see things in ways we can't, able to feels things in ways we won't. idk.

       I agree with what you said but doesn't that contradict your message?   Aren't you admitting they exist your just saying they may be caused by the environment. Cancer is a disease and it too is caused by our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What ever is causing these diseases is another discussion.   We were discussing your lack of belief in them.  Well you now admitted they exist.   So now whats your message?   Define pathological because that may be your hang up.

       I mean we consider people who can function in ways that we can't or won't, as pathological, when in fact it isn't. It's like homeless people, some will regard them as lazy or stupid, or drug addicts, unable to accomplish anything because of some defect. Yet we live in a society that profits from imprisoning people, exploiting others, creating fear, and poisoning our Earth. Maybe we, the functional people, are the sick ones for doing this. How can we not be outraged, flipping our shit, and climbing the walls, when we know what is happening all around us, and yet we just blindly accept it and pretend like everything is alright? I look outside my window and see people who have been completely marginalized by society, who's lives have been nothing but tragedies, and yet there are brand new skyscrapers being built and people driving corvettes or other sports cars. It's just unnatural.

       People are just going to believe what they want to anyways, it doesn't matter what I say. If you want to believe in mental illness, I'm not going to stop you or make you change your mind. I just think if everyone in society thought the exact same thing, it wouldn't be such a great thing.

       Sure, some psychological "disorders" are merely symptoms of a different problem. Some conditions classified as a disorder I believe are simply a neural network that has taken a different direction of evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there are definitely real psychological disorders. Anyone who has been close to family or friends with manic disorder (bi-polar) or schizophrenia can tell you mental illness is a real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why wouldn't it be? You can be born with any number of different defects and disorders to various organs, the brain is not excluded.

       I can get on board with your line of reasoning... natural selection is a weird thing... evolution will never stop... and as a result people are gonna be born with very unique mental states... probably not very well suited for today's world, but they could have been potentially useful in a certain time and place.

       Well it's all about variety, if nature created everyone the same, then when a pathogen attacked us we would all die. We need variety so that we can, or at least some of us, can survive or flourish in certain extreme conditions. Not all people have the same skin colour, but not all environments are the same, I sure can't survive long in Africa, but in Europe I might be fine.

       I definitely think thats how modern people justify or explain biblical events in the past. However I would argue that our understanding is flawed, and was the deliberate result of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. He took what wasn't suitable for society, pathologized it, and then abstracted it in a way that was convenient to him and the Zionist agenda.

       Yeah, for sure. I mean he practically converted all of our understanding into some pseudo-religion for the 20th century. The problem with that is, you now have a bunch of people who were taught that is the truth because Sigmund says so, and bam! we have a collective delusion. I think the reason why so many people, especially in the West, refuse to accept Christianity, is because they are afraid to look within themselves and accept that they may have to make a change because their thinking is flawed. It's so much easier to blame others, and project our failures onto others. It's also a whole lot more convenient for people to have instant gratification with things like abortions, than it is to deal with the commitment and responsibility of raising a child for example. How is abortion any different than murder? Yet some people believe they should be able to do it no matter what, whenever they want, for whatever reasons and at any time. I guess we've just redefined and normalized child sacrifice into something that socially acceptable.

       Sure, I see what you're getting at, but I would argue that if we got the proper amount of nutrition from real foods, and not foods that contain chemicals that alter our bodies chemistries and endocrines, we might be a whole lot healthier. I think a large component of what makes people ill today, is that they are way too stressed, and bombarded by stupid things like advertisements, political agendas, and just how we compartmentalize everything. Im sure you could say anyone who doesn't support your political ideas, or religious ideas is a schizophrenic. Most illnesses have a blood test or some physical evidence that there is a disruption in the bodies functioning, like the heart stops, but what does schizophrenia or other mental illnesses have? Nothing, its a subjective interpretation done by a psychiatrist who is educated by the same system that profits from the dependency of individuals on chemical drugs.

       Here's what I learned...there are those who have true chemical imbalances. You can see an absolute marked change in their behavior and actions. The

       medicine for the
       <em>
        right

       affliction. That's the catch. Sadly, because of how difficult it is to diagnose someone due to the intricacies of emotions, the capability to lie or exaggerate symptoms, etc..the wrong meds can be given, and the person believes they have the wrong diagnosis.

       I'm glad you think a god of any type can be perfect and create unflawed human beings, good for you. Science had proven DNA to be tricky and not so perfect, unfortunately. Be it environmental or physical, many defects can happen while the fetus is created.

       I hope you don't believe that those with depression, suicidal thoughts, violent tendencies and other afflictions are "perfect" the way they are. How many news stories about vets with PTSD do we need to read? Of someone who "snaps"? Would you be forgiving of such a person if they take away someone you love? Because they are "perfect" the way they are? Do you believe in therapy without the use of drugs?

       I think OP has some points worth discussing, depression is a good example, in that the causes could be a myriad of things from social standing, health, wealth, memory, aspirations, the cause could itself just be the life you are living or a delusion of self even.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point being to medicate a person to alleviate symptoms that arise purely from modern life is extremely dangerous and a precedent i think many people can see as almost a plan to keep the slave slaving.

       I don't think mental illness as we know it has existed for much longer than the pharmaceutical companies have. Sigmund Freud, the Jew, invented a whole new school of thought that facilitated our modern understanding of mental illness. In my opinion this was a deliberate thing to undermine Western society and culture. Same thing with the Frankfurt school. Same thing with Marxism.

       Yeah, for sure. I mean he practically converted all of our understanding into some pseudo-religion for the 20th century. The problem with that is, you now have a bunch of people who were taught that is the truth because Sigmund says so, and bam! we have a collective delusion. I think the reason why so many people, especially in the West, refuse to accept Christianity, is because they are afraid to look within themselves and accept that they may have to make a change because their thinking is flawed. It's so much easier to blame others, and project our failures onto others. It's also a whole lot more convenient for people to have instant gratification with things like abortions, than it is to deal with the commitment and responsibility of raising a child for example. How is abortion any different than murder? Yet some people believe they should be able to do it no matter what, whenever they want, for whatever reasons and at any time. I guess we've just redefined and normalized child sacrifice into something that socially acceptable.
