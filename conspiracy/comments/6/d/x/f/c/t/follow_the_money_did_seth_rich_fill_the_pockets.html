       George Webb released 3 videos today stating Seth Rich was brain damage at the time of death and possibly donated his organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/uPXuSjelhKQ">
        Video 1

        Video 3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we think Seth Rich is the DNC leaker, there's a high possibility theres more scandalous acts to the story then just being a leaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Let's FOLLOW THE MONEY...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028994_organ_transplants_black_market.html">
        Organ Harvesting is BIG business
       </a>
       ,a multi billion dollar industry and  US plays a big part in it. One persons organs can be worth up to $500k on the
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7i0Lv58.jpg">
        black market
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this
       <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/041152_transplant_patients_organ_harvesting_presumed_consent.html#">
        article
       </a>
       a lady claims she woke up on the operating bed in the middle of doctors harvesting her organs. Doctors falsely pronounced her dead by fraudulently claiming she had suffered "cardiopulmonary arrest" and "irreversible brain damage." This gave them the medical justification to start slicing away even while the woman's heart was still beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how the doctors stated she suffered from "BRAIN DAMAGE" just like Seth Rich. 
Also, the doctor pronounced her dead way before her heart stopped beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich has two conflicting time of deaths:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The official story was Seth was pronounced dead at 5:57am, 1 hour and half after arrival. 
(I think this is when the doctors pronounced Seth dead from BRAIN DAMAGE, but the heart continued to beat bc...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anon Doc stated he was pronounced dead 8 hours after arrival.
         <a href="http://archive.is/DLHkH">
          See Anon Doc Statement here
         </a>
         Make sure you read the comments as well bc Doc Anon follows up with more comments further down the thread.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Now, my question is... HOW THE FK did Seth go from TALKATIVE to BRAIN DEAD? Makes no fkin sense!
       <a href="https://youtu.be/LOn09bhDXMo">
        Fast forward to 25 seconds
       </a>
       the parents told ABC news he was talkative in the ambulance. 
In the comment section of one of George Webb's videos, a
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QixgrhX.jpg">
        surgeon
       </a>
       found it strange Seth had brain damage with no head injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this will piece things together...
      </p>
      <p>
       On this
       <a href="https://youtu.be/VOjiYudTKu0">
        podcast
       </a>
       a lady is interviewed about the death of her son, which has striking similarities to Seth Richs death. 
* Both talkative and conscious on the ambulance ride. Did the EMT give Seth the paralyzing drug too?
* Both were pronounced with brain damage 
* Both Doctors lied about time of death 
* Only difference is, Seths parents weren't there to sign the donor card, they were out of town at the time of his death. Who signed off on the organ donor? 
* Did the surgeons live dissect Seth Rich in order to profit $500k like they did this ladies son?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Seth Rich is the DNC Leaker, the Clinton's would want him dead, and everyone knows the Clinton's LOVE money. Seth didn't die from the gun wounds, so did they take advantage of the opportunity and profit off of his organs? They sure didn't mind using his murder the next day

Clinton's $500k Richer
      </p>
      <p>
       UPADATED: HOLY FKIN SHITTT 
it just dawned on me an anon on 4chan gave an IP address of a abandoned Hospital 10 mins away from where Seth was shot. The anon said he hacked seths sykpe and his Skype last login was at this
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8rPjnK4.png">
        abandon hospital
       </a>
       which is in the ghetto With tons of homeless people outside. 
On YouTube there's a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/8_J2bAMjsrc">
        video tour
       </a>
       of the hospital and the power is still on which is so odd. What is fkin even crazier is they ran into a bunch of nurses and doctors when they went up the elevator!!! Is this a organ harvesting location and is this where Seth Rich ended up at to be dissected????

       Damn.. The thought of that seems even worse than just outright murderering him. If this is what happened then it's more likely they've left a paper trail behind for others to find.

       The freak out is real: His social media scrubbed and deleted; the cease and desist letters/threats of lawsuits; media matters brigade to get Hannity fired for covering the murder; several 'debunked', 'right wing conspiracy' articles; the shills and bots here..

       That's some what I've noticed and it screams of shut up and cover up to me.

       There's been stories of organ harvesting and the Clintons for a long time, especially in Haiti. Webb has covered it before.

       I doubt the Clinton mob care about 500k.  It's probably more about "making an example".  If you mess with them they don't just kill you, they go medieval on your ass.  The Rich family are probably hostages at this point.
