       Being that the DNC IT dude was asking reddit on how to wipe a server, that eliminates him from being able to find a leaker. The only other people who would be able to is the FBi or the Awan brothers. Its unlikely that those brothers would ever help Debbie.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the fbi unmasked seth. Told Hillary, then had him killed to cover it up.

       Thats already a major concern that leakers worry about when utilizing wikileaks as a publisher - thats why there are constantly threads and big conversations regarding whether or not wikileaks is compromised - especially around October, was the major influx - but I believe they have always been an asset

       FBI would more likely be monitoring Wikileaks and the people surrounding them and SR could've been picked up in the communications - then unmasked.

       We know the IC has been engaging in such practices and investigating people around the actual target.

       I think it's entirely possible that he was caught as a Wikileaks source through surveillance and that is what led to him being assassinated too. Don't mind that other person focusing hard on scrutinizing irrelevant details while ignoring the actual idea you were laying down.

       I think Seth also leaked info about the HFA/DNC website sending potential Bernie voters to incorrect polling locations during the primary. That was his area. I have a feeling that was part of the October surprise. IIRC, Bernie users who were logged into their gmail accounts were given errant information. (HFA/DNC shouldn't have been working together at that point anyway.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it was 'just' the emails, it's too bad Assange saved the best for last. Now we may never know the magnitude of why Seth had to die. Unless... kimdotcom... greenwald... somebody else has a copy.

       Speculation is not making shit up. You shouldn't try to silence discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, given the fact that Trump has been alleged to have raped a 13 year old girl, and has also publicly shown an inappropriate interest in his daughter, I wouldn't be too surprised if Trump your "made up shit" wasn't entirely wrong. I haven't heard anything that might suggest Trump helped Epstein get kids though, any reason you would say that?
