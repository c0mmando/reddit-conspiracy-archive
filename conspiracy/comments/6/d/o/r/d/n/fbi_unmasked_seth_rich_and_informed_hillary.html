The only other people who would be able to is the FBi or the Awan brothers. Its unlikely that those brothers would ever help Debbie. </p>

<p>So, the fbi unmasked seth. Told Hillary, then had him killed to cover it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Im not suggesting that he used any particular email. Im suggesting that the fbi was monitoring Seth, and discovered he was leaking info to wikileaks. Fbi informed Hillary, then Seth was killed. How else could Hillary havee found out it was Seth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK I&#39;ll play along.</p>

<p>FBI would more likely be monitoring Wikileaks and the people surrounding them and SR could&#39;ve been picked up in the communications - then unmasked.</p>

<p>We know the IC has been engaging in such practices and investigating people around the actual target.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s entirely possible that he was caught as a Wikileaks source through surveillance and that is what led to him being assassinated too.

    <div class="md"><p>I think Seth also leaked info about the HFA/DNC website sending potential Bernie voters to incorrect polling locations during the primary. That was his area. I have a feeling that was part of the October surprise. IIRC, Bernie users who were logged into their gmail accounts were given errant information. (HFA/DNC shouldn&#39;t have been working together at that point anyway.) </p>

<p>Even if it was &#39;just&#39; the emails, it&#39;s too bad Assange saved the best for last. Now we may never know the magnitude of why Seth had to die. Unless... kimdotcom... greenwald... somebody else has a copy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speculation is not making shit up. You shouldn&#39;t try to silence discussion. </p>

<p>Also, given the fact that Trump has been alleged to have raped a 13 year old girl, and has also publicly shown an inappropriate interest in his daughter, I wouldn&#39;t be too surprised if Trump your &quot;made up shit&quot; wasn&#39;t entirely wrong. I haven&#39;t heard anything that might suggest Trump helped Epstein get kids though, any reason you would say that? </p>
