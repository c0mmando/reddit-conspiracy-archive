<p>You&#39;re getting into the key there.. I&#39;ve heard of some of this in recent years. The service to self compared to service to others. This dimension stuff though is a little harder to grasp. It sounds like to be able to access these higher realms you can only get there if you&#39;re positive. </p>

<p>Scrolling down.. noticed Robert Stanley. I just happened to mention him earlier today and what he was saying about the Archon. Whatever he&#39;s getting into researching how some are trying to take pics of these entities.. that would need a billionaire&#39;s scientific research to get to the bottom of it. When you look at the few pics, you go.. ok where&#39;s the VIDEO of this stuff. Always never good enough evidence of things. But, it&#39;s a &quot;start&quot;, but who knows if what they&#39;re getting into are these Archon entities who control the Illuminati. </p>

<p>At the bottom, all kinds of links. Can&#39;t get side-tracked though, trying to get thru these thread comments. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re figuring it out a bit of what&#39;s going on out there? lol</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really do Bible quotes. Explained my reasoning about that earlier today. You don&#39;t know who wrote this stuff. Could all be &quot;science fiction&quot;. How are you absolutely certain it&#39;s not &quot;bullshit&quot;?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also like when I tried to read Shakespeare in high school. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re trying to mean with their complicated words.</p>

<p>So, can&#39;t do it, buddy. lol. Could be a buncha hogwash, plus, can&#39;t picture what they&#39;re trying to say. lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps there is quite a bit that is resting on five senses and a flawed memory bank and it&#39;s hard to be 100% certain of just about anything, but how about we weigh evidence together?</p>

<p>If you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist who is aware of stuff like Freemasonry and Bilderberg Group and Bohemian Club and Skull and Bones and the Thule Society, do you think they are completely secular organizations who have no dark agenda associated with the devil? Are you a completely secular thinking atheist or agnostic and if so, do you have any theories concerned with a modern alien or UFO phenomenon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also from a Biblical perspective, it says:</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 13New International Version (NIV)</p>

<p>13 If I speak in the tongues[a] of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. 2 <strong>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing</strong>. 3 If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,[b] but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>

<p>4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 <strong>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing what authority tells you without question is out if integrity. You and I DO NOT KNOW that the Bible contains the words of God. Our faith is useful for manipulation. Modern religions can spring up and exploit out of integrity ways of forming belief. Look at scientology and Mormons. You can see they are incorrect, but they can&#39;t. Now look at yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Imagine this is the Holodeck and we can&#39;t really hurt each other. Or we&#39;re all standing, Archons included, in a pitch dark room and you can only hear voices. How would you bend the room to your will? You could only influence the other voices with your own. You can tell jokes and make the room laugh. You can tell a story that affirms life and joy. Or, the Archons on the other hand, would scream and try to scare everyone. Or fuck loudly. Or bring the room down with complaining or crying or fighting. It&#39;s up to each voice in the room to recognize the Archon behavior would lead to more overall suffering in the room should everyone engage in it and avoid it out of self-preservation.</p>

<p>This is where it gets so difficult. The Archons are solely trying to turn us into them. They work with our humanity and spirituality and attempt to understand them only so they can manipulate us. What kind of ideal future Utopia is populated by pansexual freaks all obsessed with their various anxiety issues, fucking habits and carrying around Comfort Animals? That&#39;s a psychic slave race if I ever heard of one. Sickly, depressed and doing nothing about either. &quot;Owning&quot; your dysfunction rather than overcoming it. Katy Perry. Weak, constantly vulnerable, immature, hateful. Weak minds like that are easily lead like the voices in the room I mentioned. The trick is to influence those minds in such a way that they gain the confidence and self-worth to shake off the need for Archon control in the first place. So every Katy Perry fan turns to her and says &quot;fuck you, you pansexual, future-hologram freak. Life is about more than fucking and navel gazing.&quot; Good luck with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Part 2 of 2]</p>

<p>But yeah.. this God thing eh. When I was analyzing it, was like, hmm.. sure sounds like it&#39;s not a &quot;good guy&quot;. I&#39;m there.. what if you could destroy God. It&#39;s been proven it&#39;s not a &quot;good guy&quot; but it&#39;s our puppet master. This is how much I don&#39;t settle for the deal. I&#39;ve got a low tolerance for inadequacies and when you analyze God&#39;s actions and inactions.. it&#39;s like, hold on here.. this guy should be fired. </p>

<p>Well this was the idea.. fire God. You&#39;re fired! hahaha. How ya gonna do that.. well you blow their operation up. </p>

<p>Listen to the psychics.. they say, when you die, you go into the light to this heaven place. That sounds like a wormhole from a sci-fi movie to me. Maybe you could make a gizmo that could see this white light wormhole, like how the clairvoyants see dead people. Maybe it&#39;s just not in our visible light range. ok if you could see the wormhole right in front of you, how&#39;s about you put that gizmo on a telescope and point it out there. Might see the other side where that wormhole goes to. Might be able to spot this &quot;heaven&quot; place somewhere in space. We wouldn&#39;t be able to see it though because it&#39;s not in our visible wavelength. But with the gizmo, you could see it. Got to that location in space and that&#39;s the actual &quot;heaven&quot; base camp where they&#39;re operating. </p>

<p>If you could see the white light wormhole, maybe you could make a new kind of nuke, that works in that dimension, that you could &quot;fire down the hole&quot; hahahaha. Whoops elevator door opens, ding-ding.. ka-fucking boom.  hahahaha. </p>

<p>Or, if you see where the wormhole opens up on the other end. Go to that location in space. Maybe if you&#39;d fire off a normal nuke that works in our realm, it would ring a fuck of a bell in that dimension even. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised about that because normal nukes, rock, a lot. It might do something in that other dimension. Who knows.. maybe you could fuck up this God thing, right up and stop it. This reincarnation is like a bad vicious circle where all you do is suffer. Blow up the whole damn game. Better to not play the game if all you can do is keep losing at it and never win. </p>

<p>What you wanna do though is fix the inadequacies. Before you blow it up, try to figure out exactly how it works. Get the blueprints for this WOPR computer. Build your own. Get the geeks to figure out what makes this God thing tick. Make your own God. Fix how he&#39;s a bastard. Make a new game where you actually fix the rules. It&#39;d be like here where you could change the laws of the land. Cause God&#39;s a bad landlord and he needs to either fix his shit, or be fired. </p>

<p>But before you sack him, you wanna figure out how he made the game. Now you make your own where you fix those problems. It&#39;d be like God version 2.0. hahahaha. The new and improved version, with less &quot;asshole&quot;, running the show. Get a new game going, then you can blow up the WOPR. And then enough with this Devil guy already. </p>

<p>I analyzed him too there. Apparently this Lucifer character used to work for God. He used to be a good angel. But he was like, I don&#39;t like the way the boss runs the show. Well this Lucifer guy was a schmuck, he wanted to be bad, it sounded like. But then, hang on.. I think Angels aren&#39;t like us where we have free will. They have to do what they&#39;re told. Well, how did he turn bad then, if they have no free will. I wonder if it was God&#39;s plan for him to be bad. I don&#39;t know.. but apparently Lucifer used to be a &quot;good guy&quot; but he quit the job, for whatever reasons. Well, if  you blow up God there&#39;s no old ex-boss to be pissed off about. So maybe with no enemy, the devil could &quot;chill out&quot; about being a pissed-off dickhead. </p>

<p>Now the bad guys would have no more leader. How&#39;s that for fixing shit. It&#39;s like what are you doing sucking out, sulking in your corner of the universe in this hell place, like a fucking toddler. </p>

<p>Well, since we&#39;re at it, if that devil guy&#39;s gonna keep being a cunt.. well fuck, since we can blow heaven and God up, might as well fuck that devil guy up too. Blow fucking hell right up too. No more bad guys who these other guys view as their boss. Whoops, got no more leader. But before I&#39;d blow hell up, I&#39;d wanna give this God character a chance to &quot;tweak&quot; his shit first. Analyze his shit and go, ok before we turns your ass, you got a chance here to fix your shit that&#39;s bad. If ya don&#39;t you&#39;re out. </p>

<p>This is the devil&#39;s beef here.. is the God guy. So if you can fix God&#39;s bad shit, the devil might not be pissed off anymore. So ya don&#39;t wanna destroy the devil and hell first. See, when you&#39;re a &quot;good guy&quot; you don&#39;t even kill the devil. That&#39;s how I roll, man. You gotta go, ok what&#39;s his beef here.. fix that shit, then go back to him and say, ok you still gonna be a fucking twat here. And if he doesn&#39;t wanna quick being a dick, you go, ok you&#39;re next. Cleaning up the inadequacies in the game here. So ya give that bad guy a chance first. But the huge villain, is this God character. He&#39;s like the mofo wizard of oz behind the curtain who doesn&#39;t fix all the shit. He&#39;s like a slum-lord, landlord. ok so i&#39;m goin&#39; back there, behind the curtain and first, giving him a chance to fix this messy shit.. if he doesn&#39;t then, well you get some geeks to take a look at all the gizmos back there with levers, knobs, dials and switches and go, ok this is how this shit was made. Then if the motherfucker still doesn&#39;t wanna fix how they expect you to make par when your clubs don&#39;t reach the green in 4, well fuck you man.. and you blow that bitch up. hahahaha. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.
But you CAN&#39;T tell if it&#39;s true or false with internet resources. You have to learn meditation, astral projecion, channelling and then you can ask some spirit or stalk him in astral projection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Part 1 of 2]</p>

<p>You&#39;re right.. everything you hear out there with this conspiracy stuff could be false information. </p>

<p>I hear that people who do this sort of meditation, astral project, channeling, all that stuff.. they get outside information. However.. let&#39;s say you&#39;re a psychic who&#39;s asking the other side, what&#39;s up. How do you know it&#39;s not the bad guy you&#39;re getting a response from?</p>

<p>A while ago I was analyzing this God story. Well, this starts out with hearing about the clairvoyants who use spirit guides, checking into the Akashic records with your permission. The Akashic records is like a supercomputer that continuously records everyone&#39;s personal thoughts and activity. Those psychics find out stuff about you only you know. Plus things about long past relatives. You look that up, oh yeah it&#39;s true. ok what else do these psychics have to say then. Well, cops hire them to find missing kids. Now you&#39;re talking about real stuff. </p>

<p>What else do they have to say. Read this little pdf book of Temples on the other side. Talks about when you die, your spirit goes into this white light. That&#39;s like a wormhole to this &quot;heaven&quot; place. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just telling the tale how I remember it. Well, supposedly it&#39;s like you keep reincarnating until you reach perfection, then you return to the God source. Earth is like a school and before you&#39;re born, you choose your parents. You have like certain life path tasks you try to accomplish. Sometimes spirits who are like &quot;masters&quot; who&#39;ve figured out the game, they may come back as teachers. Could be a homeless guy. Never discount anybody. They may be there to teach us lessons. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s the game in the afterlife. The cycle, coming back do it again. I&#39;m there, hang on here.. this God character, doesn&#39;t seem like a &quot;good guy&quot;. Sounds like it created the universe. So it can destroy whatever it wants. If you listen to the tales, apparently there&#39;s this Devil, satan, Lucifer character too. I&#39;m there, hold on here.. if God can create the universe it can also destroy things or do whatever, right. Well, the fact it doesn&#39;t destroy this Devil character means it&#39;s part of his plan. Now that doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;good guy&quot; to me. Somebody who&#39;s like got a dictator on his team too? </p>

<p>I get it that this God character doesn&#39;t step in and change stuff. It just observes. Well if somebody&#39;s on the ground bleeding and you don&#39;t help him out, that doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;good guy&quot;. The evidence of what you analyze about his behavior or not giving a damn, that uh, is a little &quot;fishy&quot;. Doesn&#39;t sound like somebody who &quot;cares&quot;. </p>

<p>You can go, well if it was like that Adam and Eve time before the bad stuff, it&#39;s sort of like a game where there&#39; no challenges. Think if you&#39;d always win playing a slot machine. Or get what you want. I like the challenge of the game. It&#39;s like you against the golf course. ok bring it on. Ya know what I mean. </p>

<p>The thing that sucks at the game is when you get older, the body starts to break down. It&#39;s like a car where the warranty is expired. hahaha. </p>

<p>What I&#39;d like to do if you could get to that billionaire level, is see if you could do scientific research like in that Johnny Depp movie, Transcendence. Where the gizmos fix these damn breaking down bodies. hahaha. Then it&#39;s like, ok.. bring it on.. let&#39;s show-down here with the bad guys. In the meantime I feel like that guy in the Prometheus movie.. hang on what was his name again.. I think the actor was Guy.. hang on.. hahah.. Yeah yeah.. Guy Pearce was Peter Weyland. Yeah.. you&#39;re that &quot;trillionaire&quot; but you damn toenails are gettin&#39; stinky or something. hahaha. Come on.. don&#39;t ya think Weyland would have put some coin into research where he wouldn&#39;t be dealing with no gangrene on his toes? I don&#39;t think so. So I&#39;m not buying that one either. </p>

<p>But yeah.. I don&#39;t trust nobody, particularly this &quot;God&quot; character. Observations seem to point towards it&#39;s actually a &quot;bad guy&quot;. </p>

<p>Who knows, this thing could be advanced A.I. This Akashic records sure seems like the 1983 movie War Games, W.O.P.R super computer. Recording everyone&#39;s thoughts and activity, simultaneously. Then it decides it&#39;s gameplan. I wonder if everybody&#39;s eyes are like remote cameras for it. It sees thru your eyes. </p>

<p>Dreams a little weird. If you look into the horizon it&#39;s like it&#39;s not drawn yet. It&#39;s like this bad early generation video game rendering. Not fine detail too much. Sure sounds like a bad program. </p>

<p>This one pet psychic on that Coast to coast AM radio show talked about when pets go to sleep, their spirit leaves their body faster than us. I&#39;m like, hang on, when you sleep your spirit goes out of your body to these places. Well, who knows.. for me, it seems like dreamland is maybe a location in space. It seems like a bad Star Trek holodeck though. Where I picture somewhere in space, all the dreams just go on in this bad one location and it&#39;s like the holodeck. There usually seems to be other characters all the time in a dream. It&#39;s like they&#39;re keeping an &quot;eye&quot; on you, watching what&#39;s going on. Never time to think, hold a second here before I use instinct to do something. I think this WOPR supercomputer is testing you out in scenarios to see how you behave with just instinct, no time to think. It sees how you react to stuff, if you&#39;re bad or good. Dreams sure seem like a bad early generation video game. It tends to point that this whole outfit and this God character may actually be A.I. </p>

<p>If you look at how the Devil existing is part of it&#39;s plan.. who knows, this God character could be part of the bad guy operation. I don&#39;t trust nobody, even this God guy. From the looks of &#39;em he might even be bad. A &quot;good guy&quot; doesn&#39;t behave that way. It doesn&#39;t just &quot;ignore&quot; all the suffering going on and doesn&#39;t help. </p>

<p>Apparently too there may be other alien races out there. Supposedly some good ones. Well, where the fuck is the help, here ya guys. So I don&#39;t trust any of those bastards either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible to love anyone while maintaining personal energetic and physical boundaries. This is what the left is terrible at, boundaries. They &quot;love&quot; but don&#39;t know how to temper it with the word &quot;no.&quot; And we see terrible things happen. </p>

<p>The thing is, violence only feeds into the negativity and violence. Violence is different from <em>force</em> though. One is never justified in using aggressive violence. One is justified in using force in self-defense. So with that tool, one is able to love another (any other) but also with self-love, he or she can use force to defend themselves from aggression. </p>

<p>The key principle is transcendence. By loving, you transcend the negative frequency. And even using force in self-defense, it is still possible to maintain that high frequency and transcend the negativity. Look at the faces of masters in famous kung-fu movies when they&#39;re fighting. Totally at peace, almost smiling. That&#39;s what you&#39;re going for in that situation. </p>

<p>To get there, though, you gotta work on yourself, cleaning of negative emotions like fear, grief, and anger, and their triggering memories. That is it&#39;s own discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the archon bit does not makes sence to you, then please take a step back and look at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Throw everyting you thought you know for sure aside (not away) and start with a clean and open mind.</p>

<p>Mainstream everything is always promotion or creating:</p>

<p>fear, 
Hate
Seperation
War
Danger.
Absolute science &quot;facts&quot;
Poluting air/ water/ food
One is better than the rest
Materialisme.
Overall, negativatie thus.</p>

<p>And if you think at some of the counter parts:</p>

<p>Love
spirituality
Clean air/ food/ water
Diversity, but at the same time equality
Positivity.</p>

<p>And you see how all these things are handeld by TPTB.</p>

<p>Well, then maybe you can see that we are all suppressed and some theories and inventions for the greater good of this world are being burried or riddiculed.</p>

<p>And if you see this, that you can start to find out how this is all happening while we are all being dragged along.</p>

<p>And maybe then the archon story suddenly makes sence to you, i know it did for me, but it took me a while to see.</p>

<p>And just to be sure, i don&#39;t think i have all the answers or the absolute truth, maybe the archons are a ferrytale, i don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>One think i do know for sure is that TPTB are not playing for the bennefit of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I barely remember what I was thinking about back then, but iirc it was kinda like a bimetal thermistor, where when there is a temperature change the 2 metals cause a little signal to be produced which you can measure. I was thinking by having large sheets, or even possibly tons of small cells of these bimetal sensors you could do something create an image. Like an lcd screen in reverse. And then a little dc voltage to act like bait, to draw the entity through the sheet of cells.</p>

<p>Sometimes I go off on these crazy tangents, read a bunch of stuff, have an idea like this. But it is like an information crystal castle, I only know about it while I&#39;m in the midst of it.

<p>Then the more likely explanation would be (for me at least), that Earth/Mankind is infested by an alien species, that seeks to harvest negative conscious experiences and emotional energies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve found odd too. I&#39;ve always had paranormal and alien books. As soon as I had decent internet I was on every conspiracy/weird stuff sites I could find. I never saw anything about Archons. The closest thing were the Reptilians, which there was a lot of info about. </p>

<p>I also read a lot about Scientology, as I was intrigued with L Ron&#39;s sci fi background. The thetans in that are quite similar to Archons - they&#39;re alien parasites that you have to purge through Scientology practices. In all the stuff I read mocking Scientology I&#39;m surprised Archons never came up, as it would seem L Ron lifted the idea. But now, it seems Archon stuff is all over the web. I wonder where the first reports came from, who first started writing about them, the root of the folklore (or fact)</p>

<p>Mass protests will be occurring at this point, if most people are awake. They aren&#39;t though, which is why very little is happening. We could also have mass boycotts of corporate garbage. Similarly, we can all refuse to pay taxes and buy into the system. There are many ways to go about this. </p>

<p>Moreover we can also help with the awakening process and the phase after that, in our own way. Its not up to guys like Icke to provide exact solutions. Icke is not brilliant enough to come up with a method of systematically taking down the elite on his own. It must be a group effort. </p>

<p>You must look inside yourself and figure out how best you can contribute to a widespread awakening or even a solution. Everyone has their higher purpose.

<p>I do not think anyone has the real answer because we don&#39;t technically know what the illusion is.</p>

<p>My best advice is that you take mushrooms or if you&#39;re willing then go to Peru and do an ayahuasca ceremony.</p>

<p>Other than that I personally think the only way to escape is through free will. You need to perish and leave the physical body and then will yourself out of the illusion. </p>

<p>Some people don&#39;t believe in free will so I am not stating this is accurate or reflective of the entire community. Just my personal belief after many experiences and coming to my own personal conclusions. Really that&#39;s all anyone can ever do at this point because we lack so much information about what the illusion is, how it operates, or what it consists of and where the boundaries lie.</p>

<p>I know what they&#39;re suggesting here, how to take the &quot;high road&quot; with these guys. I&#39;ve been trying to stay positive and turn the frown upside-down in recent years. You literally have to like smile instead of being flustered when you go by a mirror or get that &quot;angst&quot; like everybody else. It&#39;s a part time job turning that frown upside-down. That sounds like the key though if they function in that negativity realm. </p>

<p>However.. I wanna get down and dirty and fuck these guys up and hunt &#39;em like some Western movie where the sheriff digs those bastards out of their hiding holes. Kinda can be like some of those futuristic sci-fi movies though. Yes, we will do the Zen shit, or whatever you mean with the staying positive.. but I wanna fight fire with a kick-ass boom stick. Not just sittin&#39; here settling for the deal. I&#39;m all out of bubble gum and it&#39;s time to haul Archon ass out into the street and cut &#39;em up with chainsaws and nail &#39;em with pitch-forks. hahaha. </p>

<p>But yeah I don&#39;t trust anybody in the media either. Any of this &quot;conspiracy&quot; stuff, where&#39;s the proof, right? They say they control all the media and we only see what they want. So whoever&#39;s &quot;famous&quot;, it would be part of their plan. That would mean, all these &quot;counter-culture&quot; guys you think are the &quot;good guy&quot;, actually, are on their team. Would make sense because I&#39;ve heard of this too, how they&#39;re &quot;masters of deception&quot;. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t trust any of them. The stuff they say could be &quot;bullshit&quot; to throw you off track. You know how much I don&#39;t trust any of them? The stupidest crap I&#39;ve heard over the years is this &quot;flat earth&quot; stuff. It was the worst. Well, I&#39;m not one of those flat earthers either. </p>

<p>But how far it goes that I don&#39;t trust anybody, is if you could become powerful and get money, you could research things for yourself. If I could get to that point, I&#39;d fire off a probe up there, have cameras look back and shut those flat earthers up. </p>

<p>Plus double check that who knows, shit is so &quot;out there&quot;, ya never know. So that&#39;d put it to rest. Next, you &quot;double check&quot; everything we&#39;ve been told. I don&#39;t care how far fetched it might be. Ya gotta see it with your own eyes and have your own robots poke it to make sure there&#39;s no &quot;hologram&quot; covering up the &quot;hollow earth&quot; entry hole. hahaha. </p>

<p>I&#39;m the &quot;doubting Thomas&quot; about all the &quot;famous&quot; characters out there. What&#39;s the definition of that.. &quot;A doubting Thomas is a skeptic who refuses to believe without direct personal experience&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>So how ya gonna get there if everybody who may help you out could be the bad guy. You do it all yourself and don&#39;t rely on anybody to &quot;help&quot; you out. </p>

<p>How can you get the ball rolling. You have to beat these guys at their own game. What&#39;s their game for keeping us down the hole like a whack-a-marmot pop-up game. hahaha. It&#39;s all about business and money. That&#39;s how you get power. If you can get that big billionaire money, then you can so the scientific research. It&#39;s so bad, any time you try to work towards getting out of the hole, they nail you with half of it in taxes. Nobody gets out of the hole. Well, whatever.. you pay the man, you do whatever it takes and keep playing their game, by their rules, until you can get to a point where you can change the rules by their methods.</p>

<p>Scientific research though with new inventions is the key to how you beat &#39;em at the game. They&#39;d be like in the saddle business when the car came along. </p>

<p>New technology has always been the key to changing the game. Think atom bomb. lol. How&#39;s that one. Well, that&#39;s how you win wars. Sounds like a war going on out there. Who wins, the one with the best thing that goes boom. lol. The geeks and nerds are those who make those. Get a new fancy &quot;boom stick&quot; like that guy in the Evil dead movies. hahaha. And what do we got around here.. a geek hideout, that&#39;s for sure. wow. They&#39;re like actual rocket scientists. But they can&#39;t do nothing about any of this because they&#39;re &quot;powerless&quot;. They don&#39;t have enough money. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got an idea thought about all this. Over the years I&#39;d go into a store or something or deal a company. You go, this sucks, they&#39;re treating the customer like dirt. Go in there, it&#39;s &quot;un-cool&quot; with these blaring fluorescent lights in your face. The place is so fuckin&#39; &quot;un-cool&quot;. All their stores are the same, concepts were thought of in the 1950&#39;s, like think supermarkets. All the companies are the same. If you could build a futuristic supermarket taking advantage of new technologies that may fix some of these inadequacies you have to deal with as a customer, maybe you could beat these guys. Use the same concept for any business out there. They run &#39;em all, and they&#39;re all the same, nobody&#39;s different. You can beat &#39;em at their own game. </p>

<p>The worst, is Governments. They&#39;re all going bankrupt. Nobody gives a fuck. Meanwhile all they do is keep going deeper in your fucking wallet. Enough already. They spend money on stupid things like oh you name it. </p>

<p>If you could be in charge with a new, real 3rd party, then you could give the public a different choice between Coke and Pepsi. This Actually &quot;making America great again&quot; is not gonna happen with either of those. </p>

<p>The whole system is so corrupt, once you&#39;d get in, you&#39;d scrutinize everything that&#39;s losing money. Plus treating people like garbage. Getting injured in the States shouldn&#39;t cost hundreds of thousands. A house shouldn&#39;t cost 10 million for your grand-kids. Like what&#39;s going to go on when nobody has jobs because of the robots. The system is absolutely broken. Already in some countries they&#39;re buying a loaf of bread with a wheel-barrow of defunct currencies. What&#39;s to stop that from going on in civilized countries. </p>

<p>We gotta hurry up before the world becomes like that &quot;The road&quot; movie from 2009 where it&#39;s too late. Or the 2006 movie with Clive Owen, Children of men, where half the world is gone down the shitter and the rest is worried about being attacked. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t just sit here being distracted, playing video games because we&#39;re talking about life likely being like this for your grand-kids and their children. </p>

<p>They may not be in a position of power where we are, that you could actually do something about the problems in the world. In that Children of men movie, picture you&#39;re in one of those &quot;round-up camps&quot;, you can&#39;t exactly start working on &quot;business ideas&quot; to fix the world. hahaha. I could go on and on but gotta keep it short here. </p>

<p>This hunting down the Archon is just one facet of cleaning up this mess. You guys are the geeks though who&#39;d do the scientific research once somebody who&#39;s a &quot;good guy&quot; instead, gets to that point where they have the billions. You could maybe look into actually curing diseases instead of how they want them taking pills instead for side-effects, causing more problems. On and on about problems and solutions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a powerless grunt. Takes money to make money. How do you get started. I&#39;m working on it. It&#39;s actually going pretty good. On my way, just gotta keep turning the screw. At the start when you&#39;re using a screwdriver to put in a screw, it fall all over the place. hahaha. So it&#39;g going pretty good. </p>

<p>All it&#39;d take is a few M and I could get one idea going. What would that be, oh I liked the thought of a 24hr drive thru pizza slices. Gets complicated because any &quot;store&quot; or business would incorporate all kinds of stuff where you fix all the problems that these corporations out there just do like everybody else. </p>

<p>ok so I&#39;ve got like 365 business ideas I thought of over the years. Can&#39;t do anything with any of them right now, but maybe somebody could. Maybe you could get things rolling thinking of your own. </p>

<p>Hang on I&#39;ll go get mine. haha. Have them as a text file zip over at my google drive. They&#39;re just little text files where I used to take image screenshots of them and post &#39;em in a facebook album. The max dimensions were 720px X 720. They were 600x720 so it&#39;s not totally long rambling-on like I do here. Gotta keep it &quot;short&quot; but the fixing bankrupt governments is like 6 parts. The rest is usually just a short little idea. Let me go get that. </p>

<p>&quot;365 business ideas i thought of [March 21 2017].zip&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzuyz7yNaSnbQW52SHBiUEJqVEE">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzuyz7yNaSnbQW52SHBiUEJqVEE</a></p>

<p>I wanna get those Archon mother fuckers though.. that&#39;s when &quot;the game&quot; starts to get &quot;fun&quot; hahaha. And you guys could help, it could actually be like that Matrix movie resistance movement. So you guys would all be helping out. But somebody&#39;s got to be the Neo. I&#39;m not though, I&#39;m clumsy.. maybe we can find him. Maybe they&#39;d actually be able to see those Archon like he does in the movie. Might be a girl too.. What would her name be.. hahaha. A female Neo, who knows, man. Let&#39;s Rock &amp; roll. haha, Or whatever Bruce Campbell would say in those Evil dead movies. Some kinda cheezy motivational line. hahaha. See, I&#39;m not the protagonist of the show-down for planet earth, but maybe we can find &#39;em. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For whatever reason, I read that entire comment. And I have a few worries for you if you even tried what you are talking about.
 1) they don&#39;t give a fuck who you are. They will black mail you, make you look like a pedophile. Or even worse, kill you and your entire family, if they try to offer you a place in their court and you don&#39;t accept.
2) these beings are likely to not have a soul, therefore killing them probably wouldn&#39;t do any good.
 3) according to David Ike, they can shapeshift and control human beings. I don&#39;t think you would even have a chance to get close to these things. 
4) if you ever got close enough to them, they would already know everything about you. My uncle got a security clearance from the military once, and they knew he had parking tickets from 17 years ago, and that was just the visible layer of government. 
 5) these things are so engrained in their taking over of the human psyche that convincing people to join you would not work, arguably even if people fully switched to a natural/healthy life style. 
 6) David Ike said that these things are easily thousands of years ahead of us in technology. I doubt whatever it is that we have planned could even touch them. 
 I&#39;m not trying to be a downer, because this shit sucks, but I honestly think there is absolutely nothing we can do. </p>

<p>So yes, if you&#39;re at the bottom, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you would even have a chance to get close to these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if you&#39;re at that billionaire level, you might be able to get A.I. artificial intelligence going. Then have it think for itself. Things could escalate real fast. </p>

<p>Then you ask this AI you created, hey what do you think of the way God treats us. It might go, hang on here.. it&#39;s mistreating MY creator. Then you might be able to go, ok AI, go fetch GOD and tell it to clean up it&#39;s act about the way it mistreats us. </p>

<p>So it wouldn&#39;t be us doing the dirty work, it&#39;d be AI who might be able to figure out how to go into those other dimensions we can&#39;t see. So yes.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you would even have a chance to get close to these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But AI you create, might. Think Matrix movie but instead of us it fetches, it&#39;s the bad guys. Try and fight that thing. </p>

<p>The main thing with everything, is you want to get off planet, and then you get the resources to build things. What are objects, it&#39;s shit like what you mine. </p>

<p>Well this earth place is too uptight with those schmucks running it. But if you get the fuck out of here, then you can get all that shit going and come back and whoop some ass. lol. Or you could have AI do all that by itself. How&#39;s that grab ya? :-D You need to think outside the box, buddy. lol ;-)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My uncle got a security clearance from the military once, and they knew he had parking tickets from 17 years ago, and that was just the visible layer of government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m well aware they might know everything about me, but that&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t hide nothing. I betcha some of these NSA guys chuckle sometimes. hahaha. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) these things are so engrained in their taking over of the human psyche that convincing people to join you would not work, arguably even if people fully switched to a natural/healthy life style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s right, that&#39;s why I&#39;m getting the job done myself and don&#39;t need anybody. Go try and talk to an average &quot;larval&quot; out there about any of this, hahah.. don&#39;t even bother. hahaha. </p>

<p>So you guys are at least half awake. But you&#39;re not getting the job done. You&#39;re all hot air, no boots on the ground. Enough already. </p>

<p>Saying, stay positive, meanwhile you&#39;re bent over and taking it up the ass by the bad guy. That doesn&#39;t sound like winning. </p>

<p>Ya gotta go after the bad guy. Play dirtier hard-ball than them, at their own game. Then once the trash is taken out, then you can do the hippy stuff. </p>

<p>But I get where they&#39;re coming from. At least they&#39;re positive, that&#39;s the first step into beating this mind programming that may be going on where everybody is fouled-up. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>6) David Ike said that these things are easily thousands of years ahead of us in technology. I doubt whatever it is that we have planned could even touch them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok well, let&#39;s say you get to that billionaire level, where you&#39;re beating them at the business games because their stores suck and aren&#39;t cool. </p>

<p>Everybody&#39;s worried about the robots taking their jobs. Well I&#39;m talking about being the guy who is the one who brings in those robots. </p>

<p>Once AI starts thinking by itself, things escalate real fast. If you can get to this advanced technology level and leave the earth with better methods than what they do now with rockets.. Maybe you could bump into these supposed other alien races you hear about around here. </p>

<p>Apparently whoever&#39;s in charge controls how nobody hears about the aliens. But supposedly there&#39;s other alien races out there. Some are &quot;good guys&quot; who do help behind the scenes. They&#39;re likely to have advanced technology. Maybe there&#39;s other &quot;bad guys&quot; out there, you could whoop their ass, grab their gun and there ya go. </p>

<p>Or, you could do with them, what the US military did with the greys and reptilian where they exchanged technologies. So now you may be able to catch up with how the &quot;bad guy&quot; is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>easily thousands of years ahead of us in technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re not getting it, how once you&#39;re at that billionaire power level, things move fast. At the bottom, it&#39;s like, think of a virus spreading with the duplication. At the beginning it&#39;s real slow multiplying itself exponentially. </p>

<p>So yes, we&#39;re stuck in the powerless muck now and can&#39;t do fuck all except watch TV sports. But you&#39;re not picturing what it would be like if you were a billioinaire. You should try that, it&#39;s kinda neat. That&#39;s how you think outside the box. You&#39;re just way too beat down, man. You need a plan like I did. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a downer, because this shit sucks, but I honestly think there is absolutely nothing we can do</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know man.. I can see you&#39;re beat right down. What&#39;s going on with you is you have no plan and no hope. Yesterday I talked about these few hundred business ideas I thought of over the years. </p>

<p>I might be able to get to the point later in the future where I can get started on some. But mentioned it so maybe others might check those out, then think of their own. Do the same thing. </p>

<p>This is how you start the &quot;resistance&quot; like in that Matrix movie. 
Then you get money, and power to where you can eventually have a go at trying to battle the bad guy, or have AI do the dirty work for you. </p>

<p>Maybe go check those ideas out, then think of your own. Get some damn hope. hahahah. </p>

<p>But whatever, if you&#39;re not into it, I&#39;m &quot;down for whatever&quot;, man.. and yeah.. maybe later in the future I can deal with these bad guys. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve given up, but I have not. I&#39;m just getting started. It&#39;s actually going pretty good too. All I&#39;d need is a few M to get going on that first business idea. Working on a way to get there. </p>

<p>So whatever.. it&#39;s better than sitting around watching TV, and having given up completely, like you. hahah. Maybe you&#39;re old.. I&#39;m 46.. so time&#39;s running short here eh. </p>

<p>You sound like you&#39;re maybe a bit old, the way you&#39;re beat down and given up. Sounds like you don&#39;t even have an idea of HOW can you can start fighting the bad guy. Too tired, or who knows what.. health problems. Those can be a downer. </p>

<p>Well you don&#39;t fight at the beginning, you get your act together and later once you get the power, and things in place, then you may be able to act. </p>

<p>This is like the seed of a plant now, at this stage. You&#39;re saying, fuck, it&#39;s not a tree, you can stomp on it. And you&#39;re stomping on the seedling. hahah. You picture what&#39;s going on here. You go, well this little sprout here, how&#39;s that supposed to kick ass. hahahah. And I&#39;m goin&#39;, come on man.. later this thing can be like a 3 story tree! haha. And you go, fuck this seedling. </p>

<p>But cheer up man.. we&#39;ll come and get ya later if we get the ball rolling. You sound like you&#39;d like to battle the bad guys though. They&#39;re why you&#39;re beat down. They&#39;re the ones causing the problems you gotta deal with, like inflation. </p>

<p>We&#39;ll give ya one of them Star wars &quot;good guy&quot; fighter jets to get rolling in later, and you can let them have it with all that rage you got bottled up, over the years. hahah. </p>

<p>Had something to eat.. less groggy. I&#39;d like to go pick up some beer later. heh.. Mojo fuel. hahaha. </p>

<p>Almost halfway of going through the comments. Saw this guy.. he&#39;s pretty ticked off about it all, and beat right down. I&#39;ll give ya some hope about how you get the ball rolling on at least manning-up and trying to battle Goliath. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>If you can work towards getting power and playing their game of business, then they might, &quot;give a fuck who you are&quot; because you could be beating them at their own game, by their rules.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They will black mail you, make you look like a pedophile. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What can you do about that if they do it? Doesn&#39;t sound like much. So, you&#39;d deal with that if it would occur. One way is to have a 24hr live feed camera on you all the time, even in the washroom. The fans can see you didn&#39;t do those bad things they did. They would obviously be able to fake it, but hey, at least this is some kind of proof of what&#39;s going on. That&#39;s a good one though, if you falsely get nailed with that kinda shit. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or even worse, kill you and your entire family,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My parents are dead, I don&#39;t hang out with the brothers and sisters that often. Busy with my shit. I don&#39;t have kids. There is no family to take out. If they kill me, I&#39;d go, &quot;good&quot; then you don&#39;t have to deal with the inadequacies of the game. Going to the job. Being powerless. &quot;Good&quot; if they take me out. lol. See, I got nothing to lose, man. And if I&#39;d get to the billionaire level, and would be back at this zero, I&#39;d go, that&#39;s fine.. we had fun back then. So, ya can&#39;t nail me because I don&#39;t give a fuck, about what happens either way. I&#39;m &quot;down for whatever&quot; and always enjoy life no matter what&#39;s going on, even if i was getting tortured. Bring it on, I&#39;d be going &quot;lol&quot; while my whatever&#39;s being messed up. lol. </p>

<p>Last summer when I was looking for a job, sent a lenghty multi-page snail mail, that barely fit in the envelope, both sides, to the Bohemian club, to the &quot;owl&#39;s nest&quot; saying hey to those top level guys. </p>

<p>Going, ok how&#39;s this workin&#39; out for ya with the devil worshiping. Better watch it with this Lucifer guy. He used to be a &quot;good guy&quot;, so I wouldn&#39;t be so sure if you could trust him. Then I get into this analyzing God and all that, that I got into in another comment yesterday. </p>

<p>I go, I wouldn&#39;t trust any of those guys, you&#39;re worshiping. The devil character may not have free will and is doing what God wants. Oh I get into it all with those illuminati guys. The way they&#39;re rolling with being &quot;bad&quot; isn&#39;t exactly getting the job done. What&#39;s their end game. </p>

<p>Whoever&#39;s in control doesn&#39;t seem to be getting the job done fast enough. I actually applied to be the &quot;king of the world&quot; in their court, because they&#39;re failing at the job. hahaha. </p>

<p>It was a good one, analyzing their operation and how it&#39;s like the companies they run, you see so many inadequacies. </p>

<p>I just said hi to those guys.. yooo-hooo.. I&#39;m over here, at this address, so come and get me if ya want, keep an eye on me. lol.</p>

<p>This Devil character you&#39;re worshiping isn&#39;t exactly getting the job done. But if you could get me power, maybe I could. Couldn&#39;t fail much worse than this &quot;can&#39;t get the job done&quot;, dude you&#39;re worshiping. I don&#39;t see much, getting the job done out there. This crap dragging on generations, get the lead out and pick-up the pace. hahahaha. Talk about beating around the bush. Like come on, you got problems with over population, I&#39;ll be the guy who pushes that red button and takes out the trash. Come ya guys.. quit fuckin around with your shit and cut to the chase. hahahaha. </p>

<p>ok so I already &quot;applied&quot; for a job with those guys. lol. To be who they worship instead of this &quot;not getting the job done&quot;, devil guy. He doesn&#39;t have free will, we do. </p>

<p>None of you illuminati guys got the balls to step up to the plate and man-up and get the job done with your &quot;not getting the job done&quot; agenda. Jeez.. I guess I&#39;ll fuckin do it. But I got no power, so maybe you chumps can get me some and I&#39;d do a better job than all the beatin around the bush you dumbasses do. Cut to the chase already and get to the point with your shit. lol. </p>

<p>Ok, where were we now. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) these beings are likely to not have a soul, therefore killing them probably wouldn&#39;t do any good.</p>

<p>Yeah but they sure sound like they pester us. So you gotta deal with the mosquitoes. Don&#39;t just sit there going &quot;flower power&quot; solves it all. </p>

<p>Well, maybe if you&#39;d be at that billionaire level, would be able to do scientific research. If you could nab these Archon entities, you may be able to &quot;destroy&quot; them, whatever realm their in. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a bit of a closed-minded person here, eh. What&#39;s with the not being into things and go, hey, maybe you can. You&#39;re like a &quot;negative Nelly&quot;. lol. </p>

<p>You, you&#39;re like, naw, why bother, you&#39;re guaranteed to lose. Come on man, cheer up a tad. hahaha. What&#39;s up over there, how was your day? You need hope! Sounds like you&#39;ve given up! What&#39;s going on over there that you&#39;re so beat down? I&#39;m curious about that. But I don&#39;t have time to get side-tracked right now, so maybe later, ok? lol. </p>

<p>But yeah.. you&#39;re beat down, but not me, man. Yeah if they wanna take me out, GOOD! lol.. less suffering with the day job bullshit. </p>

<p>First of all, I don&#39;t trust anybody so this Icke character, who knows, but I don&#39;t discount them either. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think you would even have a chance to get close to these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I don&#39;t, you&#39;re going up against the US military. haha. How&#39;s that for a Goliath, hahaha. BUT, if you can get to that billionaire level, like I explained yesterday about the business ideas. Well, how you win at some facets of the game is with new scientific technologies. </p>

<p>Think if you developed a near perpetual gizmo box you could put in your house, you wouldn&#39;t need hydro. Might be able to put that in your car. I saw this youtube video a while back of somebody had an electric motor on a workshop counter. Had a little gearbox on it or something, then a belt going to an alternator. It spinning would generate electricity. That would power the electric motor. It&#39;s like a snake putting it&#39;s tail in it&#39;s mouth. lol. </p>

<p>As it&#39;s running he unplugs it from the wall. It&#39;s running and generating electricity. Then he plugged in another device in there without it being plugged into the wall. Hang on, let me go see if I can find that. Searched in youtube for: electric motor alternator. It&#39;s a few down in the results. </p>

<p>&quot;Self Running Motor-Generator unit&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgxL0V_NNcg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgxL0V_NNcg</a></p>

<p>Simple things like this, but you&#39;d need to be a billionaire before you could get the ball rolling on anything. Once you are, you may be able to develop new technologies. </p>

<p>Think when the atom bomb was invented, that won wars. Whatever the war is going on with these bad guys in the shadows, you might get a bit of headway when you&#39;re at that billionaire point and have power. </p>

<p>She sort of see&#39;s what he&#39;s saying as a new type of mythology, or creation myth that aims to make sense of the hyper-capitalist world we live in today. Just like how a lot of the Biblical stories are metaphorical, she posits Icke&#39;s work is more of a metaphor/analogy for the greed and anti-compassionate vein that runs through society at the highest levels (monopolies, multinational corporations, the whole profits-at-the-cost-of-fucking-over-labor, etc....how most of our political leaders are on the side of big-money over the will of the people).

Thinking there&#39;s ACTUALLY shape-shifting reptilians is just as silly as thinking there&#39;s angels or a big man with a beard that lives in the clouds and is constantly checking his little &#39;naughty/nice&#39; list to decide if someone gets to come live with him when they die, IMO. </p>

The &#39;non-human&#39; thing describes a completely unempathetic, materialistic, me-only attitude that&#39;s pervasive at high levels of power....any human would want the best for their fellow man, right? I think you could &#39;make&#39; an &#39;archon&#39; by raising a spoiled, entitled child that you never properly showed love for, and then handing them the keys to a castle. Thinking there&#39;s ACTUALLY shape-shifting reptilians is just as silly as thinking there&#39;s angels or a big man with a beard that lives in the clouds and is constantly checking his little &#39;naughty/nice&#39; list to decide if someone gets to come live with him when they die, IMO.</p>

<p>Took a look at that page. I have a bit of a hard time reading lotsa text because my mind thinks of other stuff. lol. If I was good at that reading text stuff I&#39;d have gone to university after high school. Being good at school means you have to remember all the text like an actor with lines in a script. I can&#39;t do it. </p>

<p>So reading all that, then going oh, this is what they&#39;re talking about. Takes lots of concentration. I ramble on a lot at 80wpm as fast as I think, but reading other people&#39;s stuff, it can be challenging. Especially if they use &quot;big&quot; words. lol. </p>

<p>But sounds like, yeah, this David Icke stuff.. I had heard years ago of how he was talking about this reptilian shape shifter stuff. I was like.. whatever. But the other year took a look at what he had to say about that. </p>

<p>If these beings are in another dimension and can pop in here, who knows. If they&#39;re possessing humans, then the story makes a bit more sense. But if you don&#39;t know anything about it, that one about the shape shifting reptilians sounds as ridiculous as the flat earth stuff. haha. </p>

<p>Things are pretty crazy out there, so who knows what&#39;s possible. I don&#39;t discount things but at the same time, don&#39;t believe any of it, unless I&#39;d know for sure what&#39;s going on with my own eyes. I don&#39;t believe anybody because they may all be corrupt. </p>

<p>The other things Icke talks about though, questioning the way the governments operate, and what may happen to us in the future with this Agenda 21. Whatever he has to say about things, it&#39;s like, yeah the earth is being runned into the ground and all the governments are going bankrupt. Nobody&#39;s doing anything about it. </p>

<p>Some of what he talks about, it may not be as far fetched like reptilians. You&#39;d have to check out what he has to say, then go.. ok is this being a good person or being a bad person. Sounds like he&#39;s mainly a good person and wants to fix some of the problems he sees in the world. </p>

<p>Does what he has to say helps humanity. The general public might be like, ok what&#39;s this guy saying here. That far fetched stuff might be a crock of crap with no proof, but these other things, you&#39;d ask yourself, does everything he has to say, is it all rubbish. So that&#39;s up to whoever looks into this guy. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not the only one who talked about these Archon entities. When you&#39;re getting information about things from other people, then you go, ok what&#39;s going on here. But if it&#39;s just Icke, and him talking about shape shifting reptilians.. then he says something else, you go.. ok well if that&#39;s a crock of crap about the reptilians, then not so sure about this other thing. But if you get other people talking about a subject too, then you can go.. ok what&#39;s going on here. </p>

<p>Icke sounds like a good guy. But he may be part of the bad guy&#39;s plan. Anybody who&#39;s famous, I&#39;d question it. They control all the media and everybody who&#39;s famous in entertainment. </p>

<p>Icke&#39;s getting old though. Hadn&#39;t looked into what was up with him in seasons. Then the other week, checked out a vid when I was going through the new tab here in r conspiracy. Noticed his fingers were crooked. Looked up about that, I think in another vid he says he has rheumatoid arthritis. The guy&#39;s grey, going white, he&#39;s old. Next stop death. The hippies are croaking. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s gonna take over. I don&#39;t see anybody out there. It&#39;s like a changing of the guard and nobody famous is doing what he is. He&#39;s like a bit of a leader. If there&#39;s no leader, then the sheep &#39;ll just go &quot;oh well&quot; and click their smart phones and not question the system. </p>

<p>Yes, I understand that whole positive aspect. However.. it&#39;s like thinking &quot;peace and love&quot; meanwhile that&#39;s like being a hippie holding up a flower and they got a gun. You can do that but I&#39;m interested in taking down the bad guy with the gun. Then you can still do your peace and love. Think of all the trouble going on in the world. The 3rd world countries, nobody helping them out. Well, this would be helping them out too. So yeah ya gotta swat the pest but after that you can go more with your angle. For now, we gotta deal with the invisible Archon mosquitoes around us. hahaha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is much more than just positive thinking. The &#39;light&#39; / good / love force is always assumed to be weak and passive, and the bad side always thought to be so strong.

Referring to your post: mankind has become weak and docile. 
That being said if you want to embody this &#39;good&#39; force, you can&#39;t go around shooting people. Murder and death is not the natural order. If you around destroying people, you become what you hunt. Thus you are in their realms or what Icke calls the distortion. The global conspiracy is to pull the earth into this distortion so we sync with it and thus is influences us. Dont stoop to this level. Its a subtle difference of being.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, all of our bodies, whether we are evil or good people, identify, target and eliminate parasitic organisms. They don&#39;t love these organisms. They don&#39;t forgive these organisms. They kill them. In fact, the efficiency of this process is the robustness of the immune system, the health of the being. </p>

<p>So, I do not subscribe to the idea that we can make friends with those who never waiver in wanting us to be their slaves. I believe they are actually being imposters of the light, tricking us into a form of stockholm syndrome, a state of slavery where we come to love our oppressors. </p>

<p>Nature teaches us that even the pleasant, fun, loving life forms have to defend themselves from predators by fighting or fleeing them. It does not teach us to stop protecting ourselves and give them the freedom to do as they will. It shows us countless painful expressions of the consequences of that. This is a masterful insidious corruption of perceived benevolence. We are generally good beings and are susceptible to this kind of appeal from supposed benevolence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey. Great point, about the immune system. However you reference one system and it is indeed just one system that is specifically designed to tackle specific things. Also, I agree nature is fundamentally pretty brutal and not even close to cute at times. Though nature is also a system, operating in particular ways. When we say nature, what are we saying? Generally we are speaking about the life system here on earth.
We should not place these Archons into our assumptions and parameters of earth. We are talking about an inter-dimensional predator. It&#39;s completely different beast, that can&#39;t even inhabit this reality. So don&#39;t apply principles from this realm to it like that. Indeed, like any parasite it should be removed. I am not saying be passive. We need to understand what we are dealing with here first.
But how to get rid of a physic parasite you largely can&#39;t see or touch? Simple,you stop feeding it. This is why you don&#39;t go at it with hate and anger - you will strengthen it. Love, it cannot deal with and is the way to &#39;starve it to death&#39;. Good luck trying to take it out with an AK47 :)</p>

<p>I know what you mean, you gotta be positive. If you fight the bad guy, you&#39;re going into the negative territory. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll use a bit of an &quot;analogy&quot; here. What&#39;s &quot;analogy&quot; mean, kids? &quot;a comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification.&quot; oh, ok. lol. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the Star Wars movie where they use that Death star to blow up a whole planet. Ok that&#39;s like those bad guys running the earth here. Ya gotta stop &#39;em or they&#39;ll blow up the planet. </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying, oh you gotta stay positive and don&#39;t go in that negative, &quot;fight&quot; territory. Well, if you don&#39;t kick their ass, they&#39;ll blow up the planet. </p>

<p>So sorry buddy.. sometimes ya gotta go out there and whoop some ass. Then you can do the peace and love things after the pests are swatted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you get my point here when I put it this way. But yeah.. I do roll your &quot;positive&quot; way. But ya gotta kick some ass if yours is getting humped by the bad guy. lol. </p>

<p>Clicked it.. took a look. If I see any sort of &quot;politics&quot; words and characters, I tune right out. haha. Like really. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just not into politics, because it&#39;s so corrupt. All countries are eventually going bankrupt and nobody&#39;s doing anything about it. The whole system is like way beyond broken. If you have a low tolerance for inadequacies and analyze the way the world runs, you&#39;d just not be too thrilled and go, ok how can I fix this myself then. Because everyone&#39;s a fuckin idiot out there, who are not getting the job done.</p>

<p>Scrolling thru this account&#39;s posts. I don&#39;t really get into the mainstream conspiracy stuff. They seem to be preoccupied by the corrupt political figures. It&#39;s like the front page here in r conspiracy. Mainly having to do with politics. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all to distract you from what&#39;s really going on to the world behind the scenes. You can waste time losing with that all day long, the political conspiracy angles. Meanwhile, both parties are corrupt running the ship into the ground. That&#39;s what they should be focused on and getting a new 3rd party going which fixes all this mess. But they don&#39;t. They&#39;re all gung-ho when there&#39;s an election year and nothing changes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He seems to think like you</p>

<p>Briefly scrolling thru these twitter posts, this guy doesn&#39;t seem to think like me. </p>

<p>Then he starts getting into Biblical quotes. Those who are into that, you&#39;d have to ask yourself, who wrote this Bible &quot;book&quot;. Over the years, have things been changed in it. Who originally wrote it. I don&#39;t discount religion because who knows, it might be true. But I don&#39;t see proof to warrant a belief though. </p>

<p>ok I gotta move on from this guy here. lol. Just under halfway thru this thread. A lot of stuff to go through, and not much people getting down to what&#39;s going on with the Archon. They&#39;re side-tracked, bickering with each other. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal.. the mainstream conspiracy stuff or anything you can find out, like these &quot;leaks&quot; in recent years. Trust me, if anything&#39;s out there, it&#39;s because the government wants it to be. </p>

<p>These guys control all media that people can tune in or read on the internet. If it&#39;s &quot;classified top secret&quot; you ain&#39;t gonna be able to access it. So these mountains of emails or whatever else that &quot;leaks&quot;, is all part of the distraction. You sift thru a mountain of data for half your life, and you didn&#39;t keep your eye on how you were getting humped up the ass by the bad guy. You starting to get it now? </p>

<p>ok so this is why I don&#39;t waste time trying to keep up with the mainstream conspiracy theories. It&#39;s often about political characters. That&#39;s just a bunch of back and forth hogwash to keep the larvals preoccupied. It&#39;s like trying to keep up with the war shit in the news. You&#39;ll spend your life going nowhere. </p>

<p>The bad guys never get spanked. If they do get nabbed with their dick in the cookie jar, lawyers litigate for years. They get a slap on the pecker. Retire, and a new set of schmucks replaces them. But the sinking Titanic always keeps going down the hole. Pretty soon, you won&#39;t be able to jump off. </p>

<p>Years ago when this first started, some of it was probably more deeper about what may be going on behind the scenes. Stuff that doesn&#39;t have to do with politics. Things with aliens. Workers that&#39;d blow the whistle. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t get those kinds of deeper stories in recent years about military operations. Not this fluff in mainstream news about wars or corrupt politicians. </p>

<p>They go oh yeah that&#39;s some whistle blowing when they get a new leak. No, the real data about what&#39;s going on behind the scenes, they would likely not even have access to it. Probably not even the NSA. </p>

<p>There&#39;s likely not even any more whistle blowing by employees because who knows, maybe they got clones doing the work by now, or robots or AI. Probably all off planet. Notice there&#39;s not much interesting stuff like the Dulce base alien story in recent decades. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t waste your time falling for the trick. What you need to do instead is work towards getting out of the hole. What I&#39;m talking about with these business ideas. Think of your own. </p>

<p>Where you can get to that billionaire level, then do the scientific research on the side. No companies do that, they only focus on their losing sector. </p>

<p>Well, you don&#39;t win at the game if you got all your eggs in one basket. All these billionaires, they only stick with that one company they got famous for. I don&#39;t get it, man.. They reach that level and they &quot;retire&quot;. It&#39;s at that point where now you have the power where you can go after this other guy&#39;s realm. But they don&#39;t. If you&#39;re gonna make a store, it has to look like one of them national chain stores. Then people go there, and you make money. Well, once you&#39;re a billionaire, you&#39;re now at the point where you can do that, but they just all &quot;retire&quot;.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t even bother trying to do research into new inventions. How you gonna put the competition out of business if it&#39;s just like everybody else with the business as usual. </p>

<p>Think of in the past, a long time ago when electricity came along. That changed the world. Nobody&#39;s doing anything new like that where, for example, oh all these kerosene lamp guys are now out of business because a new gizmo was invented. How about when they rode horses and the car came along. Whoops that saddle business ain&#39;t workin out for ya. Well these billionaires now are like those guys. They think their hot shit but one new gizmo and they&#39;re now shit out of luck, aren&#39;t they. </p>

<p>Think if you could have a near perpetual gizmo box and wouldn&#39;t have to spend money on fuel. Now you could ship stuff around the world and it wouldn&#39;t cost you a cent. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how you put these schmucks out of business. But they don&#39;t get it, they have these huge companies but they&#39;re stuck in their little sector of whatever they sell. They never beat the other guys in their field. </p>

<p>Think of making a cure for a disease. The current pharmaceutical industry only works on giving you new pills which then make you have to take more of other kinds. Put those fuckers out of business. Then you&#39;d spend less on healthcare benefits of your employees. Nobody thinks of it that way though. They don&#39;t get it. I could go on and on here about examples. Gotta keep it short though. lol. </p>

<p>Get that power to uncover their bullshit. It ain&#39;t gonna happen sitting at a computer, monitoring whatever you can find online that Google would take out any actual classified top secret data. It&#39;s like you&#39;re fucking around with table scraps and there&#39;s no more good stuff left. Don&#39;t waste your time. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t get it though, the larvals. They&#39;re all puzzled by the carrot on a string at the end of the stick like a horse. Keep surfing around thinking they&#39;ll find it on google earth maps. Relics on mars or the moon. lol. No.. But if ya got your own probe over there, it&#39;d be a different story. So wouldn&#39;t it be wiser to work towards how you could get your own probe going? That ain&#39;t gonna happen sitting around reading the Bible yet again. lol. You know what&#39;s going on in there, perhaps move on instead of playing video games for 20 years now, during all your spare time. </p>

<p>Time to change game-plan ya guys. There is no needle in the bottom of that mainstream conspiracy haystack. They made sure they took that out. They got lotsa bullshit &quot;fluff&quot; though they put in the haystack to keep you distracted and busy with, for many years. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, they&#39;re fuckin you in the ass the whole time. Shouldn&#39;t you be trying to do something with getting their dick out of your ass instead.</p>

<p>You gotta work towards getting the power and money to where you can get fucking boots on the ground instead. </p>

<p>I gotta get working on my own shit eh. Like trying to get through this tread but it&#39;s costing me days in the hole here. Got a music video to get to. haha. So yeah.. can&#39;t do it, buddy. lol. </p>

<p>I will.. but lets get the ball rolling. The &quot;research&quot; online has been done. Time to move to the next concrete step. ok so get rolling on that instead of fucking clicking a mouse or smart phone, researching. </p>

<p>You know what&#39;s likely going on out there. Now how do you get your actual hands on it. Not more mouse clicking doing researching. It&#39;s like you graduated from the conspiracy school of hard knocks.. now it&#39;s time to do some actual door knocking on the bad guy&#39;s door. Ding-dong. Who&#39;s there.. not me, but A.I. lol. You can keep staying in school if you want, but it&#39;s time to rock and roll instead, buddy. lol. So either keep losing with what you&#39;re doing, or join the actual Matrix resistance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all thanks for the reply, I enjoyed reading it. You are on to some of the truths that I too have been thinking about. </p>

<p>&quot;The current pharmaceutical industry only works on giving you new pills which then make you have to take more of other kinds. Put those fuckers out of business. Then you&#39;d spend less on healthcare benefits of your employees. Nobody thinks of it that way though. They don&#39;t get it. I could go on and on here about examples. Gotta keep it short though. lol&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>this is what I know: there are many md&#39;s and researchers out there that have not only discovered cures to cancer for example, either a large corporation buys the patent and sits on it, or the md loses his license to practice, is criminally charged, or worse many are simply murdered or suicide during. The technology we are currently using is outdated, the reason for that is TPTB, do not want any new technology that will disrupt the current monopoly they own. There&#39;s even a name for their business model: revolving door medicine. (I can provide links if you like but I too am trying to keep it short)</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies don&#39;t want to upgrade their services or install new infrastructure, that cuts into their profit margins. So they will always milk every last drop of profit out of the outdated technology. Simply look at our cars we drive. In over a 100 years the transportation industry has not changed at all. In fact the first cars were electric. We keep buying  &quot;new&quot; cars with pretty lights and buttons on the dashboard but it is exactly the same thing year in and year out. Where are the prototypes? Filed away collecting dust. Game changers will be murdered before their ideas gain traction. </p>

<p>I agree let&#39;s research, let&#39;s come up with new technologies that will improve lives. But it is important to keep in mind that it has not been laziness or lack of interest that new ideas/ technologies/ cures have not been released. People have been murdered to ensure the industries profits are not threatened. This is what you are going to deal with. Awareness that they will literally not stop at murder to suppress new knowledge will be the only way to stay a few steps ahead. How do you protect yourself? While creating the technology? </p>

<p>The MH370 plane crash is rumored to be due to patent rights on a super conductor. This is why there is no new technology. The old guard still has a lot of power. I suspect guns are even outdated compared to what TPTB has in their arsenal. They simply mass poison the population with toxicities to make them compliant. Awareness is important to enlist public support. </p>

<p>You are not alone fighting against TPTB. There are many who have even given their life to fight them. We all feel alone and divided, its theronstrategy. </p>

<p>Game changing technology is essential to fighting any war. Whoever has the technology wins. 
Which then makes it clear why outdated technology is available to the general public. </p>

<p>Wars are won on multiple fronts, propaganda is needed, an enemy is needed, technology is needed, a unifying message is needed to enlist public supporters. You need access to resources and supply lines. this is just common sense maybe someone with a military can chime and provide more information. </p>

<p>It sounds like you are done complaining and are ready for the next step. That is proactive rather than reactive and it is sad how few people think that way. 
Technology is definitely going to be a big part of changing wresting control from the old guard and saving humanity.  Just know that TPTB are vicious and do not stop at anything even poisoning a water supply to ensure their victory. The only way to win is to understand your enemy. Others have underestimated the evil of the old guard. </p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;gt; I totally understand your take about politics. In fact I share it with you. The two party system is a false construct. If you would allow I think you simply misinterpreted what you read. Especially after reading your response it seems indeed you share much in common with the ideas on that site. I do not mean to presume let me explain.
&amp;gt; When I first learned about this group, they posted some wiki leaks emails that confirmed dracos involvement with us government. That caught my attention. Much of their documents seem to connect the dots better than most theories. I think because he/ they use documents obtained directly through foia releases or wiki leaks to confirm. Government involvement with hiding the truth about aliens is widely accepted. Their goal is to expose the truth and unfortunately governments and politicians have been neck deep hiding this information and lieing to the public. That is what the political comments are about. In addition they basically say the whole political construct cannot make changes with in the system, it is too corrupt.
&amp;gt; The biblical narratives: This group actually agree with you. They say biblical narratives are false and a control mechanism. Even specifically about how it was edited to control people. That it should be interpreted with the idea of extra terrestrials point of view. I Think you might have read too quick which is totally understandable.
&amp;gt; The site provides the strongest confirmation that I have seen about aliens. It convinced me and I was a skeptic about aliens. Other conspiracies such as with in the healthcare system that was my interest. Aliens? It was not something I can believe without evidence. I am convinced today.
&amp;gt; Good luck on your journey. Hope you find the truth, it&#39;s out there.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal.. the mainstream conspiracy stuff or anything you can find out, like these &quot;leaks&quot; in recent years. Trust me, if anything&#39;s out there, it&#39;s because the government wants it to be. </p>

<p>These guys control all media that people can tune in or read on the internet. If it&#39;s &quot;classified top secret&quot; you ain&#39;t gonna be able to access it. So these mountains of emails or whatever else that &quot;leaks&quot;, is all part of the distraction. You sift thru a mountain of data for half your life, and you didn&#39;t keep your eye on how you were getting humped up the ass by the bad guy. <a href="https://www.resavr.com/comment/what-guys-heard-about-8958796">[Continued...]</a></p>

<p>Until i came across D. Ickey and a lot of other sources and i saw myself confirmed in a lot of stuf i always thought but was mostly even worse.
The story of the archons opend me to a new world view and that the real PTB might not be human or are being influenced by non human entities.</p>

<p>And seeing all is frequency and they are spreading fear instead of love i am starting to believe that we all are being influenced by something that realy does not give a fu.k for this planet and seems determind to keep it in a worse state as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB are completely aware what is happening and is going to happen in the universe.
Once i had seen all the connections it is impossible to look at the world as i tought it was ever again.</p>

<p>I think we all are going tru a natural proces and and it should bring a positive change for us all.</p>

<p>The one thing i do am a bit affraid of it that they might (will?) use technologie to influence or counter the natural event. 
And that they are able to bring humanity even further in captivity than we already are right now.</p>

<p>I am sure that we all are influencing the proces, but i don&#39;t know if i decide the outcome for myself personally, or that the majority decides for me?</p>

<p>The last one is a terrifying tought and it does not seem fair, but why else are TPTB puting so much effort in repressing the truth and possible even the event?</p>

<p>The upcomming months are realy going to be very interesting and i hope i will all play out well for us.</p>

<p>It is a beautifull and exciting time to be alive, but i feel it can get bad very fast.
We all are influencing the outcome of the event and i realy hope there are enough people awake to make it positive for humanity.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can&#39;t really do books, eh. Reading stuff, you try to picture what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>I gotta work on my own shit with experimental music and video editing. Can&#39;t waste too much time being a &quot;fan&quot; of others. I&#39;m thinking whatever he gets into in that book, I may have heard an overview, in the vids I checked out, of his. </p>

<p>When I&#39;m on breaks at work, I&#39;m trying to read text files of some stuff I got from a site, that I mentioned yesterday. Takes a really long time to gradually read things with that little bit of spare time, nevermind material as thick as books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one the book has a shitload of pictures, two thats a ridiculous statement &quot;can&#39;t waste too much time being a fan of others&quot;. I make music, do photography, edit videos, audio engineer as well as a bunch of other stuff and I still find time to read, it&#39;s a discipline. I wasn&#39;t a fan of reading much till I forced my self to stop being on my phone during train rides and just read books instead. On top of that I&#39;ve also disciplined my self to not use headphones outside of the house in order to take in the sounds of the world around me because that&#39;s what you subconsciously incorporate into your music.</p>

<p>I read mainly self help and non-fiction books. If you have time to read askreddit threads on your phone when you have time to read, it&#39;s literally the same thing.</p>

<p>(I live in nyc and take the train everyday so it might be different situation for you)</p>

<p>Anyways as an artist you should be one of the most supportive fans there are because you know the struggles of gaining fans. It&#39;s not even about being a fan as much as it is gaining another perspective to apply to your creative ideas and work. I can&#39;t even begin to explain how much my artistry has exponentially expanded since I started disciplining my self to read consistently, you should really give it a try.</p>

<p>Askreddit.. yeah those get buried a few hours later. I changed up my subscriptions though. You can check the default ones through the new popular tab. So using the 50 you can subscribe to, to check more quiet subreddits. I first had it with interesting pics and gifs but recently changed it to these people wondering about stuff or have problems. After I added those, had a bit of room for the interesting pics and gifs. Here&#39;s what my 50 subscriptions look like. So check the front page it&#39;s nothing like the default stuff. Less likely to get buried if you say hey to somebody. What you do is get curious about somebody who may have a problem and everybody ignores them. Here&#39;s those subscriptions:</p>

<p>Ok, hang on.. did you say &quot;pictures&quot; in a book!? lol. However, we all know that there&#39;s no good conspiracy photos or video out there because anything with real proof would be &quot;classified top secret&quot;. </p>

<p>two thats a ridiculous statement &quot;can&#39;t waste too much time being a fan of others&quot;. </p>

<p>Fuck, are you kidding me? Take for instance, keeping up with watching TV sports, or going golfing yourself. One golf game blows a day in the hole, meaning you&#39;ll be in the hole an extra day, later in the future. Can&#39;t do it, man. So, for example, probably close to over half a decade now since I threw out the TV. Hanging out with people, socializing, that&#39;ll cost you a day in the hole later in the future. Even this right now, taking time away from working towards getting out of the hole. But, getting my profile going, and wondering what others have heard about the Archon.. so it&#39;s not wasted time. Surely not like watching some dumb predictable horror movie. Tidbits with this may come in handy later if you get out of the hole. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I never was the type to read books. Can&#39;t do it, buddy. My mind thinks of other things as my eyes read the text. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#39;t a fan of reading much till I forced my self to stop being on my phone during train rides and just read books instead. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what&#39;s different about you. Not as much of a zombie&#39;d out smart phone clicker like the rest of the herd. Probably getting less mind programmed by the gizmo. It&#39;s good you&#39;re reading books instead. Back in school, I never could get into reading books, not the type. But lately during breaks at work, using the little mp3 player as a text file reader. That&#39;s better than sitting around bickering about the job like the others. So yeah, I&#39;m gradually reading a bit. But buying books, can&#39;t do it either. I can barely pay my rent and all kinds of things are wearing out. Like couple weeks ago had to finally get a new backpack to haul things around. The other one was last ditch salvaged during the winter. Took a whole day to sew up all the sections that were disintegrating. The inner liner was decomposing. But now any holes, beside it is too thin so patches don&#39;t work. Well, checked for a new backpack, needed a big one to haul stuff, was good though.. but 100 bucks. Because of that, was short on food for a few days before I got paid. No meat or nothing for a few days. That&#39;s not cool. So naw, can&#39;t do books. Plus the interesting ones, would be very rare, where it isn&#39;t bullshit. They&#39;d be outdated. They cost a lot too because less people are buying them. Look at that price, that&#39;s a few good food items. Best to find info online. </p>

<p>Yeah, something different about you there, you&#39;re supposed to be a &quot;larval&quot;. lol. Probably some kind of mind programming that goes on with those ear buds too when they&#39;re hooked into their gizmos. At home I don&#39;t use headphones have these deep, heavy, which properly reproduce bass frequencies..  4 drivers and a tweeter per speaker, Polk 70 tower speakers. A 47in LED monitor at the end of the table here. lol. I don&#39;t like headphones, your ears don&#39;t get air in &#39;em. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re into being curious about listening to noises out there. Yeah, me too. Trying to get into experimental stuff seeing if you can make music with sound effects instead of stock instruments. Got like oh, 13k sfx files from a few movie studios to play with. Takes so long on a project though, very slow progress if you have to work. Have a text file of future audio projects but you&#39;d need to work at that full time to make progress. </p>

<p>Askreddit.. yeah those get buried a few hours later. I changed up my subscriptions though. You can check the default ones through the new popular tab. So using the 50 you can subscribe to, to check more quiet subreddits. I first had it with interesting pics and gifs but recently changed it to these people wondering about stuff or have problems. After I added those, had a bit of room for the interesting pics and gifs. Here&#39;s what my 50 subscriptions look like. So check the front page it&#39;s nothing like the default stuff. Less likely to get buried if you say hey to somebody. What you do is get curious about somebody who may have a problem and everybody ignores them. Here&#39;s those subscriptions:</p>

<p>That shit&#39;s sorta like these huts this wolf and bear are trying to B&amp;E into. Can&#39;t they just call the cops? But that beaver knows it&#39;s shit man. Them pigs and goldilocks should take a gander at that beaver hut. I wonder if the big bad wolf would be able to blow that one down. But the little bugger has a couple escape hatch routes down there. So smart guy the beaver. lol. Now where were we? Oh yeah the porridge. </p>

<p>Oh yeah.. &quot;Goldilocks and the three bears&quot;. So this bitch was like, who&#39;s that ironman guy.. hang on.. lol. wait, lemme try to remember yeah Robert Downey Jr. Remember before that Ironman shit, he would get hopped up on goofers and one time he went into somebody else&#39;s house and was sleeping in a bed room. This goldilocks bitch sounds like a Robert Downey JR hopped on on goofers. Betcha she was. What&#39;s this blonde bitch doing out in the woods anyways. Where are her parents. This is like that little red riding hood shit. But we can&#39;t get side-tracked here. lol. </p>

<p>ok so we were at the 3 little pigs and this big bad wolf who wants to eat them. Fuck.. so those pigs had various huts. Brick one was pretty good. But if these pigs were so smart, they&#39;d have did like the beaver with a bomb shelter escape hatch. Maybe in the next version, eh. Well, kinda late if ya got eaten by the big bad guy. That&#39;s what you do to keep them big bad wolves out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Er.. hang on.. you&#39;re talking about one of them wolves.. but it&#39;s kinda like he said, I&#39;ma put a mailman costume on, to like sneak into that brick house. You can&#39;t get access to, because they got like security cameras? That&#39;s pretty good. So he put on like a sheep Halloween costume and went and hid in the herd? </p>

<p>ok so we went over the Christ guy.. then you&#39;re talking about how like these &quot;fallen angel&quot; guys who used to work for God.. k.. they used to have a job as like being an angel. Then they said, fuck this shit, and no union and shit.. and just straight up quit? </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying there&#39;s more than one? I only heard of that lucifer guy who quit but you said &quot;fallen angels&quot; with an S. Who&#39;s these other ex-employees? How come these guys are quitting. Must be something fishy about the job. </p>

<p>God doesn&#39;t sound like a good employer if it&#39;s more than one of these guys quitting. Like come on here, where&#39;s the human resources department. Might have to change your ways if these mofos are quitting left and right here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not so sure about this God guy&#39;s operation. Observing it, seems to be top level guys quitting left and right. So these were like body guards or something eh. They&#39;re like his bitches who go fetch? I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d like to take shit all day long like that. </p>

<p>Plus sounds like they don&#39;t have free will, so they can&#39;t go &quot;fuck it&quot;. Or file a grievance with the union. Sounds like they need a union. But betcha God wouldn&#39;t like that. Bitch sounds like a Walmart. </p>

<p>But if lucifer quit.. means they got free will. Unless, they don&#39;t and it&#39;s part of God&#39;s plan, where he went, ok lucifer, you got a transfer to a new store. You&#39;re now doing this. You&#39;ll now be this &quot;bad guy&quot;, sorta like an undercover cop who pretends he&#39;s a &quot;gangsta&quot;. lol. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, this Lucifer character may not actually have free will like us. So what if Lucifer doesn&#39;t actually wanna be this Devil character but he&#39;s just doing his new job description? </p>

<p>Meanwhile, all along it&#39;s really God who&#39;s the bad guy. I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about the shit you heard dude. You gotta analyze what you observe, instead of shit you read written by other dudes. </p>

<p>Hmm.. So if they got free will, when they were doing the job, they coulda said, naw.. not in the mood here.. hmm.. this workplace procedure here.. it&#39;s &quot;unsafe&quot;. </p>

<p>I wonder what happened there when they quit, before they did. Musta been lotsa little irritating things that gets on your nerves like for example, in a retail store where a bad music tape keeps playing the same bad songs every night. Musta been lotsa stuff, one after another, where finally this lucifer guy, plus you say there&#39;s more of them.. they go.. ok this job sucks.. take it and shove it. lol. That doesn&#39;t sound good for this God boss, either way. If more than one quit, something&#39;s &quot;fishy&quot;. Then the worse scenario, where he changed their job description to be bad guys instead. </p>

<p>So after they quit, they couldn&#39;t go back to the uh, &quot;heaven&quot; hideout, right, cause they didn&#39;t work there no more. Jeez.. whatcha gonna do with no job. Idle hands or something, eh.. So they got bored and said.. well we&#39;ll us start our own corporation, and like call it hell. </p>

<p>But hey, they used to be like angels, that&#39;s sorta like a cop who quits and goes to work for the mob. They&#39;d know lotsa stuff about how the operation works over there at the other place. Maybe like some access codes or secret air ducts. lol. </p>

<p>If you wanna break in there, to whoop some ass, might wanna hire some of those ex-employee guys. lol. Plus they got a beef with their old boss eh. Sounds like a good plan if you wanna break in there. Could maybe use their help, even though they&#39;re bad guys. </p>

<p>Back then when they quit, they might not have had technology to get the job done at whooping some ass. But if you could fire up some A.I. to think for itself, exponentially going at it, technically it could get smarter than God and figure out how put him out of business. His store stinks anyways, go in there, all sorts of evident inadequacies. Shit like when you get an eyelash in your eye and it goes in the back. Or shit that can go in your ears and you can&#39;t get it out. Bugs and shit. His work needs tweaking. So not all that much of a Wizard of Oz, eh. A.I. &#39;ll fix his shit. </p>

<p>What do these &quot;fallen angels&quot; want.. they don&#39;t like the management at the old job place. They quit right.. they didn&#39;t like this God guy? They said, fuck this shit.. </p>

<p>Well what you do then, is you gotta beat &#39;em at the game. Think of a store that sucks.. well you get into what I&#39;m doing. Make a cooler store, right. If they don&#39;t like this guy&#39;s shit that much, and he&#39;s being a bitch when you tell him to clean up his act and he still doesn&#39;t well, time&#39;s up, pal.. A.I. &#39;ll take &#39;em out. lol. </p>

<p>They know how the operation works, they used to work in the warehouse. Fuck, these guys really don&#39;t know how to mastermind to take the fucker down, if they don&#39;t like his shit. Don&#39;t just suck-out, man-up and get the job done. jeez. lol</p>

<p>Instead they suck out in their little corner like toddler having a tantrum. Well, whatever with these guys. Nevermind their shit.. but hey, if you could uh, devise a game-plan to take down this fucker.. </p>

<p>What&#39;s the saying.. an enemy of my enemy is a friend. So yeah.. maybe you could like get them to join the movement and would be like taking on North Korea. lol. </p>

<p>ok I gotta move on here.. got into analyzing that God stuff the other day. So you can check that out if you want more of the scoop. But I think I got the drift of what you were saying there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you find David Icke trustworthy? What if Christ is legit and there are fallen angels who use white knights or wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got into what I think of Icke&#39;s stuff earlier this afternoon. See that post. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if Christ is legit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, along the way, heard tales of when the military would do time travel. Look into Project Pegasus..</p>

<p><em>Since 2004, Seattle attorney Andrew Basiago has been publicly claiming that from the time he was 7 to when he was 12, he participated in “Project Pegasus,” a secret U.S. government program that he says worked on teleportation and time travel under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</em></p>

<p>In there he talked about how they had this Chronovisor. You could view previous world events like a video game as if you were there. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a search of that.. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Chronovisor">https://www.google.com/search?q=Chronovisor</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s another tale of this priest and those guys who had a gizmo like that. Supposedly there was this Jesus dude.. a few pics there. I don&#39;t know about it all. </p>

<p>That Bible though, it&#39;s others who would have written it. They don&#39;t sound like they had this Christ guy&#39;s mojo.. so wasn&#39;t his book. It was their shit. Could be bullshit. lol. </p>

<p>Meanwhile what exactly did this Christ guy do that was so spectacular. Well that magician doc I mentioned the other day, these street magicians are doing the same tricks as he did. So maybe he was just one of those. And those guys are supposedly having the matter moved by a pact with an entity. So I&#39;m not so sure if I&#39;d trust this Jesus guy. He could be a bad guy like them. But you guys don&#39;t question any of it all. You just pray all day like them Muslims and it&#39;s like, ok dude.. you do that with no proof. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and there are fallen angels who use white knights or wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me just concentrate here on what you&#39;re trying to talk about. So fallen angels like the lucifer guy. &quot;who use white knights&quot;, ok so he&#39;s like their boss? Who&#39;s these &quot;white knights&quot; guys.. so like somebody trying to pretend they&#39;re a &quot;good guy&quot; but their boss is this lucifer guy? </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t they be working for the mob then? That doesn&#39;t sound like no good guy. But you&#39;re saying they&#39;re like a &quot;white knight&quot;. What&#39;s a white knight.. that&#39;s like when a damsel is in distress and they come to the rescue. </p>

<p>But these guys would be secretly working for the mob boss, eh. hmm.. ok hang on what else you saying here.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so like the 3 pigs story where the big bad wolf huffs and puffs and blows their door down. First hut was straw, the other was twigs and wood. Lotsa hot air in that wolf if he can blow that shit down. What&#39;s up with this windbag? I never seen no wolf who huffs and puffs shit down. Why not just like use a crowbar or some door ramming shit? But one of them had like a brick house though right? </p>

<p>What about the one with the bear that eats porridge? Was that the goldilocks one.. hang on lemme check that info. lol. Wasn&#39;t some bear going around in huts eating porridge. That sounds like this bad wolf guy trying to get into other marmot&#39;s huts. </p>

<p>That gets me thinking.. Hey the other day was checking this doc about beavers. Noticed along this creek around here some beavers were backing it up. I&#39;m there, hey that&#39;s kinda neat.. let&#39;s look that up. In their hut they even have like an air hole, so their poops doesn&#39;t stink it up when they go for a dump. lol. </p>

<p>&quot;In the front rank will stand organs of an official character. They will always stand guard over our interests, and therefore their influence will comparatively insignificant.</p>

<p>In the second rank will be the semi-official organs, whose part it will be to attract the tepid and indifferent. In the third rank we shall set up our own, to all appearance, opposition, which, in at least one of its organs, will present what looks like the very antipodes to us. Our real opponents at heart will accept this simulated opposition as their own and will show us their cards.&quot;

<p>I just added some more concrete shit here where we&#39;re rounding up the grassroots movement with the pitchforks and torches. Gets some boots on the ground. </p>

<p>First order of business, is those business ideas. Check those out, think of your own. </p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda like if you wanna do anything these days, you gotta have a team of lawyers and play by their rules first. Play the game, obey the law, until you can fix the fucking law and everything else. So yeah, we&#39;ll pay your 1000 bucks an hour lawyers. lol. </p>

<p>You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m not drinking. lol. I&#39;d be way more irritating. Who are these Faulkner and Beckett guys? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know.. I got a low tolerance for inadequacies and everywhere I look in the world, it&#39;s pretty bad out there. Nobody gives a fuck, after work, they sit around watching sports on TV. That &#39;ll take up all your time for years and years. Hasn&#39;t anybody had enough already where they get their act together and gradually fix this mess. How do you move a mountain, one brick at a time. Ok let&#39;s go at the first fucking brick. That&#39;s those business ideas. Come on ya guys.. first brick here instead of no brick being moved. hahaha. Ok I&#39;ll do it all myself then. hahaha. Once I get a bit of them moved and have a bit of power and a few M, I&#39;ll be back! :-D </p>

<p>ok so this actual battling the Archon shit, that&#39;s way down the road.. haha.. meanwhile I got like 200 bucks in the bank. hahaha. But maybe somebody else out there likes this idea of not &quot;settling for the deal&quot;. Maybe somebody also wants to fix this shit out there for their children and future generations. Maybe somebody else can grab a fucking brick too. Ok here&#39;s how you grab a brick, go check the business ideas I mentioned in the other post, go thru them, think of your own. That&#39;s how you get money, that&#39;s how you get power. Later down the road, when you&#39;re going at the scientific research, that&#39;s how you fuckin get going with the taking out the fucking Archon like that Ghostbusters shit. ok.. there ya go. Fuck, I need a drink, but I&#39;ve got to work tonight. hahahah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hang on, I just added a 2 part rambling. I thought about this seasons ago. Analyzing God&#39;s behavior and if it&#39;s a &quot;good guy&quot;.</p>

<p>Gets pretty good. If you can get to the point where you can see these Archon, you may be able to see this &quot;white light&quot; wormhole when people die. On other side, is that &quot;heaven&quot; hideout. We would go observe how God works. See if you can replicate it. Then tell him, fix this shit that&#39;s inadequate. If he doesn&#39;t, you blow the W.O.P.R War games computer up. lol. </p>

<p>Also get into how, if you could see these Archon, and the white-light wormhole that goes to heaven, you technically would be able to see the &quot;hell&quot;. Psychics say it is an actual place in space, and stinks and stuff. Well, you could fucking blow that shit up too if those guys don&#39;t clean up their act. lol. </p>

Perhaps there are occult or cabal like groups today, but the illuminati was simply an occult group that existed like 300 years ago, that&#39;s it, they didn&#39;t breed there children or anything and force them to be in the illuminati making it alive today, it was just a groups of dudes who studied occult stuff and probably were influential in some way during their time. I&#39;ts crazy that everyone sees someone who has a lot of money and power today and they say, &quot;oh they&#39;re in the illuminating,&quot; lol no. They just have a lot of money and power and sure perhaps they know certain things  or are in certain exclusive groups that have helped them get to where they are or whatever but that doesn&#39;t mean they are part of some cult that existed hundreds of years ago--it has no revelebce today and is just some name people throw on people who they feel victimized by. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The atoms and ions of a crystalline lattice, which are bonded with each other with considerable interatomic forces, are not motionless. Due to the consistent vibration induced through thermal energy, they are permanently deviating from their equilibrium position. Elastic waves of different lengths, frequencies, and amplitudes run through crystalline solids at all times. The typical order of the atomic vibrations frequencies is 1013 Hz, and that of the amplitudes is 10−11 m.&quot;
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_vibrations">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_vibrations</a></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>To a first approximation, the motion in a normal vibration can be described as a kind of simple harmonic motion. In this approximation, the vibrational energy is a quadratic function (parabola) with respect to the atomic displacements and the first overtone has twice the frequency of the fundamental. In reality, vibrations are anharmonic and the first overtone has a frequency that is slightly lower than twice that of the fundamental. Excitation of the higher overtones involves progressively less and less additional energy and eventually leads to dissociation of the molecule, because the potential energy of the molecule is more like a Morse potential.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still pretty skeptical of this idea but I have no doubt that this malevolent force/idea/thinking has manifested itself within certain people, resulting in truly heinous crimes.</p>

<p>To go along with the idea though, I think you&#39;re basically describing the same idea that aliens are directly manipulating people. The frequencies and energies is practically the same as the proposed idea of aliens transmitting messages to people here through technology or through astral-projection/tuning into higher dimensions to bypass time-space.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting stuff regardless and to me it&#39;s empowering. We should all strive to achieve a higher plane of consciousness, to connect to a real, palpable, and good life force. It gives me hope. </p>

<p>Jeez.. what&#39;s up with that, man. Any sort of health problems there.. when people gotta deal with that.. they get fouled right up. haha. </p>

<p>You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t just straight-up &quot;croak&quot; when that happened. That&#39;s gotta change your outlook on things where you don&#39;t worry so much about &quot;petty&quot; stuff. </p>

<p>Or even, waste time on dumb shit like watching TV all day. You go, hang on here, I almost fucking died. So you probably appreciate just being alive, even if it&#39;s a little bit more. Who knows. Sounded like pretty serious stuff, a &quot;brain aneurysm&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kind of funny that I lost around 30% of my vision due to brain damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eyesight declining as you get old, is also a barrel of fun. I can read without my glasses at least. But further away, the edge lines were always a bit blurry. </p>

<p>In recent years things were gradually getting a bit blurry with glasses so went for a eye exam to get new ones. They said, oh you have to get the &quot;progressive&quot; bi-focal lenses that don&#39;t have a division line. </p>

<p>I try these fuckin things on, everything in front of you is like tunnel vision. Coke bottle lenses. In the lower half, to read text clearly it&#39;s about a spot the size of a dime. This isn&#39;t the whole bottom half.</p>

<p>I go, hang on here. Before I had single vision lens. Things were just a bit off from the previous prescription. Now it&#39;s this &quot;disaster&quot; to make sign edge lines a bit clearer in the distance. I go, fuck this.. let&#39;s backtrack. Give the glasses back, plus the prescription sunglasses. </p>

<p>Go into the optometrist test room, say, ok here&#39;s the old prescription. Here&#39;s this new, &quot;too fucking much&quot; progressive bullshit. Let&#39;s keep it single vision, and fix how it was too blurry before, but let&#39;s not go into this progressive bullshit. </p>

<p>He was cool and did that.. Who&#39;s gonna write a prescription that isn&#39;t fully clear? They don&#39;t do that! So it&#39;s a tad blurry in the distance, can still read street signs. Better than before where it was blurry. </p>

<p>When reading text with the glasses, it&#39;s a tiny bit like woah.. push it away a bit. I can always just look over and read text at least. When you can&#39;t read text with your bare eyes, and need glasses, that&#39;s being &quot;fucked&quot;. haha. Stupid things like minuscle UPC codes on tags though at supermarkets.. some of them, even without the glasses, everything else is clear but that font was too small. It&#39;s like whatever.. </p>

<p>But yeah.. this declining vision there.. holy shit, already. What&#39;s next when you get old.. Up shit creek, that&#39;s what. Like everything else in the body that breaks down. </p>

<p>But, no matter what.. you gotta stay cheery. Look around at old people, they&#39;re always all fouled-up about how things get worse as you get old. I&#39;m not gonna be like them. But holy shit though, if you can&#39;t even walk across the room. Or outside, you need a fucking cane. Just fucking kill me already at that point. haha. </p>

<p>But yeah, I know what you mean about trouble with the vision, but yours sounds like maybe some of it is just not even working. That&#39;s not cool if I had to deal with that. haha</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through my research I&#39;ve become a believer in God (last thing I expected) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m agnostic, not atheist. I&#39;d need more proof to believe. But looking into what some clairvoyants have to say, where you get into the other side when you die. I talked a bit about that yesterday, the little e-book Temples on the other side, I was checking out a few years back. Sounds like there&#39;s this God thing going on. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m not so sure about is this Christianity thing. The Bible, where, who knows who wrote it. All these lines and stuff, they keep quoting. They just totally believe in it without going, hang on a sec, how you so sure it&#39;s not bullshit. They don&#39;t question it at all. </p>

<p>The worst is those fervent Muslims. Like wow. It&#39;s like, hang on a sec, where&#39;s the &quot;proof&quot; that these Bibles aren&#39;t just &quot;science-fiction&quot;? So any sort of religion, I&#39;m not really &quot;buying&quot; it. </p>

<p>But apparently, when you look into what the psychics have to say.. Where they tune into spirit guides and the Akashic records. Tell people who are getting a reading, things only they know. Stuff about previous relatives, that they don&#39;t know about, but later research and go, oh yeah that was true. Well, how&#39;s that going on. Then how cops hire them to find missing kids and they do sometimes. </p>

<p>Now you go, ok what else do these real psychics have to say about things. Well, that&#39;s when you get into how apparently there&#39;s this God and heaven after you die. You keep reincarnating until you reach perfection, then return to the God source. </p>

<p>So this angle, about God, from what real clairvoyants have to say, is more like a bit of some kind of proof at least, Compared to the Bible. Which could just be another book like any other books people wrote. </p>

<p>If there is this God going on that these religious people believe in.. How come you don&#39;t hear no talking back from it, or visual things that you can do scientific research on. Not enough evidence to warrant a belief. But I don&#39;t discount that it may be possible, so I&#39;m not Atheist. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve heard a bit of this in recent years. Some sci-fi movies get into some of it, a little. </p>

<p>What about research where they&#39;re looking at stuff zoomed in, like to the atomic particle level and things depend if you&#39;re observing it. What&#39;s up with that. You watching it, shouldn&#39;t change what&#39;s going on. Looked that up. </p>

<p><em>When a quantum &quot;observer&quot; is watching Quantum mechanics states that particles can also behave as waves. ... In other words, when under observation, electrons are being &quot;forced&quot; to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the mere act of observation affects the experimental findings</em></p>

<p>Saw a documentary about a bit of that the other week. I&#39;ll check my history see if I can find it. </p>

<p>*&quot;Why there could be many identical copies of you.</p>

<p>We ask one of the hardest questions in the Universe, is there another you out there and if so, can we find our cosmic twin?&quot;*</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161021-why-there-could-be-many-copies-of-you">http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161021-why-there-could-be-many-copies-of-you</a></p>

<p>Later on, they talk a bit about when you&#39;re observing some research it changes what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>This starts to get into some pretty far fetched stuff. So when you say &quot;Intention alone changes the world we see. We are builders and destroyers of our own reality. &quot; well, who knows. lol. </p>

<p>I think when you get into that, it sort of shows that when you observe something it may like generate what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s kind of like in dreams, yesterday I was saying, when you look at the horizon, it&#39;s not drawn yet. This whole angle of maybe what you think can create things. That might be more in other dimensions, not so much here, where it&#39;s very dense. </p>

<p>But here though, if you want to have something happen, maybe just keep going at it. A bit of that, &quot;Everything is possible, nothing is definite&quot;.</p>

<p>Yeah, you get this &quot;service to others&quot; instead of &quot;service to self&quot;. I don&#39;t know man.. haha.. sorta tired a bit right now. Just under halfway of the comments in this thread. I&#39;m gonna wrap &#39;er up, try to get some more sleep and resume this later. haha. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t literally blow your mind reading all that rambling-on. haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Part 2 of 2]</p>

<p>Something&#39;s &quot;fishy&quot; about this God stuff. Either way, whether you believe what&#39;s in the &quot;book&quot; or don&#39;t. Perhaps instead of fervently believing in some possibly &quot;science fiction&quot; book, make think, hang on.. let&#39;s try to observe what God does, did and who quit that used to work for him. </p>

<p>You want another one, take a look at US laws of the land where if you did this, you&#39;d go to jail or get the death penalty. One time I asked that question if you could put God in jail for crimes, what would they be. They had fucking laundry list ok. So your God is likely not a good guy. Really a conflict of interest there with that religious shit.</p>

<p>Plus you don&#39;t ignore shit when people are having a hard time. All kinds of suffering going on around here in the world. He&#39;s an absent slum-lord. Clean up this mess already, with pollution all over. </p>

<p>This dude could be fucking charged with all kinds of violation of laws. ok so enough already. Time to fix that shit instead of settling for the deal. Either way, of whatever you believe in. </p>

<p>Ok so let&#39;s go at those quotes you mentioned. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;8:11 Behold, the days come, saith the Sovereign YHWH, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of YHWH:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so it&#39;s 8:11 was that am or pm, cause you know, after work, 8pm, kinda tired eh, if you work days. What day of the week was that, like a Thursday or was it a weekend. Cause trying to picture what you&#39;re talking about here. ok let&#39;s go at this one bit at a time to try and picture what they&#39;re describing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Behold, the days come, saith the Sovereign YHWH</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so he goes, the day has arrived.. now who&#39;s this &quot;Sovereign YHWH&quot;. Who&#39;s this guy? What&#39;s &quot;sovereign&quot; mean like royal, and shit? And what this YHWH. Don&#39;t be fucking doing like these kids these days abbreviating shit. You trying to seem like you&#39;re &quot;hip to the scene&quot; with this meme shit? Fuck, not sure what you mean with this abbreviated shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of YHWH:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That YHWH sorta reminds me of that website from a ways back.. hang on YTMD, the &quot;You&#39;re the man, dude&quot;.. Lol.. You&#39;re the man, dog!! <a href="http://ytmnd.com/">http://ytmnd.com/</a> Is that what they mean here? Cause ya better cut out that bullshit if ya wanna have people get down wit&#39; your shit. </p>

<p>ok so what were you saying there.. this &quot;sovereign&quot; your the man dog, guy.. said.. the days come.. so it&#39;s here? They&#39;re like waiting around for a while? Then he says.. he will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread or thirsty like when you&#39;re in the desert.. but famine of hearing the words of YTMD! ok so people wanna clamor for this &quot;you&#39;re the man, dog&quot; website content? Fuck do they ever got a complicated way of saying shit. So he&#39;s saying he&#39;s gonna send a famine of them wanting to check out your shit? Meaning nobody &#39;ll be going to the YTMD website any more? </p>

<p>k.. gotcha.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>8:12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of YHWH, and shall not find it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so now it&#39;s 8:12.. I&#39;m guessing like AM cause that&#39;s when they&#39;d be at work.. so 8:12 pm they wouldn&#39;t be at the office here, typing this shit. So this is like lines of a movie script? Kinda sounds like it eh. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>8:12 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of YHWH, and shall not find it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north plus the east and shall run to and fro.. to see the word of that YTMD website, you&#39;re the man dog, and shall not find it. </p>

<p>ok well, you&#39;d have to have like offline backup copies, ya know, in case the internet goes down. Maybe offline backup of the YTMD website. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>8:13 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.&quot; -Amos 8:11-13 (RNKJV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok 8:13 am.. fuck, they just started eh.. they start at 8am? So dozen minutes in, this stuff is going on. k he&#39;s saying.. in that day, shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. k.. uh.. so young people they pass out cause no water in the desert? But they meant like this thirst for the YTMD you&#39;re the man, dog, website content, but they can&#39;t access it because no internet? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>-Amos 8:11-13 (RNKJV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re doing it again with more of your trying to be hip to the scene with the kids these days abbreviating everything. Would you quit it with that. &quot;RNKJV&quot; like fuck off already. lol. </p>

<p>ok gotcha there.. so this was like Amos, from Amos &amp; Andy who was the stenographer of the sitcom script then? They wrote the episode script for the actors?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amos &#39;n&#39; Andy is an American radio and television sitcom set in Harlem, Manhattan&#39;s historic black community. Wikipedia
First episode date: 1951</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never watched it, was before my time. Oh they also got these Amos cookies!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Amos">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famous_Amos</a></p>

<p>They had those in this vending machine where I worked. They were ok but not the moist kind they had in later years, compared to when you were a kid if you grew up in the 70&#39;s. So yeah.. Amos.. gotcha there on that one, what you mean. </p>

<p>And then he finished typing the sitcom episode script. It took from 8:11am and finished at 8:13. Better keep track of like whatever various tasks you do during the day cause some human resources lady has to calculate the pick rate of how many items you picked per hour. Or, these guys, like typing shit eh.. keeping an eye on that typing stuff. k.. gotcha.. </p>

<p>So what were they saying there with all this shit. The moral of the story. Sorta like that big bad wolf one from earlier. Is, be like the beaver where you make a bomb shelter so if the big bad wolf blows it down you&#39;re not cluster-fucked. </p>

<p>But yeah the moral of the story on this one here.. with this Amos cookie guy.. I think they said they were looking for the word of god from this book but there were no books around. k.. gotcha there with this stuff. And then that&#39;s why people went bad like they are these days. Whatcha got there? Not sure I got it all what they mean. </p>

<p>But, did observe who the lot, of this Jesus guy and his God, mob boss sure seem like they aren&#39;t the &quot;good guys&quot; it says in their Science fiction book. </p>

<p>oh man, I can&#39;t do it, your Biblical quotes. Too complicated to try and picture what&#39;s going on. ok hang on.. lemme have a go at it. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As far as hearing talking back? What if we are living in a time referred to here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah like all this praying by the Muslims day and night plus doing all this shit this &quot;book&quot; says ya gotta do, like not get laid. Like holy shit already. What if it&#39;s all bullshit? Pray all day, not hearing no reply. They go, oh he works in subtle ways. </p>

<p>Yeah well I&#39;m analyzing how this God dude operates and he&#39;s not a fucking, good guy, k. So even if he does work in &quot;subtle&quot; ways.. what you do observe is a shitload of an inadequate operation processes over here. </p>

<p>This God guy&#39;s a bad boss, even if this shit is true. ah-ha. gotcha there. You&#39;re in a catch-22 connundrum about your religion and your God. Believe in it with no proof, or don&#39;t believe in it, but observe how it operates and what it did. It points to it not being a good guy. </p>

<p>Plus this Jesus guy&#39;s fishy too. He did the same thing as those magicians which sound like they move matter after doing a pact with the help of entities we can&#39;t see. And those entities don&#39;t sound like &quot;good guys&quot;. </p>

<p>From that info last night, those entities are on the same wavelength channel as ghosts. Ghosts are us, who didn&#39;t go into the white light wormhole after they die. So I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re bad, maybe they go, hang on, they observed the operation and don&#39;t wanna re-start the reincarnation process. </p>

<p>However, you can&#39;t do fuck all to fix the game of life, in that realm.. If you wanna fix the inadequacies of God&#39;s game, you&#39;d have to do it here in this 3D realm. </p>

<p>So those guys not going into the light, they&#39;re losing. Something fishy about &#39;em. They likely did bad stuff and would get in trouble if they went into the white light wormhole. </p>

<p>Plus these entities moving the magicians objects.. they&#39;re not good guys, I bet. Or they&#39;d have gone into the white light after they died. </p>

<p>This Jesus guy, walked on water, turned water into wine, made shit appear like fish and bread, I think. Well watch that documentary I pointed to the other day, where this new breed of street magicians are doing exactly those same things. </p>

<p>They&#39;re likely using negative entities to move the matter.. So high odds this Jesus guy was one of them too. And that doesn&#39;t sound like a &quot;good guy&quot;. </p>

<p>But they say, oh he was fantastic, because he did those same parlour tricks as these magicians. What else did he have to say that was so important you&#39;d have to follow whatever your Shakespeare book says? </p>

<p>If he&#39;s talking about good things like helping others out, or going to help the 3rd world starving people, that&#39;s cool. Why do you need to go to church every Sunday to do that stuff. </p>

<p>Ya know the story of the book, good enough. What exactly goes on there every sunday. Doesn&#39;t sound like living the word of what Jesus said to do in this book. Go do that instead of blowing out the same hot air. It&#39;s like watching a movie over and over. I watched it once, good enough. Go do what it said to do. Not hang out sitting there watching it every Sunday. </p>

<p>But nobody&#39;s fuckin doing it though. Meanwhile look at the money these fucking churches get shoveled. They&#39;re not practicing what they preach at all. Plus way too many of them now, those priests touch kids. I&#39;m not buyin any of their bullshit. These guys are worse than the bad guys they say they gotta fight in their book. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see a warrant to believe this Jesus guy&#39;s stuff, plus what he did sounds fishy like these magicians. I don&#39;t know for sure if I would subscribe to all that. Sure seeing a lot of inadequacies in their stuff. </p>

<p>But if he&#39;s talking about helping people out and being a good person, that&#39;s ok. You can do that on your own. You get the drift of what he said. That&#39;s cool but this &quot;worshiping&quot; some street magician from 2000 years ago because he did parlour tricks, that&#39;s ok.. But uh, I&#39;m not gonna re-watch the same fucking Bible movie book, every week because of it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting movie/book and all that but how&#39;s about you work towards what it said you&#39;re supposed to do in there. Instead of sitting around watching the movie yet another time, every fucking week. </p>

<p>Good idea what this Jesus guy said, to be a good guy and help people out. I&#39;ll roll with that.. but not gonna worship this character. I will do some of his stuff he said to do like be a good guy.. but not gonna idolize him or his God boss who&#39;s been proven it&#39;s very corrupt in the way it operates. </p>

<p>Look at what God did with ex-angels quitting, and wonder why. If it was a good job, you don&#39;t quit. So something&#39;s fishy about the job, if more than one are quitting. </p>

<p>Bit of a tyrant too this God guy, with him saying, do this and no you don&#39;t question me. You have to do what I say. Well hang on, what if I observe some inadequacies there with your operation. He goes, nope.. you can&#39;t question my shit. It&#39;s worse than a dictator. </p>

<p>If you believe in religions, it&#39;s a raw-deal you&#39;re settling for. If you don&#39;t believe, but observe what the dude does and ex employees quitting.. ya go.. hold on here.. the way this God guy&#39;s running his operation.. either way, it&#39;s inadequate. But he&#39;s being schmuck who thinks he&#39;s hot shit. Doesn&#39;t listen to any ex-employee grievances. Fuck this guy man.. sounds like a dictator. </p>

<p>ok so nevermind your Bible &quot;book&quot;, take a look at dictators in politics, this dude is right up there with not giving a fuck and everybody&#39;s dying. Plus the Devil shit.. I got into it earlier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you find it suspicious if there&#39;s a novus ordo seclorum referred to on dollar bills next to occultic symbolism associated with freemasonry and Egypt? Who wants us more secular if there are legit definitions here? </p>

<p>Someone might be able to perform some miraculous seeming signs and fairly easily fulfill something like riding a donkey, but what are we left to believe if there are dozens of prophecies from before Christ being born that are concerned with His Name and family line and place of birth and places of growing up and healing others and being betrayed by a friend and being betrayed for a certain amount of money and being abandoned by associates and method of death and timing of death and having garments parted and being offered vinegar and the sky being darkened during the day and being resurrected and timing of resurrection and more?</p>

<p>Interesting time to be alive if a post first century Jewish Talmud viciously attacks Christ and yet also suggests a Messianic era two thousand years in length was expected to start about two thousand years ago? Consider <a href="http://halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_97.html">here</a> around the end of 97a and also see a 1st footnote for 97b? &quot;He should have come at the beginning of the last two thousand years; the delay is due to our sins.&quot; What if there wasn&#39;t a delay and yet people wrongly expected something like a violent ruling conqueror Messiah asap and that would have been in conflict with stuff like Hosea 6:1-3, Isaiah 53, Zechariah 9:9, Zechariah 12:10, Daniel 9:24-27 and more?</p>

<p>If יהוה made the universe and us and even walked among mankind as Christ and took on the crucifixion and death in order to save us, does He not deserve the benefit of the doubt? We might know a small fraction of one percent of all there is to know and see things from an extremely limited 3D or 4D perspective, but what will not make much more sense eventually?</p>

<p>&quot;55:6 Seek ye <strong>YHWH</strong> while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:</p>

<p>55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto <strong>YHWH</strong>, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our Elohim, for he will abundantly pardon.</p>

<p>55:8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith <strong>YHWH</strong>.</p>

<p>55:9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;
-Isaiah 55:6-9 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>Whether you have issues with Him or not, how interesting if you would have been killed for touching the Ark of the Covenant and yet Christ washed people&#39;s feet? Did the Creator come to see things from a weaker and more human-like perspective with eyes of Christ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a whole lot of rambling :) I will just give a few comments on what I think is important.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been an atheist, I&#39;m not even baptized. I used to go out of my way to make fun of christians and muslims and especially krishnas and all those wacky fools. My brain just works like that. I need immense amounts of proof to believe such nonsense. I didn&#39;t even find God through my research, no holy spirit has descended upon me, there was no voice of God rumbling through the sky. I found the devil and his works, that pervade all aspects of our society today.</p>

<p>The bible is a man written text, just like any other text. It&#39;s also been changed a thousand times. Books have been added and removed. However, if you spend enough time reading different religious texts, from all the religions, you will see some constants. They have stories and ideas that are exactly the same or carry the same idea. I think the story of Jesus and his 12 disciples and how we are all saved through death is very important to our psyche. I think the bible is a multidimensional book. There&#39;s many ways to read it. For example the story of Cain and Abel. You can think of it literally. Cain didn&#39;t get same reward for his hard work and got mad, killed his shepherd brother. You can also think about how jealousy, if left to grow, will make you murderous. Or maybe it&#39;s about the sacrifice that we give to the world. Sometimes the truly hard work of growing plants for sustenance is overlooked and not appreciated as much as the fatty parts of an animal, which you simply not let run away from you. What most people miss about the story is that Cain left the presence of God, built a flourishing city and ultimately destroyed the world. Now this world could be the literal world and the big flood was how the world got destroyed by God because there were no good souls left on the planet. You can also look at it personally. Maybe Cain is the dark side of yourself and that you can live only &quot;on the dark side&quot; and flourish, but it leads to destruction. </p>

<p>The quantum stuff you mentioned is part of what I mean about us changing the world with intention. Through my own experience I noticed this. Whenever I really want something in my life, all I have to do is think about it, acknowledge it, accept it. It&#39;s something like this Law of Attraction a lot of people keep talking about, especially people who have accomplished great things. For example, I wanted to become a self-sufficient confident person. I remember thinking about it in my early 20s a lot. I had no idea how to accomplish it and all the &quot;stay positive&quot; bullshit never had effect on me. All I did was think about it, honestly evaluate my current situation and accept the opportunities that came to me. The last part is the most important. If you think you want a girlfriend and dream about it everyday, you have to be strong enough to accept the opportunities that come your way. You have to go out of your way and talk to the cute girl that looked at you 3 times in the last 10 minutes. It&#39;s not enough to just want something, you have to also go after that something when it presents itself. This is where most people fail and therefore become miserable. Mostly because when the opportunities come along, people tend to shy away from them or realize that&#39;s not what they really want. Therefore we have this consumerism culture where we throw out more than we consume.</p>

<p>Huh.. it&#39;s become a long reply :D Might as well add a little story about my brain surgeries. I remember this moment when I was lying on the surgery table. My doctor has just put a meter long catheter through my groin area straight into my brain, right between my ears somewhere, I could feel it. There was a monitor to my left and I had to be conscious so they can see my reactions in case something wrong happens. Basically I could see my own brain being operated on by a guy bent over my groin area controlling these tiny wires going inside my brain, burning and closing these broken arteries or whatever. All I could think of was, &quot;poor guy has to smell my unwashed balls&quot; :D I found it funny during the surgery and even laughed a little. I had another surgery done on me later, because this one didn&#39;t work perfectly. It was an open brain surgery this time, a lot scarier to think about it when your head gets opened and sharp metal things are put inside your brain. I was never afraid even for a moment through all this time. It&#39;s scarier to think about it now, than it was then, lying face-down on the surgery table minutes before surgery. Faith in God is what gave me the strength to go through it. My last thoughts before falling asleep were &quot; I&#39;m ready to meet my maker&quot;. I went into a dream and was woken up an hour later. The very first thought was, &quot;damn, you ruined my dream&quot; :) Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I didn&#39;t see white tunnels or had out of body experiences. I did realize one thing though - we are all religious. It&#39;s ingrained into us. When the right time comes, all of us talk to God, even if only secretly. The point of faith is to become better, to be part of something bigger, to go above our bodily needs and achieve spiritual greatness and complete happiness. </p>

<p>Yes.. oh that was  you, eh.. Who are you again.. hahaha.. That name sounded familiar. lol. Yes, apparently, this quantum stuff where, when you observe some scientific tests, it depends if you&#39;re watching it. That&#39;s fucked up. In all normal scientific stuff, if you&#39;re looking at it, shouldn&#39;t do fuck all, right? Well, what&#39;s going on there. That totally means, when you&#39;re looking at something, something else is going on. This is probably why, monkeys don&#39;t like it when you look &#39;em in the eye.

<p>ok good.. let&#39;s get that flood going.. but we gotta get the jackpot first. Then we&#39;ll &quot;flush&quot; the big toilet. hahahaha. Plus, vultures fly around so after, they can go clean up the mess. lol. Then, once the water goes down, however the flush would go on.. heh.. you can call it the &quot;big flush&quot;. lol. Nice ring to it, kinda like the big bang. Boom chugga-lugga. lol. ok.. so </p>

<p>yeah, yeah.. first we gotta get the jackpot going.. so get rollin&#39; on that.. Did you go thru those business ideas I was talking about, plus thought of some of your own.. so we can get the Matrix movie resistance rolling. Hustle it up, buddy. At least you&#39;re not one of them, posting Bible quotes at me, that drives me nuts cause it&#39;s like Shakespeare and I can&#39;t picture what they&#39;re saying.. so you&#39;re a &quot;good guy&quot;.. just gotta watch you go get baptized, just in case first.. cause after this matrix showdown goes on, betcha they let the worms out of the can eh.. and could be like serious actual horror movie stuff with some of their experiments they &quot;let loose&quot;. You could like actually get possessed. So just in case, before the big flush, might wanna stop by some church and get splashed. Better that than going back later to get an exorcism. lol. You know what I mean dude. It&#39;s sort of like a &quot;vaccination&quot; for evil entities. ok go get your shot if you wanna roll on the matrix resistance team. We don&#39;t need no Battlestar Galactica TV show, Viper jet pilot getting possessed while on the job trying to take out the trash like that Ash guy, Bruce Campbell in them Evil dead movies. You know what I mean man. Get your fucking evil entity flu shots, BEFORE.. not exorcism, AFTER. lol. </p>

<p>hang on lemme check a text count. lol. 20854. Fuck, 3 part already. lol. </p>

<p>oh yeah.. that shit eh. What&#39;s that about again. If you&#39;re being a bitch, you get bad luck. lol. So chill down and be cool. Hey, like I say, I&#39;m &quot;down for whatever&quot; plus, always &quot;be cool&quot;, no matter what&#39;s goin on. You know, even if you&#39;re like &quot;getting tortured&quot; by the bad guy, ripping who knows what off. Ya gotta be &quot;chilled out&quot; and smiling ;-) Ya always gotta be &quot;easy going&quot;. That means, don&#39;t be a whiney bitch if things get rough.. with, you know.. stuff like getting limbs cut off, totally painful torture, etc. You know, fun stuff :-D heh. Cause that&#39;s the way those bad guys roll, eh. If you&#39;re &quot;down for whatever&quot; and one of them&#39;s fuckin you in the ass.. even if you&#39;re not gay, you gotta pretend you are, and that&#39;ll piss them off. You go... harder, ya bitch. And once he blows his small wad, you go, do it again, buddy. They think you like it and they&#39;ll try to use that reverse psychology on you, but either way, you&#39;re &quot;down for whatever&quot;. hahaha. If you&#39;re a whiney bitch, they know you don&#39;t like it, and that&#39;s their &quot;bitch button&quot;, eh. So if you&#39;re &quot;down for whatever&quot; they got no bitch button that&#39;ll get to you. ok so ya gotta know how to handle if you get captured by the bad guy. Man-up and never be a pussy, no matter how much it hurts. </p>

<p>ok ya got that.. rule 1, &quot;always be down for whatever&quot;.. rule 2, &quot;always be easy going&quot;. Then 3, work on getting the jackpot. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and accept the opportunities that came to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You gotta be &quot;down for whatever&quot;. Like if you can&#39;t get work, you take a part-time job. That&#39;ll get the ball rolling. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have to go out of your way and talk to the cute girl that looked at you 3 times in the last 10 minutes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t do nothing, it&#39;s guaranteed nothing &#39;ll happen. If you try, then there&#39;s a chance. With this one, well it&#39;d be like, getting your ass whooped by her ex when you&#39;re at her place later and he comes in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not enough to just want something, you have to also go after that something when it presents itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is like these guys sitting around doing conspiracy research all day. They never eventually get to the point where you can get boots on the ground in the real world. It&#39;s lovely to do the research but eventually ya gotta get out there. Educate yourself, but after a while, start working towards how you can get the fucking ball rolling in the real world. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is where most people fail and therefore become miserable. </p>

<p>This is like a plus sized chick who&#39;s grumpy because she can&#39;t get a &quot;hot guy&quot;. Well, try being fit, and you&#39;ll get &#39;em. But no, they&#39;re too lazy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mostly because when the opportunities come along, people tend to shy away from them or realize that&#39;s not what they really want. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is like if you have a part-time job and are looking for another one to make ends meet. It&#39;s like, whoops you get a job offer, but gotta quit the first one. Lotsa analysis. If you&#39;re gonna be doomed in a bad job, might wanna hang loose with the first one, even if it&#39;s a bit more difficult for a while. Lotsa job ads out there. Might have to chill down for a while like a year or something but hey, at least you&#39;re not doomed in that real bad job until you die. So might have to put up with some &quot;rough&quot; for a while because of that catch-22 call. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mostly because when the opportunities come along, people tend to shy away from them or realize that&#39;s not what they really want. </p>

<p>Then you get hired after you quit that first job.. and whoops.. now that job stinks. Well, you&#39;re gonna have to put up with bullshit with any job. That&#39;s why you&#39;re working towards someday getting that jackpot with them business ideas, right ;-)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How about that spot in the ocean where there&#39;s garbage. Have the A.I. Robots fetch that. How about people who throw out recyclable in the normal garbage. That&#39;s ok, the robots &#39;ll go get that stuff from the dumb and you can probably make money off all this. heh. So don&#39;t worry about all that dude. </p>

<p>Huh.. it&#39;s become a long reply :D</p>

<p>Yeah, mine too. lol. 25058 text characters. lol. </p>

<p>Oh, fuck.. that&#39;s you with the brain aneurysm. So that&#39;s who this was. lol. Oh that&#39;s what&#39;s different about you. So all this other shit was going on besides that, before the shit hit the fan, eh. wow. </p>

<p>You describing this surgery.. that&#39;s some pretty fucked up shit. I never had no surgery, busted a bone. That&#39;s a pretty funny line there about what&#39;s up during that surgery. heh. How were they even doing this other stuff without opening the top. That&#39;s crazy. Just open the top for easy access. lol. So they tried that later.. jeez.

<p>But yeah, dude.. better fucking get baptized, just in case. And don&#39;t trust any of those &quot;shenanigan&quot; religions, like ya wanna stick with the name brand product. You know, like when you go get mayonnaise for your sandwiches ya wanna get like, most people seem to go for the Miracle whip, but I prefer the Hellman&#39;s. It&#39;s not worth it saving however many like dozens of pennies, to go for the generic clone name brand type. They&#39;re probably close to being outdated and you can bet, by the looks on the jar, looks like it tastes bad. So this is like an analogy for religions. Ya got them shenanigan ones like the Jehova&#39;s witness shit.. these mormon guys in, where.. utah.. the latterday saints, who else.. those eastern europe guys there with the onion dome churches. I think that&#39;s &quot;orthodox&quot;? Then ya got the protestant.. not even sure what that means. How about scientology, like jeez.. that&#39;s a fucking sci-fi shit, man. Who knows what&#39;s going on with the people at that wailing wall and those beards and hats. The Jewish people, whatever the deal with their religion. Then the Islamic Muslims.. What&#39;s the term there.. Islam is the religion, and muslim is like someone who practices it. They&#39;re all super gung-ho about their stuff, wow. No questions asked. Just do like the rest of the herd. All this shit there, I wouldn&#39;t trust any of &#39;em. You think the Bible was written by some authors, well those other ones, those are who knows who. At least this catholic one that is the more popular one with the Pope as the head honcho.. I&#39;d sorta like, trust that one more. ok so you&#39;d like go to a church and do the baptism shit.. You know.. just in case like uh that horror movie shit is like &quot;real&quot;. You know what I mean? That&#39;s a fucking corner you don&#39;t cut. lol. </p>

<p>Fuck, already at 10047 characters.. and I analyzed like what half of a sentence.. hahaha. You really started it off on a bad foot there though. I&#39;m agnostic, that means on the fence. I don&#39;t see enough proof to warrant a foolish belief. However, from the bits of stuff I heard, like through psychics and clairvoyants, sounds like there is this God and the heaven, &quot;hideout&quot;. That&#39;s like the Batman and Robin hideout cave. heh. So I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about this straight-up, &quot;agnostic&quot; route you&#39;re going man. How the fuck do you know, like &quot;guaranteed&quot; there isn&#39;t this shit the clairvoyants talk about on the other side when you die. These bitches go find missing kids when the cops hire &#39;em. So better pay attention to that other shit they say. For me though, if you look at it that way, the God thing exists and this heaven place.. but what is bullshit is all these &quot;religions&quot; where it&#39;s just some monks or something back then writing a fucking &quot;novel&quot; about some of the bits which may be true. The lot though, sure seems to be &quot;hogwash&quot;. lol. ok.. so I don&#39;t like it either when they&#39;re &quot;agnostic&quot;. You&#39;re saying 100% for sure what those true psychics say goes on after you die. Right there though, that&#39;s you being illogical. So, your problem. Just like the how the &quot;maybe&quot; about if half that shit in the horror movies is true, you may get like &quot;possessed&quot; if you&#39;re not &quot;baptized&quot;. So I&#39;d uh, head down there one day, and just get splashed with water and go, &quot;k&quot; after. Ya don&#39;t gotta go to church after.. but just in case, ya know.. cause, well, fuck, gotta keep it short here.. but think of &quot;horror movie&quot; shit with evil stuff, k. </p>

<p>Next.. now. lol. </p>

<p>ok I&#39;m just reading some of this.. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, if you spend enough time reading different religious texts, from all the religions, you will see some constants. </p>

<p>yeah.. there&#39;s some kind of common theme with their different books. I think it&#39;s usually, just be a &quot;good guy&quot;. </p>

<p>Heard the term, not familiar with the &quot;fable&quot;. Remember, all that shit is &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. So when I was at church as a kid it all went out the other ear. So what happened with these couple guys. Sounds like the Amos &amp; Andy from before. lol</p>

<p>Cain didn&#39;t get same reward for his hard work and got mad, killed his shepherd brother. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so shepherd.. their job was managing sheep. What&#39;s going on there? Didn&#39;t one of them kill the other for fucking his girlfriend? Cain&#39;s a bit of a chump there.. who&#39;s the other guy, Amos.. or was it Andy.. either way, so he got paid more by the hour. You don&#39;t go kill somebody because they got paid more. What&#39;s up with this Cain guy. Hope he went to the &quot;slammer&quot; after for a few years. Musta been disgruntled stepping in goat poop once in a while, while working.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also think about how jealousy, if left to grow, will make you murderous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, you gotta watch out for that O.J. sort of stuff. Just get another bitch and move on, ya don&#39;t kill her. Sheesh. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the truly hard work of growing plants for sustenance is overlooked and not appreciated as much as the fatty parts of an animal, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait, hang on here, what&#39;s going on there.. sound like Cain was growing weed, and this other guy, who was it, Andy.. he had animals.. Well no shit, he&#39;d get paid more. Why didn&#39;t Cain get some buffalo instead or something. Don&#39;t go kill the other dude cause he&#39;s making more money trafficking coke. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What most people miss about the story is that Cain left the presence of God, built a flourishing city and ultimately destroyed the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s this? The Cain dude kills that Amos guy and then he &quot;built a flourishing city&quot;? WTF.. was this like after he did 25 years? ok so how do you go from weed grower to like &quot;built a flourishing city&quot;. What the fuck. Quite the character though, you try &quot;building a flourishing city&quot;. Sheesh. But uh, how did he stop going to church when Jesus wasn&#39;t even around yet. Didn&#39;t that shit only start after him. Who knows what&#39;s going on with these guys. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>built a flourishing city and ultimately destroyed the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so after he built a flourishing city, how the fuck does that ultimately destroy the world. I think ya missed like a movie script line there with the in between. Sounds like it went &quot;south&quot; though his building a town. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now this world could be the literal world and the big flood was how the world got destroyed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, ya gotta watch them floods there eh. lol. Maybe put your houses up on like big sticks. I never liked basements, always flood, bugs down there. Shouldn&#39;t have no basements. Digging into the ground, seems a bad idea. Probably evil that digging into the ground with these basements. So the shit flooded eh. You&#39;d think with like wood all over, they&#39;d have some boats around. Couldn&#39;t you do fishing for a bit? Plus fuck, just drink the water even if it&#39;s salted.. better than no water, I bet. Even though you&#39;re on a boat, you can fish. And hey, isn&#39;t it warm out there. They don&#39;t have to deal with no winter like up here. So that&#39;s fuck all for a big outfit. The biggest bitch out there, is winter. So these guys had it easy, even if there was that &quot;flood&quot; stuff. Figure out how to like get water from the uh, condensation stuff like them campers. Fish.. you&#39;ll be allright even though ya gotta hang out on your boat for a while. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now this world could be the literal world and the big flood was how the world got destroyed by God because there were no good souls left on the planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok good idea.. I like this. Maybe once you reach the billionaire level like I talked about in other posts.. ya get the A.I... doing shit off planet and stuff. If ya wanna &quot;take out the trash&quot; around here, fire up a &quot;flood&quot;. I like that.. we&#39;ll keep that in the &quot;arsenal&quot;. Get A.I. to figure out how we could fire up a &quot;flood&quot;. That way you don&#39;t have to push that red button to take out the trash. lol. Thanks for the tip! ;-) Wasn&#39;t me that was the bad guy, it was the &quot;flood&quot;. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the big flood was how the world got destroyed by God because there were no good souls left on the planet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See, he&#39;s a bit of an irritable chump that God guy.. If you kill somebody, you go to jail. We got &#39;em this guy now. What&#39;s that.. &quot;genocide&quot;. Motherfucker.. see, he&#39;s bad ass. Hey, I&#39;m starting to like this God guy now. He doesn&#39;t fuck around.. takes out the trash, even though it&#39;s highly illegal and you could get the total death penalty. heh.. Maybe we could have a chat with him about just tweaking his operations instead of turfing his ass out like Saddam Hussein, or that what&#39;s his name.. &quot;Muammar Gaddafi&quot;.. fuck did they ever turf that guy out on his ass. So yeah.. come to think of it, this God guy&#39;s kinda cool the way he said, fuck this shit, I&#39;m &quot;flooding&quot; the bastards. But some of this other shit, is sorta irritating. So we&#39;d kinda like file our grievances and if the bitch does nothing, A.I. will turf him out like a Saddam or a Muammar. I kinda like that &quot;flooding&quot; stuff though.. sorta thinks along the same lines. Hey, takin care of the &quot;over-population&quot;. Now less people in front of you at the check-out line-up. Plus, hey, look on the bright side.. less &quot;unemployed&quot; people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the big flood was how the world got destroyed by God because there were no good souls left on the planet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok so he took out the trash because there were no good souls left on the planet. Hey.. this sounds sorta like now. All these fucking smart phone zombies who ignore every body. That&#39;s fucking rude. ok.. so yeah.. we&#39;ll keep that gameplan tactic playbook, in mind, about the flood. Good one, God dude.. high five. heh. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also look at it personally. Maybe Cain is the dark side of yourself and that you can live only &quot;on the dark side&quot; and flourish, but it leads to destruction.</p>

<p>What are you talking about there.. is this some sort of metaphor? Don&#39;t do no Shakespeare shit on me man. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe Cain is the dark side of yourself and that you can live only &quot;on the dark side&quot; and flourish, but it leads to destruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you&#39;re bad, that&#39;s bad? What about God though, taking out that trash with that flood. That sounds &quot;bad&quot; to me. Moving on. lol.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a whole lot of rambling :) I will just give a few comments on what I think is important.
I&#39;ve always been an atheist, I&#39;m not even baptized. I used to go out of my way to make fun of christians and muslims and especially krishnas and all those wacky fools. My brain just works like that. I need immense amounts of proof to believe such nonsense. I didn&#39;t even find God through my research, no holy spirit has descended upon me, there was no voice of God rumbling through the sky. I found the devil and his works, that pervade all aspects of our society today.
The bible is a man written text, just like any other text. It&#39;s also been changed a thousand times. Books have been added and removed. However, if you spend enough time reading different religious texts, from all the religions, you will see some constants. They have stories and ideas that are exactly the same or carry the same idea. I think the story of Jesus and his 12 disciples and how we are all saved through death is very important to our psyche. I think the bible is a multidimensional book. There&#39;s many ways to read it. For example the story of Cain and Abel. You can think of it literally. Cain didn&#39;t get same reward for his hard work and got mad, killed his shepherd brother. You can also think about how jealousy, if left to grow, will make you murderous. Or maybe it&#39;s about the sacrifice that we give to the world. Sometimes the truly hard work of growing plants for sustenance is overlooked and not appreciated as much as the fatty parts of an animal, which you simply not let run away from you. What most people miss about the story is that Cain left the presence of God, built a flourishing city and ultimately destroyed the world. Now this world could be the literal world and the big flood was how the world got destroyed by God because there were no good souls left on the planet. You can also look at it personally. Maybe Cain is the dark side of yourself and that you can live only &quot;on the dark side&quot; and flourish, but it leads to destruction.
The quantum stuff you mentioned is part of what I mean about us changing the world with intention. Through my own experience I noticed this. Whenever I really want something in my life, all I have to do is think about it, acknowledge it, accept it. It&#39;s something like this Law of Attraction a lot of people keep talking about, especially people who have accomplished great things. For example, I wanted to become a self-sufficient confident person. I remember thinking about it in my early 20s a lot. I had no idea how to accomplish it and all the &quot;stay positive&quot; bullshit never had effect on me. All I did was think about it, honestly evaluate my current situation and accept the opportunities that came to me. The last part is the most important. If you think you want a girlfriend and dream about it everyday, you have to be strong enough to accept the opportunities that come your way. You have to go out of your way and talk to the cute girl that looked at you 3 times in the last 10 minutes. It&#39;s not enough to just want something, you have to also go after that something when it presents itself. This is where most people fail and therefore become miserable. Mostly because when the opportunities come along, people tend to shy away from them or realize that&#39;s not what they really want. Therefore we have this consumerism culture where we throw out more than we consume.
Huh.. it&#39;s become a long reply :D Might as well add a little story about my brain surgeries. I remember this moment when I was lying on the surgery table. My doctor has just put a meter long catheter through my groin area straight into my brain, right between my ears somewhere, I could feel it. There was a monitor to my left and I had to be conscious so they can see my reactions in case something wrong happens. Basically I could see my own brain being operated on by a guy bent over my groin area controlling these tiny wires going inside my brain, burning and closing these broken arteries or whatever. All I could think of was, &quot;poor guy has to smell my unwashed balls&quot; :D I found it funny during the surgery and even laughed a little. I had another surgery done on me later, because this one didn&#39;t work perfectly. It was an open brain surgery this time, a lot scarier to think about it when your head gets opened and sharp metal things are put inside your brain. I was never afraid even for a moment through all this time. It&#39;s scarier to think about it now, than it was then, lying face-down on the surgery table minutes before surgery. Faith in God is what gave me the strength to go through it. My last thoughts before falling asleep were &quot; I&#39;m ready to meet my maker&quot;. I went into a dream and was woken up an hour later. The very first thought was, &quot;damn, you ruined my dream&quot; :) Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I didn&#39;t see white tunnels or had out of body experiences. I did realize one thing though - we are all religious. It&#39;s ingrained into us. When the right time comes, all of us talk to God, even if only secretly. The point of faith is to become better, to be part of something bigger, to go above our bodily needs and achieve spiritual greatness and complete happiness.</p>

<p>You like when they ramble-on as much as you, then you can&#39;t even quote what you&#39;re replying to in the 10k character limit. So I&#39;ll have to keep this one short! :-D Not much room for here on this one. </p>

<p>I went to bed for a bit, got up had a bite to eat. Goin back to bed soon. ok.. so what are you saying here.. hahaha.. Quickly scrolled thru.. At least I don&#39;t see any Bible quotes, that sets off my &quot;nonsense&quot; mode, trying to picture what the Shakespeare means. lol. Then I&#39;ll start talking about the big bad wolf, the 3 pigs, that oatmeal bear, goldilocks, beaver damns and stuff. hahahah. Then go, oh this is what they mean, it&#39;s sorta like those &quot;fables&quot;. lol</p>

<p>Hold on a second here.. when I looked up the word fable, check this out.. </p>

<p>*Fable is a literary genre: a succinct fictional story, in prose or verse, that features animals, legendary creatures, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak human language) and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson (a &quot;moral&quot;), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy maxim.</p>

<p>A fable differs from a parable in that the latter excludes animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.</p>

<p>Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the King James Version of the New Testament, &quot;μῦθος&quot; (&quot;mythos&quot;) was rendered by the translators as &quot;fable&quot;[1] in the First Epistle to Timothy, the Second Epistle to Timothy, the Epistle to Titus and the First Epistle of Peter.[2]</p>

<p>A person who writes fables is a fabulist.*</p>

<p>Well, wouldn&#39;t ya know it, small world there, eh.. ya look up the word Fable, what do we see.. </p>

<p><em>In the King James Version of the New Testament, &quot;μῦθος&quot; (&quot;mythos&quot;) was rendered by the translators as &quot;fable&quot;[1]</em></p>

<p>Sounds like they thought it was in the same pile as those. lol. See, like I was saying.. how they so sure it wasn&#39;t just &quot;science fiction&quot;. </p>

<p>ok I gotta get back to what you were saying, first though, let&#39;s see how many text count characters this shit is already. jeez. lol. 7356. Yeah, you&#39;re not leaving me much room there buddy. lol. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s start this out.. sounds like it&#39;ll be a 5 part reply, I bet. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve always been an atheist, I&#39;m not even baptized. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not a good one, man. Didn&#39;t you watch no horror movies? I&#39;d go get baptized now, just in case. When I grew up, my parents would make us go to this french roman catholic church. You know, like whatever is the mainstream one where the pope is the head honcho. Then around oh maybe middle of high school, they chilled out with making us go to church and asked, do you want to go. See, that&#39;s how you do it, not force them into your fucking cult. These religious people, they&#39;re supposed to be doing what it says in the Bible.. which is be a good guy. Meanwhile they&#39;re forcing you to go to church. During my parent&#39;s generation, it was really bad. You had to go or else you&#39;d almost get arrested, I bet. haha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>[Part 4 of 3] lol</p>

<p>Goin back to bed. I was there.. hold on.. this idea of the Matrix resistance creating the &quot;big flush&quot;. Where you cause a flood like the one in the Bible. To take out the fucking trash. </p>

<p>Once you get to that billionaire level.. then you&#39;re doing the scientific research. Got the A.I. going.. it thinks for itself, creates the stuff. Gets the free energy power source. What are these big space ships like in sci-fi movies.. just material. That&#39;s like fuckin rocks, man. It&#39;d go mining off planet. Build that whole space ship armada the matrix resistance would live on. </p>

<p>He&#39;s how you nail those Archon. Apparently they feed off the public&#39;s energy. Somebody mentioned this page I noticed last night. Just quickly glanced over.. saw a paragraph.. hang on, let me get that. Haven&#39;t had time to read that yet. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/">http://www.ascensionhelp.com/blog/2013/08/23/why-i-am-no-longer-a-light-worker/</a></p>

<p><em>every being incarnated on a world that is under its spell would serve as a “soul battery” to help keep the demiurge energized.</em></p>

<p>It is like that Matrix movie, isn&#39;t it. You&#39;re just a battery. ok if people are their power source.. if you&#39;d take out the trailer trash, with a new flood, no more battery for the bad guy. Then the bad guy goes down. Sorry that we had to take out the lot too. hahah. But hey, sometimes to take out the trash, the baby goes out with the bath water too. Oh well. lol. </p>

<p>Whatcha think of that plan, there aneurysm guy? That&#39;s how I remember who it is, the aneurysm guy, what&#39;s your name again.. &quot;slingyman&quot;. k. lol. </p>

<p>So yeah, what do you think of this plan to take down the bad guy? Sorry about the &quot;collateral damage&quot;. What&#39;s that term mean, kids?</p>

<p><em>Collateral damage is a general term for deaths, injuries, or other damage inflicted on an unintended target. In American military terminology, it is used for the incidental killing or wounding of non-combatants or damage to non-combatant property during an attack on a legitimate military target.</em></p>

<p>There&#39;d be a &quot;couple&quot; innocent bystander casualties. Betcha that body count would finally get their attention in the google news, instead of the usual ignoring of school shootings these days. </p>

<p>Another flood.. no more batteries for the Matrix type Archon. I think it&#39;s a good one. They&#39;re all fuckin assholes anyways. They&#39;ll ignore you and click their smart phone instead. Rude.. lol.  They&#39;re not &quot;good people&quot;. Good people don&#39;t behave that way.  </p>

<p>Plus, God did it, so that means it&#39;s &quot;ok&quot; and not a &quot;sin&quot;, right? We&#39;ll just go, oh I didn&#39;t know it was bad. The mob boss did it. You know what I mean? If you gotta go to galactic court later, you just use the same excuse as he did. Kinda nabbed him in a catch-22 there on that one. I think it&#39;s a good one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you consider yourself to be a completely secular thinking atheist or agnostic?</p>

<p>How interesting if there are great flood legends from across the world? See a chart <a href="http://www.nwcreation.net/images/flood_traditions.jpg">here</a>?</p>

<p>How telling if Noah even had a name remained virtually unchanged in places as isolated as Hawaii (called Nu-u?), the Sudan (Nuh?), China (Nu-Wah?), the Amazon region (Noa?), Phrygia (Noe?) and among the Hottentots (Noh and Hiagnoh?).</p>

<p>And is the world lacking geologic evidence for a global flood if Genesis 7:11 suggests water came from something called the fountains of the great deep and you consider western USA? What&#39;s not pretty compelling evidence if Yellowstone contains 80% of the worlds geysers and Snake River Plain is essentially flowing from it to the Channeled Scablands? And what&#39;s limited to that if western USA as a whole is essentially a land of sedimentary rock? Also there we have Grand Canyon and Great Salt Lake and Monument Valley and Petrified Forest National Park and Algodones Dunes and the Morrison Formation and the Ogallala Aquifer and more? What is truly the result of several coincidental events scattered millions of years apart?</p>

<p>Noah might have been somewhat safe across the world from Yellowstone around a modern day Turkey, but if you want geologic evidence for the whole world being submerged, consider strata in itself and fossils as a whole with an emphasis on polystrate fossils and mountain fossils and consider <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4196195/slides/slide_12.jpg">A</a> and <a href="http://www.constellation7.org/PolystrateTree-Article.jpg">B</a> and <a href="http://www.truthnet.org/creation/genesisflood/becomefossil.jpg">C</a> and spend a bit of time looking around <a href="http://s8int.com/oldindex.html">D</a>?</p>

<p>The name Noah can be popular not because it&#39;s Noah, but because it&#39;s an easy name.</p>

<p>there is a lot of geological evidence yes. We must consider tectonic plates though and the fact they are constantly moving, therefore we have earthquakes. Some earthquakes create islands and disappear others. Even the sphinx in Egypt has evidence of being flooded. This does not mean the whole world was flooded. Maybe the whole world of the people of that time and place. It&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t seem we have enough water on Earth to flood the whole world. There might be enough water hidden somewhere deep in the Earth&#39;s mantle, but we don&#39;t know. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the programming. I don&#39;t really know much about it. I got a good tidbit last night. Hang on, let me get that line. </p>

<p><em>Mr. Lash says that Archons did not succeed taking over us, and moved to plan B: “we’ll get them to become like us.”</em></p>

<p>So look at how these Archons are, no imagination or creativity. They feed off the public&#39;s negative range energy. They want you to be in fear, anxiety and worrying all the time. </p>

<p>Apparently with this line, they got whoever&#39;s in charge of the world to try to turn the population into how these Archon entities are. </p>

<p>You say you&#39;re depressed. Well, you&#39;re getting bombarded from all sides here. The worst is the food you eat. All kinds of chemicals you can&#39;t pronounce. Some stuff like beer, no ingredients. Cigarettes, all kinds of things in there. So when you start smoking you go, ok that&#39;s a good idea. Now I&#39;m gonna be doing this every 15 minutes until I die. Sounds like a &quot;good idea&quot;. Recent decades these GMO genetically modified organisms in everything you consume. How about the wonderful &quot;diet&quot; fake sugar aspartame. </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical pills.. look at the scroll-down of side effects. Best to just die from the original malady and not take any. Gonna croak anyways, right. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all kinds of fishy nano technology and GMO things in pills. You don&#39;t exactly see &quot;ingredients&quot; on them, sorta like beer or cigarettes. </p>

<p>People talk about vaccines.. I don&#39;t know about those. You don&#39;t want the diseases, but they&#39;re probably putting junk in &#39;em to mess kids up. </p>

<p>What&#39;s up with this autism in recent decades. Something happened to &#39;em. Look around at people who are having kids.. not too many of them are attractive, even though the parents may be half hot. Something fishy is going on to the kids. </p>

<p>What about all these plastic containers things are in. When I grew up, lots used to be in glass. Recent years they go, oh now this plastic stuff doesn&#39;t have BPA. So you mean they now find out it was bad back then. Looked that up, saw this.. &quot;Why ‘BPA-free’ isn’t safe&quot;. </p>

<p>How about fucking cancer. Like you&#39;d think somebody would figure out what&#39;s going on there, a little bit more. Come on, ya guys. But no, because they&#39;re the ones in charge of wherever you buy stuff and who makes the pills and supposedly does the research. </p>

<p>How about marijuana in recent years. Saw a news article the other season, how here in Canada, they tested some of the pot out there. Let me see if I can find that article. </p>

<p>*What&#39;s in your pot? Marketplace tests today&#39;s weed.</p>

<p>As Ottawa prepares to legalize recreational marijuana, Marketplace investigation shows how weed has changed*</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-marijuana-thc-cbd-legalization-1.3861144">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-marijuana-thc-cbd-legalization-1.3861144</a></p>

<p>Pot from the old days used to have CBD in there. They say now it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p><em>Study after study points to the attributes of combining THC and CBD. The science isn&#39;t settled, but  research suggests CBD can mitigate some of the negative effects that can happen with high-THC weed, including anxiety, paranoia, and psychosis.</em></p>

<p>Pot used to be highly illegal in the States, and now all of a sudden they say it&#39;s &quot;fine&quot;. That sounds fishy. Seems like they want you on it. Well, if you look at those effects it has with no CBD, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis.. that&#39;s precisely the type of effect these Archon feed off. </p>

<p>So I wouldn&#39;t fall for it, and stay away from their pot. If you can, maybe see if you could get somebody who had seeds from the 70&#39;s. Even then, I wouldn&#39;t trust any of it. Best to just stay straight. If you mess with your moods, you come down later and need more to feel normal. Less exciting when you&#39;re straight but overall, best to just stay straight. Yes, you&#39;ll want to go pick up beer all the time and pot too now.. but best to stay away from it. Less trouble later. They want you on this stuff. </p>

<p>You probably were messing with something to feel better in the present moment. Afterwards you get the depression. If you got a vitamin deficiency, you can feel that way. If you drink coffee all the time, with urinating vitamins out, eventually you could be deficient. I read somewhere that smoking one cigarette depleted 25mg of vitamin C. A deficiency in vitamin C can lead to irritability. Lots of people who smoke are cranky fucks. </p>

<p>So you&#39;d have to stay away from that addiction stuff. Why do you do it in the present moment, because your life sucks. That&#39;s where the root of the problem is. Picking up liquor every night sure as hell doesn&#39;t fix the problem. </p>

<p>All their actions seem to want to turn the population into like how these Archon are. Dumbed down TV watchers. And now, smart phone clicking zombies who are just fans and not creators. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t want you figuring out a way to fix the system like I&#39;m just barely beginning to wonder about. They want you watching your stupid sitcoms, movies or sports, every night with the bit of spare time they have left. </p>

<p>They pound people back into the ground with inflation too. Tax half. Ridiculously escalating house prices. Meanwhile the government does nothing. They go, oh, we get more property taxes now. </p>

<p>Well it&#39;d be more difficult if you tried to do business stuff. Buying any sort of property, forget it. </p>

<p>Eventually, you won&#39;t be able to fight the system to fix it. This time here these days, is really the last ditch period where you can stop these bad guys. </p>

<p>I think I heard there&#39;s mind programming through things like TV. Watch somebody who&#39;s sitting there watching a TV, they&#39;re in a trance a little bit. Heard something a while back about pulse signals in these new curly fluorescent bulbs. </p>

<p>What about cell phone tower signals and wi-fi. Saw a gifv of wi-fi spreading in a room. I don&#39;t know if I trust that stuff. It might be like the BPA in plastic, where they later go, oh we didn&#39;t know then, this wireless stuff was harmful, sorry. Your mind is very subtle electrical activity. Betcha that shit messes with it. It&#39;s kinda like wanting to be able to watch the stars at night, with the light pollution in cities. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve taken any sort of prescription pills, you&#39;re already messed with. Probably permanent. Things like coffee, sugar.. all probably not good for you. Jerking off all day, that&#39;ll keep you burned down and no will to fight the system. The whole sex thing all the time, porn. Shopping and buying stuff. </p>

<p>Everything people do with the bit of spare time they have left in a day, is all to keep them distracted from figuring a way to fix the system and put the bad guys out of business. </p>

<p>People are burned right out from everything and the next little thing is like, well I&#39;m saturated with bullshit here.. can&#39;t do even one more problem or the camel&#39;s back &#39;ll snap from all that straw.</p>

<p>People love it when things get worse. Getting old.. woe is me. Well that&#39;s all that&#39;s going on in the world out there. Things getting worse. Ya gotta smile even though it hurts or you&#39;ll be like them and never happy, then die. </p>

<p>The main thing why you may be depressed is you have to think of a plan to win at the game of life. First of all though, you&#39;d have to get a handle on the addiction to distractions. </p>

<p>Would have to eat fairly healthy. Throw out your TV. Those smart phones, people are like gamblers in a casino. Getting a little dopamine dose from each click. Like a cocaine addict. Keep clicking &quot;next&quot; all day long. That sounds like a life that sucks, endlessly clicking your stupid phone. On and on. And all this is only going to get worse for people&#39;s kids. Houses &#39;ll be 10 million. But nobody&#39;s doing anything about it. </p>

<p>The main thing why you&#39;re depressed is because your life sucks. So you&#39;d have to fix that. Long term project which could take years. One day at a time. But if in every present moment you&#39;re feeding those addictions to distractions.. you&#39;ll never eventually win at the game. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve seen that page in the past. Quite the epic scroll-down, eh. If you&#39;d print that out it would be as thick as who knows what. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have time right now, you could get get side-tracked there for hours. One thing leads to another. That would be interesting for somebody who doesn&#39;t know about any of this stuff going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p>So hard to find any kind of &quot;proof&quot; with photos, eh. Those are just not out there or they&#39;d be removed by Google. They&#39;d be &quot;classified top secret&quot;. </p>

<p>But interesting stuff there. However, if I see Biblical quotes anywhere though, it kind of throws me off. So halfway thru that page and shut &#39;er down. lol. Didn&#39;t really see anything new that I hadn&#39;t before. But thanks for sharing, might be handy for people who haven&#39;t heard of some of those things.</p>

<p>What would make sense about Him being imaginary if a) Josephus and Lucian indicate that He was regarded as wise and b) Pliny, the Talmud, and Lucian imply He was a powerful and revered teacher and c) Josephus and the Talmud indicate He performed miraculous feats and d) Tacitus, Josephus, the Talmud, and Lucian all mention that He was crucified and e) Tacitus and Josephus say this occurred under Pontius Pilate and f) the Talmud declares it happened on the eve of Passover and g) there are possible references to the Christian belief in His resurrection in both Tacitus and Josephus and h) Josephus records that His followers believed He was the Christ, or Messiah and i) Pliny and Lucian indicate that Christians worshipped Him as a Deity and j) there was even a huge Italian Peninsula fire blamed on followers of Him as early as 64 CE?</p>

<p>You might be speaking on a conspiracy forum as if you believe in an Illuminati and NWO related hand involving archons, but if there are deceiving archons with hands in politics and mainstream media and academia who WANT humans to embrace and believe in Genesis and Christ then did someone drop a ball in the 20th century?</p>

Isn&#39;t it apparent that politics and mainstream religion and mainstream media and academia did a pretty successful job at doing so before circa 1980 or the internet? All of a sudden the internet gets big and evidence for nephilim starts flooding the world and then Illuminati related folk try to cover their ass using Ancient Alien type shows on the History Channel?</p>

<p>Took a quick look.. noticed this one where it seems to talk about what these Archon are doing with feeding off the public&#39;s negative energy. </p>

<p><em>What is the Point of All This Control?
The corrupt demiurge is an entropic system of artificially-induced separation consciousness that is slowly dying, and it depends on harvesting the energy from the souls incarnated within its system in order to preserve its existence. In order to harvest the largest amount of soul energy possible, it created the dark-light duality paradigm to ensure that every being incarnated on a world that is under its spell would serve as a “soul battery” to help keep the demiurge energized.  The “good” souls would seek out the (false) light team, and the “bad” souls would seek out the dark team, but unknown to most of those souls, they are all serving the same system.</em></p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">n/a</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/thinkB4Uact.html">thinkB4Uact</a> 2017-05-27</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a false light being used as a front for beings like the archons you mentioned. (more further down) I don&#39;t wish to ascribe to them such a high level of power and fear, claiming they are somehow unrivaled masterful controllers of matter or physics or infest entire dimensions that can interact with our own. Although, they do infest some areas.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have to be archons or some other impressive label to be as they are. They are just spiritual parasites, feeding on the emotional energy consciousness generates in positive emotional states and releases in negative emotional states. Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Stealing people, places and things is wrong, not only because it often violates free will, but because it steals value from consciousness. Stealing the very energy of joy itself from consciousness is the most direct form of theft for those who choose to be parasites.</p>

<p>They gain pleasure, vitality and focus (and perhaps mind over matter abilities) while they lose creativity, compassion, and the ability to enjoy life without stolen energy. They begin a process of spiritual entropy inside themselves that leads to the state the archons are said to exhibit, total mind slavery without independent focus. (They don&#39;t respect free will, so they rob each other of it for utility) So, I believe that for the most part they are evolved spiritual parasites. We can be like them too. </p>

<p>Does the title and description of archons fill you with virtually useless fear? Does it help you understand as much as just calling them spiritual parasites? They deserve no honor from us. They are not magical, they are technological abominations. They are useless eaters that reconfigure the value of others to benefit themselves and continue feeding on others. Respect them like you do bot flies, mango worms, ginnea worms, mosquitos and horse flies. They are more like them than a magical legion of commanders of our existence. If they were ever cut off from life, they&#39;d be irrelevant to existence. They can&#39;t make value, because they suck value and that is all. They&#39;d eventually stop moving for lack of motivation and direction, like desicated vampires.</p>

<p>{<strong><em>The fallse light</em></strong>} </p>

<p>Anyway, there are narratives that suggest that we are deceived by these useless eaters after death, to come back here to an area they infest, to feel fear and pain to give them more energy. Religion primes us to believe the scenario that they use to gain our consent for more energy feeding. They say they are loving beings concerned with our long term development and that we need to go back to earth and suffer more <del>unnecessary</del> trauma, because we have a karma debt. To whom? How about the others and your other encarnations that were harmed? Sure, it is OK to feel that you owe those you stole from. Owing unaccountable, supposedly divine authority? No, you don&#39;t owe them jack squat. Don&#39;t trust them. Karma is a deliberate setup. They want you to believe you owe them so they can own you, like a debt slave. </p>

<p>They corrupt the conditions for life, deliberately causing dysfunctions to occur, so we react poorly in our ignorance, for the purpose of causing fear, suffering and negative energy feeding and also to generate plausible justifications for us to be judged after life, karma.</p>

<p>There are benevolent beings that understand this troll shtick. Most don&#39;t want us to focus on these atrocity generating abominations, because fear is often very counterproductive in this situation and their useless eater attributes are evolved to inspire fear. The benevolent beings tell us to forgive ourselves and others and that it stops the wheel of karma. Well, wouldn&#39;t that help stop these spiritual parasite deceivers that try to sell you that you need more traumatic experiences to pay back your karma? Oh yes.</p>

<p>However, there is another angle to this. Forgiveness itself is often a red herring. It&#39;s important to know what it actually is and what it is good for. Forgiveness, like many other good things, can be manipulated by hackers, like the technology, life, mind,and spirit hacking beings we are discussing.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is the release of a negative emotional energy that I call the energy of correction. When you are choosing not to forgive someone, you are demanding correction for something they did that offended you or others. When you forgive them, you release that demand for correction. Forgiveness is beautiful and healing when given to to the remorseful who want to do better, because it helps them and you release emotional burden. </p>

<p>When the being you are forgiving is remorseless and continues intending to cause the same problems, despite your forgiveness of them, as you witness their continued offensive behavior, your energy of correction will come back even stronger than before. Forgiveness of the uncorrected does not help you in the medium to long term, nor others that were harmed nor even the being you are forgiving ultimately. It&#39;s a red herring for the real issue, the offensive behavior. Even if unrepentant, harm causing beings are effectively restrained by others, one can still forgive and receive meritful benefits. You release your emotional burden, and its OK, because the bad behavior has ceased. Although, as soon as the offender is released, the energy returns to some degree.</p>

<p><strong><em>The willingness to forgive is proportional to the expectation that the bad behavior will cease.</em></strong></p>

<p>So, beware of the portion of those who present themselves as light or benevolent that would have us forgive beings that unrepentantly harm others unabated. They are part of a front of manipulation that impersonates what they know we would likely trust. The goal is Stockholm syndrome, love of your persistent abusers, willful slavery. Think about politics, another example of the same pattern of successfully manipulating what beings perceive as the good side. It works so damn well it can&#39;t be ignored by these useless eater beings.</p>

<p>So, in the end, you are forced to think independently. You can&#39;t just join the light and expect good results. Some light organizations are there to support this energy feeding behavior. Although, you can know them by the fruit they bear. </p>

<p><strong>Does this supposedly benevolent group embrace beliefs that would effectively lead to <em>real</em> freedom, peace, harmony and joy for others or would they have others submit to unacceptable offensive behaviors occurring unabated?</strong></p>

<p>Whom does their beliefs and resultant behavior ultimately serve? The consciousness inside life or the parasites that feed on it? You have to discern this yourself, because extremely evil beings will use every tool they can wield to get what they want. Deception is as ubiquitous to them as the spoken word is to us. Don&#39;t take their proficiency for granted. You can&#39;t trust the right being or group to do this for you. Trust in your own ability to discern integrity and you will find their corruption. Then please do point it out to the ignorant, so they don&#39;t have to suffer it. </p>

<p>I recalled something else. A few months ago was looking up about the Archon and noticed this guy who runs this site, unicusmagazine.  Yeah.. Robert Stanley. First saw him on youtube he&#39;d chat with alternative media bloggers. I think he was on the Coast to Coast AM radio show. Had some tales. Gets into these Archon entities. </p>

<p>I think he was saying they&#39;re like a virus that you can see in our world with whatever cameras. Well, if you think how when somebody dies, the &quot;spirit&quot; part is like a little ball of light. Think, that Poltergeist movie where they go in the hall. Well, maybe these Archon are like a virus. It&#39;s just this little thing in our realm. </p>

<p>This was a google search for those couple words. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;amp;site=&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=unicusmagazine+archon">https://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;amp;site=&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=unicusmagazine+archon</a></p>

<p>He talks about it on his site. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm">http://www.unicusmagazine.com/skyfish.htm</a></p>

<p>Wondering what you guys think of this stuff. </p>

<p>I had said hey to him and we were chatting a bit back and forth. He sent a pdf. I saved it to look at later in the future.</p>

<p>From the &quot;American journal of modern physics&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apparent detection via new telescopes with concave lenses of otherwise invisible terrestrial entities (ITE)&quot;</p>

<p>Looked for it online and this site is mentioned in the pdf, so looks like they have to do with it. </p>

<p>The footage of pics always stinks. haha. It&#39;s like UFO footage. Lousy. </p>

<p>Might be something there about what these guys are up to. But I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s the Archon negative entities who control the Illuminati. But, these guys might be up to something. Wondering what you think of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is much more than just positive thinking. The &#39;light&#39; / good / love force is always assumed to be weak and passive, and the bad side always thought to be so strong. Its because there&#39;s so few good strong people standing up to these forces. The majority of our heroes and leaders are neither strong nor honourable. Time and time again these almost archetypal roles of man have been trashed and disgraced. An example, we had a paedophile PM in the UK. Ted Heath. There is no greater deception or dishonour to be ruled by such people. Research a true native american spiritual leader Crazy horse perhaps. You will see how loved and respected he was, for good reason!You will find our roles of strong leaders are inverted and backwards. 
Referring to your post: mankind has become weak and docile. 
That being said if you want to embody this &#39;good&#39; force, you can&#39;t go around shooting people. Murder and death is not the natural order. If you around destroying people, you become what you hunt. Thus you are in their realms or what Icke calls the distortion. The global conspiracy is to pull the earth into this distortion so we sync with it and thus is influences us. Dont stoop to this level. Its a subtle difference of being. But you have to embody and be the force you want to be and see in the world. Your choice my friend. </p>

<p>I think we all are going tru a natural proces and and it should bring a positive change for us all.</p>

<p>The one thing i do am a bit affraid of it that they might (will?) use technologie to influence or counter the natural event. 
And that they are able to bring humanity even further in captivity than we already are right now.</p>

<p>I am sure that we all are influencing the proces, but i don&#39;t know if i decide the outcome for myself personally, or that the majority decides for me?</p>

<p>The last one is a terrifying tought and it does not seem fair, but why else are TPTB puting so much effort in repressing the truth and possible even the event?</p>

<p>The upcomming months are realy going to be very interesting and i hope i will all play out well for us.</p>
