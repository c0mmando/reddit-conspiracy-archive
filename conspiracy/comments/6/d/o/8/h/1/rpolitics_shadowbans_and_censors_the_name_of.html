       Same deal with u/gaslightin having his comments about CERN shadowbanned from
       <a href="/r/MandelaEffect">
        /r/MandelaEffect
       </a>
       . I've also had a comment with the phrase "hail corporate" shadowbanned as well.

      <p>
       Reddit's and r/politics' blatant manipulation should be obvious to most of you but I'll provide evidence below of my individual case.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         No search results come up when you search for "Jacob Schwartz," just some off-topic threads.
         <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/mr8.jpg">

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         My comment with the phrase "Jacob Schwartz" is there when I see it, but no one else. Pretty inflammatory but no responses and no downvotes.

       What's interesting is that someone mentioned that bots kept trying to post this article but it kept getting removed. I can only assume that those submissions had "Jacob Schwartz" in the title and mine didn't. Searching for "De Blasio" is missing my submission as well, although somewhat recent submissions do appear. All those times Reddit's search function has been absolute garbage? I'm thinking it's because they directly manipulate the results, seemingly at times on a case-by-case basis. Google does it, why not Reddit?

       Sure, which makes me wonder why in every single article I can find, he isn't directly named, except for a single article from an apparently anime-leaning news site.

       Strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, see my other post. Stories at 0 points after 6 hours have passed are instantly removed, and are thus removed from the search engine. It doesn't matter that I can't find his name specifically, you won't be able to use any string to get to those submissions because they've been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, my COMMENT was shadowbanned and I've yet to see any explanation why certain comments are targeted. My only explanation is that they have certain keywords, and in this case, it was "Jacob Schwartz."

       I am actually relieved to hear that r/politics is owned rather than organic.  I periodically pop over there looking for something interesting to read, but always come away troubled that there are that many people actively engaged in what appears to be a pit of mental illness and manic hatred. Nothing open-minded at all filters through. To know that it is owned/manufactured is somehow preferable to having that much illness and close-minded hatred percolate up organically.

       I think satire absolutely adds value to the discussion. Id also say calling out the type of blind hypocrisy that I did has a value as well. The fact that you can't see that value is of no concern to me.

       Saying that someone is a Trump supporter does not add value, it's a meaningless distraction. Like every comment you've made here. You're sliding. You've been called out. Now you're doubling down.

       That's not what I said. I said it was funny for someone that posts on one of the most insane and hateful subs in existence to be calling out another sub for being insane and hateful.

      <p>
       So that leaves us with two possibilities here. A) you know what I was saying but you're playing dumb now because your entire hall monitor schtick is starting to look silly. Or B) you honestly and truly don't understand that I was pointing out the blatant hypocrisy in his comment.

       You're blaming the actions of an entire sub on a single user. That's like calling an admin that's posted in td a racist. There's no irony. These types of comments add no value to discussions. Your judgement of TD ironically casts you in the same boat as the user you were trying to shame out of this discussion because of his associations. Fun fact for you, we have freedom of association in America buddy.

       I see you're really trying to sell me on option B, but to tell you the truth I'm still leaning towards option A and I'll tell you why.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        You would have to be a non-native English speaker to not see the irony in a t_d poster calling another sub insane and hateful.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        You wouldn't be white knighting this hard if my original comment didn't strike a nerve (which is also ironic considering your username).
       </li>
       <li>
        Bullet points always look best with 3 or more and I'm too lazy to come up with a 3rd one so I'll just refer back to my first point.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Now you're still free to continue to push this option B narrative if you'd like. The whole "freedom of association, buddy" things was a pretty good sell for option B but I still need more.

       I'm still content to say that you're sliding this thread and have made no worthwhile contributions. You're bottom feeding, see chart, because you can't say anything about the real topic which is a self described neutral (in reality a far left propaganda forum) sub censoring topics that don't fit the Democratic narrative.

       So basically any story that goes against their narrative is downvoted to 0, most likely by bots, it never reaches rising or the front page, and then they add an arbitrary rule that removes the post after 6 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could've left it at that but they add:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At that point, the thread has run its course and is very hard to find in the subreddit. Either way, your story is off topic for r/politics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The thread has run its course? What? It's hard to find so they make it IMPOSSIBLE to find by deleting it, and they somehow claim it's off topic. I'm laughing typing this because it's just so absolutely ridiculous. I'm baffled by their ability to operate freely in such a brazenly corrupt fashion yet be so incompetent and self-incriminating at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your submission and the other submission are currently at 0, will be removed including removal from any searches, and then POOF, it's like it was never there at all.

       So you're for censorship? you know, can you explain to me the influx of people who want to censor people, like you?  How does this even get upvoted to 10? Am I wrong to think conspiracy is anti censorship?

       shadowbanned a comment of mine when I wrote "his name was seth rich." Logged out and it wasn't there, logged back in and it looked like it was there like normal. Knew something was weird when the shillingtons didn't attack. I have commented in that sub since without issue. (I like to fuck with the shillys to see what that faggot brock is using as his narrative now). If this doesn't hint there's something up then idk.

       If comments are immediately removed by a bot they don't show up. Otherwise you would see deleted spam in every thread. This is different from a shadowban, which is sitewide.

       has been garbage ever since it started censoring the sources people could post.  Now its all mainstream instead of independent journalism.

       ughh i'm so sick of the shadow bans on this site. I get shadow banned in
       <a href="/r/nba">

       for hating on LeBron, I get shadow banned in

       for pointing out the astroturfing movement behind the "user actived soft fork".. there's fucking shadowbanning everywhere on this shitty site. I'm so close to leaving this site, the problem is that the vast majority will stay thinking it's a free and uncensored site.

       Yes, shadowbanning is by far the most offensive thing reddit engages in. They don't have the decency to even inform you that your transmission was blocked, causing you to waste your energy trying to communicate with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just tell me you did. Too afraid to justify the ban or deletion in the minds of third person observers? You are an irresponsible coward destroying the integrity of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I was the CEO, I'd make a conspicuous example out of those that engage in this behavior, using their soon to be abominable names, before I have the code adjusted to no longer support this moderation option. If you want be a weasel, get out.

       is entirely owned by MediaMatters. There is a rigid consistency to all posts and articles that is beyond suspicious. American political opinion is the opposite of homogeneous...and yet r/politics exists.

       I don't see how Jacob Schwartz has any thing to do with politics. He was too low level to matter. I think it's a more appropriate topic for r/news.

       For real though, what kind of political discussion can be had about this story?

       It's ironic how a thread complaining about censorship contains so many who would decry censorship in one place and hold it up as beneficial in other places. They do not exude integrity.

       Yeah lol, they like Cebsorship when it protects their lord and saviour the Donald.

       All "conspiracies" in this sub are about democrats, republicans and Donald and his crownies are of course so clean and honest people, and people here think of themselves as unbiased and truth-seekers.

       Wow! We are owned. Filtered news in print and network, political addenda pushed on college campuses, and free speech being challenged.  We're in trouble.
This is front page news, instead it's buried by the media. Scary.
