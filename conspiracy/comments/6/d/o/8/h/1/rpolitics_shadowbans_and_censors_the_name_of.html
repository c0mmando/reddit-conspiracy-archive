<p>Reddit&#39;s and r/politics&#39; blatant manipulation should be obvious to most of you but I&#39;ll provide evidence below of my individual case. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>No search results come up when you search for &quot;Jacob Schwartz,&quot; just some off-topic threads.
<a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/mr8.jpg">http://i.magaimg.net/img/mr8.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>My comment with the phrase &quot;Jacob Schwartz&quot; is there when I see it, but no one else. Pretty inflammatory but no responses and no downvotes. <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/mr9.jpg">http://i.magaimg.net/img/mr9.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Direct link to the thread to verify: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6dmedt/de_blasio_staffer_rising_democrat_caught_with/">https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6dmedt/de_blasio_staffer_rising_democrat_caught_with/</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that someone mentioned that bots kept trying to post this article but it kept getting removed. I can only assume that those submissions had &quot;Jacob Schwartz&quot; in the title and mine didn&#39;t. Searching for &quot;De Blasio&quot; is missing my submission as well, although somewhat recent submissions do appear. All those times Reddit&#39;s search function has been absolute garbage? I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s because they directly manipulate the results, seemingly at times on a case-by-case basis. Google does it, why not Reddit? </p>

<p>Feel free to prove my points wrong or further them.</p>

<p>Sure, which makes me wonder why in every single article I can find, he isn&#39;t directly named, except for a single article from an apparently anime-leaning news site.</p>

<p><a href="http://animeright.news/zanting/de-blasio-administrations-jacob-schwartz-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges">http://animeright.news/zanting/de-blasio-administrations-jacob-schwartz-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges</a></p>

<p>Strange.</p>

<p>Regardless, see my other post. Stories at 0 points after 6 hours have passed are instantly removed, and are thus removed from the search engine. It doesn&#39;t matter that I can&#39;t find his name specifically, you won&#39;t be able to use any string to get to those submissions because they&#39;ve been removed.</p>

<p>And again, my COMMENT was shadowbanned and I&#39;ve yet to see any explanation why certain comments are targeted. My only explanation is that they have certain keywords, and in this case, it was &quot;Jacob Schwartz.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said. I said it was funny for someone that posts on one of the most insane and hateful subs in existence to be calling out another sub for being insane and hateful.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re blaming the actions of an entire sub on a single user. That&#39;s like calling an admin that&#39;s posted in td a racist. There&#39;s no irony. These types of comments add no value to discussions. Your judgement of TD ironically casts you in the same boat as the user you were trying to shame out of this discussion because of his associations. Fun fact for you, we have freedom of association in America buddy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I asked the mods why my post  was placed under &quot;bot removal&quot; and received this response (don&#39;t mind my awful grammar):</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/mrs.jpg">http://i.magaimg.net/img/mrs.jpg</a></p>

<p>So basically any story that goes against their narrative is downvoted to 0, most likely by bots, it never reaches rising or the front page, and then they add an arbitrary rule that removes the post after 6 hours. </p>

<p>They could&#39;ve left it at that but they add:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At that point, the thread has run its course and is very hard to find in the subreddit. Either way, your story is off topic for r/politics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thread has run its course? What? It&#39;s hard to find so they make it IMPOSSIBLE to find by deleting it, and they somehow claim it&#39;s off topic. I&#39;m laughing typing this because it&#39;s just so absolutely ridiculous. I&#39;m baffled by their ability to operate freely in such a brazenly corrupt fashion yet be so incompetent and self-incriminating at the same time. </p>

<p>Your submission and the other submission are currently at 0, will be removed including removal from any searches, and then POOF, it&#39;s like it was never there at all. </p>
