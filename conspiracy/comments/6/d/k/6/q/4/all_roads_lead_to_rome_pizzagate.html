<p>Charges of teen rape against <strong>Trump</strong> dropped twice. Attorney: &quot;Jane Doe has received numerous threats today&quot; -- Oct 2016</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A woman who has filed federal lawsuits accusing Donald Trump of raping her two decades ago, when she was 13, abruptly canceled a news conference Wednesday at which she was to detail her extraordinary claims against the GOP presidential nominee.</p>

<p>In the most recent suit, Trump&#39;s accuser asserts that while she was exploring a [...] career in 1994, she attended a series of parties at the Manhattan home of prominent investor <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. She alleges that during those parties the real estate mogul tied her to a bed and raped her.</p>

<p>Trump’s Labor nominee oversaw ‘sweetheart plea deal’ in billionaire’s underage sex case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Donald Trump&#39;s new nominee for secretary of labor, <strong>Alexander Acosta</strong>, could face a grilling in the Senate over claims that — while he was the top federal prosecutor in Miami — he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls.</p>

<p>As the U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, Acosta agreed not to file any federal charges against the wealthy financier, <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, if he pled guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>

<p>Epstein ultimately received an 18-month sentence in county jail and served about 13 months — treatment that provoked outrage from alleged victims in the case.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a lousy concoction.. Trump&#39;s a part of it! Pizzagate started years earlier with the Silsby scandal and was solidified with the Podesta email leaks. Stone&#39;s comments are simply insurance for effective damage control. They knew the DNC emails would be leaked before they were leaked, it was probably the same in this situation too. The circumstantial evidence and connections are damning and plentiful.</p>

<p>Fun fact: Alefantis, the pizza shop owner, is privy to the sam security-free art-smuggling channels that the Rothchilds are privy to. Can&#39;t link, but it&#39;s on voat...</p>

<p>No, that many are <strong>reported missing.</strong> To quote the source you link, &quot;The vast majority of these cases are resolved within hours.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are onto something. I think Roger Stone, Assange, Trump and Epstein are the Grand Masters of this pedophile ring and are deflecting blame to Podestra. I started researching this and all roads lead to them. Notice how the rape charges against Assange were quietly dropped. Probably because Stone took photos of Assange&#39;s persecutors while they were doi ng disgusting things to children. Trump has not been adverse to making sexual comments to children. They are involved in this up to their necks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything that says Trump was directly involved in a ring. But while searching I did just learn that Epstein just settled another case this past May 4th in which a woman made allegations that he &quot;used her as a sex slave&quot; / &quot;pimped her out,&quot; depending on the source. She was initially approached at the Mar-a-Lago, [maybe pimped out there?]</p>
