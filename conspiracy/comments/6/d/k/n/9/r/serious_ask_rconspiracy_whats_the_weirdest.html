       Basically masonic information and other alternative reality stuff that I had no way to understand at the time.  I think it had a great deal to do with my huge curiosity about the world and it shaped a lot of decisions I've made subconsciously (now consciously). But as I learn more now, everything is like recalling what I was told then.  Like truths were implanted in me.  I can't say specifics cause my memory around all of it is very dreamy though.

       That is a valid question. But I was actually under surveillance, and I deserved to be. However, once I knew my mind played all kinds of tricks on me. Made me realize they could do a great deal of good suppressing crime by just letting people know they are there haha. Like, you're paranoid anyway right? I see these gangstalking things and at first I was like that is silly. But that is exactly what it was. Bear in mind, I've been sober for many years. And my life is radically different now.

       Oh I believe you. A ... uh, friend ... used to live in a house with many roommates who dealt in various substances. Some of the roommates thought they were under surveillance, and some thought that was  paranoid. Spoiler alert: many years later, it was confirmed the house WAS under surveillance - an undercover cop lived on the same street and reported the very obvious traffic.

        UFO:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ~1987 or so, I was in Civil Air Patrol, I was in about ~7th grade... we met during the evenings at the Truckee air port, near lake Tahoe, ca. Our squad leader was an ex-mechanic on the SR-71 and was father to one of the other kids in our group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were out doing marching exercises around the hangars, and it was ~7:30pm or so and was fairly dark. We turned the corner around the hangar we had our office in, and down the way, off in the distance we could seethe mountain range, and it was a very bright moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw a light rise up from beyond the mountains and it flew up pretty straight, but the light stayed bright and steady, and as Civil Air Patrol is essential "youth air force" we were all interested in what type of plane we were seeing, and we tried to guess. Then it stopped at a certain elevation - then it flew directly at us. very fast.it got close and hovered above us, and was the typical triangle with three glowing circular lights at the points. Our commander shouted at us all and made us run back inside the office. He wouldn't speak about that incident after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Weird People
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wen I was ~17, I had just got hold of the original "Cooper Report" and we were all sharing and reading that thing like mad in our conspiracy-group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to hang out at this particular coffee shop a lot, after school, when we cut assemblies, after martial arts... we were always there.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day, relatively shortly after we had all been reading and talking about the cooper report, among a bunch of other things we were into this man comes out (large man, late 40s) and says "Sarah_Connor." I say "Who's asking?", he "Say's 'Remember me?'" -- "uh... no, who are you?" -- he says "Where are you going?" -- "Don't know yet, why?" -- "Which way are you going?" -- "Why are you askin me this, who are you?" -- "Well, I am going to go back into that coffee shop and sit at that booth over there, when you remember who I am, come back in, sit down and lets have a chat."
      </p>
      <p>
       I noped the fuck out of there. I had ~3 other friends standing there with me when this happened, he acted like they didn't even exist.

       I have many others, but want to hear some of yours as well.

       What if organ/blood harvesting from children DOES extend life greatly if injected/transplanted into older beings. What if the abductions are based on blood/tisue/genetic matches, and hallucinatory-tech is used to make people see "aliens" if they happened to be returned after some bio-component is harvested/tested on them.... :-) thats some fun conspiracy-fiction-writin-prompt-material.

       Thanks for sharing.  I had a similar run in with what was most likely the TR-3B.  I had just learned about the ship and only a few weeks later in CO Springs "saw one."  Talk about some serious Baader-Meinhof phenomenon in action.

       I'm sorry but I'm a bit skeptical of some of your claims. Your martial arts experiences sound like they are straight out of/belong in some low budget Chinese martial arts movie from the 80's. Could you explain a bit more in detail your training practices and what exactly it is that you experienced with less mysticism and dramatization?

       Phone at my dad's work was tapped once when I was a kid. He even called me over to teach me what it sounded like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two years ago I also got stingray-ed but the cops who set it up messed up so instead of hearing my own call I could hear other people's conversations on my phone. The use of said stingray in that area in the time I was in it was confirmed by local police 6 months later.

       What area? I am really interested in trying to figure out a way to create a mobile app that will be able to map out stingray locations. We were building an internal RTLS cellular system based on RSSI in large office buildings a few years ago for Salesforce... but I dont know of a way to ID (aside from the faulty install) if a device in sting-ray'd or not... Any ideas?

       As for whether it's stingrayed or not, there'd be no way to tell unless it's actively happening. You'd need some way for the phone to be able to check if it's connecting to a real cell tower or not, and to alert the user if it has a signal but is NOT connected to a valid/registered tower.

       So there are factory methods in each cellphoe where you can get the tower ID and RSSI and other data from the tower... what is needed is an app that actively logs ALL that data with the GPS location of the phone regularly and pushes it to a DB in AWS - and you keep capturing all that data, and you compare geo-loc from al the phones and the towers they see/connect to when within that cells signal domain - the app should be able, after time, to "know" which tower it should be connected to based on GPS as it moves into and out f each cell... you get an alert if the phone connects to the non-predicted cell signature.

       Just grabbing as much data as possible should leave plenty of parse-able info to find a fingerprint.  But it would be much faster to just get your hands on an actual stingray.

       Naw, the process of finding her was a whole separate mindf-ck.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR
-Looked for a "real" psychic for several weeks to test if metaphysics are real (I was atheist 17 yrs.)
-Lots of fakes and frauds
-Found cool looking metaphysics/crystals/bookstore next to old-school amusement park
-Psychics giving readings inside unexpectedly
-I really want to talk to one but don't want to pay
-Middle-aged woman with crazy silver hair and bright blue eyes taps me on my shoulder and asks if I want to talk
-She tells me a lot of stuff, no charge, asks me to come back when I feel like it and gives me her personal number
      </p>

       Just the perfect experience that I hoped/prayed/thought/willed for.

       Your post just reminded me of someone who kind of suggested I go to a psychic a while back, and I hadn't really thought much of it before.  But now that I do, it was probably related to some other (similar) things.

       It wasn't that serious. Mostly for download and sharing of various OS images, software, music, movies, etc. The concerning part was the speed at which they would call as if they were already watching. Even after moving to new locations and staying under the radar.

       Okay, so here's one that is relatively benign that I haven't mentioned elsewhere, mostly because it's just a random strange occurrence.  But perhaps interesting nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have entertained the thought that I may have had something to do with the Iranian drone hijacking, in 2011.  I was working in Dubai for, let's say, a company that seemed to have some interesting connections.  During this time, I had a handful of experiences that had already convinced me there was some targeting going on, and I was beginning to become pretty nonplussed about the whole situation.  I still can't say who was responsible, but that's another story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, on a trip to the Burj, I was chatting with my co-workers about the feasibility of some geolocation software and I mentioned that civilian GPS can be spoofed.  This is true, and public knowledge, since it had been done years before then.  I didn't really know the exact mechanics of it, just that it was possible.  But my idea was that if you spoof a GPS signal, then you can use standard GPS hardware (in, say, a smartphone) as a custom tracking device.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, it was just a random conversation in a public location.  And it's not much of a secret -- something any good hacker with some resources could likely pull off.  But a short time later, Iran apparently used a similar method to hijack that fancy stealth drone.  And I kind of find the timing and proximity of it to be a tad bit coincidental.  Maybe so.  Or maybe not.

       UFOs
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger, roughly 12 years old or so I had my buddy from Florida come up and visit for the summer. He, my cousin and I were all good friends. We decided one night to go camping in my woods (~8 acres or so).
      </p>
      <p>
       We played board games and shit for a few hours before we decided to hit the hay. My cousin had fallen asleep first and my friend and I were trying to fall asleep. Suddenly we heard a very strange sound - best way I can describe it is like the old school ufo sound, like woo-woo-woo (you get the point lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       Above us we could see lights over our tent - Orange, yellow, white, blue etc. And they were in a circular fashion. We had the top of the tent closed so we couldn't  see outside unfortunately. I asked my friend if he could see and hear what I'm seeing and hearing and he said yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were going to hop up and run out of the tent to see what it was, but we could not move from the neck down. I could turn my head and so could he as we looked at each other terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
       It disappeared as fast as it appeared and as soon as it was gone we were able to move again. When we got out of the tent we both had a weird feeling of time passing quicker than it actually was. I'm not exactly sure how to explain it though. The moon seemed to change position each time we looked at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should add that no drugs were consumed that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a hard story to tell for some reason and I'm not sure why, but when I do tell it my eyes water up and I get that 'full of dread' feeling. Idk it was strange and I wish we could have been able to see what the hell was above us that night.

       There was a PDF posted a few years back that was talking about thought weapons and it was a  really long PDF - I cant recall what it was called, but it was very detailed and talked about the technologies they used to inject toughts into peoples heads... it was named/worded in a semi-whacky fashion but was amazing reading... hav any clue what I am talking about? I posted it to this /r/ after another user had posted it some place else on reddit, he thanked me for reposting it as it needed to get seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Are you familiar with Barnaby Jack? He was going to demo a weapon that could kill, remotely, anyone with a pacemaker? He "ODd" on drugs four days before his tech talk on the matter.... He also was the one who showed that he could hack many med-tech devices in hospitals...

       There's an ex-gov't hacker who sold the device used to jackpot the ATM in Terminator 2 to James Cameron. He also sells mind control protection equipment. While I don't believe any of the current tech can be shielded against, I do believe that Cameron is aware of psychotronics and that this awareness is demonstrated in his films: Strange Days is about EEG-cloning of experiences from one individual to another, Avatar is all about EEG-cloning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to frequent this hacker's website (he still sells a variation on the ATM jackpotter and is proud that he sold Cameron the version used in the film) as he would frequently have cool new inventions like metal detector sneakers, gambling machine jackpotters, a device that could control how fast your electric meter spins from inside your house, etc. I was always puzzled by the paranormal and mind control stuff he had. I was dismissive of it, and confused as all the other tech was legit and I thought it was all bullshit. Seeing that site may have saved me when I first got v2k, as I knew, in the back of my mind, that this stuff goes on.

       Interesting stuff. I also noticed in a Tarantino film (Grindhouse, I believe) there's a scene where a character is standing in front of a rack of magazines and one is titled "Psychotronics."
      </p>
      <p>
       The only really long .pdf on mind control I can think of that might fit that description would be "The Matrix Deciphered." It's spot-on but the author's either a total asshole or the guy on Facebook claiming to be him is. I guess it really doesn't matter. The information is accurate and he and I heard many of the same things word-for-word. He was first told they were a satanic cult, then Russians, then aliens, then the CIA. I was first told they were evil spirits, then Russians, then aliens, then the CIA. Truth is stranger than fiction.

       NSA and AT&amp;T in the 90's. Worked at a call center with a lot of people who also worked in the large Reno AT&amp;T office. Out drinking one night and one of them starts talking crazy about how the govt. records all phone traffic in the US. This was when I was 18 long before I ever went down the conspiracy rabbit hole. To see a lot of it validated along with some of the militia ramblings from the early '90s has been interesting.

       ive been following echelon since the 80s...

       the first cisco 3640 i inherited in 1997, i need to retrieve the enable pw.. will never forget what that pw was "feet4monkey"
      </p>
      <p>
       the ccie i hired to help me recover that password was telling me about hw cisco was required to include back-doors in all their equipment for the NSA... this was in 1997
      </p>
      <p>
       then snowden leaks pics of the nsa interception plant where they get devices in transit, open them up and install vulns into the devices being shipped wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically that simple leak alone should have had every single foreign government in the world throwing their cisco gear in the trash....
      </p>
      <p>
       whats crazy, is that we recenty learned how the CIA is actually playing the bumbling idiot role, (well, we all knew that was their ploy forever - but the run EVErYtHINg - bush cabal and all that) -- and they have more zero-days than anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I wonder is who has more leverage over whom: CIA over Mossad, or the reverse?
      </p>
      <p>
       When i was revealed that we share all intel with israel (and MOST of the high-end spy tech comes from israel, I assume israel is the Master in the IC space, on one hand -- but given that the US owns actual SPACE, I would assume the intel we share with five-eyes and israel in specific
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be calculated to see where the leaks/fractures are....
      </p>
      <p>
       EXCEPT; stuxnet. if you watch zero days documentary they talk about israel basically going rogue and deploying it via compromised contractors as the facility was air-gapped, and israel let stuxnet get out before the US wanted it to be and they let it spread.

       full 5d chess going on right now - think of it like the early stages of a much more complex risk game. rather than placing your traditional armies on the game-board in the various territories, the territorial borders are at times, unknown, already compromised and known to be, or not known to be - or the boundaries are not know and everyone is currently placing their pieces.

       Pretty sure the EU was all about simplifying control of national banks on an administrative/clerical level for the people who run them. It's gotta be a bitch when your family/cabal is trying to run the economy of multiple nations all using separate currencies, interest rates and languages .

       I mentioned earlier that I met a guy in starbucks and we started talking about spooks - and I told him that I think that the crazy evil ones are bred and are a function of the human trafficking problem... its not like the guy you sat next to in 8th grade and played with during recess grew up to just become some evil psycho who throws people out of helicopters and gets off on torturing anyone they can...

       I mean, I'm sure, given just how huge their ops are, that there are plenty of compartmentalized people in the alphabet agencies with good intentions and all that, but the real spooky spooks?  Scum.

       Who knows?  It's just my hunch, I suppose.  I don't necessarily even believe in karma, or anything, but I don't think karma requires my belief...

      <p>
       I do think behaving badly is often its own punishment in the long term, whether you want to call that karma or not.

       See my update above about 4th dimensional beings...
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to do night excercises out in the wild, where one team had to hunt another team in complete stealth. This was before I discovered the mode for my self...
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the top guys I trained with, Eric, was on the other team - I was stealthily (I thought) making my way toward where I thought some of the other team was, I stopped, it was dark, but the moon was out so there was some visibility, and as I moved between these boulders, I put my left hand on the large boulder to my left, took a step forward, and then transfered my balance-anchor to my right hand as I placed it on the boulder to my right...
      </p>
      <p>
       The the 'Boulder' reached out and wrapped its arm around my neck and took me down silently. That 'Boulder' that I put my hand on was Eric. 5th dan fucking bad ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       He later said that he was looking me directly in the eye as I placed my hand on his knee and tried to creep past him, as I thought he was a boulder....

       This one happened several years ago and it's not the weirdest one, but it's in the top 5 and it was more than just me, so there's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 20+ years ago... My sis and I decided to drive to Sedona for the day with her daughter (the kidlet had just turned 3yrs) as my sis, somehow, hadn't been there yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were about to begin the drive home when the sis asked where Schnebley Hill Road went, what was it, etc., so we took a left with the intent of heading up Schnebley Hill for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       After driving for a few miles, the pavement ended and became a well-driven dirt road and we drove along slowly, both checking out the scenery (my niece was sound asleep by then). The road was getting rougher, we're barely going along at maybe 5mph because close to the ground sports car and we hadn't spoken in a bit as we're both looking around (t-tops were off) and observing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking I was seeing some things that weren't possible up in the cliffs of the mountain across the way and then I saw a bird that absolutely didn't belong in this time/space take off from a hole in one of the cliff-type things in the mountain. My sis stopped the car and we both just looked at each other, becoming aware of the complete silence surrounding us. She finally asked if I'd seen anything. Shit. It wasn't just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last mile or so, we'd both been seeing what appeared to be cave people up in the cliffs and the bird can only be described as a petrodactyl, but who knows wtf it actually was (never heard or seen anything like it before or since then). We realized we also didn't know how long it'd been since we'd seen another car on the road or even off to the side with people taking pics and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       We got out and put the tops on and then discussed how to proceed once we were completely back inside the car (windows up and doors locked) We weren't sure wtf happened or how/when we jumped timelines and landed in something resembling prehistoric time, we just knew we were in a place we didn't belong and really
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       stood out because of the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       We decided turning around and going back the same way didn't seem like a very good idea, so we kept driving forward thinking we'd find civilization again at some point. The road finally dumped us out a few miles out of Flagstaff and added an another 2.5hrs to the 2ish hours it would've taken from Sedona on top of the 3.0hrs it took to drive out of there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That day still comes up every now and then and it's one of those things where you're glad someone else was there; so many things happen and it's just
       <em>
        you,
       </em>
       so having another person along for the experience was a nice change.

       We were thankful then, and remain so to this day, the experience was literally shared. The drive home was a combination of some very loud unspoken back and forth along with actual discussion of
       <em>
        did that really happen
       </em>
       (like we were going to somehow be able to talk ourselves out of everything we'd just seen/heard - lol). To this day, the only "logical" explanation is we somehow jumped timelines and entered a different time/space.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one of those things that needed to happen to get both of our attention as we'd recently began waking up and that took it to a level that made it a lot easier to take in info that would've been otherwise disregarded as too far out there without having lived that particular experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to say too much here as far as family lines go, so I'll just say we've both always known we're different. Part of it was because we were simply told that while the balance came from general experiences growing up. Otherwise, we both just thought that's how it was, and no big deal; a couple of them are very similar and then we both have things that are unique to each of us. Again, no biggie, as neither of us knows any different due to those traits always being part of us, just like regular senses/abilities are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That experience was one of the catalysts that took place during that time that shook us both awake; it wasn't familial lineage that needed investigation, nothing was what it seemed and we needed to find out wtf we were dealing with and what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll PM you another one that's happened fairly recently and currently has the #1 slot for things that shook my snow globe something fierce and sent me down a rabbit hole I'd been noping out of as that shit couldn't possibly be real since I'd first heard of it 20yrs ago. It's since been moved into the "real" column.

       We're 4th gen Phoenicians and not much that happens here surprises at this point, but nothing - I mean nothing - could've prepared me for that experience. I've found it doesn't matter what someone thinks they're ready for; it's a jolt when it happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just came up within the last couple of weeks as my sis decided to share it with some of her friends/neighbors who are older - like in their 60s - and none of them believed her even though they've commented often about the weirdness that happens when she hangs with them vs when she's not around.
      </p>
      <p>
       She ended up calling me on speaker and all she said was, "hey, remember that time we drove to Sedona with (my niece)," and before she said anything else, I said, "you mean when we time-tripped back to Land of the Lost?" They're still struggling to wrap their minds around it because it's so out of the norm of their realms of understanding, yet the way we describe what happened driving up the hill is so similar, it's difficult to just write it off.

       are you familiar with Jung? In one of his books(Memories, dreams, reflections)  he tells how he lived a similar expertience: he spent several hours visiting an old church and the next day when he came back to show the church to his assistant the church was just a bunch of old ruins because that church was destroyed centuries ago.

       Not really conspiracy related but this is a story that happened to a close friend of mine: he was running by the Seine, close to the Notre Dame Cathedral. It was around 8 or 9 PM and something he noticed  while he  was running is how empty the place was (is full of tourists and locals at that time) . As he was running he saw  a woman, with normal clothes, nothing out of the ordinary in her appearance,  in front of him coming his way. As they  were getting closer he noticed something weird, couldnt see her face, and as he was approaching her  still couldnt see her face because she had no face, nothing. 
The precise moment they crossed each other was beside a big streetlight, and he could see under the light that she had no face, nothing, no mouth, no nose, no holes in the places her nose or eyes should be...He couldnt sleep for the next 2 days, and we still dont know what was that

       This will be buried.. but when I was around 8 I saw a floating white orb in my bathroom.. it gave off a subtle white glow to the room around it..
      </p>
      <p>
       Being the kid I was I just stared at it for at least a minute.. then I left to go grab a bat cause I wasn't sure what it was.. when I got back the orb was gone and that was the end of it..

       What appeared to be a homless man pushing a cart up a hill on the sidewalk at 2 a.m. verbally spoke the literal thought that I was thinking a moment before he appeared. After he said it he laughed and kept walking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I did not write the thought down at the time I don't remember the exact wording but it was something like, "Someone could come up behind me and steal my shit".
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think the dude was telepathic and read my thought and then laughed at it because he did not intend to rob me.

       So there are factory methods in each cellphoe where you can get the tower ID and RSSI and other data from the tower... what is needed is an app that actively logs ALL that data with the GPS location of the phone regularly and pushes it to a DB in AWS - and you keep capturing all that data, and you compare geo-loc from al the phones and the towers they see/connect to when within that cells signal domain - the app should be able, after time, to "know" which tower it should be connected to based on GPS as it moves into and out f each cell... you get an alert if the phone connects to the non-predicted cell signature.

       Yeah, as best as I can recall that's pretty much it. And recall that this was in Tahoe, very near the Nevada border, could have easily flown up from groom lake in moments...

       are you familiar with Jung? In one of his books(Memories, dreams, reflections)  he tells how he lived a similar expertience: he spent several hours visiting an old church and the next day when he came back to show the church to his assistant the church was just a bunch of old ruins because that church was destroyed centuries ago.
