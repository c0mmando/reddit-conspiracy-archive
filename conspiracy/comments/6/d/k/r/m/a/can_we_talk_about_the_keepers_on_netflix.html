       The show is about the Catholic Church, child sex abuse, and a puzzling murder. It's gripping. Really. Very well done documentary-style series with lots of twists and turns and things that'll make you sick. There's nothing happy here aside from old women and their relationship with their puppers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's an underlying message throughout the whole thing that I did not expect from the same Netflix that published
       <em>
        Dear White People
       </em>
       , and that message is: The Catholic Church rules over all. Specifically in the last episode, you see a man trying to pass a bill to extend the statute of limitations and he was informed by a senator that the Catholic Church stepped in and said "this bill cannot pass." The bill did not pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad music begins to play over a text explanation of what's happening with this man and his bill and the tone of the music added to the text gave me the sense of "you do not fuck with this church. All hope is lost. They make the rules."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wondering if anyone else has been watching this show and getting the same underlying tones and vibes as I've been getting from it. The filmmakers seem to be just as distressed as the audience and the show's subjects about the disgusting amount of power the Catholic Church has over these cases.

       But this morning Netflix won't allow the last episode to play. Says that an error occurred. Every other show works totally fine... beyond frustrating!

       Can we talk about Sharon May? What are her ties? How long has she been covering shit up? This was a well put together documentary but it seems like they are skirting around the part where politicians also took part in raping the girls. I'm surprised it's on Netflix too. Maybe it's on there to discourage people for coming out and telling what happened to them because nothing is going to be done about it. That's my guess, anyways.

       Man Sharon May was weird as fuck. I got the feeling like the producers knew she was stonewalling them hard and her smug little look the whole time said it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't remember any mention of politicians doing the raping but I remember the police were raping and I have a feeling the FBI was in on it too.

       Totally. I wonder how many skeletons are in her closet? Possibly literally ha. As far as the politicians, when one of the investigator ladies was talking about who was involved in the sex ring she said, priests, cops, business owners, and POLITICIANS. Then nothing else was mentioned about it. I'd like to know which politicians she was referring to.

       Red sports car?!? She was a obvious liar. Denied seeing pornographic photos or the contents of the meticulous abuse writings that were buried.
