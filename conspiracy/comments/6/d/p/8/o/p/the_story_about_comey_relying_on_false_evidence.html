        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TL:DR included at the end. Please forgive the impressive length, but this is important. So <a href="http://archive.is/vDqYr">this</a> story has been hot this week and confusing the fuck out of everyone. There are four essential components to this story and I&#39;m going to explain how this shows they are at the end of their rope. The four components are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There is an email floating around that showed Debie Wasserman Shultz received an email between Loretta Lynch and a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria during the campaign and that email shows that Lynch conspired with Hillary&#39;s staff to kill the FBI investigation (&quot;she wouldn&#39;t let it get too far&quot;). <em>This is the only truthful part of the story. Everything else has been added because they *</em>must** convince you that the impending Lynch email leak has been faked by the Russians.*</p></li>
<li><p>That email was fake news created by Russia in order to create the appearance of collusion between the DOJ and Hillary. <em>This is the part they need to accept.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Comey knew it was fake, but relied on it to bypass DOJ on the Hillary investigation when he made the &quot;no reasonable prosecutor&quot; press conference (note: this has nothing to do with the letter reopening the case). <em>Comey&#39;s original claim was that he knew he had to take action on the fake email because otherwise the Russians would spread it around after the case was closed.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Congress held a hearing to find out why Comey made the unprecedented decision to bypass the DOJ and make his announcement that Hillary was &quot;extremely careless&quot; but that no reasonable prosecutor would take the case. <strong>Importantly, during closed session with members of congress he presented the Lynch email as the reason he had to do what he did.</strong> Trey Gowdy later made a TV appearance and said that Comey knew something that the rest of us didn&#39;t that justified his actions - he was referring to the Lynch email. Another member of congress asked Comey about the email in open session and Comey said he could only discuss that in a closed setting. <em>This is why this story is so confusing. *</em>This bizzare piece of the story is designed to make you tacitly believe that the Lynch email to Wasserman Shultz was fake by distracting you with more inexplicable Comey news.** Think about it, why did he lie to Congress? <strong>Why not just explain that he knew it was fake then, but unless he stepped in, the Russians were going to spread the fake email anyway? Also, why wouldn&#39;t the Russians have still spread it around to make the DOJ and Hillary look corrupt AF?</strong> That was the intent, right?* None of this makes any sense unless the Lynch-Shultz emails were real and the DNC was only just now confident that they can pull off the big lie.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The reason this has been confusing is that both WaPo and CNN are reporting it and it makes Comey look bad. If their story is true, that would mean Comey mislead Congress and undermined his own reasons for interfering in the DOJ&#39;s case, unnecessarily thrusting himself into the center of this political hurricane for no reason. The answer: that&#39;s <strong>the best they can come up with because too many facts are out there.</strong> Lies have to account for all know facts in order to work and this is their last chance to sway the public before the hammer drops. The Lynch email is out there (probably waiting to be released) and unless they take action to delegitimize it, Lynch and possibly Hillary are facing a slam dunk obstruction of justice charge. Comey intentionally botched the Hillary email case so that even Gowdy probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to get a conviction. For a good rundown of how Comey intentionally wrecked the possibility of creating a case against Hillary, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6dhxob/comeys_firing_was_the_pivotal_moment_of_the_deep">see this post from a The_Donald user</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what we know: there was an email intercepted from Debbie Wasserman Schultz claiming that Loretta Lynch had been in private communication with a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria during the campaign. <a href="http://archive.is/uw3UD">The WaPo story</a> also alleges that the email was sent to Leonard Benardo, an official with the Open Society Foundations. The email was real, but the fact that it was sent to George Soros was probably added to make it seem even less credible. A good summary can be found <a href="http://rickwells.us/clinton-aide-denied-allegations-collusion-loretta-lynch-not-really/">here</a>. This is where the truth ends. The rest of the story is cover.</p>

<p>Comey cited the Lynch emails as his reason for making the &quot;no reasonable prosecutor&quot; press conference and allegedly locking DOJ out of the process. In that <a href="http://archive.is/tCSHz">NYT Comey love-fest article</a> a few months ago, it was said that Comey didn&#39;t tell Lynch what he was about to do before that press conference -* he decided the public wouldn&#39;t trust her after her Tarmac meeting and he had to step up and take action to preserve public confidence in the justice department.* <strong>All of that was a lie.</strong> Comey was really covering Lynch&#39;s ass because she refused to recuse herself. Perhaps the next in line would have recommended prosecution? Either way, Lynch was not going to let Hillary risk an indictment and as long as she didn&#39;t recuse herself, she had the final say. Comey gave Lynch cover when he claimed that no reasonable prosecutor (i.e. Lynch) would take the case and prevented her from having to make a decision in this case. <em>If it was her decision not to prosecute, she would have been further committing a crime by taking an official action (other than recusal) in a criminal case she had been implicated in.</em></p>

<p>So Comey said his hands were tied because of the email and because of the tarmac meeting. He said this to congressional members in their closed classified hearings and he never suggested that the emails were fake. He was questioned about the emails in an open hearing too and he simply referred to their classified discussion. Why would he lie to Congress about his reasons for making an end-run around DOJ? <strong>This is the takeaway the DNC is willing to live with -- as long as you also believe the Lynch emails were fakes created by Russia.</strong> Comey is already compromised and they don&#39;t have any other option. Congress and Trump already have the Lynch emails, so this is their last resort. That&#39;s why this story sounds so strange.</p>

<p>So the best story they can come up with is that the Russians created the emails implicating Lynch and Hillary&#39;s staff in a conspiracy to obstruct justice AND <strong>that Comey knew they were fake all along but didn&#39;t tell Congress!</strong> The MSM wants the headline to be &quot;Comey misled Congress!&quot; but the real story is that Lynch and Hillary colluded to kill the FBI investigation. If Comey knew they were fake, but he used them as a justification for throwing himself into a political train wreck and then lied to Congress about them in a classified setting, then Comey really is nuts. He used fake Russian propoganda as an excuse to steal the spotlight, accuse Hillary of being careless, and then essentially pardon her. Then he misled Congress when they asked about why he bypassed DOJ? Why the fuck would he do that? The answer: he wouldn&#39;t - the emails are real and this story reflects just how little rope Hillary and Lynch have left to hold onto.</p>

<p>Finally, this might explain the behind the scenes panic over the Alwan Bros. They apparently spied on 20+ DNC members over several years and they just ran of with tons of data to Pakistan. The rumor is that they have been blackmailing the DNC. Perhaps the DNC is afraid that the Alwan Bros. can prove that the Lynch emails weren&#39;t fake. <strong>Perhaps Debbie Wasserman Shulz&#39;s laptop has that evidence (she was the recipient of the Lynch email, by the way) and this would explain why Debbie was willing to go nuts on the Capital Police to get her laptop back - even if it made her look like a maniac on TV.</strong> I have heard that the Capitol police caved and returned the laptop. If that is true, then it explains the timing of the Comey lied story. Debbie recovers the laptop and they check it thoroughly to see whether there is any trace of the Lynch email. They realize that the laptop doesn&#39;t have anything that could corroborate the Lynch email and that means it is safe for them to finally run with the story that they were Russian fakes all along. Perhaps this means they&#39;ve neutralized the Alwan Bros. as well?</p>

<p>TLDR: The DNC is at the end of their rope. Comey didn&#39;t rely on a fake Loretta Lynch email created by the Russians when he interfered in the DOJ Hillary email case - he knew the Lynch cover-up email was real at the time and when he testified to Congress. It is only now that the DNC believes they&#39;ve cleaned up enough evidence to claim that the Lynch email was fake from the beginning. The entire Comey-used-fake-evidence is a story designed to trick you into believing the evidence was fake. This seems plausible because no one likes Comey and, at this point, nothing alleged about him is too implausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very sensible stringing together of everything. What I come away with is the ridiculous dog-n-pony show of which Comey has been the center, as you state:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Comey knew they were fake, but he used them as a justification for throwing himself into a political train wreck and then lied to Congress about them in a classified setting, then Comey really is nuts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s settling in deeper for me is that they only have to win the public perception and opinion battle; they don&#39;t have to fear any real &quot;justice&quot; because most of the congressmen and judges who would do anything are bought-off, threatened or blackmailed for their own shit. He just has to get on CSPAN and look reasonable, while they can truly be &quot;nuts&quot; with impunity. Congress isn&#39;t going to do a damn thing about him or anything surrounding this.</p>
