        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">435</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-26 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CelineHagbard.html">CelineHagbard</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been active on this sub for about three years now, mostly as a user, but recently as a mod as well. I&#39;ve been studying conspiracy theory of one sort or another for almost a decade. This is not an authoritative guide, but a record of some of the things I&#39;ve picked up over the years which you may or may not find helpful. </p>

<h3>Upvotes and Comments</h3>

<p>The number of upvotes and replies a post or comment has is pretty much the worst way to judge something. Various agencies and organizations do hire shills and vote bots to influence social media, but even if they didn&#39;t, the wisdom of the crowd is only so good in a sub like this, where people&#39;s opinions are driven largely by media narratives from multiple political persuasions, each with their own agenda and/or personal bias. If you want to get closer to the truth, on any topic, you need to develop your own critical thinking faculties. This means examining the source of information, the credibility of that source, any ulterior motives that source may have, etc. </p>

<h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>

<p>This is an inherent cognitive bias we all have. You can&#39;t completely rid yourself of it, but you can learn to recognize it and compensate for it. If you find yourself upvoting a post or comment because you want it to be true before you apply critical thought to it, you&#39;re likely experiencing confirmation bias. The skeptical approach is one of the better ways to combat it: assume the opposite of your belief, try to tear down the argument presented as best you can, and if you cannot, you can place that argument in the &quot;tentatively true&quot; category. Familiarize yourself with other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">cognitive biases</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">logical fallacies</a>, primarily so you can find the fault in your own thinking, but also so you can put yourself in another user&#39;s shoes and see why they may think a certain way. But in general, try to avoid merely calling out a fallacy or bias; explain clearly why your argument avoids that fallacy.  </p>

<h3>The Nature of Certainty</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.<br/>
--<del>Aristotle</del> (Apparently <a href="http://publicnoises.blogspot.fi/2009/02/aristotle-and-accuracy.html">not Aristotle</a>, but still worth considering.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://amasci.com/freenrg/bead.html">Keep your bead on the wire</a>. In short, imagine a bead on a wire between 0 and 1—0 meaning complete disbelief and 1 being absolute certainty on any given hypothesis. The idea is that if you ever let your bead get all the way to one end or the other, it becomes very difficult to dislodge it. If you keep your bead somewhere in the middle, even if very close to one end, you will remain open to new information. </p>

<h3>Shills and Rule 10</h3>

<p>This will undoubtedly be a contentious point for many. I don&#39;t doubt the existence of shills, but that&#39;s not the point of Rule 10. If you don&#39;t know what I mean by shills, I mean users who are paid to push a narrative or disrupt and divide an online community. Check out <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/22/1112509/-The-Gentleperson-s-Guide-to-Forum-Spies">The Gentleman&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies</a> and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">this Intercept article on JTRIG</a> for more information. The article cites two self-identified purposes of JTRIG:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and<br/></li>
<li>to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Labeling another user as a shill would fall under JTRIG&#39;s mission—it&#39;s attempting to destroy someone&#39;s reputation so as to manipulate the discourse. It muddies the waters and slides the conversation at hand. It&#39;s also one of the weakest forms of argument. Feel free to spread information about shills in the general sense—it&#39;s very important that people know of their existence and tactics—but you&#39;re not winning the information war by calling users who disagree with you shills. </p>

<p>If you think you&#39;re talking to a shill, the best strategy is to present your argument clearly and calmly, point out any fallacies in their logic, and then walk away. To the extent they exist, they want to drag you into a fruitless conversation and waste your time. Continuing to engage or calling them out means they win; don&#39;t let them bait you. Aim for <a href="http://fablegod.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/disagreement-hierarchy.jpg">the top of the pyramid</a>.</p>

<h3>The /new Queue</h3>

<p>Given the prevalence of vote bots, brigades, and other voting patterns, if you&#39;re genuinely interested in discovering new information here, your best bet is to go to <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a>. If you&#39;re new to reddit, this is where you will find posts as they come in, unfiltered by any other opinions. Upvote the good, add to the conversation, and downvote the bad. As a reminder, we have a 2-day moratorium on new accounts posting here to cut down on spam.</p>

<h3>What This Sub Is and What It Isn&#39;t</h3>

<p>This sub is first and foremost a forum for open discussion. The range of subjects is somewhat intentionally left vague. We mods try not remove any content (other than that which breaks site-wide rules), yet we do moderate behavior that gets in the way of that open discussion. You may think that this sub has been &quot;taken over&quot; by one side of the political spectrum or the other, and from time to time it is. We have no control or recourse over voting bots, and we get brigaded from multiples sides frequently. </p>

<p>This sub might best be seen as a mess of obfuscation and disinformation where sometimes, the truth is able to slip through a crack. We can&#39;t fight that obfuscation without sealing the cracks. The best we can hope for is to catch a glimpse of that truth and help it find it&#39;s way to others. This sub is not and cannot be some beacon of truth, be it your truth or mine; at it&#39;s best, though, it can be the last large refuge on this site where that truth has a chance to live. </p>

<h3>What This Sub Can Be</h3>

<p>There are some smaller subs where the truth can dance and be free, yet has no wings to fly. Here, it must struggle just to breathe, let alone thrive, yet we do have some reach. This sub can only be what you choose to put into it and what you are able to get out of it. All I can ask, all I can hope, is that you enter as a student and a seeker of the truth, and that you put that ideal above your need to be right or your desire to change minds. </p>

<p>Not trying to attack the mod but it&#39;s a shame to see something posted here that isn&#39;t the typical reposted political stuff and it gets removed. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s still up and I&#39;m just blind please disregard. :)</p>

<p>You counter with an already negative outlook. Its prevalent within Reddit as a whole. You don&#39;t care for discussion only validation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t see why there&#39;d be an issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such an indecisive sentence. You make it as if you really don&#39;t know and are not sure of the ability to lobby upon the merits of the post. </p>

<p>This is something I for one see as failures upon the leadership structure within this moderation team. You can&#39;t agree on anything and your rules as so damn vague that its impossible to clarify it. </p>

<p>So in the spirit of Reddit mentality this mod team like so many others here just waits until there is backlash. Then it is time to talk about it. </p>

<p>Lol the tells me you are either not here for the community or you are not on a standard to communicate in a manner to which is better for your subscribers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a meme on the front page of Voat right now. </p>

<p>I am going to paraphrase it so you get the idea. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I tell you of all the problems within the world I am a conspiracy nut, reformer, and I I tell you who they are I am a Nazi. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You think about that mindset and how prolific it is here on this site. Look at the safe space they are trying to create within this subverse alone. </p>

<p>Such rules to hinder development. So what a person gets passionate and calls you names about something you said. </p>

<p>Honestly so what? Does it diminish the point of your post? Highly unlikely and the community of Voat protects its content creators. </p>

<p>These mods are on Voat as well on conspiracy. So I implore you to make your own on Voat. Give people the content whom will discuss it and will promote discussion. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t stay here in shackles and chained to them. </p>

<p>I will put it to you this was. I feel uneasy here. I know they will likely ban me or delete the comments first chance I screw up and they can claim it with a rule. </p>

<p>You also can&#39;t see what mods are deleting. On Voat you can. </p>

<p>One of the mods here also mods history on Voat. I made a submission about when Voat became Voat or at least got the name idea. Was a post from the creator of Voat and another were talking about the name.</p>

<p>Well it was deleted because it wasn&#39;t relevant they said. But for 1.3y before that not one deletion had been made. I happened to moderate the coontown equivalent on Voat at the time. </p>

<p>I mentioned it as a reason and they denied it. But fact still stands they play favorites here and over there. You will never have true discussion in this place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no fan of what spez did and spoke out against it at the time, but is this happening regularly? I&#39;ve seen no evidence of it. </p>

<p>Are votes manipulated here? Yes, that was literally the first point I made in this post. I can guarantee you if voat gets big enough to matter, the votes will be manipulated there, too. There&#39;s no software solution to the issue of vote manipulation on a forum that allows open, anonymous registration. Any sufficiently determined adversary can manipulate it. </p>

<p>Look, if you want to use and promote voat, I won&#39;t stop you. There are some features there I prefer, too, and reddit&#39;s far from perfect, but as it stands it&#39;s the largest platform of its kind. As soon as there&#39;s a viable decentralized alternative, I&#39;m there. But voat is not that, at least for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I promote the ideas of a non censored group. Currently that is Voat. I agree it isn&#39;t perfect in the slightest, but we are however actually able to ask things of admin and they are implemented. </p>

<p>We do NOT have vote skew where you can&#39;t tell if a post is being brigaded. We do have post view counters to actually tell if a post is popular. Many people do care about those points I don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I care about view counts on submissions I make. I also don&#39;t trust a bot that someone controls. The deletions logs within subverses and users who are banned by admin and the list of forbidden links is also something Reddit will not provide. </p>

<p>We have an admin that will fight for freedom of expression for conspiracy and the less desirable subverses just the same. Long as site rules are not broken. </p>

<p>Hell we had a user actually dox the admin of Voat once. They were not banned...well the main account the alts were later when it was discovered they were manipulating votes on posts and users demanded action. </p>

<p>You think about that level of commitment a CEO has for just a moment. </p>

<p>Do you think for even one moment just one that would have happened here? </p>

<p>You are a mod of conspiracy and you are part of one by being here. </p>

<p>You&#39;re free to call out or decisions in public as well, but it gets close to crossing the line when you insinuate or accuse a mod of being a shill or compromised (you didn&#39;t do that here; I&#39;m just speaking in general).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How Reddit Was Destroyed</p>

<p>Yes to the extent I can, I&#39;d like to prevent that. I assume you&#39;re specifically referring to rule 10? I still maintain that it keeps the discourse (slightly) above the shit-slinging shill accusations. I wrote a lengthy comment explaining how if I was running a shilling operation (the disrupt and divide type, not the candidate or company shilling), then what I&#39;d do is make constant shill accusations to slide conversations. I can try to dig it up if you want.</p>

<p>But on rule 10, I&#39;d support a temporary suspension on removing shill/troll accusations to see what happens. I&#39;ve broached it in modmail, and I think it might have legs.</p>

<p>Oh absolutely. I think most of the mod team does. I don&#39;t think removing rule 10 will fix that though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think people should be banned for rule 10.</p>

<p>I was guilty for it, and I&#39;m sorry for it. I now realize what a huge fallacy it is and how easy of an intellectual trap it is to fall into to just accuse someone you disagree with of being a shill. </p>

<p>I came to the understanding that there are actually very few real shills, and that their purpose is to sow distrust, which I was perpetuating by falling into the trap.</p>

<p>Getting banned taught me that lesson, and now I don&#39;t do it anymore.</p>

<p>However, I was never given a chance to learn that lesson before being banned. I was just banned. The first time, the mod decided I didn&#39;t need a warning because he looked through my posting history and saw I&#39;d done it more than once. The second time, I&#39;d been being careful not to break the rules for weeks, and was having a bad day and broke rule 10, and got banned because I&#39;d already been banned for it before.</p>

<p>The mod decided to skip removing my comment, and just went straight to a ban both times.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that instead, the comments get removed, with a copy &amp; paste reply that explains the WHY of rule 10, instead of just expecting people to bend over and take a ban for it.</p>

<p>The reasoning for this is that getting banned became a huge ordeal for me both times just to get unbanned. It became all I could think about, and I couldn&#39;t get any work done until I&#39;d appealed to the mods to be unbanned.</p>

<p>As a result, I simply don&#39;t participate here as much as I used to. I can&#39;t justify being distracted from an entire day&#39;s work because I got myself banned for shitposting.</p>

<p>I honestly cannot fathom why any mod felt that any of the comments I made deserved a ban with no warning, and it made me lose a ton of respect for this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You deleted your offending comments, which in general makes it very hard to appeal a ban as we can&#39;t see why you were banned. In general, we do try to give warnings, but when there are multiple rule violating comments in a short period of time, we sometimes assume it&#39;s wanton disregard for the rules and issue an immediate ban.</p>

<p>We&#39;re generally pretty lenient about lifting bans if the user agrees not to do it again, as happened in your case. If we unban someone and the break the rule, what should we do? We get plenty of rule 10 violations as it is without having to deal with users who already agreed they won&#39;t break it.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re pretty fair on bans regarding rule 10. I almost always give two warnings, as do most mods. Your original ban might have be a bit abrupt, but the second one was warranted. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a ban appeal process where we can overrule a ban by vote if we feel the ban was unjustified. As far as bans without warnings, I generally argue against it unless a user is <em>only</em> making rule violating comments and not contributing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To help users with suggestions on how to create better content as we are responsible for the subverse. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hold any moderator positions with the subverse as all of them I am owner and one I am co owner as the owner requested me to be one. </p>

<p>I helped with the CSS and fostering as well as growth of the community. </p>

<p>On Voat we have varied degrees of subverses. </p>

<p>Owner - usually the creator of the subverse and all permissions. </p>

<p>Moderator - can&#39;t add new moderators is the only restriction or terminate subverse.</p>

<p>CSS - only allowed to do css work.</p>

<p>Janitor - deleting of comments and submissions deemed as spam. (These are able to be removed with community input as well) </p>

<p>Approved submitter - exactly what is says as you are only allowed 10 submissions within each subverse unless this or higher level. </p>

<p>Now some sub&#39;s have &quot;system&quot; on their ownership. These are defaults and only janitors or css are allowed to be within these. </p>

<p>The responsibility of a moderator is to remove spam pretty much. I look at it as a way to encourage submitters and subscribers to get feedback or help to make more quality submissions. </p>

<p>As an owner of sub&#39;s I also look for people to hand them over too that are passionate about the topic at hand. I have handed over three subverse and grown a great many in my time as well. </p>

<p>We need moderators and owners to foster development with communities in Voat as if there wasn&#39;t such a thing there would be useless content. </p>

<p>If we get a rouge mod we have the logs to pin on them, and we do not hesitate to do so when its needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m against vote hiding because it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s hidden, the narrative still gets controlled by astroturfing.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather see the votes to know I or someone else is being brigaded. This makes them easier to identify.</p>

<p>Look, we all know they are here. Some of us know who they are. I&#39;ve committed quite the list of names to memory myself.</p>

<p>Do people remember what it was like here before the election?</p>

<p>From my experience, it seemed of those that took a side and had anything to say, this place was id say 70% Bernie, 30% Trump before the Democratic Convention.</p>

<p>I was on team Bernie and it was pretty tame in here. The occasional socialist this, fascist that, referring to the candidate not the Redditor. We all got along fine.</p>

<p>Certainly no one responded to anyone with the smug &quot;have you filed a police report?&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe because we were united in agreeinment that Hillary is a piece of shit and her loyalists didn&#39;t ever come in here to defend her sorry ass.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all changed. It&#39;d be one thing if they were only pushing the Trump Russia narrative, but it went well beyond that.</p>

<p>Before, there were non political conspiracies I didn&#39;t ascribe to, and I just didn&#39;t go in those threads. Even today in the Trump Russia narrative posts, I don&#39;t believe it because it&#39;s MSM propaganda and a convenient excuse for Hillary losing to Trump. But I still don&#39;t go in those threads. I know I don&#39;t belong there.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not the same for the shills who spend all day defending their queen and any conspiracy around her. They only appear in pizzagate or Seth Rich type threads or anything antithetical to the DNC. Many of them have accounts 90-100 days old... roughy the time Shareblue expanded its budget to $40 million from $5 million in the general election and $1 million in the primaries.</p>

<p>We saw /politics change overnight the week of the convention. And shockingly go back to normal Nov 9th. But then it went into overdrive and we knew it was only a matter of time before they came here.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fine line between a shill raising a counter argument and just regurgitating talking points. These people do not at all look at new evidence with an open mind.</p>

<p>Example: Pandas4Progress is Seth Rich, this is well established now. Pandas4Bernie has a history of showing motive for Seth Rich being the leak. Anyone with a brain would concede that the likelihood they are the same person is pretty high given the similar names.</p>

<p>Just because we can&#39;t yet prove they are the same, doesn&#39;t make the likelihood any less or debunk it.</p>

<p>The absence of evidence proving one way or the other does not debunk anything but it doesn&#39;t stop them and their bot army from manipulating the discussion.</p>

<p>Logical FALLACIES ARE VIOLATIONS of the rules of logic. People may want to familiarize themselves with those rules before skipping ahead to violations. Claims of &quot;fallacy&quot; are often misused to deflect from a related point that is not meant to fall within the rules of logic. Or sometimes, the word &quot;fallacy&quot; is incorrectly used to describe a fact itself.</p>

<p>You may think that this sub has been &quot;taken over&quot; by one side of the political spectrum or the other,</p>

<p>Stepping back to the biggest picture -- the final resulting output of submissions and votes -- it is obvious which of the two parties (that would be Democrats and Republicans, who do not fit nicely on the &quot;political spectrum&quot;) are gaming the sub. What to do about it? Probably not much we can do, but we should keep thinking about it. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on the strategy of the particular shill. The regurgitating talking points style shill, probably not. The JTRIG disrupt, deny and divide style? I can see it, especially if they know they can bait a user into breaking a rule and getting banned. These shills <em>do</em> target individual users. </p>

<p>But most of the shill accusations I see <em>are</em> against users who go into extended conversations. I would agree with you that they&#39;re probably not actual shills, but more likely just trolls or people with strongly held beliefs. That&#39;s what makes shill accusations against these users even more lame, in the original sense of the word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider that a cheap copout, because shills do NOT use arguments, they use talking points. You are suggesting that we argue honestly against people who are arguing dishonestly. That is a recipe for wearing the community down until there is almost nothing but shills left.  </p>

<p>We have a problem and we have a robust comment system in which to work it out organically. Let us use it. Any form of censorship will damage this community because the community is built on an inherent lack of trust.  </p>

<p>These changes are a nightmare sugar-coated with well thought out reassurances. You are writing as if you understand what the community needs and then dropping the ball when it comes to rule 10. This change is the key to shills&#39; success in many other subreddits. We don&#39;t even need to theorize. We can look at the example of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. This was the rule that precipitated total shill domination.  </p>

<p>Rule 10 does nothing but demoralize honest users. We are forced to sit and watch the shills waste everyone&#39;s time or go somewhere else.  </p>

<p>Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who sees this. How could shill accusations possibly derail conversation more than actual shills running unchecked spreading carefully formulated talking points?  </p>

<p>I think that we should be allowed to call shills out if we are willing to honestly and carefully explain what is concerning about the behavior to the community in the process. Shills power rests on unaware readers, and they deserve a chance to hear opinions from the community about the discussion at hand.</p>

Other large subs do this or make megathreads, but I find it can limit good discussion about multiple angles on a story, which by the nature of this sub, there will be. </p>

I guess when <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> went full on Hillary Clinton support after the primary I knew something was up.

Not saying that was the case here, and I&#39;m not even saying I think mods should do anything about it in cases where it&#39;s not the same article, but it&#39;s an issue.

<p>I also find it interesting that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> made the change to censor many alternative media sites and prevented people from altering the mainstream media titles in any way.  So its basically just a posting board for the corporate media articles now as you can see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  Didn&#39;t mean to put you on the spot.  Just wondering out of interest and in context to being a mod and your experience in studying conspiracies.  I&#39;m definitely in support of open investigation into the Seth Rich murder.  I think Paul Wellstone was probably murdered.  Mike Connell.  JFK Jr.  It&#39;s all sad stuff.  Especially when you think about the potential of our society if we had these leaders and/or justice for what&#39;s been done.  Luckily we have a place to discuss this stuff.  Thanks for keeping it as open and free as possible!  Long live the Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>If that does not embody that enlightenment ideal of &quot;dare to reason&quot;, then I have no idea what does; as the mod team here literally stands firm in its commitment to never become an arbiter of truth, and for you to frame such thing as a negative is wholly disappointing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When shilling is obvious, it needs to be called out. There is a lot of grey area, but sometimes strong patterns emerge, and calling them out and discussing them is important.</p>

<p>We are all better of knowing shill tactics, and in turn it makes it more difficult for shills to spoil this and other subredits because avoiding patterns that will reveal them is extra work, and the more they have to do it, the less effective they are.</p>

<p>Shills are actually a lot better at monitoring /new queue than regular people because that makes it easier for them to control whether something gets to the front page (it requires less upvotes/downvotes when submission is new) and getting their comments in early makes it easier for them to have and keep top comments in submissions that do get upvoted to the top.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cqc0u/submitted_a_link_to_rconspiracy_only_3_different/">submitted a link</a> and within 1st 40 minutes only 3 accounts commented in my submission. One was 4 days old, another one was 6 days old, and the 3rd one was 1 month old.</p>

<p>While it could be a coincidence in other places, in a place that is a constant target of astroturfing campaigns this is more likely to be shills than not.</p>

<p>Various agencies and organizations do hire shills and vote bots to influence social media, but even if they didn&#39;t, the wisdom of the crowd is only so good in a sub like this, where people&#39;s opinions are driven largely by media narratives from multiple political persuasions, each with their own agenda and/or personal bias. If you want to get closer to the truth, on any topic, you need to develop your own critical thinking faculties. This means examining the source of information, the credibility of that source, any ulterior motives that source may have, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that is all obvious but what isn&#39;t is why the only time the mods flair a post for brigading is when it is negative towards trump. Seth stuff here has been an obvious brigade (the_donald has called for such off and on) and yet nothing happens with those threads. </p>

<p>Not saying they should be pulled/flaired but it seems inconsistent (And I am all for people investigating it but it appears they don&#39;t honestly want to do so and just want to plaster this place with meme like posts).</p>

<p>TL:DR - What is the decision process for deciding to flair a post here?</p>

<p>If that were the case the situation would be even worse. You cannot have nice things because you as a whole are irresponsible and juvenile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to Reddit.  No matter where you go if you bring up anything about President Trump rabid leftists are going to show up with their narratives from the media.  This is how it goes every time.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys there are some strange facts about this Seth Rich case.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;OMG it&#39;s a fucking conspiracy theory, CNN confirmed this.  His family is grieving and wants you to stop talking about it right now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about Russia?  There is zero evidence of any collusion but it&#39;s talked about every day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No evidence!?!  Trump played golf with a Russian in 2004.  A senior administration official anonymously told CNN that Trump ate in a Russian restaurant in 2011.  How can you not see the obvious collusion?  Impeach now!&quot;</p>

<p>The left is completely owned by the establishment.  You don&#39;t even have to pay them to push the establishment&#39;s narrative, they gladly do it for free.  </p>

<p>Reddit happens to be the site with the most leftists so this is the way it is from here on out.  For the next 8 years every where you go on this website people are going to be whining about what ever Trump did and calling for impeachment.  Covfefe has been in the news all fucking day.  These people are deranged and it shows bigly on reddit. </p>
