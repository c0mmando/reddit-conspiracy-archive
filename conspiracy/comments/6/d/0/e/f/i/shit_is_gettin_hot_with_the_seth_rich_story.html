    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich was very likely the leaker.</p>

<p>If he is not, then either he was friends with the leaker, associated closely, or Wikileaks still has their mole and this is all a bizarre cover story. Podesta is so incompetent at times, I could imagine him killing someone random and just being like, &quot;This is what happens to whistleblowers!&quot;</p>

<p>Seth Rich had the expertise, the disposition, the intelligence, and the global concern of one who leaks. That&#39;s overly abundant. Would Podesta (et al) kill a high ranking official without proof?</p>

<p>Regardless, I think it&#39;s clear the Seth Rich was killed as a <em>suspected</em> leaker.</p>

<p>No real alternatives have shown up. No motivations, no enemies, no mental health type issues of depression or elsewise. Positive relationships and not overly ambitious (aside the Panda4Bernie persona).</p>

<p>The best lead on the possible killers I know of are the 2 persons killed the day after Seth Rich in South Carolina, one who worked with Hillary Clinton campaign, both Mexican, and with I think armed robbery records. Fits the memo of &#39;nobody cares who killed the Mexicans&#39; but I haven&#39;t attempted to verify their times with back and forth to D.C.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh no. 
Witnesses need to be questioned. 
1.Such as podesta and his cryptic statements on leakers. A culture that is threatening towards reporting crimes and wrong doing is relevant. 
2. Kim dot com needs to questioned and his evidence needs to be verified. 
3. The dnc has used the media to obfuscate anything that is negative press. Including the Seth rich scandal. This needs to be investigated. 
4. The dnc has means, motive to create a false lead. In fact this is a typical tactic of defense attorneys. It is not far fetched that suspects would try to come up with aleternative theories to avoid blame and cover their tracks. 
At the end of the day, as long as the dnc politicized this murder, seems to coerce the family to silence the questions. It is very damning, and the behavior of mob bosses. They are under suspicion and are trying to control the narrative using public relations. They have been caught red handed stealing an election from Bernie sanders. The win at all costs culture at the dnc has encouraged corruption, cheating, and associations with sexual predators all in the goal of seizing power in our government. This is An organization that encourages criminality and retaliates against whistleblowers. Democrat or republican everyone wants fair and ethical politicians. This is non partisan but as a democrat I cannot identify with a party that will steal elections and associates with felons, and sexual predators. Money is NOT everything. Don&#39;t you agree? </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This is a false statement. Oppurtunity is considered evidence and Seth Rich had the oppurtunity. Here is a copy and paste from earlier:</p>

<p>discussed here. Motive was explained earlier and is considered circumstantial evidence. So yes, there is evidence that the DNC was involved with his murder. Oppurtunity is also considered evidence. So yes, there is evidence Mr. Rich could have been the leaker.
Direct evidence could possibly be found on surveillance footage, his laptop, or witness statements. The government(suspects) are the ones who claim a monopoly on collecting this evidence. They have refused to interview potential witnesses, refused to release evidence, and claimed to have lost the critical pieces of this case. This in itself is further evidence that they are involded in these crimes.
This isn&#39;t proof beyond a reasonable doubt and I don&#39;t think many claim it is. If you start looking at crimes in the past the modus operandi is the same as other victims who this criminal organization had motive to murder. It&#39;s a reasonable theory drawn from evidence available.
You could also expect the criminal organization who steals, loses, and refuses to disclose evidence to astroturf &quot;WHERE IS THE PROOF? WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE?&quot; over and over and over again. We do have conclusive proof that this criminal organization employs individuals to disrupt chat forums, propogandize people, and spread their talking points. The criminals operate through central control and do not trust the workers to have much discretion. It&#39;s easy to identify talking points and see them being repeated with no other subsfance.
This is a community who discusses different theories. People come here to air their thoughts and have people examine them from different angles. These same people pay a lot of money in taxes for services and for others to represent their will. When that doesn&#39;t happen they have a right to be upset. The loss of life has an effect on everyone in the country if the suspects are indeed guilty. There is a legitimate interest into this investigation further than the families wishes.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. I had the opportunity to kill him, that doesn&#39;t mean I did it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take some excerpts from that novel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Direct evidence could possibly be found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning there is no direct evidence. Exactly as I said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&#39;t proof beyond a reasonable doubt and I don&#39;t think many claim it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t even close to within a reasonable doubt and yes, many claim that it is. That&#39;s why this theory is still going. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could also expect the criminal organization who steals, loses, and refuses to disclose evidence to astroturf &quot;WHERE IS THE PROOF? WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE?&quot; over and over and over again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, and hear me out here, normal people just don&#39;t see enough evidence to believe it. </p>

<p>Take me for example. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a community who discusses different theories.</p>

<p>So stop getting angry when someone doesn&#39;t agree with your unproven theory. </p>

<p>You said opportunity is evidence. Saying that &quot;the DNC had the opportunity&quot; isn&#39;t evidence because that statement literally applies to millions of people. </p>

<p>Also, very sad attempt at an insult to end your post. If you&#39;re going to resort to that as your only argument then at least put some effort into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>podestas cryptic email demonstrates how the dnc fosters a that Discourages its employees to report wrongdoing. That is important to the investigation especially when you take into account the pattern of hiring convicted felons, rapists, and sexual predators in their leadership ranks. In addition, consider that they literally stole an election from Bernie sanders by misleading their own voters, and breaking their own rules. Also consider the Donna brazile debacle. Bob creamer using hired thugs to intimidate the opposing party voters. We are talking about rico charges. The dnc as an organization fosters a culture that retaliates against whistle blowers. I am so curious if there is any employee handbook that describes how employees are supposed to report ethical issues. I bet there is not. 
Bernie sanders was just the tip of the iceberg unfortunately. Podesta threatening retaliation against whistle blowers demonstrates his concern is not with rooting out criminality but retaliating against anyone who reports wrongdoing. His phone records should be subpoenaed at minimum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there is a case in court right now which alleges the election was stolen. So your denial is premature. 
Hiring sexual predators and convicted felons does demonstrate their values as an organization. Other companies have been found liable for less because of their hiring practices. You are not familiar with case law apparently. Ignorance is bliss for you. </p>

Who is we? Are you working for the dnc? Hmmmm</p>

<p>You are clearly not familiar with case law. An organizations hiring practices have been used to demonstrate its values in court. In fact an organization can be found liable if they hire people with criminal records. This is why HR. Conducts background checks. To reduce the companies liability. By hiring convicted felons such as bob creamer, or Donna brazile who not only deceived the American public but also cheated to gain an unfair advantage. This demonstrates not only the values of the DNC but also the culture of unethical behavior among the leadership. If you add in the retaliatory atmosphere towards whistleblowers the dnc has a liability problem. May have indirectly or directly endangered Seth rich. This is how employment law suits are filed FYI. That organization you represent is cabal of theive and there is no honor amongst thieves. Good luck you are going to need it. 
Fostering an atmosphere of retaliation toward whistleblowers speaks to motive. You are really working hard </p>

<p>Republicans have now spent the past 2 months yelling about every leak. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When all else fails pull out the race card oops I meant political card. Yikes is this a specific tactic or just a natural reaction. </p>

<p>Unfortunately whether you like it or not In a murder investigation motive leads to suspects.  Suspects are then ruled out using alibis And corroborating evidence. Cell phones are subpoenaed for example. Witnesses and suspects are questioned. The case and evidence is built and then a prosecutor decides whether to pursue the charges. A grand jury is convened in secret if the case proceeds forward then the defendants have access to the evidence. That is called discovery. These are facts whether you like it or not. </p>

<p>Investigations have established processes that have nothing to do with your personal opinions. 
You can scream until you are blue in the face that the DNC values ethics but the fact is they hire convicted criminals and people who have been fired for a lack of ethics in positions of leadership. Values are determined by actions and actions that are crimes such as hiring thugs to beat up opposing party voters is a serious crime. That is a fact whether you ignore it or not. It is undeniable on video thank you veritas! </p>

<p>Podesta has demonstrated a motive to silent a whistleblower. In an email and also established proof of the culture at the DNC.  That is a fact. 
You know what&#39;s not a fact Seth rich was robbed. That is a premature theory. </p>

<p>You seem to pick and choose facts to confirm your beliefs and that is illogical and an emotional way to Make a point. I suspect you are young and very naive but what the hell do i know the world is full of weakminded people who are easily convinced using emotional ploys. I am done.
