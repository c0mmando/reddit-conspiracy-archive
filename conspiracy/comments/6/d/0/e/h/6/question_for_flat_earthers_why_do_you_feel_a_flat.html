       Yes.. but we aren't in ancient times.. so what makes someone think it's more logical the Earth is flat when all the evidence now points to spherical?
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon and sun are spherical. The objects we see in space appear to be spherical. I can see no reason why a flat earth seems more logical than a spherical Earth causing us to ignore the evidence... other than the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what were South American's reasoning for the Earth being flat?

       What is it "I do" exactly? Who said I have an argument or that I should have an argument?

      <p>
       You continue to create straw man arguments that have no relevance. You seem to be paranoid and delusional by the assumptions you have made in this discussion. Not unlike the assumption that flat Earth makes more inherent sense than any other model.

        Yes.. but we aren't in ancient times.. so what makes someone think it's more logical the Earth is flat when all the evidence now points to spherical?

       <p>
        The moon and sun are spherical. The objects we see in space appear to be spherical. I can see no reason why a flat earth seems more logical than a spherical Earth causing us to ignore the evidence... other than the bible.

       That the earth is round was mathematically proven least as early as Eratosthenes in about 200 BCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Copernicus did was propose and support a helio-centric model of the "universe" counter to the geo-centric one that was all the rage.  Though of course he wasn't the first to propose such a thing, just the most influential to modern Western understandings.  There was a Greek who proposed a helio-centric model back even before Eratosthenes, but Ptolemy's later geo-centric model was the one people believed in Europe til Copernicus.

       They are far more advanced than us when it came to the knowledge of the stars we're learning that much...again. So it's not a huge jump to make that maybe they knew what they were talking about.

       No one has a correct conclusion. That's why we're here. To question. To discuss. Not a lot of people here have faith in modern science they find it to be corrupt. At to that that we've been lied to about almost everything and yeah you're going to get some skeptics.

       Science is a religion. You have your priests in their priestly robes (lab coats) questioning the universes biggest questions and probing the unseen and giving out the answers that are too be believed and not questioned.

       I didn't assume you sided with Eric Dubay. I was just giving an example of how I myself analyze info to come to conclusions. I don't just listen to authority figures.. whether that is people in modern science or the Incas etc.

       The definition of science is not institutions..

       Science gives out data and theories. Ye people in science can act like religious zealots.. I never claimed otherwise.

       Just because I don't believe in flat earth theory doesn't mean I don't question mainstream scientists views.

       First video "debunking" the article makes an absolutely false claim stating that the moon appears the same everywhere on the globe.  This is a lie, the moon appears "upside-down" in the Southern Hemispherer compared to the Northern Hemisphere.

       I find that 99% of youtube videos are fraudulent and the reason they dont cite is because it makes showing errors far easier.

       Seriously, and Im not even kidding find me one scientific document that shows a flat earth. It doesnt have to be published or even peer reviewed. There is a reason these people dont show their numbers.

       So you want me to point you to research that is through "authoritative" means?  You do know that official research is controlled right? They bury any research that doesn't fit the narrative and you would be blind to not understand that. I don't trust anything official. I trust in my fellow man.

       And I prefer data. I dont want to see a youtube video with no cites, I dont want to see blogs with no cites and made up numbers.

       Just if you can (No one has yet0 provide me with a logical breakdown of even one facet of flat earth.

       Again doesnt have to be published, I just want to see the numbers and figures used to back up their positions.

       This is one of the worst videos of anything I've ever seen, and I only made it about 7 minutes in. What difference does it make if Cavendish intended to calculate G, or something else? It still follows from his experiment, and has been subsequently refined by later measurements. That doesn't make it "utter bullshit", and it doesn't support the "flat Earth" cause in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the calculation done does assume that the Earth is an approximate sphere and that its center of mass is approximately at its physical center. But so what? If you think that these basic assumptions are wrong, then you are free to challenge them. To this point in the video, no attempt of this sort was made. Plus, either way, the gravitational constant G and the force equation are still legitimate, even if the assumptions made regarding the shape and mass distribution of Earth are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad science, bad arguments. But this is "flat Earth" content, so I suppose that that's par for the course.

       How much of a narcissist do you have to be to think you know more than the entire educated population on the planet? This has nothing to do with the shape of the Earth, and everything to do with the state of your mind.

       Actually I spend an average of 5 hours everyday in study of occult-ed topics since at least 2012.  Shit, even on my drive to work I'm listening to history and conspiracy podcsts.  When people post the same thing over and over and I and others have debunked it multiple times already it's silly for me to go find and post it yet again.  Many of these users here have already seen it at least 5 times. Tired of it, especially since one of the goals of forum shills is to waste your time.

       it's not ignorant to believe in basic science. Gravity pulls things together, forming mostly sphere like shapes (see the sun, the moon, other planets).

       Why do you people assume that the only way to know would be to go to space?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it this way... if the earth is flat, then the universe around us is some sort of fake, so why could the same "power" not fake a space trip?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need to go to space to
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       the earth is not flat. It's that simple. Only be denying the evidence can you even maintain the idea that the earth is flat.

       Everybody know about the storming of the beach at Normandy. America sent troops in boats all the way to Europe. Easy-peasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, though, everyone knows about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Japan sent planes around the spherical globe to attack their newly formed enemies on the other side.

      <p>
       And so, in one well understood and well documented instance we have America addressing those East of us and being addressed by those West of us: A sphere.

       That 9/11 was a media hoax (septembercluesDOTinfo) is plausible and interesting to discuss.

       There's never been any real dispute about the shape of the earth. What's been disputed is heliocentricity. FE is a lame attempt by NASA/tptb to associate NASA debunking with the ridiculous idea that the earth is flat.

       Let's start with your theory first.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is physically impossible for a sun 3,000 miles above a flat surface to appear to drop below that surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with the sun directly overhead. The angle from the flat surface to the sun is 90
       <sup>
        o,
       </sup>
       the slope distance to the sun is 3,000 miles, and the angular diameter of the sun is 0.5 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we'll move the sun so that it is directly over a point on the flat surface 3,000 miles away. The angle from the flat surface to the sun is 45
       <sup>
        o,
       </sup>
       the slope distance to the sun is 4,242.6 miles, and the angular diameter of the sun is 0.354 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next we'll move the sun to a point over the flat surface 6,000 miles away. The angle from the flat surface to the sun is 26.6
       <sup>
        o,
       </sup>
       the slope distance to the sun is 6,708.2 miles, and the angular diameter of the sun is 0.224 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we'll move the sun to a point over the flat surface 9,000 miles away. The angle from the flat surface to the sun is 18.4
       <sup>
        o,
       </sup>
       the slope distance to the sun is 9,486.8 miles, and the angular diameter of the sun is 0.158 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we'll move the sun to a point over the flat surface 12,000 miles away. The angle from the flat surface to the sun is 14.0
       <sup>
        o,
       </sup>
       the slope distance to the sun is 12,369.3 miles, and the angular diameter of the sun is 0.121 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this tell us? If the sun is 3,000 miles from the surface, and it travels from directly overhead to a point 12,000 miles away, its apparent diameter in the sky will be one quarter its original size and it will be over 110 times its diameter above the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means it is utterly impossible for the flat earth sun to appear to set. It will still be perfectly visible above the horizon from over 12,000 miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       This proves beyond doubt that the earth is not flat.

      <p>
       Nope. The flat earth theory ignores atmospheric effects. For example, it is a fact that close to the horizon, atmospheric refraction makes the sun appear to be even higher in the sky than it actually is. When you see the bottom edge of the sun touch the horizon, the sun is actually already below it.

       Bullshit. It is an undeniable geometric fact.

      <blockquote>

        You think you can see a sun 9,000 miles away?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On a flat earth you would be able to. At 9,000 miles, the angular diameter of the flat earth sun would be 0.158 degrees. The Statue of Liberty's head is 10 feet wide. The flat earth sun would appear to be about the same size in the sky from 9,000 miles as the Statue of Liberty's head seen from 0.7 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can easily see the Statue of Liberty's head from less than a mile away, so you should also be easily able to see the flat earth sun from 9,000 miles away - not least because it is a very bright light source.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what about the atmosphere I hear you ask? Well, at 9,000 miles away, the flat earth sun would be 18.4
       <sup>
        o
       </sup>
       above the horizon and the slope distance would be 9,486.8 miles. If we use the altitude of the ISS as being the edge of the atmosphere and calculate how far away from us the light from the sun would enter the atmosphere, we'd find that it is a point about 752 miles away and the light would travel through about 792 miles of atmosphere. That's only three times the distance it would travel through the atmosphere if the sun was directly overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't "think" you'd be able to see the flat earth sun from 9,000 miles away, I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       you would.

       I think it makes sense because a flat, motionless plain is what we experience. We don't feel ourselves spinning through space, we don't see curvature from our perspective. It appears completely flat and motionless.

       I have heard that a lot.. but what I don't understand is why flat Earthers feel that a flat Earth system makes more sense than the sphere system.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you described doesn't eliminate the sphere system.. because there are reasons given how the sphere system can work even under the circumstances you list. Look at it this way.. you can be flying in a plane at 600 MPH.. yet does it feel like you are flying that speed? It's the same thing with the Earth traveling through space.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you really think on something as large as the Earth we should see curvature? To me it seems weirder if we would see curvature than if we wouldn't... the Earth is immense.. if not we wouldn't be alive on it.

       Wasn't trying to eliminate or prove anything. Was just answering the question. I can't prove anything anymore than anyone else can prove anything. We (the regular people of this world) have no access to space, therefore anything we say whether it's a globe or a flat plain really comes down to speculation and faith. I'd like to think that there isn't a centuries old, worldwide conspiracy to hide the true nature of our reality from us, but I cannot get to space to verify for myself. I'm left to taking it on faith, which I must admit I have zero faith in anything told to us by any government/corporation/agency. When scum rules the world the rest of us are left to wallow through the muck.

       No, it's pure bullshit that the only way to prove the earth is a sphere is from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides we know how the flat earthers operate. If they were taken into space and shown the spherical earth through a window, they'd claim the wind was an LCD screen projecting a fake image.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is based solely on denying evidence - no amount of evidence will convince the flat earthers because they believe the earth is flat for religious reasons.

       Go watch a sunset through a telescope. See the perfectly visible sun be blocked by the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is utterly impossible on a "flat earth", because the sun would have to be so far away from the disk to even touch the horizon, that no part of the disk would be under it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun doesn't disappear in mid-air, but it does drop below a horizon. That is proof positive that the earth is not flat.

       The above image shows two views of the flat earth sun relative to an observer's field of view. At the top is a side-on view and at the bottom is what the observer sees.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll note that as the sun moves away (staying at the same height above the ground, the sun fills less of the field of view, and appears to move lower within that field of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you extrapolate outwards, you'll notice the sun never quite touches the bottom of the field of view and will become too small to see long before it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the "vanishing point" is said to be at infinity. As an object moves away, it appears to get closer and closer to the bottom of the field of view, without ever quite getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, on the flat earth it would be impossible to see the sun cut in half by the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can run the maths and see that for the sun to appear to be cut in half by the horizon on a flat earth (given the maximum height above ground of mountains etc) the sun would need to be tens of thousands of miles away, even when people only a few thousand miles away can see it directly overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is physically impossible for the earth to be flat but the sun behave the way we have all seen it behave.

       Of course you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another form of the same argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The angular diameter of the sun is 0.5 degrees. I'm going to halve that and assume the angular diameter is 0.25 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers claim the sun is 3,000 miles above the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to assume the sun is directly above a point 3,000 miles away. Using a right angle triangle calculation we find that the slope distance to the sun is 4,242.6 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I am assuming that at 4,242.6 miles the sun has an angular diameter of 0.25 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using this angular diameter caluclator:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://rechneronline.de/sehwinkel/angular-diameter.php">
        https://rechneronline.de/sehwinkel/angular-diameter.php
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We find that the actual diameter of my flat earth sun is 13.09 miles
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens if the sun moves much farther away? Let say it is still 3,000 miles up, but 12,000 miles away. The slope distance becomes 12,369.3 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       So using our angular diameter calculator and the actual diameter we calculated above, what would this sun look like if it moved from 3,000 miles away to 12,000 miles away?
      </p>
      <p>
       At a slope angle of 12,369.3 miles, my half size flat earth sun would only have apparently shrunk to one quarter its apparent size at a slope angle of 4,242.6 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you plug in the actual value for the angular diameter of the sun (0.5 degrees) you will find that the sun will appear to shrink to no less than one quarter its original size by travelling from 3,000 miles above and 3,000 miles away, to 3,000 miles above and 12,000 miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our earth was flat, the sun would never disappear because it simply can not move far enough away for it to become too small to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how you look at this, the way our sun behaves is not possible if our earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much evidence aginst the flat earth theory that you simply have to refuse to accept any evidence and believe flat earth on faith alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's what the flat earthers do.

       Most of the time when you bring up the movement of the Sun or the stars, they try to bring the argument back down to the surface and ask for proof without looking at the Sun/stars.  IMO, the movement of the Sun (both over a day and a year) are the best evidence against a flat Earth.

       It's about angular velocity. Think about sitting on a merry go round and it's barely moving. Would you feel anything? Due to the immense size of the Earth and the relatively slow motion.. that explains it. Plus gravity which is much more powerful counter acting it.

I'm saying it appears flat and motionless... because it does. You can't feel it moving, you can't see it curving. It most certainly does APPEAR flat and motionless from our perspective here on earth.

       Solipsism is the belief that only one's own mind exists, not the OBSERVANCE that we can't perceive the rotation of the earth with our own senses. You're being silly as fuck.

       Solipsism - the view or theory that the self is all that can be known to exist.

       I Think this fits the bill, what else would you call denial of everything you cant see feel or experience? Seriously, what do you call it?
      </p>
      <p>
       No comment on computers? I mean you cant independently verify that they arent magic, can you?

       You can always peg a douchebag by their high and mighty, holier than thou attitude. I do not think computers are magic. I do not deny everything outside of myself. I simply OBSERVED that when I go outside, this earth APPEARS flat and motionless. I do, however, think you're an asshole. Thank you, fuck you, bye.

       And I OBSERVE curvature. Ever seen a Foucault pendulum? I have and those simply could not exist on a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever seen what ships do when they sail away from you? They disappear bottom first over the horizon, again impossible on a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of the coriolis effect? Again not possible on a flat unmoving Earth.

       For the record and you might really consider this. People who cant defend their points default to personal attacks.

       If you could make a point you would have but since you cant you sling mud. Thank you for proving me right lol.

       I didn't assume you sided with Eric Dubay. I was just giving an example of how I myself analyze info to come to conclusions. I don't just listen to authority figures.. whether that is people in modern science or the Incas etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of science is not institutions..
      </p>
      <p>
       Science gives out data and theories. Ye people in science can act like religious zealots.. I never claimed otherwise.
      </p>

       Just because I don't believe in flat earth theory doesn't mean I don't question mainstream scientists views.
