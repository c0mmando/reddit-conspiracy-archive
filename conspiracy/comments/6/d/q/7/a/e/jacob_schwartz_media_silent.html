       Why isn't the mainstream media posting anything about this. Pedophile who happens to be a Democrat working for top democrats and no mention of this on any major media site. Can you imagine if this was a repulician staffer would be 24/7 coverage of this.

       I'm saying if he was a Republican it would be all over the news but since he was a Democrat nothing about it. Look at Republican pushing reporter 24/7 coverage of that what is worse shoving someone or being pedophile. If they cover that so much you think they would cover this but I see nothing.

       The guy is a virtual nobody. If he was in congress or was president, sure it would be covered.

      <p>
       But some people want the news to cover any crime a person commits who is a democrat. That sounds fishy to start with.

      <p>
       I am guessing he is also a christian, should they use that angle as well? Lots of christians molest kids should that be on the news every day?

       I monitor about 600 tv news stations across the US. I see shit all the time that never makes national news.

      <p>
       Maybe you want this to because you think it means something. What is it you think it means? He molested kids. He is a criminal. Anything other than that is just pushing an agenda. It is like you are happy he hurt those kids so you can tell people democrats are bad or something.

       Yeah the same way the left pushes and agenda if you say you watch 600 news stations you should know. But you are a Trump hater from post history so why should I expect anything else from you. Didn't answer question btw if it was Republican staffer you know this would be all over news but since left controls most of media it's nowhere to be seen.

       Disingenuous fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you miss the over arching meta narrative of the hot mess the Dems./DNC have had themselves mixed up in for some time now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you a brave new post modernist and that outmoded jive doesn't apply to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well to bring you up to speed 'cause I know you care
       <em>
        so much
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       William Clinton - a serial rapist who's wife has long since averted her gaze in a trade off to continue gaining notoriety and clout as a "political power couple"
       <em>
        pukes in mouth
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anthony (small) Weiner - multiple instances of lewd, perverted, obscene and not just borderline pedo proclivities but since proven and on record beyond the pale involvement with pedo activities with very little resulting consequence hmmm.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Jacob Schwartz - and now little Jack and his established, on the record charges resulting from evidence found on his laptop displaying exactly the type of hard core pedo tastes people have been alleging the DC Dem. elites have been engaging in since it came out in the pre-election wikileaks. Which just happened to coincide with the emergence of the "fake news" meme.....curious and curiouser.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Podesta Bros. - looking even dicier now  (if that were poss.) in light of little Jack's behaviour. ++++overwhelming some would say circumstantial evidence indicating the Pedo Bros. involvement in unimaginably depraved pedo activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate - read up on it chump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedogate - read up on it chump.
      </p>
      <p>
       World wide entrenched pedo networks that serve as blackmail counter measures to keep the political class in line and service the depraved habits of the global elite - again piss of and read about it and chalk this up as a resounding fail/loss at Langley, your bot farm for CTR/Shariablue or MM or whatever rock you live under.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see "Another Chance" you need to keep to the correct narrative as history will not remember you kindly when this house of deceit, hubris and evil comes crashing down and believe me it has. You can talk about the "politicizing" of sad stories and the "sickness" of those involved in supposedly doing so all you like but you are simply blaming the messenger and lamely attempting to divert the focus onto the people who are trying to give these issues a higher profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you know well it is the people at the heart of these allegations who are truly sick and depraved and you are clearly on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time is coming where you snakes will be exposed, you will scatter and be trod into dust and all your artifice, scheming and conniving, roiling and slithering in your dens will be forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the world will be a better place.

       Look at you and what all you just said.

      <p>
       I am not pro-establishment. I didn't vote for bill or hillary, I don't like anthony or jacob, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has happened with you is that you are blind to so many things because you want to make this all about politics and party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you aren't seeing how you are being used here to spread propaganda and divide people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and as far as pedo/pizzagate I was fighting against child porn back in the 90's (back then the FBI had only one guy in Ohio to handle computer crimes like that - I would know because I spoke with someone from the FBI about it and worked on a local case involving it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am all for catching pedos, I don't associate them with a party but with those who are sick and those in power (who get away with a lot - justice system favors the rich regardless of party).
      </p>
      <p>
       You and others are being used for political purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and the same people who for 8 years attacked Obama over every little thing are now discarding their principles/morals/values to protect one single man and his family (and cohorts).

      <p>
       Don't be 'that guy'. Try looking at things from a whole new light.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are being used by a few to make money. They are playing to a base that hates someone/some group. They are using you for their own gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are making this about politics because they know it sells and you will buy it. You want a conspiracy? Well, there you go - look at who pushes what and why. Look who profits from all of this.

       I am all for that. My investigations though don't involve just rushing about blaming a party or throwing out accusations randomly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am more of a slow burn type person who looks long and hard into things and doesn't just jump on the next train because it makes people/party I don't jibe with look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a rush to judgment isn't good IMHO and it sucks seeing so many being led astray as they buy into anything they want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a real conspiracy here that goes to the core of many things. Power, money, injustice - and it isn't about politics at all, it is about those with money and influence and how they play us for rubes.

       Trust me I am not convinced of the validity, innocence or version of truth the "right" side of the political divide professes anymore than I am of the "left" - I think the salient point here is the word divide and TPTB would prefer it as wide as possible, with as little dialogue between the two poles as realistically achievable and those identifying with either side resorting to the most emotional reasoning and reactionary rhetoric as poss.

       We've just had our turn of a generation emboldened under Obama to look back in scorn, resentment and mockery of GWB, spent laughing and spitting cliches at the religious right and the jokes for humans and intolerant bigots they set up into positions of  power in the right/GOP and also in these Babylonian temples of deceit called mega Churches simply to groom us all to loathe them, mock them and belittle them and forever tarnish the idea of conservatism, the right, Christianity too by assumption/association as they were all revealed to be the fools, con men and duplicitous devils that so many of them were/are. I agree too, now it's the lefts turn and the master stroke where everyone's turned on everyone for the most petty to the most paramount reasons - a resurgent "alt" right meets the decaying shell of a broken ass leftist narrative all presided over by spooks and multinational cronies who have brought psychological warfare techniques previously tested and refined abroad home to roost among the long targeted domestic enemy class - but like the right before them people on the left should have been more diligent, shouldn't have got caught up in such egotism and hubris and should have obviously at too many incremental and nuanced stages to identify in hindsight sure - but overall more people should have come out  in numbers "stronger together" and called the left out on moving away from it's core principles and they tried individually - Seth Rich was one of them and here we are.

       Here we are with meaningless populist or centrist politics, emotive inflammed reactionary rhetoric and while all is in chaos the Chaos Magi continue working under their purposefully sowed clouds of confusion and murk while everyone else is left to ponder is the transgender issue a civil rights issue.

       If you've been on the scene for so long then breh you'd know via Dave McGowan that the pedophocracy is an issue that's been round since at least Laurel Canyon in the late 50's early 60's then wouldn't you and I agree that it's totally endemic on both sides of the political system and all throughout other state institutions, the military, academia, the corporate world, the police, religious orgs. etc, etc, and that's simply the little shake down they instituted for that era - who knows the totality of the black psychological ops. that have been implemented since post WWII let alone since Sumeria or Egypt.

       The whole pedophila thing isn't about a party or right and left, it is about people in power always getting away with shit - and not just pedo shit but tons of other crimes (drugs, rigging things, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, my issue is with how this playing out here in this sub and how it detracts from real issues by making it about one party or one part of a party.

       None of that is relevant. He was a man who molested kids. Why do you want to use the hell they went through from this asshole for politics? Do you think him being a dem is what caused this? I mean really, what is your angle?

       Using Seth's dead body to attack Dems? The DNC never even offered a reward for his killer. Why aren't there billboards everywhere asking for tips? Your employee would likely do the same for you. So who exactly is abusing his memory by wanting justice for him?

       Why should they, the DC police already offered 25k.

      <p>
       The other people on the right doing so are grandstanding and trying to cash in on it all. The ONLY reason they care about this is that they want to pin it on the DNC. Mark my words, if they catch the guys that did it and they were just hood robbers the right will claim that is fake.

       There are 65 unsolved homicides for the detectives to sift through from 2016. And that doesn't obviously include the ones from 2015 or the ones they are currently working on this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you care about any of those? How about you all raise money to hire more detectives? You care about this murder for political reasons only. Period.

       Listen when you have someone murdered that was in a position to know about and expose a pre-arranged, large scale, criminal fraud to hand Hillary Clinton the Democratic nomination for the Presidency on a silver platter, that is a relevant and important enough fact to be a motive for the killing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you need reminding it's a rare thing for someone to "just get murdered" for no apparent reason. Nine times out of ten, murders take place to cover up some other crime and to keep it from being revealed by someone that has inadvertently discovered it and if they haven't already reported it to the police they most likely will.

       They aren't reporting anything pizza/pedogate related because it gives an opportunity for people to look into it themselves because the circumstantial evidence is frightening and most likely true considering the depths they have gone through to silence people on this matter. Names such as Ben Swann and Milo come to mind. Paying close attention you will see it being censored in the negative sense while music videos and Hollywood are slowly but surely normalizing pedophilia.

       And yeah, poor Ben Swann. If I ever bump into that dude on the street, I want to ask him what happened. I'm sure they threatened not just him, but his whole family. Probably the network too. Bummer. But I'm still grateful to him because he entered Pedogate into the mainstream public record, when no one else would. I hope karma is kind to him for that.
