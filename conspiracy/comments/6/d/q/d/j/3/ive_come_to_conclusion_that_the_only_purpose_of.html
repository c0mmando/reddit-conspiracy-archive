       It's really bad. I'm in no way a racist or a bigot, mind you, but it's really ridiculous that they have a Ramadan story. I've never seen another story related to a religion.  Maybe I missed another religion they promoted. So I could be wrong... I don't obsess over snapchat stories but every time I look they are the most absurd things. And being that EVERYONE has a snapchat it's the perfect device for a good brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they trying to defend being a Muslim and promote that it's a peaceful religion? which I know that it is; in a none radical form. I have had Muslim friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are they just subliminally mind fucking us trying to convince us that every Muslim is peaceful and doesn't want to destroy America and everything that it stands for?

       I hadn't actually seem those, although I don't look that often and I'm a long way away from the US. There is a definite agenda of pushing idolization of entertainers.

       It's a dim generation, taught that what's on their FB news feed is more important than what is really happening around the world. They are taught to be dumb and they're taught to have the same stupid opinions. I'm 17 so I notice the most with people around my age. And you're right, it is disgusting.

       I'm glad someone in your age group has some sense. It's encouraging, but we're not out of the water. In fact, we're still sinking. I can't even imagine how brainwashed the next generation of children will be, as they will probably get an iPhone right out of the womb.

       My brother is now 7, he has an iPad, SkyQTV and a PS4... The gap between generations is getting smaller but all these influential kids will have their heads buried in technology from such an early age watching whatever the powers that be want them to watch. It's like programming a human over a long period of time. Shame really.

       Snapchat knows their target demographic and has marketed to external companies who wish to target that demographic. It just so happens that companies that spew clickbait and idiotic bullshit happen to love Snapchat's demographic.
