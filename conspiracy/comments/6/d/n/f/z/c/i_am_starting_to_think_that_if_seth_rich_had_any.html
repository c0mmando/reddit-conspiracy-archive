        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have established that the Seth Rich and Russia angles might both be a case of heavy circular reporting. Lets look at the Awan case however:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brothers hired on Capitol Hill.</li>
<li>Some have criminal records. Have been bankrupt.</li>
<li>Dubious practices such as nepotism afoot. The way they worked is extremely suspicious with the work allocated such that most of the money would go to the family and the central figure in that.</li>
<li>They appear to have gained access to the entire system on CH.</li>
<li>They had the password of Debbie Wasserman Schultz&#39;s equipment.</li>
<li>They appeared to have undue power and impunity.</li>
<li>Extremely high salaries that do not seem reasonable.</li>
<li>They also have dirt on them in a legal case against another family member further reinforcing what unscrupulous lengths they might go to to make money.</li>
<li>They were fired and banned from the complex after being investigated for theft and hacking.</li>
<li>Debbie Wasserman Schultz worked around the ban hiring one as an adviser creating a connection that would allow interference.</li>
<li>The whole lot fled back to Pakistan after the case opened.</li>
<li>The best defense from the DNC for is that they must be being framed because they are Muslim.</li>
<li>Debbie Wasserman Schultz is so distraught by the affair she grills the police chief in a meeting and attempts to threaten him into handing over evidence in the case.</li>
<li>May have had access to Podesta emails.</li>
<li>DNC had the servers looked at by a private entity and not the authorities allowing them to create their own narrative.</li>
<li>Guccifer 2 also identified as a fraud linked to the Clinton campaign (they screwed up when they created documents to leak trying to add finger prints).</li>
</ul>

<p>These guys come across as criminals and there&#39;s nothing implausible reported on the case.</p>

<p>If you keep researching and studying it, it&#39;s an open book. It&#39;s way more than I can write on here. There is far more compelling and relevant links for the Awan brothers to the DNC leaks than there are for the Russians and Seth Rich. If it&#39;s not that, the way Schultz was squirming over a laptop held in evidence really makes you think there must be something there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up good points.  But just as DWS freaked out to the chief about this laptop, seems a lot of people are freaking out about Seth Rich.  When you hit a nerve, seems many have to ask why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be careful though whose nerve. Absolutely the press is terrified of the Russia narrative they clung to being blown away by the Seth case. The DNC however is a bit more elusive and could even feign injury. The DNC gives much less to go on than the massive legions of mainstream in your face press outlets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You bring up a side I&#39;ve never considered before.  The anti Muslim backlash.  But do you really think the press is that worried about their reputation backing the anti-Russia campaign?  They bounced back well after backing Hillary and her 99% chance of winning, all polling areas pure Hillary +25% insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not their reputation. They have none. It&#39;s their narrative that is under attack. Their believers.</p>

<p>This is also dangerous. If you think of the shock and reaction to that when Trump won after they believe Clinton would. Look now at all the true believers again still running back quickly to their press with the narrative of &quot;we weren&#39;t wrong it was destined the Russians just cheated and ruined it all&quot;. I think another shock will truly break them. It would be catastrophic for the psyche of millions of people. I can&#39;t even cite a specific outcome. It will be madness.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s most telling of all about the Awan brothers is that in any event it&#39;s a massive scandal. Yet the press couldn&#39;t give a toss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, that next morning people were in shock that Trump won and the media machine was wrong.  But my gut says general populace wouldn&#39;t care if one day narrative changed to &quot;it wasn&#39;t the Russians, it was North Korea making it look like Russians&quot;.  That general populace would take that gear change pretty well.</p>

<p>The Awan brothers is out of the general understanding of people.  You can see their scope of evil due to you being an IT admin, but not average joe.  I remember them being explained as a shared It resource for those capitol offices that didn&#39;t feed full time staff.  Made sense explained like that.  But what a cover, to get into so many office&#39;s machines.  Jeez.  How does one like them get security clearance?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at the case you realise that Debbie should be in the shit. Everything in the budget meeting she came up with was pressure on the Awan case.</p>

<p>The Awans were first accused of a procurement scam. So first volley she opens up on the chief for his procurement of staff and equipment. Not only implying to penalise his budget calling his procurement toys but also saying no you. Then she goes on to exploit that to got over him and attack him through his bosses implying that his autonomy be stripped from him through them. The democrats said that the Awans were being setup because they were Muslims. She then attacks him on diversity in a budget meeting and doesn&#39;t relate it to the budget at all and attacks him by suggesting he implements diversity quotas against undermining his authority. She takes it a step further going under him saying that she will talk with the union and his subordinates and specifically saying without him present. Finally she openly demands he returns a piece of evidence held in an investigation and threatens consequences if not. She hijacks the entire budgetary meeting to pressure him over the criminal case against the IT team I am pretty sure she recommended for the job and helped get cleared for it.</p>

<p>Being shared like that isn&#39;t entirely unusual. IT definitely looks like it was exploited though for them to raise their salary up to the maximum allowable amount.</p>

<p>Being close to powerful figures in politics. However it really starts to get a bit much. There is a compelling case for blackmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re exactly right. I have an extensive criminal history. In a way, that is where my IT skills came from. But despite that and like you, the trust I am given is not displaced. If anything I am more conscientious and careful because of my background. </p>

<p>The work I do now comes with an insane amount of access to things that you would never imagine someone like me could have haha. But the side work I do from time to time is a level above that. People are so trusting with their data and equipment, not because of what I can do, but what someone they trust tells them I can do. And I don&#39;t think either party has any idea how vulnerable they are.</p>

<p>The Awan brothers preyed on this systemic technological ignorance that lives in DC. But someone recommended them knowing what they are. That person is probably the bad guy.</p>

<p>How is this new thread downvoted so hard?</p>

<p>Probably because it seems obvious what&#39;s going on here. The Seth Rich nonsense is losing steam and people are looking for a new angle to speculate endlessly on. The right has created a conclusion based on nothing more than wishful thinking (the DNC is covering up an internal leak) and now people are inventing plotline after plotline to try to shoehorn reality into that pre-established conclusion.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s incredible to me is how obvious it is that this is being done to distract from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpInvestigation/wiki/doc">the biggest conspiracy in modern history</a> that is unfolding right before our eyes yet people here are barely talking about it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not excluding that Seth Rich might have been involved in the leak and there&#39;s a lot that matches up with that theory (although some things that don&#39;t as well) but the Awan case is glaring and I haven&#39;t seen a single thing that doesn&#39;t fit. It sticks out like a sore thumb. Even if it isn&#39;t related to the leak it&#39;s a massive scandal for the democrats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible as are a lot of things. Remember that Podesta said he would make an example of a leaker even with little basis for it? What if Seth was killed merely for being suspected of it?</p>

<p>The only real question I have is did Seth have access to those emails? It&#39;s not clear how he might have gotten them. The Awan brothers on the other hand...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is known pretty much how Seth got access. I just tried to google up a link explaining it though and the Astroturf on this story is 10 miles thick. I&#39;m at the hospital with my wife right now, but I think I have it saved at home and will dig it up if you like. Or just read through a few of the SR compilations. Iirc, he got access and then started sharing access with other people, and there are records of that. Or, maybe someone helpful will come along with specific knowledge of what I am half remembering here.</p>

<p>Any which way, great post man. We definitely need to spend more time on the Awan brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only heard about them from George Webb which is weird because it should be all over the place. The Awan brothers seem like they should have their own wikipedia page at this point as well.</p>
