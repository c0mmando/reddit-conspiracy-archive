       Seriously, how do you get from "immigrants" to "I no longer have a culture" to "I am no longer an individual"?
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesnt even make any kind of sense, and it comes in place of things that actually matter like actual sex slavery and drug smuggling, and all the interconnections those things imply.
There are
       <strong>
        so
       </strong>
       many conspiracies
       <strong>
        so
       </strong>
       much more interesting than goddamn
       <em>
        racebaiting
       </em>
       . You would think people would respect themselves more than enough to waste their efforts on stuff like this. Anyone who is here is already thinking more than most, they are better than this, they can
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       better than this. Have some self respect for the love of christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess we still have to sugarcoat our racism in intrigue before we can talk about anything that actually matters, like US military documents describing encounters with alien spacecraft in the 40s. There is still truth out here. But not all of us have eyes to see it.

       The fact you think it has to do with race is the issue. Culture is totally separate, most of these immigrants are coming from countries that still punish women for being raped, and still do public beheadings. Sharia law doesn't mesh with rest of the world is the issue

       Immigrants vote 90% liberal. Stack the deck enough in swing states and you have one party in perpetual power...then they don't have to answer to the people at all.  How many black americans did obama help? Not many...imagine even less and less incentive each year.

       It creates stress, it gives politicians (across the world) the chance to get elected based on these issues (Imma build a WALL!), it gives people something to complain about and it keeps us conspirators away from non-manufactured issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       These earthly problems (We need jobs, we need immigrant policy, we need healthcare, ...) are here to keep the plebs occupied. Every ancient culture was obsessed with the stars, the afterlife, spiritualism, ... We aren't. We're obsessed with issues every mainstream outlet presents, day in, day out.

       That's what

       These refugees reproduce at a rate far greater than the local populations. Take into consideration that a lot of these refugees also take in welfare money from the government and in the Macron leaks, it was mentioned that the refugees may be granted citizenship. Who do you think they are going to vote for? The party that brought them there gave them free money and citizenship.

       It is a land grab of the lands the refugees are from,and yes a very deliberate operation to destroy cultures and and religious and national identity in both the nations they are from and the nations the arrive in.

       They will be used, as we are seeing, in the nations they settle in as a tool to keep the populations divided.

       To destroy social cohesion. It's much more difficult to apply divide and conquer tactics in a nation with one cohesive culture. Mix in 10-15 other cultures and you can start playing them against each other. In the end it's about abolishing the concept of nations all together.

       It won't work. Humans are naturally tribal. We thrive amongst our own tribe. 50 years of manipulation won't undo 200 000 years of human evolution and history.

       Like others have said it helps to erode the borders and then also it adds to the number of impoverished dependents who will clamor for communism-lite.  Its about overloading and breaking the system to quadruple down on more of the same.  The "socialists" never had a plan for transitioning a healthy US into "socialism" and so they need to break it first.  Then we can have their "socialism" without any prosperity and the government gets to be the good guys helping out all of the weaponized poor.  Its why assholes like Zuckerberg are now

       There was a very long and thorough study by a professor which  said that diversity of culture undermines all of society. Voting civic duty, cohesion and unity goes down. Crime,goes up, etc etc. it's basically an invasion that undermines the very fabric of a people. Think of what happened to the Native American (minus the disease) the professor turned out the be flaming liberal who spent the majority of his time presenting his work trying to undermine his own results. He couldn't deal with the results being so blantantly  against the multi culti agenda
