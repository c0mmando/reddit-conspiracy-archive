       Lower in this comment chain you asked for links saying anyone owed money, I gave you one.  Also, as I said in the first comment, I just went for a site that trump fans wouldnt call fake news, breitbart has a lot of connections to people all around trump so they're not going to go out of their way to shoot themselves in the foot. But If you look around the internet for other sites on it, there's more in depth research done about who loaned him the money, and it's mostly russian banks for the same reason trump gets his loans from there, noone else would give him the money.

       And as I've said multiple times now, I gave you a link that trump fans wouldnt call fake news and told you to look further into it since breitbart wasn't going to In depth about it as it was against their interests/investors/ownership.

       Hillary wasn't a good candidate for a plethora of reasons, and I'm not going to pretend I supported her, or even liked her, but she was at least a competent politician. I guarantee she does some awful things, but I'm not naive enough to believe trump isn't doing trump the same things, they run in trump hehe same circles, they used to be close friends.

       None of the "serious" allegations make any fucking sense though. Who the fuck is leading the charade against Trump? Why don't they attack him for something serious, like bombing Syria without consulting congress?

      <p>
       Russia has dirt on Trump (paying hookers to piss on a mattress).
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia needs Trump to repay back the loans.

       Russia exposed the corruption at the DNC.

       Am I just jaded or biased? I fucking hate Trump's policies and I always have. I think he's hilarious and entertaining, but I don't particular enjoy defending him. However, everything that comes out the dem's mouths sounds like the dumbest shit I've ever heard.

       They support everything he does, the Democrats are themselves infiltrated by Russia and both sides are putting on a show of Russia collusion.

       What if this was part of the reason for the fake russian narrative? Besides destabilizing Trump, but more importantly they knew Kushner was doing something like this and the only way to catch him up was to put

       Let me make sure I understand what you're saying. Is the theory that to oust/expose Kushner they wanted to put the Trump cabinet under scrutiny for Russian collusion?

       Literally just occurred to me. I don't pretend that it is more likely than anything else. But from my perspective the Russian collusion narrative is fake propaganda. But, I don't think these people go to these kind of lengths without a purpose. This gives me a purpose that helps it make sense.

       My immediate issue with this line of thinking is that is makes Kushner Trump's enemy when I've seen nothing to indicate that's accurate. Trump himself seems very fond of Kushner and both seem to benefit from each other.

       I don't think anyone really like Trump, and he will act like he loves the people he hates. See his bright talk of Israel, but choosing to not shake Bibi's hand. He's fake af, and it almost looks like the more he appears to like someone, the more he hates them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Kushner is a snake. Who knows what is really going on in his mind. I dunno, I think there is a great deal of fake outs going on, I won't pretend to know what is real, but I think it is a mistake to take anything these people say at face value.

       The issue with that is that he has done more than just talk up Kushner, he's given him a lot of responsibilities in his administration. Would you give someone you didn't trust power?

       I wouldn't try to distill this situation down to something as simple as does he trust him or not. I think it is a snarl of conflicting allegiances and agreements, and very little in the way of actual trust.

       It's honestly pretty easy to mix up, there are quite a few connections. I don't understand if trump is complicit, or if he's just so damn incompetent everyone around him left him out of the russia loop for fear he'd just blatantly tell people, not realizing it's a secret.

       I don't think so, but he could still go down for obstruction of justice. Even if he thinks "hey there is nothing here with the Russia Trump thing" and legitimately has no idea what the fuck is going on, taking actions to stop the investigation is a crime.

       That's a great point, as ended up being the case in Clinton's email deal. But as far as obstruction of justice, does intent really matter? Asking Comey to lay off Flynn, asking Coats and Rogers to state there's no evidence during the ongoing investigations are serious things even if they find nothing in the end. Trump doesn't want to be investigated period.

       The espionage laws Comey mentioned were written specifically to say that intent was irrelevant. Comey claims that prosecutors still take intent into account.

       I couldn't say, I'm sure there's some way he could be removed but I don't know for sure.  The interesting parts going to be when the investigations turn into trials/hearings and people start flipping on eachother.  Not everyone is immune to prosecution like trump is right now, so either something will come up to get him out of office, or he's really as dumb or senile as it seems and he won't make it much longer anyway.

       But she's not president, there might be some shit handed down to the Democrats because of this, but they were due for a shakeup anyway.  There's special councils, a huge investigation, to think nothing will come of this just because some members of the dnc are also implicated is naive.

       No dude, they didn't.  Obama didn't have special councils looking into him for collusion with a foreign government.  And all the ties to russia are unprecedented, this isn't normal.

       Trump's administration appointed the special counsel. Unless Democrats start winning elections the only people going to prison will be Democrats like Mike Flynn.

       Mike Flynn was appointed by Obama. These investigations are not into the the Trump campaign buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort and Podesta both worked for the same Russian oligarch. These investigations will ensnare Democrats and Republicans if properly done, if they aren't corrupt then they will only ensnare Democrats.

       Dude, you're all over the place. First off, the special council was definitely not appointed by trump or his immediate team, it was appointed by the attorney general.  And Flynn was fired by obama, who warned trump not to hire him, and he still did.  And the investigations are most definitely looking into trumps campaign, and his connections to russia, that's the entire point of the special investigator.

       they might find some democrats were in the wrong, but they're looking st trumps team and the Republicans who worked for the camping and advertising companies.

       Trump only nominated him, he still had to be confirmed.  Plus he was an assistant to the attorney general when Bush was president.  He wasn't in trumps immediate circle.

      <p>
       You're reading too far into this trying to find fault in the info I provided you, and I'm not putting a spin on this, I'm telling you what has happened.  It's not my opinion that trump and his team are being investigated by the special prosecutor, it is a fact.

       , The main Kremlin Think-Tank drew up plans on how to help Trump win.

      <p>
       And, when it looked like HRC was going to win back in mid-late October of 2016, the same think tank decided to instead try to undermine the results of the election by presenting the General Election as rigged against Trump. Coincidentally, that was when Trump gave his stupid fucking

       Nobody has been charged with anything. He hasn't been caught. This is a puppet show.

       The whole Trump administration is puppets so yes you are right. They are a puppet show. And they are one that is exposed as committing treason.

      <p>
       Dont be upset Trump is a hero. He has finally exposed how flawed the current government is. He will bring down his party and their big money donors. He didnt mean to do this, but still credit where credit is due. He is the idiot we needed to bring these people down.

       I don't care. My point is that the public face of your government is irrelevant and Trump is working win Clinton and the Neocon establishment.
