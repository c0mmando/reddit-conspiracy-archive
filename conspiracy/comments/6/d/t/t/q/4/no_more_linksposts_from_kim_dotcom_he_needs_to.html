       If he has the proof why is he acting like these Biggs documents could be real? I thought he has proof regardless..? Im far from an expert so maybe Im wrong but it seems like hes just benifiting off of Conspiracy and Seth Rich. I say we tell him fuck off until he

       I've seen that he's tweeted about how he's suspicious that the documents are fake and wants validity now, but I'm still skeptical of his intentions. He lied about having HRC emails during the podesta leaks. Hes posting all these justice for seth rich posts on twitter. Well give up the proof then! Probably easier said than done but IMO hes leading us on.

       All I want is someone to post evidence. For all I've seen people saying he's produced nothing, the only replies I've seen are accusations of being a shill (which is incredibly naive and immature) and not links to things he's achieved?

       No they are not. Not at all. Th3 person he is asking a guarantee from is in no position to give that guarantee.

       It's a stupid trick. Make unrealistic demand, know that they will never be met. And then he'll say "well, I wanted to testify but my conditions weren't met".

       And if he wants to testify in front of Mueller (which is exactly how this needs to happen) he needs safe passage. That is not only a reasonable demand, it is the only reasonable demand.

       Mueller has the authority to investigate the Russia conspiracy and anything that comes from that. That sure involves Rich if he is in fact the leaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a liar because you know Mueller has broad authority, including the authority to grant Kim's request.
