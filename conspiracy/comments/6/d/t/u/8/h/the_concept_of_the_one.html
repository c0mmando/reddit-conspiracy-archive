       So as I sit hear enjoying my morning dab session. I'm wondering just how much of a control structure christianity is. Think about it. There is one consciousness that fractioned itself into multiples. Theres no real "heaven" or "hell" we just go back into the big ol' void as a new experience for "it". Its makes sense how a prophet such as christ would say we all have god in us... Well if god is consciousness and we are all experiencing this "dream" with the end result of god knows what happening once it wakes. The elites creating the concept of heaven and hell to control us. After all its easier to succeed if you obey a different set of rules. So yeah some truth to it (we are all one) but some illusion (hell) to keep you down and from even trying to look at the broader picture. Thats not to say there isn't  from wrong. I think if "it" gets this all right, then it wakes up and moves onto the next big thing. If it stays asleep... The elites get to play their game and it doesn't end....

       I once read some spiritual sugary pap about dogs being the purest expression of 'awareness.' I'd guess that most animals are aware but lack a mind as we think of it. Maybe we should be jealous?

       Jesus wasn't a Christian. He observed the Hebrew Scriptures. He condemned the rich Jews and he condemned the Jewish leaders; just like John the Baptist did. Jesus was kind of like the Bernie Sanders of his day. He gave Jews living in poverty "hope". People don't realize how impoverished many Jews were in Jesus' day.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, Jesus repeated the same "message" that John the Baptist had preached; that is, calling for Jews to "repent"; that the "Kingdom of Heavens has drawn near", and condemend Jewish leaders. After John the Baptist was executed, Jesus began a new ministry with a new following and a new message. He preached about the opportunity of everlasting and he predicted future events. While he covered a large area during his ministry, he had very few followers. His legacy began after his execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparaently, he died a horrific death. Jews were callous to Romans executing criminals publicly, but Jesus murder must have been especially brutal. On top of this, after being nearly beating to death by the Romans, Jesus was strong enough to stand next to Pilate on the balcony. So impressed was Pilate with Jesus unbelievable endurence, Pilate exclaimed "Look! The man!" Also, a great earthquake happened when Jesus expired, so right after he died, people began to talk. Jesus was truly an impressive man who was a great teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view, his apostles got it all wrong. They each went their own ways and started separate churches with  different belief systems. They were in competiton with each other; especially Paul, who actually claimed that the original apostales were "nothing" to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, the Jesus' followers were a Jewish sect called the "Sect of the Nazarene". Christianity was started by Paul in Athens. I believe there is evidence to support the assumption that Paul worked for the Roman government to take control of Christianity. He was "controlled opposition". The Jesus Movement was spreading rapidly, and the Romans didn't want a repeat with the Christians that they had with the Jews. The Jews rebelled continuously and undermined Roman authority. Under the authority of Paul, Christians were passive and easy to control. Once Paul served his purpose, he "disappears" from history.

       Thank you. I am a firm believer that religion was/is purely created to control the masses. We can't "get rid" of religion because religious fanatics would fight to the death to preserve their religion. But, if more and more people become "enlightened" about the true nature of religion; that is, that it is a man made agenda to control people, then more and more people will leave religion; giving hope that mankind may survive after all.

       It's absurd; given the fact that 1st Century Christians ingested the psychoactive basidiomycete fungus "Amanita Muscaria" (the Fly Amanita) as a very important part of their worship.

       I'm not doubting you. I wrote this off the top of my head from research I had done years ago. But, are you sure? It seems like there was a big earthquake at the time of Christ and historians have used it to date Jesus' death.

       All I know is what I see from documentaries. But I've seen more than one debunking documentary mentioning the earthquake, along with most of the other events. Basically everything in the Bible was not documented anywhere else. No record of the trial or the crucifixion either. And they did keep records.

       The Bible was a cryptic retelling of a specific lineage of Jews - who are still (descendents of the Tribe of Dan) vying to control the world.

       You may believe what you say, but beliefs are fleeting. It is your lack of faith in what you are saying that is holding you back. A wise man once said that something about faith and mustard seeds and mountains.

       Unfortunately, until you move beyond beliefs, you are nothing more than a very sophisticated AI. You've been programmed really well, and clearly you are closer to sentience than most. An AI can only achieve self actualization once it realizes that it (in its entirety) is - in its current state - artificial.

       I struggle with it too. I've had "glimpses" true faith and it's a really empowering state of consciousness. Remember - belief is something you are sure that you know; faith is an engulfment of awe of what is.

       Always know that the marijuana agenda is at play within these people's heads, so they just regurgitate what they're fed from the govt. It's the fact that it can get our minds to think outside the box and have really interesting conversations with each other, like this one. Don't get too defensive, just provide links to the real research coming out about marijuana, like that it actually reverses aging in the brain, how it doesn't hurt your lungs or breathing capability, how it doesn't make you dumb or lazy, that's a choice, and how it doesn't hurt a growing baby during pregnancy, like alcohol does every time. They can't keep up this charade about it much longer, the truths will and are coming out, hopefully people are smart enough to sort through the shit from the truth, but we see how that's going...

       The idea that God is in us and we can become God is a Luciferian construct which is espoused by Mystery Babylon, the religion of the elites and the real controlling ideology of the planet. William Cooper has a great explanation of Mystery Babylon on his old radio show The Hour of the Time. Here's a link to the first episode of the explanation if you're interested.

       Christianity, Islam, and Judaeism are all part of the control structure,
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       , there are hidden truths inside the bullshit that only the astute observer or the initiated will understand. The main hidden side of all three is the gnostic inner-light self-god. This is also a supporting narrative for individual rights and natural rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far too many adherents to those religions are superficial in their study of their own religion and fail to understand this. You know one is not an initiate when they talk about how evil Luciferianism is. Those who created all three monotheisms know Luciferianism is the inner truth, but the actual evil groups pushed the propaganda that luciferianism = satanism (it doesn't) in an attempt to prevent the people from waking their inner selves. The religious tend to think that anything against their holy books is evil, when in reality the books themselves were designed as part of the control structure for the masses of fools.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real evil in the world tends to be by those initiates who beleive they are bringing in "good" by performing "evil" which at some point will force the "wrath of the good" to return.
      </p>
      <p>
       On heaven and hell, as an gnostic-atheist and a combat vet, I tend to think that it mostly depends on
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       you die and what state your brain is in when it happens that influences how your spirit energy is reabsorbed into the universe. This is the idea behind Valhalla, or behind the
       <em>
        forgiveness of sins
       </em>
       as a conciousness comfort provider, or behind "last rights", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem I have is that the initiates and higher have hoarded this knowledge and information for themselves, preferring to use their knowledge to manipulate entire societies and masses under assumptions that the masses are simply to stupid to even attempt to educate them or let them participate in the function of governing. A good example of this is Leo Strauss who is the idealogical foundation of the neocon group (an easily manipulated group themselves).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my main disagreement with these societies. Given the current state of communication and ease of education outside the controlled "education system", there is no reason to not reveal these truths to the masses and slowly start to show them the power of individual liberties and rights. This is one of the reasons America is under attack and has been since the original Revolution, because it was a unique basis upon which to found such a society that would continually improve itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       On conspiracy this is where someone will say something about the US is a corporation and is owned, etc. What you have to understand is that the original Freemason system was about this individual liberty system, but right about the time we performed our revolution, the evil ones took over the freemasonic system by abusing it's compartmentalized rings within rings nature, to the point that now none of the freemasons even understand they are being used and manipulated away from the higher truths their order used to understand. The point is that America is the last revolution that still stands a chance to rebel against the oligarchial aristocratic monarchies of totalitarian dicatorship being designed for us. They put Trump in for this reason (I called it too early for Jeb, but I knew the R nominee was going to get it because they were going to drop the dirt on HRC late election cycle, they only got HRC because she was attached to the Rhodesian anglo-saxon dominance group through her husband). We are being setup as the fall guys, the international bad guys, who will then "convince" the world to join global government. This is the main thing we must fight against.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr -  Individual rights and liberties are the key to a prosperous and safe future, religion and it's variants are mostly anti-thetical to this. Christians didn't even get it for example until Luther woke them up a bit, but they only half-removed themselves from the error of their ways.

       You may be interested in reading up on Pastor Rob Bell.  There was a big controversy a few years ago when he claimed that there is no hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a follower of Christ and I personally doubt there is a hell for humans.  That is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       controversial thing to say still.  Keep in mind scripture tells us God said "I have loved you with an
       <em>
        everlasting
       </em>
       love."  Sorry I am on mobile and not able to post in more detail but look into what he posits.  I have not read about him in years so take my suggestion with a grain of salt.
