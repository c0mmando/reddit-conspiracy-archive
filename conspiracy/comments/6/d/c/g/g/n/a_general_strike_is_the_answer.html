       The way to defeat the powers that be is to stop playing their game. If a good percent of the population decided to not participate in everyday society no work no School no materialistic consumerism bs just buying the essentials to survive and not contributing to our system in any other way. When their precious capitalism is threatened is when they will be forced to hear our voices.

       I like the way you think, but everyone is asleep. They think capitalism is the only way to live. The county I live in has a big Amish community and I'm starting to think maybe we are the crazy ones, not Amish.

       Indeed. Crony-Capitalism is the problem, along with Consumerism, and Globalism (in it's current form). Which is why we must abolish government and self rule. Corporations in their current form can only exist when there is a government to corrupt.

       Completely agree. I believe people would truly benefit (and be better off) living simpler lives (ie. homesteading - growing food, raising livestock, hunting, fishing, etc etc).

       Although Amish have their own issues with government because each area is run by an arch bishop of the church. So it's local government but what they say fucking goes or you'll get excommunicated in a flash

       Well true, but that's a business. Both parties are voluntarily exchange goods. The boss wants your skills and time, and in return pays you what you agreed (ie. a paycheck).

       The capitalist pays you an amount less than the value that you produced for the market, thus extracting profit off your labor.

       So, now that we have that down. You own a playstation 4, I do not. I want a ps4, so I ask if you would like to trade me. You ask what I have, and I say: "Well, I have a rubber duck, a gold coin, a button". You stop me and say: "I will trade you for your golden coin".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, do I want that ps4 more than my golden coin (mmm, sure). So, we voluntarily trade, if I think that is worth my golden coin. End of transaction. We go off on our merry own ways, happily knowing we just profited (ie. got something we did not have before).

       Nope. Still applies if you build something yourself. If it costs you $40 to build a chair, in order to profit from it, you raise the price of what you want in trade for it, and what others are willing to trade for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the sake of money, if people only think it's worth 35$, you either lower the price (take a hit), or figure out how to lower the price in producing it (ie. costing you only $30 to accept the rate of $35 that people are willing to trade you for it).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basic economics, and how so many people do not understand it, worries me about the countries future (and humanity, for that sake).

       I think you're onto something here.

      <p>
       When nobody has the resources to damage the system, the only option is voluntary non-participation. We're trained young to participate and are penalized for not participating. It's ingrained into our psyche that non-action is non-productive. In actuality, non-action is a choice to not act.

       So they keep us divided so that if one side says "everyone just stop for a minute" the other side says "you just want to kill all the kittens in the world!" or something oblique like that.

       We aren't actually starting from scratch. We are more expanding into something bigger. We are evolving. We need to take what we have and steer it into a new, progressive direction. The only good direction is the legit one.

       We cannot stay static anymore. We need to be dynamic. We need to constantly upgrade our society or else it will become stale. Just small changes on a regular basis to form a more perfect union.

       You don't make things better with government or corporate rule.  You'd need to cut like 90% of government including military and bring back corporate charters.  Concentrated power always attracts sociopath's.  It's why democide is the number one killer of humans and it's not even close.  We need to maximize liberty and leave people live how they want as long as they're not hurting anyone.  We need to reject fear and leaders.  Collectivism always leads to death.

       You cannot separate the political from the economic.  We don't have free market capitalism because it doesn't exist--anywhere.  It is a unicorn.  Capitalism decays into crony-capitalism as naturally as water running downhill.  Because capitalism, by definition, is concentration of wealth, and therefore, of political power.

       this has been my say.. everyone needs to wake up and nonviolently stand down. imagine being able to band together and just walk right up to TPTB and slap cuffs on em? its farfetched/sorta ideaistic and would take alot of cooeration but its doable.. and realistically whats best for us.

       But it's not easy. As shown by the latest mass demonstrations and protest, mass media support and promotion would be needed to make a significative percentage of the population to leave the couch and act.

       And you can bet it would happen if, say, one day marshals arrested Hillary or someone of her ilk. I can already see the newstertainers barking on TV, every young person dragged to the streets by their idols and

       , corporate America flexing its' muscles.

       It is vague, but if it is determined that it creates a national emergency it is illegal.

       NATIONAL EMERGENCY STRIKES
      </p>
      <p>
       The Taft-Hartley Act gives the president of the United States the power to intervene when a strike becomes a "national emergency strike." National emergency strikes are those that can endanger national health or safety. The president may appoint a board of inquiry charged with making a report of the situation. Based upon this report, the president could apply for an injunction restraining the strike for 60 days. If there has been no resolution at the end of 60 days, the injunction can be extended for another 20 days. During this period, employees are polled in a secret ballot to determine their willingness to comply with the terms of their employer's last offer.

       The dream of repeating 1946 is constrained by –- among a multitude of factors —  legal barriers erected in the years since. The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act prohibits unions from calling strikes in solidarity with other workers. It also prohibits wildcat and political strikes. Since Taft-Hartley, organized labor has, on the whole, been on the back foot. As Robyn D. G. Kelley, professor of American History at UCLA, noted, even the most militant recent labor struggles are “simply fighting to save collective bargaining and union recognition.”
