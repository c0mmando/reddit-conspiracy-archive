<p>Until completely proven to be false..a possible conspiracy should not be dismissed.</p>

<p>And I will also defend a person&#39;s right to be suspicious of the investigation&#39;s conclusions if it doesn&#39;t satisfy them. I will simply ask them to list the reasons and back up the claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With Trump being more friendly with Russia, I don&#39;t necessarily believe that. I think he doesn&#39;t want to be outright rude towards Russia because it is a lot harder to make deals when both sides hate each other. And I think Clinton was more incompetent towards Russia.

<p>why wouldn&#39;t she be? she had years of experience in government while Trump had none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is about where I am. From the beginning Trump only cared about being on TV and having huge crowds cheer for him. He was toxic enough of a figure that he had to settle for sleazy fucks like Manafort running his campaign. He was happy to go along with taking a soft stance on Russia and an anti-NATO tone because none of that mattered to him. He wasn&#39;t acting nefariously initially, just indifferent and incompetent.</p>

<p>I do think he has managed to incriminate himself since just because he&#39;s defensive and unwilling to admit fault. He needed to own up early on that some shady people were in his circle and do what was necessary to clean house. Now he&#39;s digging himself in deeper by trying to shut down the investigation in an incompetent manner.</p>

<p>This is just my opinion, though, wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was either more culpable or less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use a lot of words that don&#39;t work for what the news claimed happened. </p>

<p>Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the election doesn&#39;t really work because it has been stated a number of times by the previous administrations officials that Russia didn&#39;t change the ACTUAL VOTE.</p>

<p>Another word they try to use is Russia &quot;interfered&quot; with the election, but since the election actually happened and there was no change to the final votes, they didn&#39;t actually interfere.</p>

<p>The truth is, Russia probably TRIED to INFLUENCE the election, like a large number of our &quot;allies&quot; also did (and to a greater effect). The catch is, even Obama tried to influence brexit by making statements about he feels the UK should vote before the referendum. There was a clear push by news outlets in the UK for Hillary as well. So does it really matter that a foreign country tried to influence an election when it is pretty much common practice? I think it is shitty that countries do that, but I am not going to be selectively outraged over one country more than another, especially when we do it pretty regularly ourselves.</p>

<p>You see people use those other words, because it allows the listener to imagine that there is more to what is being said than really is being said. There was no election hack or interference. Russia PROBABLY TRIED to INFLUENCE the election, that is all we have evidence to claim.</p>
