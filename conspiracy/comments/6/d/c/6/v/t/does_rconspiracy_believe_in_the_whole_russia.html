       If anyone actually believes it, please could you explain to me how and why Russia would "hack" the election. Also why would they want Trump over Clinton? What would they gain and what would their motivation be to have Trump in office?

       No idea...crazy shit tho...it's not going away on this sub..regardless of attempts to do so..one more point in r/conspiracy favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until completely proven to be false..a possible conspiracy should not be dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for the Trump/Russia stuff. Until the investigations are complete..I will not dismiss them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I will also defend a person's right to be suspicious of the investigation's conclusions if it doesn't satisfy them. I will simply ask them to list the reasons and back up the claim.

       Agree on all points. Like, I don't think Trump doing dirt with Russia is unreasonable at all. I just think Trump and Russia are both confused by the election hack stuff. Like at first they were like "Oh no, they found out about the hookers and cocaine!" Then they read the stuff the media was saying about them and were like "wut?"

       With Trump being more friendly with Russia, I don't necessarily believe that. I think he doesn't want to be outright rude towards Russia because it is a lot harder to make deals when both sides hate each other. And I think Clinton was more incompetent towards Russia. The whole start over button thing made the US look like idiots and she wanted a no fly zone which the Russians basically said that they would go to war If that were set in place.

       With everyone working against him and his candidates at those positions, yes it would be hard to get people through. And people throw out that she is the most qualified person ever to run. But why? She did absolutely nothing while in power but build up her family's wealth through their foundation. Trump ran a successful business and has employed thousands of people and dealt with foreign people as well.

       GOP has house and senate

       The KGB has a term specifically from him - a useful idiot.  I do believe there was some Russian shenanigans with the election and after.  Do I think that's why Trump won?  That is impossible to answer.  I really don't care about the election anymore, I'm more worried about compromised advisors in the beginning of his presidency.

       This is about where I am. From the beginning Trump only cared about being on TV and having huge crowds cheer for him. He was toxic enough of a figure that he had to settle for sleazy fucks like Manafort running his campaign. He was happy to go along with taking a soft stance on Russia and an anti-NATO tone because none of that mattered to him. He wasn't acting nefariously initially, just indifferent and incompetent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think he has managed to incriminate himself since just because he's defensive and unwilling to admit fault. He needed to own up early on that some shady people were in his circle and do what was necessary to clean house. Now he's digging himself in deeper by trying to shut down the investigation in an incompetent manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just my opinion, though, wouldn't be surprised if he was either more culpable or less.

       They use a lot of words that don't work for what the news claimed happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia "hacked" the election doesn't really work because it has been stated a number of times by the previous administrations officials that Russia didn't change the ACTUAL VOTE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another word they try to use is Russia "interfered" with the election, but since the election actually happened and there was no change to the final votes, they didn't actually interfere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, Russia probably TRIED to INFLUENCE the election, like a large number of our "allies" also did (and to a greater effect). The catch is, even Obama tried to influence brexit by making statements about he feels the UK should vote before the referendum. There was a clear push by news outlets in the UK for Hillary as well. So does it really matter that a foreign country tried to influence an election when it is pretty much common practice? I think it is shitty that countries do that, but I am not going to be selectively outraged over one country more than another, especially when we do it pretty regularly ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see people use those other words, because it allows the listener to imagine that there is more to what is being said than really is being said. There was no election hack or interference. Russia PROBABLY TRIED to INFLUENCE the election, that is all we have evidence to claim.

       Nope not even close. I do however believe that they maybe influenced it a bit trying to sway public opinion by assisting in exposing the truth online maybe. Which I'm all for, considering the shit our government is responsible for including interfering in other governments elections and pushing coups.

       what are you talking about

       GOP has house and senate
      </p>
      <p>
       it's called competency...  it's his own fault if he can't get his own part to get along with him. Obama ran the government fine for years with GOP going against everything he does

       anyhow, if you don't agree because you made up your mind already, there's really no point of this conversation, you ain't changing your mind. Sometimes though you got to let reality kick in or you just sound silly

       Lol if only he had a Senate majority to put these people through. You realize the President still has to nominate over 50% of the positions that need to be filled right? Nobody is working against him there, he just hasn't done his homework yet.
