        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Despite my username, I don&#39;t want to pretend to be a detective. However, my instincts are telling me to go back to the last point where there&#39;s an inconsistency. The manager at Lou&#39;s appears to be lying. Read this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the bar closed at around 1:45 a.m. on July 10, the 27-year-old walked out of the bar to the sidewalk and started talking with the manager. The manager on duty who knew the DNC employee very well asked him if he wanted a ride home knowing that he had about a mile walk to his home. The manager said Rich declined the offer and decided to go to The Wonderland Ballroom located a couple blocks down the street. However, police cannot confirm that he was at that bar.</p>

<p>There were reports that Rich was highly intoxicated. But sources tell FOX 5 that those toxicology results are still not back. According to witnesses at Lou’s City Bar, they said he had a couple of drinks. Police sources believe that the two hours after he left the bar, the alcohol he consumed would have already worn down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even police don&#39;t buy the manager&#39;s story that Seth was sloshing drunk. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4516416/DNC-staffer-Seth-Rich-family-demand-answers-cops.html">Nobody recognized Seth</a> at Wonderland which means it&#39;s highly unlikely he went there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/seth-rich-wasnt-just-another-dc-murder-victim-he-was-a-meme-in-the-weirdest-presidential-election-of-our-times/2017/01/18/ee8e27f8-dcc0-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html">According to Washington Post</a> (not believable but we need to look at the claim), Seth was on the phone the entire time with his girlfriend from 2:05AM to 4:19AM:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 2:05, he called his girlfriend, who was in her home state of Michigan. They spoke for 89 minutes. Then the call dropped. A few minutes later, he called her again, and they spoke for 43 more minutes.</p>

<p>At about 4:19 a.m., Rich told his girlfriend he was almost home and said, “I gotta go,” according to Rich’s father, who has spoken with his girlfriend. (She asked not to be named or quoted because of continuing harassment of those connected to the case.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where was he? The journey was only 30 minutes to walk back to his place. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd that he would spend 132 minutes on the phone with his girlfriend at 4:00AM in the morning outside in the dead of night when he could be talking inside his place? Doesn&#39;t that seem strange? We don&#39;t know where he was in these final moments. Once we crack that, we solve a LOT.</p>

The MPD cited 14 Ccn coordinates that covered the dudes tracks from block to block.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly if Hillary <em>really</em> had him killed we have a way bigger problem on our hands than just image issues.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to have the whole entire police force in your pocket, judges, lawyers, the people who do the autopsies, etc., just to get <em>away</em> with a murder and cover it up. But how do you get all these people to agree to something so crazy and illegal?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t just waltz right in and convince people to cover up a murder. What that should tell us is that the whole system was built on a morally corrupt foundation to begin with. If the chief of police changes hands for example how do you ensure the new guy would be down to do something like cover up a murder? The whole system has to be controlled.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to take care of every individual with influence and the ability to see through the cover up. And that&#39;s a fuck ton of people since murder involves the authorities, the health care system, legal bodies, politicians, and the media. So many people would have to be in on it to ensure you&#39;re not caught.</p>

<p>If the DNC killed Seth Rich we&#39;re fucked because that means the whole damn system is rotten. </p>

Almost every legitimate business has cameras facing at least out towards their entrance and usually in front of the entrance.

<p>If he was shot right next to his apartment, that would possibly be a big clue, or a big coincidence, or possibly just that he was pacing out front of his apartment for minutes while on the phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For you maybe not, but we don&#39;t know his actual phone calling patterns. Some people can&#39;t just sit and talk on the phone, especially for extended periods of time. And if what the family said was true and the reception in his apartment was awful then it really isn&#39;t out of the realm of possibility that he may have been just walking around outside his apartment while on the phone with his girlfriend and lost track of the time. </p>

<p>And in all honestly D.C. Still isn&#39;t even the safest of areas in general and in the last couple months there have been dozens of armed robberies and thefts in the area he was shot. You see someone walking around not paying attention to what he&#39;s doing because he&#39;s on the phone and that&#39;s the easiest target of all. </p>

<p>Here is the narrative that people in this thread are trying to establish: very drunk, 3 hour walk and talk in the middle of the night, an obvious target, he&#39;s murdered in an attempted robbery because who wouldn&#39;t be robbed acting this dumb?</p>

<p>Then they&#39;ll doctor up some cctv footage and release that in a few weeks if this doesn&#39;t blow over.</p>

<p>Why won&#39;t skeptics get on board withbthat reasoning?</p>

<p>Persinally, I&#39;m a little more biased and take the harder stance. It sounds like the construction of a narrative. Clearly a simple mugging would make given the walk and talk narrative.</p>

<p>My question is was thisba work day? Did he have an iPhone? How was his battery able to handle 3 hours of talk time after a full day? Did he have a charger at work? Did he carry a battery</p>

<p>I know my phone would be low on battery by 1am, and it wouldn&#39;t last for a 3 hour call. But I guess that&#39;s a silly way of looking at this.</p>

<p>Burkman hasn’t figured out all the logistics yet. Another development has nudged the reenactment to the back burner: Burkman announced this week that a retired Army intelligence officer has led him to believe that Russia was behind the murder. “I think this guy is credible,” he says.</p>

<p>The source believes high-ranking Russian officials ordered Rich’s assassination after he discovered that Russia hacked the DNC. The Russian hacking story broke the month before the murder, which Burkman says supports his case. He has sent letters to the chairs of the House Homeland Security and Oversight committees calling for an investigation into the alleged Russian connection. Burkman’s source is the sole support for Russia being involved.</p>

<p>I like the idea of a reenactment but that theory  is so ridiculous. </p>

<p>Calls dad ~11pm, calls friend ~1am , calls dad 1:30am (3 mins total all calls - times estimated), calls other friend for 12 minutes at 1:30am - calls girlfriend 1:45 - 2:30 (about the time it takes to walk home) - calls girlfriend again 3:15 - 4:00.

    <div class="md"><p>So essentially, when he ended his first call with girlfriend at 2:30, he got home. About 45 minutes later - enough time to take a dump, recharge the phone a bit and microwave a burrito - he steps outside to call his gf again and walk&#39;n&#39;talk. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s no inordinate missing time as suggested in OP&#39;s lie by omitting all the accounted for time points you mention between 1:45 and 4:15.</p>

<p>They spoke for that long and he was murdered right after they hung up.  Makes you wonder if she was a part of hit.  He could have confessed on that call that he was going public with Clinton&#39;s voter fraud scheme.  She notified the hit team via text and kept him outside walking and talking until they arrived.  Far fetched I know but it&#39;s the only way I could believe someone being on the phone that late at night with a drunk person. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you&#39;re downvoted. It&#39;s entirely plausible. Maybe he intended on going to wonderland, called GF on the way and ended up staying on the phone for a long time. Since it&#39;s hard to talk on the phone in a bar/club, he may have just meandered his way home, since the manager said it was about a mile walk. I walk a mile in about ten minutes, but I have a long stride. Can&#39;t see it taking the average person more than 20. Besides, it&#39;s not a weird thing to just go out for a walk, especially when you&#39;re on a long distance phone call with a SO.</p>

<p>Because in my years of heavy drinking in college I can guarantee you it doesn&#39;t mean something important was being discussed. </p>

What I read on his blog was he specifically said that he wasn&#39;t involved in the leak.  He said his reply to this question in the comments section of his blog.  Of course I can&#39;t find this.  But spend time on his blog you will see that he has integrity.  The speech he gave is also there.  The newspapers reported that he was a conduit.</p>
