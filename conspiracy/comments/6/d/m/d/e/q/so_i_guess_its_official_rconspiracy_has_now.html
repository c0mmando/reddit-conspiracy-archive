       Yes. By being born in a state that primarily votes blue, the first Clinton became president, which in turn gave HRC political experience which eventually made her run for president. So Seth Rich wouldn't have been working for the HRC had I never been born. Instead he was in D.C and killed by random thugs after a struggle.

       RIP Seth. I'm sorry.

       That's NOT the problem. I up voted the original Fox 5 story. I'm interested in both. The problem is they're brigade our sub, controlling the front page so it looks like a mirror of T_D.

       They don't give a fuck about Seth. This is dirty politics and information warefare. They will post posting anti DNC shit to see what sticks to try to distract us from Trump selling arms to Saudie Arbia. To distract us from the new Trumpcare that will take healthcare from 23 million Americans. And do distract us from the daily drip of the Trump-Russia scandal.

       How long before you start blaming those damn Russians for hacking into r/conspiracy and replacing all of the pro-Hillary posts with "Seth Rich/Pro Tump" posts?

       Fuck Fox News and fuck you dude.  I'll never understand why ppl spend time in subs they don't enjoy.  Pretty sure ppl here disagree with fox 99% of the time.  Hmm for example anything to have to do with bush 9/11, Reagan drugs/arms deals, or anything that shits on Rumsfeld or Cheney has ALWAYS been accepted and pushed here.  Gary Webb who exposed Reagan era drug pushing is on the front page here like once a month.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the1% of the time where we agree with ONE GUY on FOX who everyone agrees usually blows cock (hannity), ppl come storming in here calling us alt-right or w/e the cool phrase is nowadays.  Fuck off.  Fuck fox x2.  Fuck hannity x3.  But I'm gonna listen to the man if his dumbass is the only one with the balls to cover this story.

       It's just weight of numbers as 'Seth Rich' is the #1 conspiracy right now. In a few weeks it will go back to Moon Landings, Ancient Aliens, JFK, Ley Lines and all that other good stuff.

       Why the fuck do people keep making posts like this? This is so far from pro T_D it's not even debatable. Most of us here hate T_D. And for the record the Seth Rich stuff didn't just come out of no where. When smoke spreads so does the fire, and this happens to be a conspiracy sub where I along with others, and hopefully you, seek the truth.

       Your right this sub just totally happens to embrace the shit T_D spreads and downvotes anything that reflects badly on Trump. Just just a crazy random happenstance am i right?
      </p>

       There is no smoke. All this Seth stuff started because a paid fox news actor was paid to distract from Trump and its blatantly obvious and ya'll ate it up because feelings are more important than the Truth here.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one who thinks Seth is the Leaker gives one shit about the Truth. The entire thing is based on feelings and Assange literally telling you what to think and people believing without question.

       Not when there was no evidence.  When they realized the news wasn't going to talk about the evidence.  Just like Pgate.  Just like 9/11.  Just like Intel agencies spying on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they can't even take time to breath between throwing at half baked trump Russia propaganda.  If Trump is working with Russia show the evidence.

       The trump-Russia evidence or PG/SR?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean trump-Russia, tgen ofcourse there is that chance, but NONE of the Intel agencies deserve to be believed at face value.  The CIA,NSA,FBI all have a LONG track record of Lying and scheming to society domestic and foreign for personal gain.  If they want me to believe them now after revelations or Atleast doubt shadowing official story of  JFK, 9/11, WACO, OKC, Tuskegee, Sandy Hook, Boston marathon, MK ultra, mockingbird, artichoke, paper clip, tonkin, Iraq WMDs, Snowden leaks, and most recently Wikileaks then they better show some damn evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the SR PG leaks actually being disinfo fed to us from IA's via 4chan---yes that is a HUGE worry of mine.

       Again this R/conspiracy. And again, you're talking out of your ass, fox gives Trump about a 52% positive view the rest is negative while other main news corporations give him a 85%+ negative view. Fox news is the most middle ground when compared to every other news source. And you're claiming they're protecting "daddy". Do yourself and all of us a favor and jump off of r/conspiracy. You're more suited for r/politics.

       I find that hard to believe. Because Seth Rich being the leaker is entirely a conclusion based on feelings with not a single piece of truth. T_D folks believe it because if they believe that they can absolve Trump and Co. of ALL russian connections.

       They don't need to absolve crap. The russian story is just the DNC blaming something other than themselves for their loss. Its unbelievable how people actually buy into it, literally zero proof, but it gets repeated all the time on the news. Its like everyone is getting brainwashed, it is fucking creepy. What else is there that media made us all believe that is blatantly false?

       All true. All of it. You make a cross remark about he who shall not be named and you've got massive downvotes within a few seconds. Not just me. Anyone who crosses the T, smacked with downvotes.

       Not when there was no evidence.  When they realized the news wasn't going to talk about the evidence.  Just like Pgate.  Just like 9/11.  Just like Intel agencies spying on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they can't even take time to breath between throwing at half baked trump Russia propaganda.  If Trump is working with Russia show the evidence.

       Again this R/conspiracy. And again, you're talking out of your ass, fox gives Trump about a 52% positive view the rest is negative while other main news corporations give him a 85%+ negative view. Fox news is the most middle ground when compared to every other news source. And you're claiming they're protecting "daddy". Do yourself and all of us a favor and jump off of r/conspiracy. You're more suited for r/politics.
