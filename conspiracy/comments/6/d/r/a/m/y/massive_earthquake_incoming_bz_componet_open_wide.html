      <p>
       Recent activity indicates potential locations of nagano or another indonesian/ Philippines area quake. Id wager closer to fukushima area if Japan takes the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       33% likely to see this play out elsewhere. Its a big one. Likely 7.0 - 8.0+ so while east coast japan is my primary location of interest at this time there is a slight chance that we see activity in Elsalvador Chile or New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Main location of interest. 38 km E off Hitachi, Japan 6.9 - 7.4

       <em>
        50-25 km depth-
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangelets possible on usa west coast. 4.0- 5.0 activity. (California).
      </p>
      <p>
       The bz only opens like that when we get rocked. Stay safe out there guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably a round of 6.0 - 5.5 aftershocks seen globally over next 48 hours.

      <p>
       Just wanted to say that was a huge breach. We ahould truly be seeing a huge eq this run. Could easily go 8.0 (although solar winds were quite weak in that regard).

      <p>
       In regards to my theory this earthquake is now postulating. 
The energy has breached the magnetosphere heavily. Aiding to growth and expansion of the earths inner flux tubes at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are cruizing a low wind speed which is great for a test. 350km/s effectively. A 325 would be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we wait in anticipation. We appear to be just several hours away from the main shock.

       Stay safe at reddit and japan. :)

       <em>
        This is a very moderate wind stream with a very long duration. I assess the incoming earthquake to reflect that.

        conclusion
       </strong>
       We have now seen a planetary bell ringer in a primary named location.
       <em>
        Users in other named locations may not be out of hot water at this time.
       </em>
       It was a large breach and I feel that this is not the only quake of this scale to take place throughout the nest two days. I apologise and would like to admit I RECIEVED THIS DATA LATE. This lead to an uncertainty in the exact naming of locations. Working as fast as I could three locations were named. All showing signs of activity. Had I had more time I feel I'd have done better in tracking this event. My apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you are from another location named. Stay precautious for the next 48 hours. Please and TY

       A high speed solar wind stream above 600 km/s is now moving past Earth. Enhanced geomagnetic activity reaching minor (G1) storm levels will be possible during the next 24 hours. High latitude sky watchers should be alert for visual aurora when it is dark outside. Data below courtesy of the DSCOVR spacecraft

On the sun, middle latitude coronal hole #47 will become geoeffective over the next 24-72 hours. A minor (G1) geomagnetic storm watch will be in effect after December 20th once a high speed solar wind stream arrives past our planet. Here on Earth, sky watchers at higher latitudes should be alert for visible aurora later this week. Stay tuned to SolarHam.com for the most up to date information. Image below courtesy of SDO/AIA.

       Your posts are a bit difficult for me, but on this thread it looks like you're predicting a likelihood of a 7.0 or larger earthquake in the Fukushima area  2- 48 hours from the time of your original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I got your message right?

       As always, fascinating information.  If you wanna get "their" attention, go ahead and short the yen and simultaneously buy stock in the reinsurance companies in Japan.  Money talks to these folks.  If you make a market out of it people will pay attention.

       In all seriousness, buy futures based on your predictions, even if just a small amount.  I guarantee you will be found.  When you monetize your knowledge they always find you.

      <p>
       What's your background btw?  You speak very fluently about a number of disparate domains.  Stats?  Combinatorics?  Clearly you're some sort of quant.  I used to do political predictioneering with game theory and you seem to have a flavor of it in your work.  In any case, keep up the awesome work, I always enjoy reading your hypotheses.

       Technically I am just quite well read and inquisitive. I have formal intellectual parents who always pestered me to question everything by inferring the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science and mathematics always suited me as niche areas of interest, amongat astronomy and physics. Seismology also interested me at a young age. Accompanying geology and geography. 
I suppose I am just a quiet wall flower...
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive worked many places yet find myself struggling to grasp a formal position in a respected environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really apply myself to he honest. Its more a self failure analog that compels me to only reach for the lowest obtainable reach prior to factually being turned down for the various qualities that make me question myself.

       My best friend is like you.  Brilliant, lacks all formal training, makes lateral thinking across domains seem machine-like, and is completely unaware of how big a difference he could really make if someone just directed and organized for him.  I find the smartest people also tend to be those who can't reconcile their intellect within the social / political / economic architecture we've established as a society.  It's simply beneath them (in a good way).  Sort of like a ego = 1/knowledge type of thing.  Idiots always shout the loudest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good to know you and please try to start building up the confidence to make a difference outside of anonymous message boards.  The world needs more openly brilliant people working together if we're to fix all that's wrong.  In the meantime, keep spreading your wisdom and insight.  I, along with many others here, really appreciate the effort!

       Einstein famously coined the "Ego = 1/knowledge" ... Can't quite take credit for that one.  Ironically Telsa probably embodies its' spirit more than anyone.

       I seriously feel like tesla-
      </p>
      <p>
       Edison was an opportunist. A clever wordsmith with immoral practices and slightly questionable motives in everything he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel tragic for tesla reaply. The man truly was snever credited fully for the brilliance he harbored. Thats truly tragic on so many levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt know that was an Einstein quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is a quick joke in the movie idiocracy involving Einstein. Where the main character. (an all round fully average bloke) goes forward in time to emerge in the future with another time traveller his age. While having been average in the past as he now emerges into this world he is paraded about as the 'smartest man alive'. Due to human logical degradation. When he sees his partner again she asks him: "do you think this is what its like being einstein"? "Just walking about looking around "feeling like you're surrounded by dumbarses"? To which he replies. Huh maybe?.
      </p>
      <p>
       She replies with a snappy: "maybe thats why he invented the bomb"!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I truly see it as a parting gift he never wished to give. Yet the joke in itself is quite hilarious. :)

       Having done some amateur theoretical physics sleuthing for the past 10ish years, I'm pretty solid on the belief that gravity is flat out wrong.  I think that gravity and relativity describe a series of interactions well in a vacuum, but utterly fail at describing a system.  Things like the assumption that the speed of light is the upper governor for the universe seem oddly convenient for the model to work.  I would bet the house that gravity isn't real and that electro-magnestism is the true answer to a unified field theory.  I think there is a flaw in Maxwells equations (which Einstein also worked on) and if ever rectified will explain the physical occurrences of a whole host of things we thought impossible.  It's fun to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Tesla, this is a good read.  Not only does it demonstrate his brilliance and full commitment to embracing concepts most would consider fantastical (as he was never a slave to the Newtonian model), it also sheds a good bit of light on the man himself.  He was a funny dude.

       I feel weve so much to learn about space that your gradually right. Weve used cesium in labs to accelerate light past the traditional 'speed of light' slightly proving it isnt impossible. While synthetic, it goes on to show your thoughts are fully rational.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what preturbes me is how linear it is to be an outside thinker in these fields. As though we must believe in every rule to get the job. Any considerably indifferent opinion will be a deal breaker.
      </p>

       Seismologists arent physics professionals. I am scientifically intellectual yet do very porely in grammar and such. I can conversate at a really professional level in person to person terms. Yet type like a pigeon inhabitant of america, and am often considered an immigrant inspite of it and having spent my whole life here.

       Tesla was unique. 
I am very thankful to have this paper youve found by him. I truly look forward to reading more of his work. If you find anything on his geomagnetic harmonic reaonance. Please do send that myway. I have a feeling its important to what I am doing now :)

       I've lurked your prediction threads. Thanks for your time and efforts. If you're interested let me know the book title so I can take a look. I've done professional copyediting and proofreading. I'd be glad to help for free, or on any future projects you have.

       You seem like a good person, very intelligent and curious. Don't let small stuff like grammar or writing get in your way. Overcome, adapt, or find a workaround.

       Exactly.  I was going to say "just ask!" There are plenty of people around who have the time and would be willing to take a stab at cleaning up a book so it might have a better shot at being published.  Sort of a grass-roots/community effort.  I can see the headline now...

       I get people phobic at times. Its strange but I keep it in mind to start a channel. I was more competitive in my 20's. I am mid 30's now and tbh my last handle suffered the recap of a dying spouse. So I sort of fell apart live mid online persona. 
So I really push to do my best in spite of it. I am just still healing and need more time (at times). Ive had a really really rough year. Tbh sometimes the following males me feel vulnderable or makes me out to feel more paranoid then I suppose it should. Its likely due to the immense amount of pressure ive been under all year looking back though...

       You have an amazing talent.  Honestly, if I could do what you do, I'd be overwhelmed as all hell. I wouldn't know what the fuck to do lolz.  So I'd probably end up doing nothing.

       I'm truely sorry you've had a rough year.  I feel like a bit of an ass saying that - 'a rough year'.  It seems so trivial and inconsequential to say it like that, like oh well, better luck next year mate, thanks for trying, here's a keyring for your efforts.

       You know, no one ever asks how I'm holding up, and it gave me a bit of a jolt tbh.  I'm doing okay, thank you for asking.  I'm still adjusting to being in your country, and I've been here three years.  I think one day soon it will all become normal to me, but for now I feel like I'm living in a foreign (lolz) and alien world.  I just kind of accepted I was living in LA, now I find out we're moving to Las Vegas.    But whatareya gonna do, right?  Just gotta cop it on the chin and roll with the punches down the aisles and streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you holding up?  Are you okay?  The fact that you're here after such a shit year is inspiring, tbh. Maybe that's the wrong word.  Maybe admirable is better suited.  I hope you find something to help you refocus and regroup.  If you ever need help with anything, let me know.  I have limited skills - I'm a former cop, turned PI and I'm devastatingly charming when I need to be - but you may use those small talents of mine if you ever need.

       CME Passage / Bz South / G2 Storm (UPDATED)
A fairly weak shock passage was observed today by the DSCOVR spacecraft. A minor geomagnetic enhancement will be possible during the next 24 hours. A widespread disturbance is not currently expected.

       Holy smokes this is all waaayy out of my realm. Just looked up BZ component:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The magnetic field of our Sun doesn't stay around the Sun itself. The solar wind carries it through the Solar System until it reaches the heliopause. The heliopause is the place where the solar wind comes to a stop and where it collides with the interstellar medium. Because the Sun turns around her axis (once in about 25 days) the interplanetary magnetic field has a spiral shape which is called the Parker Spiral.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bt value
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bt value of the interplanetary magnetic field indicates the total strength of the interplanetary magnetic field. The higher this value, the better it is for enhanced geomagnetic conditions. Moderate Interplanetary Magnetic Field strength values start at 15nT but for middle latitude locations, values of 25nT or more are desirable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bx, By and Bz
       </p>
       <p>
        The interplanetary magnetic field is a vector quantity with a three axis component, two of which (Bx and By) are orientated parallel to the ecliptic. The Bx and By components are not important for auroral activity. The third component, the Bz value is perpendicular to the ecliptic and is created by waves and other disturbances in the solar wind.

       Locations are based on area seismic data available.
      </p>
      <p>
       All locations are relevant to area activity. Vs time expectancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that regard fukushima Japan is due for a 7.0 scale earthquake. Due to the recently calm activity. We gauge the nagano activity as a 'hint of potential mega quaking'. This rises its probability. 70%
      </p>
      <p>
       Areas known to have this 'scale' of activity are also relevant by association to the expected size. I replied below with a wind chart to express this per interval.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scale of quake we associate that type of activity too is 7.0 scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Locations known for that range in no unique order. 
Kamtchaka/alaska, NZ, chile, elsalvador, us west coast, japan, phillipeans, indonesia, nepal, afganistan/pakistan, ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we gauge the time loss vs current activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we see strangelets they associate hints. Yet tine loss is the more critical factor by argument. Due to the time loss since a japanese quake. In addition to the activity. Fukushima japan is the likliest location with a higher probability then the other selected areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The usa west coast would likely only go active in an 8.0 event. Having eigher a pacofoc northwest or sanfransiscan 5.0 to follow an otherwise large event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect only to see a 7.3 range quake. Likely downgraded to a 7.0-6.9 however it will be vast in its arrival. Which will be very soon. (as in a matter of hours. 2 days at tge very most).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likely all named areas will see heightened activity following this quake. (in the thread). Not this comment.

       No this is my own theory. I am unfamiliar with the gap theory...
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory involves solar protons reacting with the earths magnetic flux tubes influencing the basic seismology model. Much like a dj stretches a sound on a record player. I feel that incoming solar winds complicate the flux tubes conveying (leading to the creation of earthquakes).

       Thia is the most sinilar paper ive seen. Although my theory is likely different in a context that its proveable via photograph should the australian array choose to allow me time to test it. 
I need to really read into the article prior to noting any vast differences yet it is a great find. I am very thankful for it :)
Very very :)

       I really feel the recent area quakes are still aftershocks of the last major quake in your area. This greatly reduces your chances of a main event in my understanding of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too hope your alright and truly feel you will be. +/- some mid scale rumblings.
      </p>

       We need to see how large a quake japan is struck with. I will save you though and send updates if the circumstances appear to change mid process :)

       Thanks :) I hope you're right about no major shocks here. Japan can handle quakes and rebuild. The Philippines is a different story. An 8 hitting metro manila would be a catastrophe I don't even want to imagine.

       It would be catastrophic. I very well studied the eq your nation last experienced. It always hurts when you cant do anything to help accept read. 
In time I hope to change that.

       They had a set back. Actually I nailed the crash in my otger thread. Stating 215 being the eth price for the bubble pop. The trail off missed the mark, as I assessed more solidarity in the ltc community. Yet the pre position of a crash was ultimately on point.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pushed too hard and hugged it to death. Instead of simply holding firm a slight stampede occured. Its still a safe investment. Likely a better one today then yesterday. Although they are currently likely to lose another 100+/- depending on where ethereum sets its price. I feel 250 is irrational and see 168-175 being the new norm.

       Absolutely. 
They need to refurbish their community and take on promoting themselves as a utility.

       The problem I find they have is they promote bitcoin more then themselves. 
Eth is using corporate level tactics. Essentially eth is as valuable as doge with their non existent cap. They are a vampire coin and much more likely to succeed as they 'give away coins to refugees in a un food program.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take on this is that bitcoin and litecoin holders need to boycott them and stop trading with them until they create a cap. Otherwise btc and ltc will be 'giving away their inflations' to these refugees as they trade the coins out for lunch money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factually that angers me. 
How can we ever inflate our price if eth us giving out 100,000 + people "an undisclosed amount of coins"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we are depending on users to appreciate their worth. While the eth users bash all coins in mass on a one way street promoting citcuit. Then they cash them out for vasic survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traders aren't helping with their weak hands falling for it either. They gwt psyched out and sell into eth. Then when eth pulls all cryptos take the hit. It is an endless circle-

       I hear alot about new alts, like steam or xrp. I just consider then all niche investments from a linear point of view. 
I'd suggest sticking to the known ones and rarely investing in emerging markets until they establish an actual userbase and have solidified their entire network to a publishable level. Life is too short to take risks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main comeup today through tuesday is taking stock in eth at a low then selling at a high. Since eth just rapidly expanded its usership and worth its a good long twrm investment. Yet playing off its growth is a profitable way to up your current coin purse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The window of its growth is settling. I hear tuesday should be a big day for ltc. (followed by weds).  Sunday is always a btc day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most coins rely on media for growth. A general tip is to really extort the amount of growth the utility will recieve based on the articles. Since sunday is the day before monday presses. It always reflects a solid in take. I feel this is the utilitys way of setting itself up for more clients. Investing quietly in itself. This way to secure a good week on the presses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other advice id give is use a three pronged spear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep all currency in a seperate account. Prior to investing in any coin place a 5.00 usd investment in three coins. Wait 1 hour and every 10 minites sample the market. Which ever shows the most promise is likely the best coin to co tribute to for the day. Basic sampling should be perofrmed any time prior to moving wages on the floor. So leaving a 15.00 buy in behind helps to speed up the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also document timing and volumes. Never trade a coin against the chatter on screen and if its going to good pull out. Most people get addicted to greed. I saw the bubble popping early and warned my friend. He was in great ahape leaving early. 
So always run if its too good to be true. 9 timea out of 10 it is. :)

       I have some money I want to invest and I don't really care if it all goes down the drain.. just don't wanna invest in "conventional" bullshit like normal currencies or stocks. How do I get into investing in stuff like those currencies mentioned throughout your conversations? Any "beginner guides" or just buy them straight off like any other currency?

       When you put it that way ETH seems as if it is a very well organized corporate level pump and dump. Though instead of dumping it might just be some sort of crypto take over...like astroturf for the crypto community. Made to appear as if it is natural growth but much of it is artificial.

       I cant see why eth continues to grow vs btc. Btc is the real crypto which gives gains. The eth money is corporate backed. With 0 cap it has absolutely 0 worth.

       Predicting earthquakes is obviously a very tough business, with a low expected success ratio IMO. What are your thoughts on a reasonable success ratio?

       Things are really hard here for me now, and this is all overwhelming at times. Aside from that, there was a brief moment where attention seemed quite 'intense'. 
In a regretful moment of pressure I wiped up and took a well needed hiatus. Sorry I didn't mention it. Asking for help is harder then ignoring the fact that you likely need it?

       Gf died. Lost house. 20k in debt. +/- from last year. Forced to live with family again. Cancer, and need gum surgery. No insurance. No money. No chance-
      </p>
      <p>
       -9.72 +/- in checking...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrote a book. Had bad feedback due to grammar. Give away basically everything in hopes the karma will come back. Help friend make money on investments plotting coin charts. They lose it before I am ever paid. Invest my time in reading, use the data to promote good things and charity to the world. Do everything I can to be a good person. 
Cant seem to catch a break. Since my life fell apart my wages get garnished die to child support. 
Any job I take I am paid half my earnings. So far behind now I doubt I will ever ever catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could probably be given 50k and blow it. Just to actually have a chance at surviving and starting at square one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because thats likely never going to happen. I just give all I can away now for free. In short its better the world has it then I pass on in some fot of demanded grandeur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone gets a shot on this rock. 
Miss my gf. Miss my life. After a year on a couch, having every ounce of work ive put in not paying off. I just don't feel that I will ever get out of this rut. 
Not here, bot now. Not ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have so little I don't even attempt to really succeed or make ot out anymore. I am just broken and recluse. Giving the last bits of myself and sanity away, as I pray for a future. Yet fear it all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much the bulk of it without pointing out every ladt detail of why I have become the mess that I factually hate to admit I am. +/-

       I'm relatively new here. 
I am very interested in earthquake prediction as I was in a big earthquake long ago. (Interested but know NOTHING about it.)  Kinda made me take note.  Also made me move to a area less prone to eq's.

      <p>
       Just want to say I'm so sorry things have been so hard on you!!!  It will get easier now.

       If this interests you, check out "Suspicious0bserver" on YouTube. The bulk of it is Space Weather, but how that correlates to earthquake risk is nothing short of mind blowing to learn about. I highly recommend his channel if you'd like to learn more about the subject.

       Sorry to hear about it all. I also am stuck in a similar rut, in terms of not even attempting to succeed and just being so "done" with life to try to sum it up simply. But there is more to it all. You are here for a reason, you chose to reincarnate as that life for a reason.(Sorry don't mean to push beliefs or assume)
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice is to take it slow. Little steps can be a big achievement when trying to fit your life back in to the "norm" that society demands. Living with your parents affords you the opportunity to save money even if it is just a little bit. Most are not as fortunate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have a feeling you will refine your research to a point of being irrefutable. I actually believe in you more than I do myself. So always remember that folks do care and want your success. Even though we are just text on a forum board, we are still people. I don't do this but every few years but I will pray for you and your well being. It does seem to work once in awhile.

       The hardest part is always not knowing. Its knowing that others like you are out there that makes up for it.

       I stumbled on this right now for a reason. After just stumbling across a video a few minutes before for a reason. This gives me hope. Take care of yourself and believe and accept the advice you gave out. I'm fighting too against wishing I could blink myself out of existence. Thanks for your post. I'm sending warm healing energy your way.

       I'm a longtime lurker here,  am aware of you and your contributions. And right now can empathize with almost every letter of every word you wrote. (Different chronic illness, but similar situation. Similar amount of debt, inability to see a way out of the hole I'm in, stuck living with family which exacerbates my already full plate of shit. Never having a job work out despite skills, never enough money, the near impossibility of accessing healthcare...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you took a break to keep yourself going. And I'm glad you're here and you're not alone. I don't really have adequate words for you, but I ran across your post at this particular time for a reason. I've been getting a lot of that recently, which gives me a hope i didn't think could exist. So thank you.

       Keep your chin up, eyes on the horizon, no worries, no regrets.

       In many ways I have...
Some people have great destinys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find myself one with the moon. A single soul lost in my own abjections. Its not that ive given up on life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was simply never owed anything, having far less then enough to ever make a success of myself in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, I can assess that I have no future. Does that mean I've given up. Id truly argue it. That life itself has very little to offer someone in my position. 
Its more so I will remain lost for lifes entirety. 
These are the sins we bare

       I know it is hard, but try to keep positive thoughts going through your mind...even some of the corny "positive thinking" youtube videos help when your brain is in a whirlwind of negativity.

       Congratulating the young man as he finds his place in the universe. They can prepare you for work but life is and always has been a discovery for all of us (yet none of us were prepared). So please send my blessings and  congratulations!

       Life is too short, but ol global is still plotting to save the world. Its been a rough few weeks and I feel slightly diasapointed I left early. 
Just some heavy sighs in an otherwise progressive world.

      <p>
       I am still alive though, so I have that going for me. :)

       I truly missed ya and hoped you were well. I wanted to emerge sooner but I felt ot was best to take a sort of siesta for a brief moment to relax. Im past it. Truly happy to be surrounded by my friends like you again :)

       Its reduced to scale. X class events being the most notable. However a high range b will cause some connection issues. During x class events, are our more worriesome affairs. Yet when these events maintain following days of low level activity we typically see a more heightened level of response. (earthquake wise).

       Radio communications break down, transformers can overload, circuits can run haywire.

       This is a very negligable event in comparrison. However in earthquake terms we should see a real bell ringer.

       that was most likely a man made quake. the worlds biggest seismic blasting ship was photographed right where the earthquake hit and there is huge amounts of natural resources in the area. maybe they saw frankies video and a full moon coming up so they figured it'd be a good media cover (he'd get all the attention). 3 weeks is enough time to sail from panama.

       I disagree. Have you ever pushed a magnet with another magnet? Well, our magnetic field is linked to all that ferrous material in our crust, the Earth spinning, and the hot core spinning at a different speed. When electromagnetic radiation hits our magnetic field en masse, do you not think it likely that our magnetic field will react to that, potentially just enough to shift a couple of plates for an earthquake?

       Originally I coined this theory geo magnetic harmonic resonance. If anything id meet tou at electro magnetic stimulation. There is a root factor I am debating with this whole theory being either an electric vs magnetic phenomena. I often wager it as both until tests can be conducted.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me its more so an unsolvable argument and likely is both or should be considered both until one process can effectively be worked out. I chose an electric process due to the standard model yet agree magnetics is likely much to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If enough tests come back positive showing a correlation I truly hope to be allowed a single field experiment to test the theory someday. It would be noce to know if we cant officially prove it at this time.
       <br/>
       It would be so nice to factually say I am not wasting anyones time and truly have something amazing to offer the world. Until then. I suppose I will simply keep wrapping my brain around it.

       Not sure what your educational background is but the sun has been studied for a very long time and we do track magnetic changes on Earth caused by the sun. This is a real and measurable thing we do. The problem with your idea is that the magnitude of change is off by billions.

       Absolutely none of that negates anything we're talking about here. Really, it's just like you're giving links to descriptions about the individual things involved. Do you understand that simply because what is suggested isn't
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       established science doesn't mean it's wrong? How do you think we learned everything in those links?

       I am going to put this lightly, this isn't some new field of science this guy discovered. He just has a really poor understanding of math and physics. His page is complete and total bunk science.

       That hardly even reads as coherent English. It's a stream of consciousness using random science words.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These solar wind fields contain a vast amount of elements, Which act as harbingers towards seismic events here on earth.  The principal forces I see taking place are magnetic, electric, and ionizing materials.
       </p>

       This is nonsense and it totally reads like someone who has taken at a max high school level science classes.

       Three one word replies, yet no one is refuting that u/parsingsol's reason for posting this here, is that in physics and seismology forums, his research is considered fringe, and not worth a second look.  This subreddit survives on the discussions of topics which may be considered fringe and refuted.

       See to be honest Were really approaching a large pacific nortgwest bender. Just not yet. Likely more so following this max and its peak. (8 years). Tge juan de fuca eveny will be epic. Anything in california will be laughable by comparison. So I supoose its all in hiw you look at it?

       . Chances are an event like that could trigger other seismic activity, including the Yellowstone Supervolcano.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tremors and other small events may be relieving pressure, but that'll still be pretty ugly. Ash clouds reducing sunlight for several months, gases and the pyroclastic flow would suffocate the immediate area, and people will definitely die.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is to be the guy who preps to last longer than the majority of the population. Once every man exhausts the several weeks supply of food in their pantry, and all their water, making it shorter, it's all clear for the apocalypse.

       Thanks! My food and water are in order, but I lack the funds to build a decent armory. Even having 3 months of food, and 110 gallons of water puts you ahead of the population. Would you say my predictions for how that would affect other seismic activity like Yellowstone are accurate?

       Ive really considered the juan defuca event as capable of promoting nw volcanos to become active. This singularity very well could be movement enough to rattle yellowstone awake. 
Juan de fuca has several area vilcanoes near it. Maby being submarine volcanoes. Such as off the californian coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your general synopsis is correct from what Ive researched. The main thing I'd suggest prepping in that extent is anything to replicate the suns environment. Good lighting with full spectrum red green blue hues. Light reduction is critical on our bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event of a yellowstone I see maybe a 3 month lightless cycle fillowed by vast intervals of clouding and acid rains. 
I think its the after effects people wont be ready for like acid rain that will be most devistating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having to check water for contamination. Not eating specific foods, and learning which days to avoid the toxic weather patterns that would follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buttoning down is the easy part. Having enough to make it is hard. Yet imagining the storm systems and hurricane force winds, facing the aftershocks that will take place always wondering if another event is likely to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be little things like loneliness attacking your conscious. Expired memories haunting you of all you lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that anguish, and the relearning and trend setting is what will be the most devistating affect.
      </p>
      <p>
       No going outside in grey storm clouds.  Avoiding winters new cycles of extreme freezes. Avoiding highly contaminated areas (with likely no warning)
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean thats the life I see. So yes your tragically accurate, in most regards. (from what we know based on fossil records)...
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine its far worse then either any you me or one hear can actually imagine. Although their is a really good pompei volcano remake in hd recently that sort of mirrors what we could probably expect here when we see it.

       Thanks, that was really enlightening. I am far enough away from most volcanic activity (Sedona AZ), that I should be able to weather out the beginning. It's the later effects like acid rain, unpredictable weather, etc, that you mentioned that are going to be the main issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm planning on setting up a hydroponics system of sorts, and a spirulina growth tank. I'll unfortunately be reliant upon food stores for those several months, as I don't have a generator. Climate patterns should mostly hold. I'm in a desert with minimal cloud cover and rainfall most of the year, so my food plan shouldn't be affected.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the bright side, the ash released would most likely seed water bodies with nutrients, boosting fish populations. That'd make fishing a better long-term food source.

       7-8 years, right? I'll probably be encumbered with a family by then, if not a wife. 'Tis the Mormon way. Vegas wouldn't be too smart of an apocalyptic destination though. I'll probably end up establishing a micronation by then with the members of my church, farming and living off of shared resources.

       Its humble. Tbh arizonas high elevation and cave's give you a vast upperhand in either scenario. Even slc area has the heightened elevation which would be ideal post event. (less rain). 
All you really need to focus on now is life in the mean time and the little things. 
Most people forget that its the slight tells that nature gives us that is our true advantage and warning system. From animal movements to seeing a new crack form in a sidewalk. To noticing repair work needed in area basements, and solar data. All these are harbingers of vast events. 
Take them all with a gradual level of importance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Animal movements are the most ideal methods in my opinion. Noticing a flock of birds take flight or seeing a fawn of dear in migration is your best bet something is wrong. From there dogs will bark, cats will scatter. Thats when your certain its on the fritz...
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice to you. A. Don't stand in a doorway nor under am object that can't suooort the weight of the ceiling / floors above you. Its better to lay in a pocket between a couch and solid wood coffee table. (not the cheap kind).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because after incidents users found that people in doorways get chopped in half when the wood splits. Also desks seem to crush school children (cases seen in variius post event scenarios). While cubbies formed around thr sesks which they could have laid in to survive. (much like a bed of nails holds an item vs a single nail). 
B. Time the event in your head. In a major eq. Communications will be lost immedieatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only way to guage a tsunami is by timibg the event in your head. The seco d the event starts start counting to both remain calm, yet prepared. Anything past 5 minutes is a 7.0+ if youve reached anywhere near 6 minutes your in a 9.0. Expect a potential tsunami if within two miles from the coast. C. Know of area resources and areas of concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       You dont want to live through an earthquake to walk into a lions den. Be sure that area nuclear facilities are a good distance away. Or place the distance between yourself. Just encase the facility is damaged.

       I list potential areas, and often strangelets. Strangelets being hypothetical to the tinedilation model. Vs. the showing relevant activity model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically there are seismic 'tells' prior to a quake. Since we have an effective 'seismic range' via the incoming solar weather, what we look for is a common area both expecting an eq based on its yearly intervals. As well as one thats known to match the incoming scale of activity. Often there are dormant areas that reflect this activity showing no activity. Thus I feel these are Strangelets (or comparable) in that regard.

       dude you are a troll. You thru out so many locations in the thread. It's how magicians works. lets see how many locations you claimed could be hit. 
1. Japan (title)
2. Indonesia area
3. chile
4. new zealand
      </p>
      <p>
       and you had more locations and chances all in very active earthquake areas when lots of smaller earthquakes been happening in the pacific rim.

       Earth is 260 billion cubic miles mate- 
There are also only 16 7.0's a year.

       exactly ... this is the last argument ill make with you
so as you say 16  7.0's a year.. you notice we haven't had a 7.0 worldwide in  a while few weeks. figure you will play your odds with where one will be. Why even try to predict? you aren't going be right always. 16 7.0s is more than 1  7.0 earth quake every month thats pretty common
trying to predict things in general is a ability I don't see the value in. your time would much better be spent learning about nearly anything else. A skill accomplishes something 100% of the time. Where as your "skill" doesn't accomplish anything in the end, you could say.. "see i told you so" So there is that if you want to count that as something. you can't stop the earthquake from happening where ever it happens. No one should evacuate based on your warnings because you won't always be right. anyone could do what you do it's not that hard you just spent a lot of time doing something insignificant most people wouldn't bother trying to do. I certainly wouldn't invest time in it.

       It isn't about stopping an earthquake from happening its about the advancement of seismic warning systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am documenting significant arguments which establish a rooted connection to earths largest seismic events and our most complex solar wind patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is significance in documwnting that relationship regardless of your pessimism. Factually a ocnnection could lead to the very complex journey of devising a smart system. One which operates an algorith which detects the likely probability of an incoming seismic event. Using real time solar weather feeds.

       It's unfortunate you have to contend with that. Blame Japan for the  feckless design of the plants and their safety measures, blame whatever forces were necessary to generate a m9.0 event, and then blame the currents for bringing the contaminate to you.

       Life here is very much like it was the day before 3.11.  With the exception of the exclusion zone and everything that's occurring within it.  That being the most radioactive spot on the planet.

       The bz componet was a very large duration event and I expect to see a pretty large scale quake. However The shaking while persistent appears to have a mild expectancy. So long duration event. Mild / moderate shaking. Far less destructive then 3.11

       You too. 
I sort of feel happy and try to befriend all users. I dislike when they attempt to discredit me with a 'not sane' image. Yet to be honest Ive been here 8 months doing this and havent seemed to give off that impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I factually updated everyday 3 times aday. Id probably question my own sanity. Yet 1-2 postd a month (which seems generous) seems rational, and every update has existing data sets. (so this isnt exactly not backed by science). I just hope thats not the reason why they seem to 'take interest'.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me its just a basic theory. I think it holds real meaning hence all the times Ive placed my reputation on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So its just that: a working theory. Plave as much weight onto it as you all care or like. :)

       I'm from Japan and not willing to give a warning to my people regarding to this .Because our people don't trust any sort of informations like the OP has done.They do extremely bad mouthing towards these kind of people, even scientific based informations, it makes me really sad every time I read that narrative which has made by inconsiderate people on the internet . I know I'm going to be blamed but this is my secret revenge. Thank you OP .

       Honestly this was a really tough quake to plot due to yoyr recent activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am assessing japan as the main location. Yet there is a slight chance this could come your way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that your elevated activity slighlty reduces your chance as it allows pressure to decrease. Japan is now showing heightened activity with an exosting depth that is common in foreshocks. So that also can relieve you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually assessed your last 6.9 on my past account. So I am pretty good at this. I think your in the clear this run yet if the japanese quake occurs I would expect more 4.5 level aftershocks in your area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty likely you wont see anything too big at this time. Yet these locations are noted in case the area is off by a margain. So just know that the worst likely has passed at this time. (for your nation). :)

       Japans system isnt exactly a cost effective system which they gain much from. I think the current system is maybe 60 seconds advanced warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system detects deep ground movements as a sort of heart beat for inner earth. When a p wave is detected it essentially allows a warning at the cusp of the initial wave. By the time a message is sent we typically feel the event as it came. 
Trumps tactic was likely to cut spending. Its likely a good move in respects to the system being proposed really onpy saving us a minute. (at a multi million dollars in expenditures). Since it doesnt mitigate the event or really give us much time to prepare, I could see why they decided to scrap this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a real way if I could log time on australias array and get a reaearch grouo together, I teuly feel I could gain anywhere from a day to a weeks additional time with the basis of my model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a month depending on how far another researchers advanced sunspot projection model is coming around.
      </p>
      <p>
       So spending several million on a system that is likely a year away from being outdated seems like a slightly good move in my opinion. So long as a newer model is being designed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont feel that the planned system was quite worth its weight in gold in that regard.

       It's the only system being talked about because it's the only one that works. So far we only have that, the seismic gap theory and some computer model of the North Anatolian fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seismic gap theory straight doesn't work and while the computer model can predict the location and magnitude of earthquakes accurately it cannot predict a time and only works for that one fault line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far the only successful prediction and evacuation​ before an earthquake is Haicheng, China where they saved something like 50,000 people after someone noticed animals started acting weird. This is dismissed as pseudoscience by most of the West but the Chinese are still researching it.

       UrEDAS, and it's only like an 8 second warning typically.
      </p>
      <p>
       An earthquake gives off fast moving but low amplitude P-waves and slow moving, high amplitude S-waves (these are the ones which do the damage). UrEDAS uses extremely sensitive electromagnetic seismometers to detect these P-waves and give warning for the oncoming S-waves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it's not much as far as getting to safety or evacuating goes that 8 seconds is enough to fully stop the bullet train, hide under a desk and shut off gas supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's extremely useful because you don't have to deal with trains derailing or massive fires like the one that wiped out Kobe.

       I agree every second counts. Yet the cost associated woth the previous system likely wouldnt be justified as soon as a new system is viable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like buying a 1980 minivan for 25k on credit. (when your already in debt). 
I assume thay a more effective system can be utilized that costs less. Cost is a huge concern of america at this time. We have a very finite amount to spend and a vast set of Infastructure which needs updating.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were doing better economically we would be better off and Id argue it as a more critical necessitate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel we will take on these types of costs as the budget is reduced and finds a level ground. Yet until the past administrations slack is picked up, I just don't see such an expenditure taking such top priority in the extent it provides such little roi.

       No / Yes? 
Japan is very well suited in its infrastructure. This will be a more then vast event. Much stronger then their 'weekly /daily' activity. Yet for the most part its more so just a really big event with a slightly unsettling period of stress associated with it. 
If this were in nepal, it woykd be far more destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scale 1 to 100 on danger. Id give it a 70. Enough to strike concern, yet fairely little loss of life. Some general property damages. And maybe a reported but what will be negligable tsunami associated with it. (like 10 inch waves). Maybe a third a meter tops...

       Hey man so awesome to see your back.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the chances of us seeing another big new Zealand quake are in the next 10 or so years? If you can predict that far?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for everything you have done. I hope one day more people will listen!

       Technically if we see a 8.0 id expect a 6.0 within 5 days. If we see a 7.0 id expect a 5.2 range within 5 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from long range. Its really not an assessment I can make as the solar data seemingly is fixed to a weekly progression at best. Sometimes it goves a 33 day window yet spots can hyper inflate in a two day time. As well as circling the lens holding their initial magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I expect you will have a sizeable aftershock in this sequence. Yet the area appears generally stable.

       I'm in the Kansai area myself and there was a small earthquake yesterday evening. Nothing too concerning but enough to stop you in your tracks. My husband and I were cooking when it happened and it got us to sit down for a minute.

       Its been relatively a strange occurance this incoming glancing blow. Typically the wind would be closer in interval for such a breaching. So I hope that this takes you away from a scale 5 mag 8. Hoping for a mag 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just an hour or so ago a sizeable 5+ (mag) struck near tokyo. I assume this will all but confirm a location near hitachi as the main shock. I am staying awake as best as I can to document it. :)

       Thank you so much! We're home today and our apartment building is actually a designated tsunami evacuation building so I'm hoping that also means it'll withstand a relatively strong earthquake.

       No way I am letting you two have all the fun without me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I slightly expect a tsunami warning to take place yet I wouldn't place it as a heightened event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to say "everything is fine". Follow instructions accordingly, yet I doubt a major event will occur in that respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose just breathe and realize that its more then likely a small scale event. As your only in 8.0 territory. Which will more likely be a mid range to low level 7.0 as it is created.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again. It shouldn't be too bad a shake in your region and the waves will likely be 10 inches. Quite laughable in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad to hear you two are well. Happy to help anytime guys :)

       The warning we get on our smartphones before an earthquake only leaves us with around ten to fifteen seconds to get to safety, which sadly for a lot of people isn't enough time. Luckily we're home tonight but if it happens tomorrow it'll be a bit trickier since we're back at work. I just hope it doesn't happen while either of us is commuting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it'll happen at some point in the next twelve hours?

       Technically I think a 12 hour warning is fair. To be honest I almost missed this event and checked the solar data on a fluke. To my amazement a seemingly long breach was there quite unexpectedly. Its more so luck then anything that you all are reading this post. Noaa had it written off so I disregarded yet checked again last minute for sport. 
And as always. No worries.
Hopefully it comes at a convenient time for you both :)
That would make my day to know good company is in  better health and safety:)

       We will see. Last round was 3 in a row. So hoping for another hit. This was a rare solar front which even noaa didn't expect. So we will see what shes packing over these next 12 or so hours +/-
      </p>

       I have a good feeling about this one since the last eq took place central to the modeling / area. So time will tell :)

       Not worried. 
Just extra precautionary. I am assessing this event to come in a matter of hours. 
If the earthquake comes tokyo is the safest city in japan to be in. 
Count in your head and time the event. If you make it to 4.5 minutes. Make your way to high ground immedieatly. 
(as a precautionary step).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again tokyo is very safe. 
They went through a 9.0 before with very little structural damages. This should be like a speed bump in that regard.

       Technically your just being responsible for the day. With likely more warning then anyone there.

       So take a level of comfort in that. Don't consider it anything less then lucky :)

       So you are predicting a specific earthquake "38 km E off Hitachi, Japan 6.9 - 7.4 50-25 km depth."
      </p>
      <p>
       But when that doesn't happen you have also thrown a load of locations at us spread across the entire globe so you can say "see! there was seismic activity!"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Nagano

       The prior list of locations are known areas of seicmic value. Many likely to see activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very high probability in the named area. Hence it being most probable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't doubt the location, I simply list other probable locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point in this is to track the relationship of seismic events to solar winds. Not to prove the location algorithm. Having a base relationship produces a drive to have a scientific body test the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       My goal is to progress the areas of research and testing my own theory. Not to prove myself as omnipotent. This isnt about me and a magic ability. Its a test in a series of tests which appear to show a documented pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume the earthquake will strike the given location soon within 48 hours of the time of my posting.

       Should the specific quake you predicted not occur what will you tell people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will you say that you were wrong, or will you look for any token seismic activity in any of those other places and claim you were still right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't you predict any more details about these other locations? More specific location, magnitude and depth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you also explain the 48 hour window, how do you come up with that and why are you unable to more accurate?
      </p>

       I don't understand how you can predict specifics of one quake except the time, but not for any others.

       There are various tyoes of faults and causes for earthquales in addition to solar influenced seismic activity. Most earthquakes are caused by plates jamming into one and other causing subduction zones and strike slips. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main focus is solar influenced quakes which usually happen on faults that expand from eachother.
      </p>
      <p>
       The window is assessed for time dialation. Basic cause and effect. While the breaching has taken place effectively charging the earths magnetic fluex tubes, time dialation occures as the conatant effect is transferred to the subsurface levels of the magma chamber. Once the earths magnetic flux tubes convey within the planet they create the circumstances for an existing p wave as outlined by the theory.

       As always I post the data and experiments / tests life. Trying to refactor any instances in which I see as contradictory to the experiment.

       Ive had some very compelling results in the past seceral months time. With a very high ratio of aucess at most times. Hence the feedback I am receiving.

       I regret to seem standoffish. Yet while a good question to ask Ive answered it several times. (on several occasions).

       You can't even give a straight answer about what you will say if it doesn't happen. Can't you see how this sounds like a completely cop-out? It sounds as though you have really only said that there will be seismic activity somewhere in the world during a 48 hour period. I can do that. I can tell you there is measurable seismic activity in the southern hemisphere right now.

       So in one breath you say his claims are extraordinary, in another breath you say they are ordinary.  Which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, OP IS making an extraordinary claim.  He is saying there's going to be a 7.0+ earthquake within 48 hours of his post.  He's also said it will be newsworthy.  Nowhere is OP saying that it will be a "normal" quake that happens all the time anyway - I mean, read the title : "massive earthquake incoming".

       They are making the extraordinary claim they they are predicting this particular quake and its details, or seismic activity at any one of these other locales should the Hitachi one not occur, and this is based on their prediction method. But for some reason their method of prediction cannot detail the latter which needs explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality they're just giving themselves an out. The specific quake doesn't occur, point at any seismic activity somewhere in half the world.

       You're getting downvoted but I couldn't agree more, he's dodged the most important questions including the name of his book. Seismic activity happens constantly and there are 100's maybe even thousands of earthquakes daily. To me it's confirmation bias in its purest form unless the methods can be revealed better rather than getting people lost in scientific jargon that doesn't lead to any actually explanations.

       How many 7.0+ quakes are there happening each year? The OP is making a claim that a 7.0+ will happen within a 48 hour period of time that will be newsworthy.  To me, that's a bold claim in itself and one that can't be replaced with "well, there was a 5.5 in some other place, that's basically what I predicted" - a 7.0+ is a huge quake.  The OP has no hiding place in that regard - and I don't mean he's saying that there WILL be a quake, but that there's no "back up excuse" if it doesn't happen other than - well the assessment didn't guarantee a quake, just gave a probability of X (which is actually fair enough).

       I'm glad I've seen this now.. I'm pretty close(?) to Nagano right now. In Kofu to be exact. HOW massive do you think it will get? In terms of destruction, if it hits Japan?
Appreciate your work man.

       Have you ever been completely right about one of these? Whenever you predict them you always seem to predict a 7-8, and then settle for a 3-4, which are really common.

       EQ prediction is only viable if it allows effective evacuation for the proposed affected area. As there is a distance of 1,905 miles between the Philippine's and Japan this is not an effective prediction in the slightest. This is even before you factor in the effects of attenuation on a 7-8 magnitude quake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally there have been 495 quakes to hit Japan in the past 12 months, make no mistake there was no prediction made here today!

       Well I stand by my post. I stand by the selected area and devaluing a 7.0 in comparison to the general areas micro swarms and basic plate techtonic movements seems quite ineffective should my post represent truth in it.

       I am glad no other prediction was made today. 
It genuinely seperates me from the standard model.

       I imagine you will have a good shock soon. 
I truly feel its more then likely to occur stemming from another quake. Essentially we will see a 7.0+japan. Followed by a nz 5.5 Philippines 5.5 turkey 4.0 alaska 4.6 and californian 4.5
Maybe even a 4.0 washington strangelet
      </p>
      <p>
       The most impressive of events appears to be building up. I think we are moments or hours away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The BZ is fully zipped and it was a very long duration influx. So I expect to see a very long earthquake by that effect. A true global bell ringer.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is 80% of heliplots will document the incoming main shocks as they manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you will likely see a sizeable quake. 
Stay safe and operate under the impression that one could come today. Not in an insane fearing mindset. Simply remain mindful that we have had a vast moment of time where energy has breached our planets core. Which will make its way to the surface soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay safe and no worries. I truly feel your missing the worst of it this time around. :)

       The bz componet just zipped up. This typically takes place for several hours prior to an event. The warning is maybe 14 hrs young in a 48 hour cycle.

       You will see 4 sections on this graphic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first section is the bz componet. This is the escursion of atomic material penetrating the magnetosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the lines draw away from one and other a breach is occuring. When they move towards eachother again the event is nearing its end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those protons feed into the planets core via their bonding to a magnet tube. Known as a flux tube which conveyors within the planets core. 
The conveyoring seeds the magma bed with additional heat decay. Causing it to expand. As it retracts the cavity collapses causing a P wave. Which makes its way to the planets surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process typically takes a matter of hours. 
The solar winds are also lowering to a more effective holding speed. (330 now).325 is ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed graphic is the third tear down on the graphic included in the link.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assess a 325 - 300 as an optimal holding speed for earths solar winds.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we reach that period the event will likely come to frutition. Please be patient :)

       You will likely feel about a 6.5 event. (in tokyo). Uet I assess a 7.2- 7.4 at this time. (Roughly 4.26 minutes) in duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect this to occur within the next 18 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its always a 50/50 probability. (I am either going to be right or wrong after all). Much of this is determined by the data. Not much had to do with a personal level of response by myself. Its just an assessment based on the data available.
      </p>
      <p>
       The science is often supported by an existing event. I imagine this to be more southern having an offshore hitachi  located epicenter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time the event in your head. If its any longer then 270 seconds make your way to high ground. (for optimal safety). That's good advice if communications are reduced. As anything in such a duration could create a sizeable Tsunami. Without a digital communication device. You will have fairly little warning of an event associated with an earthquake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly feel this will take place within the next 18 hours. It was a long duration BZ breach. Which could add to the timeline. While id still be technically right.  I truly am working on dialing the timing down. Its truly more to do with the data as it comes. Making it more difficult to produce a more effective scheduling system with the tools at my disposal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I assume 18 hours. Or less.

       Thanks for the detailed reply. Is the 18 hour time slot meaning you expect it to happen within the 18 hours, so literally any moment from now on, or to happen IN 18 hours time? Just trying to plan my movements during this time in case something does happen.

       No worries. 
To be honest I was expecting the next several hours. Yet the solar wind data was a vast event. (which could extend that window). I don't want to oncote fear mind youm if anything consider tokyo is highly prepared in their national construction for these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me (that citys proximity) makes it sort of safe in comparrison to a more ne coastal region. The pocket / bay is quite distant from any known seismic zones epicenter. In addition to the infrastructure. You should be fine and well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your in a wooden house on the beach. Its likely not so lucky a place to be. So you have advanced knowledge and several safetys in place. Thats something to take comfort in.
      </p>
      <p>
       My general impression on time was again 7-8 hours. Yet again its the duration of the solar event which is uncommon. So a more effective timeline is likely 18 hours. 
Will be happy to update and correspond (right or wrong).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind ya, this is a working theory. So all details help and lead to inherited knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if its alright I may say hello again in some time :).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way I may call it an early night tonight. (getting clise to midnight and all). Just be sure your not over stressed. Eat well, find a good read etc. I truly doubt that post event much devistation will take place in tokyo. My main area of concern at this time is hitachi. The two 4.5's in the vicinity make it to be an active area of interest. So I suspect that is the region to likely inhabit this activity. :)

       Top graph displays the bz componet. The impression where the two vectors seperate is the initial breaching. Them coming together is the breach contracting to a normal level. Typically we see the event within a day of the phenomena. Yet also typicqlly the breaches are half this size. So I am unsure what that will mean. I consider a longer interval of time inbetween. Vs. A larger then normal eq. (although the time it takes to postulate also reduces the seismic size of the quake).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I suppose the longer it takes the better off you are. If that makes sense :)

       Weve seen some activity there lately. I hopenyour all good and well. I presume your dodging a bullet out there this round yet you could see some 5.0's if japan takes a sizeable hit. 
Me I am doing ok actually for a change. Not great. But ok is better then miserably. :)

      <p>
       Things are moving again and for the first time in a while I feel that I can breathe again. Mostly a positive.

       Hope your fairing well :)

       I have to apologize. When I switched user accounts I took a vacation. This data came in at the last minute. I worked it in. Considering indonesia in the first paragraph as all can clearly see. Yet due to the time away I'd list many tracking plots which could have dialed this down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't feel japan is out of hot water yet. Time will tell if we will see some action there and I believe were going to see alot more action over these next 24hrs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indonesia may have spoken first. Yet its very likely today will see some activity, which is very sizeable.

       No this is my own theory. I am unfamiliar with the gap theory...
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory involves solar protons reacting with the earths magnetic flux tubes influencing the basic seismology model. Much like a dj stretches a sound on a record player. I feel that incoming solar winds complicate the flux tubes conveying (leading to the creation of earthquakes).

       Congratulating the young man as he finds his place in the universe. They can prepare you for work but life is and always has been a discovery for all of us (yet none of us were prepared). So please send my blessings and  congratulations!

       Life is too short, but ol global is still plotting to save the world. Its been a rough few weeks and I feel slightly diasapointed I left early. 
Just some heavy sighs in an otherwise progressive world.

      <p>
       I am still alive though, so I have that going for me. :)

       I truly missed ya and hoped you were well. I wanted to emerge sooner but I felt ot was best to take a sort of siesta for a brief moment to relax. Im past it. Truly happy to be surrounded by my friends like you again :)

       Thia is the most sinilar paper ive seen. Although my theory is likely different in a context that its proveable via photograph should the australian array choose to allow me time to test it. 
I need to really read into the article prior to noting any vast differences yet it is a great find. I am very thankful for it :)
Very very :)

       Not worried. 
Just extra precautionary. I am assessing this event to come in a matter of hours. 
If the earthquake comes tokyo is the safest city in japan to be in. 
Count in your head and time the event. If you make it to 4.5 minutes. Make your way to high ground immedieatly. 
(as a precautionary step).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again tokyo is very safe. 
They went through a 9.0 before with very little structural damages. This should be like a speed bump in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically your just being responsible for the day. With likely more warning then anyone there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So take a level of comfort in that. Don't consider it anything less then lucky :)

       Thanks for the detailed reply. Is the 18 hour time slot meaning you expect it to happen within the 18 hours, so literally any moment from now on, or to happen IN 18 hours time? Just trying to plan my movements during this time in case something does happen.

       Thanks again for your constant updates on this.

       It isn't about stopping an earthquake from happening its about the advancement of seismic warning systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am documenting significant arguments which establish a rooted connection to earths largest seismic events and our most complex solar wind patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is significance in documwnting that relationship regardless of your pessimism. Factually a ocnnection could lead to the very complex journey of devising a smart system. One which operates an algorith which detects the likely probability of an incoming seismic event. Using real time solar weather feeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its not like I am not doing 'just that with my life'.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact that is exactly what I am doing my life. Carry on-
