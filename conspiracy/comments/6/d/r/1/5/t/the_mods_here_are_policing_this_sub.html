       We're getting posts that are no different than a staff memo from some middle-manager type moderator telling us how to "properly" use this sub. And all the while I'm seeing mods such as
       <a href="/u/CelineHagbard">
        /u/CelineHagbard
       </a>
       remove posts/comments that disagree with
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       views. It leave the narrative completely one-sided.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking you all to keep this in mind that our mods have turned into nothing more than cops for our sub. They push their agendas harder than any user and with vastly more power. Keep your minds free, keep your comments inquisitive, and above all else question authority. Even on this sub reddit.

       I agree. She seems to ignore the "depending on context" part of rule 10, but that's really the only complaint I have from what we can publicly see. They have a difficult job, and I'm willing to cut them a little slack. I've seen some suspicious behavior by another mod, but I don't think it's bad enough yet to put them blast. I don't want to create unnecessary drama

       It's called applying the rules of the sub. Do you have a grievance with any specific removal or is your complaint a more general one on the rules of this sub?

       . Anything you do will be criticized until you're not yourself anymore. You gave them something and instead of utilizing it they are bitting the hand that feeds them. Why aren't they coming to work together? Then again people want a reassurance and it's normal that people have a lack of trust after everything. However there are agendas at play as well and we aren't blind to them. I've lost hope in this sub because of the fake user base takeover despite you and the other mods trying to create a reasonable balance. Since the users aren't reasonable you will ultimately have a hard time meeting people half way. By the time you try to work it out the sub will be pulled in all sorts of directions and torn apart to bits and pieces. There is no more sense of community and that's because people don't have this intention at mind anymore hence the responses you're seeing. If you manage to reunite people and recreate a balance you will be a hero forever in my books. I applaud you for what you're doing but I have little hope in this place. And it's not because of you. It's because certain someones that will stop at anything until they get the sub to how they want and not how the community wants despite them being the loudest advocates for unfairness in this sub and which then this sub wouldn't be any different from most of other subs around here.

       Well of course you'll start out by saying "it's not an authoritative guide" when it's EXACTLY that. Obviously you can't enforce it, but after removing a shit ton of comments and then following it up with a guide that's not a guide but seriously it is a guide, it's quite obvious what you're pulling.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're trying to police this sub, you're removing WAYYY too many comments that seriously could've added to the discussion/offered a different point of view. And I'm calling you out on it. That's all. I won't say anything bad about you as a person, won't call you a shill, but I will say you are a terrible moderator. But that's just my opinion. You have become the "Big Brother" of this sub.

       You haven't really demonstrated that, and not everyone seems to share your opinion. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this point.

       I'm not entirely sure what aspect of my post even talks about something that can be enforced. The only rule I touch on is Rule 10, which I will admit I do enforce rather strictly, but I did not change the rule; it's existed on this sub for some time. The rest of the post was more about how to interpret what people read on this sub—in terms of upvotes, comments, the /new queue, etc.—but these are only my opinion. Obviously you and anyone else can interpret the sub however you wish, and I certainly can't enforce that.

       No, you're actually not calling me out on it; you've simply asserted it. Calling me out would imply linking to specific instances where I've overstepped my authority. Simple volume of removals is meaningless if those removals are in accordance to the rules of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use ceddit to find anything I've removed, link it here, and then we can have a discussion (please don't link anything I've removed for personal and confidential information, as I will have to remove that again). I won't doubt there are likely some instances I've made an error in judgement, but you have to point out specifics or this is just a baseless accusation.

       A few days ago there was a guy claiming his alt was banned for posting Sandy Hook stuff and had it out for one of the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dude's alt was literally nothing but spamming Sandy Hook stuff to this sub and the second to last comment he posted before being banned was full of incredibly racist remarks (which is probably what got him banned).

       Honestly every interaction ive seen with u/Celinehagbard has gone as good as they possibly could have managed.  If you're constantly getting shit removedd, you should try to follow the rules a bit better, they're not here to control what you say, but it's their job to make sure the sub doesn't go down the road to getting banned.  And with the influx of donald shit after their mods locked the sub, they've been doing a hell of a job.  If they slacked off, this sub would turn into another altright(banned) or thedonald(on its way to being banned) and I don't think anyone here wants that to happen.
