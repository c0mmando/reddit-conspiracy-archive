    <div class="md"><p>Well a large portion of the US is still pretty into the demagoguery, but honestly I am not really sure. I guess I could say there is a lot of issues here but I don&#39;t think that would do it justice.</p>

<p>If I could abridge it I would say it has to due with his large amount of support from the GOP, and other career politicians who know they couldn&#39;t cut it in the real world without some help (Same goes for dem candidates, look how DNC fumbled election). The GOP has a decreasing base of followers but the way American politics are at the moment with things like Gerry-meandering and people&#39;s inability or outright refusal to care enough to become politically active is astonishing, and sets us back severely.</p>

<p>I fully believe if trump came out tomorrow and said &quot;The Kremlin helped fund and support my election campaign&quot;, that 50% of his followers would still be beside him. Reactionary politics and policies is killing America. Coupled with the extremely low voting rate among people under 45.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll not sure why you guys are so hung up on little stuff. I would appreciate feedback on the articles.</p>

<p>If they turn out to be shit let me know and I could take them off? The aim is to find valid/plausible links. So you&#39;re not helping much.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t blame them though, I mean for an internet forum, there are a lot of people that see this stuff. So even if it&#39;s kind of a joke to us, it is kind of a twilight zone for bipartisan conspiracies lol</p>

<p>Your information is woefully out of date. Since then, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier">many parts of the Dossier have been corroborated</a>. And while not a single detail has been proven to be false, since it&#39;s a compilation from multiple sources of varying credibility, one wrong detail doesn&#39;t discredit the entire report. </p>

<p>Obama’s former CIA chief also cast serious doubt on the credibility of the infamous, explosive “dossier” originally published by BuzzFeed, saying that its author, Christopher Steele, paid intermediaries to talk to the sources for it. The dossier, he said, “doesn’t take you anywhere, I don’t think.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is called strawman. Trump has connections to Russia, so does Hillary, and anyone else with significant wealth. That&#39;s not the issue. The issue is did Trump work with Putin during the election to leak DNC and podesta emails in order to win the election. And the answer to that is no.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire &quot;Russia is colluding with Trump&quot; story was manufactured by podesta and hillary both during the early primaries and within 24 hours of her defeat. </p>

<p>Every billionaire will have &quot;suspicious behaviour&quot; when moving vast amounts of money. The MSM went nuts when they found out trump sold a house in the Russia. The absurdity knows no bounds. This &quot;Russian ties&quot; obsession a witch hunt distracting from the one and only real problem in America - The control that Deepstate agencies and Central banking have over the world.</p>

<p>How about people in the US worry about what the deepstate and federal reserve are doing to their country instead of wasting time chasing russian butterflies which are truly inconsequential?</p>
