       Very interesting read. If true, Trump is "brilliant".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea who Lisa Frank is but...THIS is one of the best and most complete political things I have read! It all fits together and if True, which from all I know it surely seems to be, this is a giant step in "draining the swamp" and proves Trump is not the Bullshiter Obama just called him, rather he is one smart cookie three steps ahead of all these political morons. In fact, I would even suggest he likes the cover insiders and outsiders give him as a dunce -- it is a perfect cover for this Billionaire in the style of the old raincoat Detective Columbo! I LOVE IT!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very few crime/mystery novels that approach this true story for compelling drama, intrigue and brinkmanship (with the nation in the balance).
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe the fake-media story that Trump made a mistake or huge gaffe by firing Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe the media narrative from the left that it was an attempt to silence Comey from some investigation into Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe the RINO narrative that Comey is a good guy just trying to do his job in terrible circumstances and the timing was bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe the lie that Comey was admired and respected by career FBI investigators and agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t believe the lie that Trump’s “tweets" are not professional and have no strategic purpose.  His tweets are weaponized and deadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Comey is a poisonous snake of the highest order…a deep-water Swamp Denizen who has been highly paid to deliberately provide cover for high-level corruption by the Clintons and Obama. He is has been central to trying to destroy the Trump campaign and then the Trump administration from the start. He is as dirty as they come in DC. He had highest-level cover (the FBI no less) and was deep into an effort to eliminate Trump. Trump had to move hard, fast, and at exactly the right time to cut the head off the snake without getting bitten by the snake or being finished by the other swamp denizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Begin by noticing how the President fired Comey when Comey was 3,000 miles away from his office, that Comey had no inkling he was being cut, that all his files, computers, and everything in his office were seized by his boss Sessions and the justice department.  This was not a violation of protocol, it was tactical. Notice how Prez Trump compartmentalized the strike and did not inform any of his White House “staff” to prevent leaks.  Notice how he emasculated Comey and the swamp denizens by letting them know in a tweet that the Attorney General got information (surveillance “tapes” from the seizure of Comey’s office) to let Comey and his handlers know that Trump’s DOJ has the goods on them. This was a brilliant, strategic and totally imperative move at exactly the right time against horrible, evil and corrupt powers infesting our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The swamp is on notice that the President is on to them, they are sweating bullets because their criminal games of corruption are being pursued and they know it.  They are screaming and ranting because they are desperate denizens of the swamp who are beginning to realize they are roadkill.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE COMEY SCAM. Taken from credible public sources (readily available if you want to look or want me to sent them to you), with a few reasonable “fill in the blank” conclusions of my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Highlights:
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey was a minor assistant US attorney in the late 90’s.  He only gained power and money by being the DOJ official who “investigated” and cleared Bill Clinton of any wrong-doing in Clinton's totally corrupt pardon (for huge payoffs) of criminal financier Marc Rich as Clinton was leaving the Presidency. This is how Comey began his career as a creature of the “swamp” years ago, as a servant of the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey provided “cover” for the Clintons in their gaining incredible power and wealth after leaving office through pardoning a billionaire money-launderer, arms dealer and criminal.  Comey was a key piece in how the Clintons upped their corruption game and gained incredible wealth through their foundation after leaving the White House. A huge part of the scheme was giving Marc Rich a free pass when he should have spent life in prison, and that is what Comey covered-up for the Clintons. This set up Comey to be part of the corruption machine, making him powerful and wealthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after doing the Clinton’s dirty work as a DOJ official, Comey resigned from the DOJ and took a position as the head attorney (Counsel) of the Lockheed Martin company, a huge military contractor.  While he was in that position Lockheed became a major contributor (millions) to the Clinton Foundation and its fake charity spin-offs.  In return for these payment to Clinton Inc., Lockheed received huge contracts with Hillary’s state department.  Comey was the chief legal officer of Lockheed throughout this period of contributions to Clinton Inc. in return for State Dept. contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In late 2012, after overseeing Lockheed’s successful relationship with the Hillary State Department and the resulting profits, Comey stepped down from Lockheed and received a $6 million dollar payout for his services.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2013, the largest bank of England, HSBC Holdings, was deep into a scandal. Investigations by federal authorities and law-enforcement had revealed that for years HSBC had been laundering billions of dollars for Mexican Drug Cartels, channeling money for Saudi banks who were financing terror, moving money for Iran in violation of the sanctions, and other major criminal activity. HSBC’s criminality was pervasive and deliberate by the Bank and its officials.  HSBC was a huge Clinton Foundation contributor (many millions) throughout the “investigation” and Bill Clinton was being paid large personal fees for speaking at HSBC events (while Hillary was Sec of State). Eric Holder and the Obama Justice Department did what they were paid to do, and let HSBC off of the hook for a paltry 1.2 Billion dollar fine (paid by its stockholders), and not one Director, officer or management member at HSBC was fired or charged with any criminal.  Exactly when everyone involved with HSBC Bank (including the Clintons and all of their “donors”) were being let off without penalty, and cover had to be provided to HSBC, Comey was appointed as a Director and Member of the Board of HSBC (in the middle of the fallout from the scandal).  He was part of the effort to cover up the scandal and make HSBC “respectable” again.
      </p>
      <p>
       After about a year as HSBC director, despite his lack of any law enforcement experience, no DOJ leadership experience, and no qualifications for the job, Comey was appointed FBI director by Obama.  The only qualification Comey had was that the Clinton’s and their cronies knew Comey was in bed with them, was compromised and was willing to do their dirty work.  Comey was appointed to the FBI right when Hillary was leaving the State Department, and was vulnerable to the FBI because she had been using a private-server, mis-handling classified information, selling access to favors/contracts from the State Department to Clinton Foundation Donors (including Comey’s Lockheed Martin), and much more. Remember that this was about the time the Inspector General of the State Department found over 2 billion “missing” from the State Department finances during Hillary's tenure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious conclusion is that Comey was appointed to the FBI (along with other reliable Clinton-Obama cronies)  to run interference for the Clinton’s and Obama’s at the nation’s federal law enforcement agency(in conjunction with a corrupt Department of Justice).  Comey was and is owned by the Clintons.  He owed all of his power and wealth to being part of their machine and providing them with cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       In late 2015 and early 2016, information began to come out about the Clinton Foundation and its use by the Clinton’s as a multi-billion dollar slush fund for corruption and political favors. (even Chelsea’s wedding had been paid for by the “charity) This was right as Hillary was beginning her campaign for President. It was revealed that the Foundation had never completed required reports or had an audit.  Supposedly the FBI, under Comey, began an “investigation” of the Clinton Funds.  A “professional” accounting firm was brought in by the Clintons to do a review, file some reports, make recommendations to the Clinton Foundation Board, and provide a veneer of legitimacy to the Clinton Fund operations.  Predictably, one of the partners in the firm that was chosen (and paid lots of money) is the brother of James Comey (FBI Director).  This brother owes James Comey $700,000 for a loan James gave him to buy a house, and presumably some of the money from the Clinton Fund was used to make payments to James on the loan. Over 2 years later and nothing has happened as a result of the FBI “investigating” the Clinton Funds under Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one in congress or federal law enforcement was intending to actually pursue the Clintons, but Judicial Watch and other independent sources obtained information proving that Hillary had been running her own server, sending out classified information, etc. This information began to come out right in the middle of her campaign to be coronated as President.  A “show” investigation had to be performed to appear to look into it and clear her.  Who to use?...the reliable shill James Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       As head of the FBI, Comey (and his lackeys in key positions) deliberately screwed up the investigation into Hillary’s use of a private server and her plain violation of national security law on classified information.  The investigation was deliberately mis-handled in every aspect. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s lackeys, did not use subpoenas or warrants, lost evidence, allowed the destruction of evidence, failed to do any searches or seizures of evidence, did not use a grand-jury, did not swear witnesses, did not record testimony, allowed attorneys to represent multiple suspects (corrupting the testimony).  Everything that could be done to ruin the FBI investigation and to cover for Hillary was done.  A “slam-dunk” case became a mess. Immunity was given every witness even though they provided no help. Maybe more importantly, by focusing the FBI on the email scandal, attention was drawn away from the much bigger scandal of the Clinton Foundation that could bring down a huge number of corrupt politicians, lobbyists, and even governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, Comey’s job was simply to totally botch the Hillary investigation and ruin the case against her and her minions within the FBI regarding her emails. At the same time Comey also started work on a parallel assignment to illegally “wiretap” and surveil Donald Trump and every other person involved in the Republican campaign.  He was tasked with digging up any dirt or fact that could be used to hurt the Trump campaign later.  This included using a fake “dossier” paid for by the Clinton campaign to obtain authorization for the surveillance and to try to associate Trump’s campaign with the Russians. Under Comey’s direction the Trump/republican campaign was monitored and surveilled and all information was provided to the Obama Whitehouse and the Clinton camp all during the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lorretta Lynch was supposed to complete the coverup for Hillary as Attorney General by issuing a finding that the deliberately botched FBI “investigation” did not justify prosecution of Hillary.  But someone screwed up and Bill Clinton was video’d meeting with Loretta Lynch in Arizona shortly before she was supposed to make her decision on Hillary (interference with a federal investigation), and Lynch could no longer credibly squash the Hillary scandal. The solution, give the job to James.  The Clinton’s owned him and he would have to do whatever is necessary to provide cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey goes on national TV and violates every rule of the FBI, the Justice Department and American law enforcement by revealing some of the FBI’s “evidence” of what Hillary did (enough to make it look like the FBI and Comey did some investigation), then declaring that there was no “intent” and clearing Hillary.  He did what he was ordered to do.  The Justice Department and Obama backed Comey’s coverup and it looked like Hillary had survived the scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, right before the election, the NYPD obtained pervert Anthony Wiener’s laptop and found classified emails from Hillary on the laptop. The NYPD began leaking details to new-media outlets, and the story was about to explode. Comey once again stepped in to cover Hillary. He short-circuited the NYPD leaks by publicly acknowledging the laptop and the emails, but then claimed just days later that hundreds of thousands of emails had all been reviewed and “nothing new” was on the laptop. Once again, he had done his job.  Providing cover and FBI “protection” for Hillary on the newest scandal when it broke.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary had won, Comey would have kept right on providing cover for the corruption of the Clinton machine.  He would have kept the FBI paralyzed, prevented the Clinton Fund from being investigated, and continued to do his job as the Clinton’s personal scandal eraser at the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT TRUMP WON.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swamp and its bottom-dwelling denizens realize they are at risk from this political outsider who is not connected to the uni-party machines. Before Trump takes office, a “fail-safe” plan is implemented to ruin Trump’s administration and try to force him out of the Presidency.  The key players committed to the plan are the democrat politicians, the RINO establishment, the media, the Obama-Clinton operatives embedded throughout the intelligence agencies and the entire bureaucracy, and most importantly, the Obama DOJ and JAMES COMEY.    The scheme is to smear Trump with Russian “connections,” through a fake FBI “investigation” and more importantly, to trap him into a charge of criminal interference with the FBI.   COMEY IS THE CENTRAL FIGURE IN THE SCHEME TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surveillance of the Trump campaign is continued after he is elected, all participants are “unmasked” illegally, and the transcripts are leaked throughout the government and to the media. When General Flynn appropriately calls Russian officials on behalf of Trump, they brush off the old fake “dossier” and all of the surveillance of the campaign, and Comey creates the “Russian Conspiracy” investigation. With help by RINO swamp kingpin and warmonger sell-out McCain, the fake "Russian pee dossier” is leaked to the press. There is no actual evidence of any collusion or connection between Trump or his campaign with Russia, but that does not prevent Comey from initiating an “investigation” at the FBI.  This provides Comey with protection from Trump firing him immediately.  Comey (or his minions) constantly leak news of the “Russia Investigation” to the media, and the media does its scripted part by screaming constantly about “Russia.”  The Democrats fill their role and constantly scream about “Russia.” McCain and the RINO establishment do their part by promising to “investigate” how the Russians influenced the campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after Trump is sworn in, the DOJ Hillary/Obama operatives and Comey start the direct attack.  This is before Sessions has been appointed to the Department of Justice and the DOJ is still controlled by Obama operatives. DOJ Obama appointee Sally Yates approaches the Whitehouse with news that General Flynn had been in contact with Russia and alleges that he might be compromised.  She reveals that there is an FBI “investigation” into the Russia ties (which they are constantly leaking to the media themselves).  The White House Counsel (who Yates talks to, not Trump) asks for some more information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day before the promised additional information is to be provided by Yates to the Whitehouse, Comey sets up a dinner with Trump.  If he can get Trump to ask about Flynn or try to intervene regarding Flynn or Russia then Trump can be charged with “interfering with an FBI investigation.”  MY OPINION IS THAT COMEY SURVEILLED AND “TAPED” THIS MEETING IN HIS ATTEMPT TO SET UP TRUMP.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a two-pronged attack.  It protects Comey and DOJ democrat holdovers from being terminated by the new administration because they are involved in an “ongoing investigation” that they control the timetable on(albeit one with absolutely no evidence). If Trump fires Comey then he is “interfering with the investigation” which is itself a federal crime that the FBI could then “investigate.”  Alternatively, if they can get Trump to question Comey about Flynn or try to get him to back off of Flynn or the “Russia” investigation, then they again have him “interfering.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump knows it is a set up by Comey and that he is probably being recorded (tips from FBI or DOJ who are not part of the corruption?)  Maybe because his phone calls in the Whitehouse as President have already been bugged and released to the media.  (FBI is in the best position to do this) Maybe because he was used to the Mafia in NY trying to shake him down every time he built a hotel. Comey tells Trump that Trump is not under investigation regarding Russia, but that others involved with the campaign are being investigated. Trump does not take the bait and attempt to intervene about Flynn or the Russia scam.  Later, Flynn is cut loose because he is being used by Comey and the Obama-holdover Justice to try to damage Trump.  He did not thing wrong, but if he stayed the charge of “interfering with an investigation” might seem to have teeth.  Comey verbally tells Trump on two more occasions that he is not being investigated, but refuses to state this fact publicly or when testifying in Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump knows everything I have gone through above about Comey. But he has to move carefully. He has to get his Attorney General and Deputy AG in place, get enough leverage on the Russia narrative, and ideally get rid of Comey in a way that allows him to obtain all the information that Comey has been accumulating (if he is taping Trump he is taping others). Comey, and others testify in Congress.  Under oath, both Sally Yates and Intelligence officials from the Obama administration state that there has been no actual evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  More importantly, Comey, while refusing to say that Trump is not under investigation, testifies that he has informed the Senate Intelligence Committee heads who exactly is under investigation regarding Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump tells almost no one at the White House that he is moving against Comey (so no leaks… no listening in on his conversations) Trump somehow contacts Sen. Grassley (the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee) and confirms that Comey told the Senator that Trump was not under investigation personally.  Trump gets both the Attorney General and the new Deputy Attorney General to legitimately review Comey’s unprofessional actions at the FBI and to recommend in writing that Trump terminate Comey.  Somehow Comey goes to California (at the request of AG Sessions or already scheduled and someone at FBI telling Trump?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump seizes the moment and acts. While Comey is in California, 3000 miles away and 7 hours from his office, Trump prepares a letter firing him (with Sessions and the Deputy AG recommendations attached).  In the letter Trump states that he had been told 3 times by Comey that he (Trump) was not under investigation. The letter is hand-delivered to the FBI headquarters by DOJ officials to lock-down and seize everything in Comey’s office, including all surveillance files (“tapes”) of Trump and others. All of Comey’s files, docs, computers and “tapes” are taken to Sessions at DOJ.  They are not taken to the Whitehouse or Trump, but to Sessions, who has every right to have them.  Sessions can tell Trump that Comey had surveillance tapes of Trump that contradict what Comey has been telling Trump, and perhaps tapes of conversations with other swamp “conspirators.”  But Trump does not have them personally or at the Whitehouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey learns he has been fired when the media broadcasts it in California.  He had no idea it was coming and he is ticked.  On cue, the Democrat politicians and media begin screaming about Trump’s “interference with the Russia  investigation” in accordance with the plan to set up Trump for that charge.  The Swamp wants to blow up the Russia narrative using Comey, and Comey is set to testify before Congress to try to hurt Trump by saying he was interfering with the FBI investigation. Comey intends to follow through with the plan to take down Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because of his brilliant timing on this, Trump has Comey’s files, documents and information safely with Sessions at DOJ. Trump sends out a “crazy” tweet that says:  “James Comey better hope that there are no “tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The media and the politicians go crazy about the “inappropriateness” of this tweet. They accuse Trump of “taping” everyone at the WhiteHouse (forgetting that the Presidents phone calls with foreign leaders have been “taped” without his knowledge.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that Trump did not say he taped anyone, or that he has any tapes at the White House. It seem apparent that Trump is telling Comey that the DOJ (who has every legal right to possess it) has the surveillance information and files from Comey’s office, the “tapes" obtained and kept by Comey.  Comey and all the Swamp Creatures understand the clear message…their plan has failed and Trump’s DOJ is now holding all the cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Russia interference scheme crashes and burns. While the mouthpiece media, Hollywood and the insane fringe continue to scream about Russia and Comey being fired, the politicians  who will soon be in the crosshairs of a legitimate (and ticked) FBI and DOJ are starting to fall strangely silent.  Comey realizes all the leverage is with Trump and that he will be lucky if he is not added to the Clinton Death List because of his knowledge (better not take any baths near an electrical outlet or get on any airplanes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey tells Congress he will not testify and writes a public letter to the FBI accepting his firing and telling them he does not want to discuss why or how he was terminated.  Senator Grassley and Senator Feinstein (she must be covering her butt in fear …) issue public statements confirming that Comey told them that the “Russia Investigation” does not involve President Trump personally.
      </p>

       AG Sessions and his Deputy AG use the Comey trove of information to determine who has been part of the Comey Syndicate at the FBI. They will be appointing an “interim” Director of the FBI shortly who has not been compromised by Comey, Clinton or Obama.  That “interim” Director does not have to be approved by Congress or anyone, and can immediately begin cleaning house at the FBI of all Comey/Clinton/Obama minions, initiating investigations of the Clintons, Clinton Fund, violations of intelligence confidentiality laws by Susan Rice and Obama, human trafficking in DC, political corruption…draining the Swamp.  Using the Comey files they can be fairly certain they are not getting another Comey as an “interim", and they do not have to wait for the circus of appointing a new permanent “Director” through Congressional approval.  Most of the heavy lifting on rooting out FBI corruption and starting investigations into the swamp will be done by the “interim” before a new director is appointed. I suspect the Trump administration hopes the approval FBI Director process will be slow and tedious, so there is no political interference with the housecleaning that is starting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one masterstroke, Trump has eliminated a truly toxic and dangerous enemy to his administration and our country, dealt a horrendous blow to the Clinton/Obama and deep state machines, begun the restoration of the integrity of the FBI and the DOJ, and gained incredible ammunition to begin hunting the foul creatures in the swamp.

       I believe this. It aligns with everything I know and have read about the Clinton administration, anyway, which is really just a wing of the deep state controlling greater DC.

       I do not know if Trump is "a good guy" and I disagree with him on matters of policy. But I
       <em>

       know that at this particular moment in US history, he's the best shot the US has got at turning the ship around.

       Not sure.  They used the excuse that they need more time to go through everything.  I am not sure I believe it.  They could be covering for someone, or they could be waiting for the right moment to disclose what they know.

       They at least offered this disclaimer. I would assume this is one of the conclusions they drew, based off of Trump waiting until Comey was across the country. It is disingenuous though to not clarify what is fact and what is inferred

       Unless they're keeping it to a couple people, following up on the shit he wrote down, getting more evidence as they go. It's not like they'd want the people they're coming for to get wind of it and destroy/alter the evidence they'd get from it.

       There's a special prosecutor now, it wouldn't be as hard to keep information secret.

       Well, yeah.  Obviously if it's announced you're investigation just got expanded to start looking further down the line from where it started you don't release the info to the people you're investigating with an itemized list for them to check off as they shred shit.

       I'll be honest here, I'm not entirely sure how the cross over works with investigations between the agencies/committees when parts of the government are being investigated by a special prosecutor, as well as multiple agencies/bureaus.  But the reasoning I'm seeing when I look into it is they want to make sure theyre not going to be putting the information into the hands of someone who's either being investigated, or will leak the info to someone who is before they just hand over all their info.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they didn't they might as well just shred the evidence themselves, the reason for appointing the special council is that they'd be able to be partial during the investigation.  Plus any way of inhibiting the leaking of what they find amid an ongoing investigation has got to be a priority at this point.

       All of this is basically a wet dream that all your political enemies are evil and Trump is the benevolent God Emperor.

       I do think Comey is a good man though. You should watch some of his speeches. He doesn't seem like an evil guy.

       I don't think this character assassination works though if you're going to use Comey's use of capitalism against him as a sign of corruption. Your guy is a billionaire. I wonder if all his money is legit.

       I may not be the most intelligent person here, but if I had as much power as some people think the Clintons have and I have the FBI director in my back pocket, I am pretty sure I would have had Comey make public the investigation of my opponent. I don't know if I would leave it in the hands of the voters?
