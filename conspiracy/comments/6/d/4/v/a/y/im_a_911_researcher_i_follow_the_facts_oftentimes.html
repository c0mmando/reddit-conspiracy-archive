<p>Khazars are the only empire iirc that had its nobility/ruling elite convert to Judaism. They specifically imported Jewish priests and other religious leaders to do so. It was as a result of being surrounded by 2 other Abrahamic religions, Orthodox Christianity in the Byzantine Empire in the south and Sunnis in the steppes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews are not the problem, but the (political/Rothschild) Zionists are.</p>

<p>Most Jewish people today are medern/moderat/secular Jews (they take the good and leave the bad).</p>

<p>However, most of the &quot;Jews&quot; in power are (political/Rothschild) Zionists pretending to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Jewish people and evil (political/Rothschild) Zionists are not the same thing! This above mentioned form of Zionism is a very racist, genocidal, greedy, self-serving, unsympathetic, sociopathic, psychopathic, and fundamental ideology. There are Zionists that are not claiming to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, but &quot;Christian&quot; (faux Christian), such as the Bush Family and Biden. Many of the Zionists claim to be &quot;Jewish&quot;, in part, to discredit any and all critics with a dismissive conversation ender by calling them &quot;anti-Semites&quot;. Zionists that claim to be Jewish are about as Jewish as terrorists claiming to be Muslim (as in, not at all true to the (modern/secular/moderat) religions).</p>

<p>Part of the plan by these (political/Rothschild) Zionists that claim to be Jewish is to have the masses hate actual Jewish people and Israel for their atrocities; The average uninformed/missinformed person may mistake these Zionists as true Jewish people, and falsely blame humanist Jewish people for all of the atrocities of the Zionists (War, Coup de tats, Usery, human rights/constitutional defying laws/policies/actions, etc.).</p>

<p>The three big (political/Rothschild) Zionist Occupied Governments (ZOGs) are the USA, the UK, and Israel. Many other countries are also controlled, owned, and operated by the Zionists (through Central banking, mega corporations that politically lobby federal politicians, mainstream media, etc.). Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.</p>

<p>The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.</p>

<p>Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).</p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>(Political/Rothschild) Zionists control most of the worlds currencies, certain stock / stock markets, governments (through controlling the currencies, political lobbying, etc.), lend money to governments (including lending to the USA and Russia). Absolutely no entity has as much influence, power, money, resources, etc that these (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and related Global Elites around or above them have.</p>

<p>You are either uninformed and/or missinformed if you deny the existence, power, wealth, and influence of (political/Rothschild) Zionism.</p>

Ovadia Yosef and Netanyahu. &gt;&gt;
Why are Gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. That is why Gentiles were created.In Israel, death has no dominion over them...With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but (God) will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one&#39;s donkey would die, they&#39;d lose their money. This is his servant...That&#39;s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew. Gentiles were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel. (just a few of Yosef quotes)</p>

Many USFG politicians have Israel-USA dual citizenships.</p>

<p>The Zionist grid of power in a nutshell: The USA is Israels bitch, the USA, Israel, UK (and others) are the bitches of the (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and the Zionists are the bitches of the top-of-the-top of the Global Elites/Powers That Be (PTB)/Illuminati.</p>

<p>Protip: When trying to denounce (political/Rothschild) Zionism and its ilk, for the love of God, do not use David Duke as a source! Duke may be right about the power of Zionism to an extent, but using Duke as a source probably discredits the Conspiracy/Truth/Dissent movement since Duke used to be a KKK Grand Wizard, is a white-supremacist, and is also not fond of Jewish people (even if they are humanist and not Zionists).</p>

<p>────────</p>

<p>(Political/Rothschild) Zionists control most of the worlds currencies, certain stock / stock markets, governments (through controlling the currencies, political lobbying, etc.), lend money to governments (including lending to the USA and Russia). Absolutely no entity has as much influence, power, money, resources, etc that these (political/Rothschild) Zionists, and related Global Elites around or above them have.</p>

<p>You are either uninformed and/or missinformed if you deny the existence, power, wealth, and influence of (political/Rothschild) Zionism.</p>

<p>So 9/11 overview of potential (credible) involvement I&#39;ve heard;</p>

<p>A few Mossad officers and Israelis (5 total)</p>

<p>Saudi Secret service + high level government officials</p>

<p>The reason the Israeli involvement as a whole is hard to link is that the Israeli Mossad works in an unusually decentralized and autonomous way. You can very easily have a few agents decide to &quot;go rogue&quot; with almost no consequence simply because of this nature. </p>

<p>Interesting info in there, don&#39;t just skim it. </p>

<p>And an related article: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2002/05/07/students/">http://www.salon.com/2002/05/07/students/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>more than one-third of the students, who were spread out in 42 cities, lived in Florida, several in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. — one-time home to at least 10 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers. In at least one case, the students lived just a stone’s throw from homes and apartments where the Sept. 11 terrorists resided: In Hollywood, several students lived at 4220 Sheridan St., just down the block from the 3389 Sheridan St. apartment where terrorist mastermind Mohammed Atta holed up with three other Sept. 11 plotters. Many of the students, the DEA report noted, had backgrounds in Israeli military intelligence and/or electronics surveillance; one was the son of a two-star Israeli general, and another had served as a bodyguard to the head of the Israeli army.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to &quot;get you&quot;, I&#39;m asking you for information. Please look at how these comments have been going - I ask you for information, since the source you cite doesn&#39;t contain it. You then link a different source and insult me for not having read it. That isn&#39;t intellectually honest. The claim you made was that the FBI report concluded the deported Israelis had links to the attacks. The report does not make this conclusion. If you just said &quot;I disagree with the FBI report because of this DEA summary that shows a link&quot; then we could have skipped a whole chunk of this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with the Israeli &quot;art student&quot; incidents. Can you please tell me where in the memo (written before 9/11) it links the 5 deported Israelis to the hijackers? Or at the very least tell me what new information I can expect to get from reading it that a summary does not tell me? I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re linking it to Able Danger either. Can you give some evidence linking the Israeli students to Able Danger, either a separate link or the part of the DEA doc that does? Other conspiracy sites I see don&#39;t make this link or ascribe anything similar to the DEA doc, so I&#39;m interested to know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that some Israeli &quot;art students&quot; living in the same city as the hijackers is strong evidence that the high-fivers were connected to the hijackers. If you&#39;re instead switching to talking about links to Israel in general then I agree it&#39;s a coincidence, but it doesn&#39;t seem enough to suggest they had a hand in it.</p>

<p>Same city? Same block. Stop being deceptive like this. It&#39;s really strange. </p>

<p>If you at all knew about Abel danger, AMDOCS, or the DEA spy ring details, you wouldn&#39;t be asking these questions. I&#39;m not spoon feeding you any longer because you have put words in my mouth and obfuscated details. It&#39;s incredibly bizarre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I guess I need to pull your quotes since you&#39;re either writing very sloppily or just lying. In your first post you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They [&quot;They&quot; referring to the &quot;celebrating individuals&quot; you mentioned in the line above&quot; had connections to the 9/11 Hijackers and much more.
When I asked why you had concluded differently to the FBI report, which says they had no connection, you said:
Where did I ever conclude differently than the FBI?
So your position is that you A) agree with the FBI report, B) believe the Israelis had connections to the hijackers and C) there is no contradiction between these. So it follows that D) the FBI report supports a connection. This isn&#39;t putting words in your mouth, it&#39;s literally reading what you&#39;re writing. Stop being intellectually dishonest. If you don&#39;t actually believe something, don&#39;t write it. More importantly, if you&#39;re saying that the high fivers weren&#39;t connected to the hijackers and didn&#39;t have foreknowledge of the attack, then why bring them up? What do they demonstrate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same block vs the same city is not a particularly meaningful one. Lots of people lived on the same block as the hijackers. It cannot stand alone as the proof that Israel did/knew about 9/11. The DEA report of the &quot;artists&quot; activities doesn&#39;t seem consistent with either a team of handlers or a team of monitors. If you believe it suggests otherwise, then (again) please tell me where. The full text is searchable <a href="https://cryptome.org/dea-il-spy.htm">here</a>. </p>

<p>Again, I have looked into Able Danger (not sure why you spell it incorrectly?) and the DEA &quot;spy ring&quot;. But there is nothing to suggest they are linked beyond conjecture. If you have evidence to suggest otherwise, please link it! It&#39;s not &quot;spoon feeding&quot; to provide evidence for your claims. It feels like you&#39;re being intentionally vague because you don&#39;t want to get tied down to any one theory or fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me you become an asshole when you post stuff like, &quot;Dual Israeli Citizen Politicians!!1!&quot; and then get totally defensive when asked for any proof, don&#39;t provide any, and say shit like, &quot;I&#39;m just a simple goy, right?&quot;  (This just happened to me).</p>

<p>I&#39;m Catholic, if you can provide evidence that indicates there&#39;s a Jesuit conspiracy (for example, really not looking for any) then, great, I&#39;d be interested to look at the evidence. </p>

<p>Mud-slinging without facts sucks though and it makes what might be a valid point laughable and racist, and, unfortunately, I see that a lot here.</p>

The spend substantial resources in constructing disinformation and fake conspiracy theories with the common determinator that the victims where real so that we don&#39;t understand this key aspects of these operations. It&#39;s not because of care there are no real victims but because this makes the operation manageable.

    <div class="md"><p>No. Both Kennedy murders where faked. Produced like Hollywood movies, just like 9/11. All the conspiracy theories surrounding these events are part of the psyops. Affirming the event (JFK was shot, 3000 people died). Much of the imagery from JFK is simply impossible. Although so few people where standing where Kennedy was shot there&#39;s a plethora of imagery. In the 60s! Razor sharp Polaroid taken on a moving vehicle. Riight. Miles Mathis has a good write-up on. Some claim he&#39;s a shill. I don&#39;t know. The details may be wrong but I definitely think the Kennedy murders was a hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure they &quot;ordered&quot; it via the PNAC document.  But I doubt they knew what they were getting.  And if they did it all by their lonesome, why would they do such an incompetent job of implicating Saddam, who obviously had no ties to the deed whatsoever?  It&#39;s more likely they just used 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq, than that they deliberately made themselves look like idiots by claiming that he orchestrated a bunch of Saudis and Mossad agents and had weapons of mass destruction.  The Republican response was obviously improvised, not planned.</p>

<p>German newspapers wrote that antizionism might be the new antisemitism, after the German vice chancellor visited Isreal and met extra-parliamentary opposition group &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot; (they want  bring awareness to the consequences of occupation/zionism) which angered the Israeli president and he cancelled the meeting with the vice chancellor later that day.</p>

<p>First, the newspapers ripped him to pieces for his political faux-pas and &quot;spitting in the face of Israel&quot;, but after the chancellor backed his decision up, they calmed down. </p>
