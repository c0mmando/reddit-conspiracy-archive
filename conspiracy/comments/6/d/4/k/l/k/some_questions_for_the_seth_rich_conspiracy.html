       If he were assassinated via a double-tap it would
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       like an assassination, which would warrant a full scale investigation. As it stands, he's dead, via what appears to be, a botched robbery, which is an open-and-shut case.

       Fair enough.

       Questions for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       We agree Seth was murdered.
We agree the murderers are still at large and the case is not solved
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would Wikileaks be so interested in solving this, what vested interest would they have outside of it exposing something more?
       <br/>
       Why would they (and be the only ones) offer a reward for information?
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone including the DNC had any interest in putting this to bed then why would they try to do everything possible to stop the investigation or obstruct it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason this conspiracy lives on is because it isn't resolved and those who stand to lose the most if it is in fact true seem to be the only ones not interested in solving it.

       That's a very good point. Democrats/Liberals/DNC members should be making the biggest fuss of all to get this solved. This was one of their boys. Why do they want everyone to just accept that this was a "botched robbery" and move on?

       Especially since they could use it multiple ways to promote their narratives.  example:
      </p>
      <p>
       Play SR as a russian agent who was leaking, got caught and obviously Russia did him in.  RUSSIANS!!!!
Play SR (HRC already tried) as another victim of senseless gun violence.  GUN CONTROL NEEDED NOW!!!!

       Good point, why aren't liberals making Seth Rich the poster boy for gun control? If that criminal hadn't gotten his hands on a gun so easily, Seth Rich would still be alive. This is the NRA's fault!

       It wouldn't work because D.C. Has very strict gun laws so it would go against their narrative and for the gun lobby saying well if he had a gun he could of protected himself.

       I'm having a hard time believing wikileaks wants this solved. If they have proof that Seth Rich was the leaker why not release it? I know that is not their policy to do that but the leaker is dead and this would put a stop to all of this Russia stuff. Plus give the family answers. Not releasing proof just keeps this going.

       how do you explain all the bruises Seth Rich had on his hands and face. why would wikileaks offer a huge reward for some random person who was murdered during a botched robbery? Why do you believe Brad Bauman, who is a known DNC operative who deals in crisis management. How do you explain David Brock being on the board of directors for Brad Bauman's foundation? There is way too much that doesn't add up. Plus, when the media is pushing their narrative as forcefully as they have been lately, that is a dead giveaway that something is up. This whole thing is fucky, and I just want the truth. The actual truth, not a truth that was thought up in some boardroom meeting.

       If you think it's fishy that Bauman is connected to David Brock, what is your opinion on Ed Butowsky, the friend of Steve Brannon who financed the "investigation" that yielded the fake story about the laptop and emails to dinosaur? Or the fact that Bukowsky visited the White House a few weeks ago? That seems way more concrete a connection.

       To answer questions one and two, maybe they didn't want it to look like an assassination. For question 3, maybe the assassins didn't take Seth's personal belongings in the off chance they were detained by police. Having the property of a man who was found dead in the streets is a dead giveaway that you did it. Duh. I don't think a double tap is the only way to send a message. A couple bullets to the back still sends a strong message. And in general, a couple bullets to the back will normally kill someone pretty quickly. The fact that he survived for awhile is probably just a fluke.

       You're right, there's no way this was done by a professional. A professional would have used a sniper rifle from a mile away, and put a bullet right between his eyes. That's the only way professionals work.

       What if it was the Russians that killed him, to throw everyone off their trail? We need to find the people responsible so we can rule that out. Democrats should want this to be solved ASAP. If it was the Russians, then maybe Trump was involved!

       Even if this was just a totally random, "botched robbery," it doesn't change the fact that it was Seth Rich who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and not the Russians. But the fact that the guy who leaked the emails got executed in the streets shortly after is just way to big of a coincidence for me. Anything's possible, but I think the most logical explanation is that he was assassinated. Corrupt politicians like Hillary Clinton absolutely do not give a fuck about taking out their enemies. It's just business.

       This doesn't really help to further the conversation.  We're in a conspiracy sub, the proof for a lot of this stuff is going to be hard to find and circumstantial.  No one here can prove that it was the Russians and no one can prove that Seth Rich did the leaking.  Demanding proof isn't going to get us anywhere.

       So you’re making the incompetence defense here.  Let’s apply the same standard to the criminal investigation of Seth Rich’s murder … or to you own line of reasoning.   There are plenty of unanswered questions surrounding Rich’s death.   But the notion that answers should not be sought because the killer(s) were incompetent is like dismissing the lies of a veteran politician because normally he’s so much better at it.

         Because they panicked, or because they were afraid of getting caught while stealing his stuff since they had just fired two shots, or a host of other reasons. Perhaps they just weren't that concerned with making it look like a robbery, but didn't want it to look like an assassination. There are tons of potential answers to this.

       Good point, why aren't liberals making Seth Rich the poster boy for gun control? If that criminal hadn't gotten his hands on a gun so easily, Seth Rich would still be alive. This is the NRA's fault!

       If you think it's fishy that Bauman is connected to David Brock, what is your opinion on Ed Butowsky, the friend of Steve Brannon who financed the "investigation" that yielded the fake story about the laptop and emails to dinosaur? Or the fact that Bukowsky visited the White House a few weeks ago? That seems way more concrete a connection.
