       It should go over well since most of the people that post in this sub now 'overlooked' the racism that Trump exudes to vote for him. At least this guy is honest, I guess.

       Just so you know, we committed genocide to take this land after whitey fled England to escape persecution. As America grew, people came from all over the world. At points, the Irish and Italians who came here got the Arab treatment. None of us are pure. You guys are so hypocritical, it's astounding. And any decent post is met with the_donald brigading and downvoting.

       It's more about economy and education than race. This is easily observed by going into different bars. Go to a biker bar or a trailer park and you'll see how much your "civilized white people" position falls apart. Go to an expensive bar or restaurant in Atlanta or San Francisco and you can have plenty of "civilized" discussions with minorities.

       Sure racism is bad.

      <p>
       But no one can argue against: The world would be better off with one race.

      <p>
       Same with religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the simple fact that there wouldn't be anything to argue about. And we would be able to realize the real, systematic, problems with our system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we have these 'mixing pots' of countries where everyone gets preoccupied with fighting about who's skin color is the best or who's magic book is more true.

       If there was no longer a way to divide us, we would rise.

       There is an episode of 'the fairly odd parents' that you may want to watch. Basically everyone is turned into the same gray blobs and some people start talking about how they are tge most gray and bloby.

       Even in a world where we all have the same some people will think they have less, some more. I doubt any world organization could ever exist and never divide on itself.

       How could it happen? Even if every single person were the same that would hardly stop wars being faught and people hating other people...it's childish to think it would work. I fail to understand how you can believe it would work on the most basic of levels.

       In order for this argument to make sense you have to fully believe that the root of ALL strife in the world stems from either race or religion (ignoring that money is probably higher than these two combined). What makes you think this is true?

       Right. Let me change the argument around then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm racist because I want one race. So no one could ever fight about it. What if my one race is just a malgamation of all the races, hundreds of years from now like the Southpark episode?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, what if I choose no race? Can I be racist if I wish every race on earth was wiped out?
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly think the other species on this planet would be far better off without humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thank you for talking this out with me. I'm not racist. Unless were talking about the human race.

       Some interesting points, but I'd also point out that the white people practiced some seriously evil genocide to pretty much wipe out the indigenous peoples of North America.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also consult with several tech companies whose employee rosters are quite diverse, and I don't think race has much to do with people's intelligence. There are a lot of smart Hispanic, black, Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern people. The problem is our lousy education system and incredibly shallow and stupid media.

       It's possible the melting pot/quilt will win out in the end. But it's the really evil people atop the pyramid who need to be stopped, and, best I can tell, they're mostly white or at least "white."
