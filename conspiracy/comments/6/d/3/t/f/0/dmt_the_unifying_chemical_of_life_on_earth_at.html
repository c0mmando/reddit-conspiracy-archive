       It's one of the foundational motives. The 12 tribes of Israel were spread all around the globe (Native Americans, Mexicans, Latin Americas, Africans, Indians, etc) Melanin literally is the conduit of spiritual energy which the elites need to sustain their power structure. About 90% of world population are descended from Israel, we just need to reconnect with our ancestors.

       If we were to go off fossil records &amp; archeological findings, the oldest bones of our kind are found in Ethiopia, as well as the first mention of any deity &amp; religious text that would serve as a guide for future generations of this faith.

       If we go off of the general premise of pansmeria, we can all stop discussing this now as there's probably no way to figure out how we came from before this planet.

       A theory I've come across from old folks is that our deities, both good and bad, as well as some of their people came here to Earth soon after the nuclear destruction of Mars and their civilization which predated Earth's humanity by a millenia.

       Very true!! I have a feeling the generation I claim is more inclined to look at the metaphysical, ethereal consciousness we all share, more so than the previous generations that have blatantly over-valued their physical selves &amp; it's time on this planet.

       I personally think DMT could serve as a fresh new lens for science to view things through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The love of my life has epilepsy &amp; her grand mal's are nocturnal. She &amp; I have discussed at great length how there's a possibility her epilepsy &amp; maybe many other people's could be linked to erratic or simply abnormal releases of DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've also talked about how many illnesses that relate to memory &amp; motor loss could potentially be linked, even slightly, to the incorrect catalyzing of DMT during sleep &amp; maybe even periods of being awake.

       Interesting. Got any links or abstracts you could throw down?

       I wish:((( epilepsy is one of the largest ailments in the world with the least amount of research, funding, public exposure, you name it. Around 1 in 20 people have some form of epilepsy &amp; the epilepsy foundation know of enough cases now to say that for every citizen in the U.K. there is an individual with epilepsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many illnesses &amp; ailments are getting funding but this one is just hardly talked about on a large scale. In some countries people still think demonic possession is the singular cause for seizures which ends up leading to nothing but a horrible life &amp; extremely early death in the life of someone who could've been given a better chance to a life like everyone else.

       I will say check out the epilepsy foundation's website. Great literature there. But that's really it.

      <p>
       Anyone that sees this please go read; YOU could be the reason someone gets to their family again or not. Read up on the do's &amp; don't's, find out how you can help spread awareness. Donate if you're able. A lot of people you know may have epilepsy &amp; just haven't brought it up because they don't want to have to answer uneducated questions &amp; assumptions.

       After doing DMT once &amp; tripping on 5 grams of psilocybin every week last summer I've concluded I don't like the word reality. I can't prove I exist or that any of this exists so I refer to this all as just experiencing.

       Tek 2 is easy to use and you don't need lye. Just need to find some MHRB, which isn't impossible.
