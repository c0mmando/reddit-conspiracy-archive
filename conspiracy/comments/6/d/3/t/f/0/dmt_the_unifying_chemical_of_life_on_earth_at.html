The 12 tribes of Israel were spread all around the globe (Native Americans, Mexicans, Latin Americas, Africans, Indians, etc) Melanin literally is the conduit of spiritual energy which the elites need to sustain their power structure.

    <div class="md"><p>I wish:((( epilepsy is one of the largest ailments in the world with the least amount of research, funding, public exposure, you name it. Around 1 in 20 people have some form of epilepsy &amp; the epilepsy foundation know of enough cases now to say that for every citizen in the U.K. there is an individual with epilepsy. </p>

<p>So many illnesses &amp; ailments are getting funding but this one is just hardly talked about on a large scale. In some countries people still think demonic possession is the singular cause for seizures which ends up leading to nothing but a horrible life &amp; extremely early death in the life of someone who could&#39;ve been given a better chance to a life like everyone else.  </p>
