       Trump got elected with the help of the votes from conspiracy theorists, antisemites, people sick of corruption and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's failed to lock up the D.C. pedophiles and release 911 info, attacked Syria based on bogus intel, put on a yamuk in israel like a shabas goy bitch, and lined his pockets selling visas to china etc.

       That circlejerk frustrates me to no end. Voat is the same way. These people don't realize they're being played in hopes that they will accept the police state, condone foreign war, and hopefully a few of them are even dumb enough to start some kind of violent uprising that would allow for the imposition of martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       They spend all their time talking about the dishonest media and "fake news" but they operate under the assumption that the media is 100% trustworthy about literally every detail about every terror event. They stop questioning it as soon as it proffers the opportunity to circlejerk about "muh ebil mudslimes."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying over and over again to get them to investigate the details of just
       <em>
        one hoax terror event
       </em>
       in hopes that it will cast doubt on all others, or at least get them to think critically about the MSM they claim to despise and distrust.

       I'm not special, no, and I was still able to figure out that the mainstream media lies about terror attacks that are fabricated by government agents. It's not that hard if you apply some critical thinking.

       George W. Bush got in office by stealing the 2000 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sample article:
       <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/none-dare-call-it-treason/">
        https://www.thenation.com/article/none-dare-call-it-treason/

       Then he gave a massive 4.3 trillion dollar tax cut to the rich, ELIMINATING THE SURPLUS ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he was away all summer on vacation, not tending to anything but himself (supposedly).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, a report commissionbe by Bill Clinton revealed that 2.3 trillion dollars were "unaccounted": in the Defense Deaprtment. That was September 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the great terror attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was the very next day that the consortium revealed it's findings on the vote count in Florida -- by every statewide measure, whatever method was used, Al Gore won the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, if that wasn't enough, the fall was filled with giant corporate scandals, the anthrax scare, and many deaths of biological scientists....
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, I remember it well ... but not fondly.

       Trump like Bush jr. seems to think it's his destiny to be a war president, hopefully in the next false flag something blatantly obvious goes wrong that wakes up all the sheep so we can stop repeating this vicious cycle, hell Obama used the Bin Laden killing to get elected the second time, violence seems to be a language we Americans speak fluently

       Here is the hard fact about the last election, and why the media predicted it all so poorly. The media and DNC are out of touch with the majority of people who don't live in metropolitan/coastal areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This fact still has not changed. The way the polls were done are the same ways they are still being done. You really have no idea how popular Trump is, because the way the media seems to report their own wishful thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the real secret about why people voted for Trump was actually as simple as "to piss everyone off." Trump is VERY consistent at this, so most of his base aren't going to budge.

       Hillary Clinton straight up did not campaign in Wisconsin or Michigan, whether it was arrogance, ignorance, or throwing the election I highly doubt the Democrats would allow such an oversight a second election in a row

       So why bother with "drain the swamp" and "America first" then? How is putting his hands on the saudi kings balls and wearing a yamuk like a bitch pissing people off?

       I'm sorry I thought the point was to elect a President who would make America great again. I didn't realise it was all a big troll. When was the last time Trump said "radical Islam"? Before the election?

       Then you missed a major reason why people actually voted for him. Similar to how the french spoiled ballots to protest with their vote, American's voted for Trump to basically give Washington DC the finger.

       why would he want to?  he's a billionaire businessman just trying to secure connections and legacy for his family and friends.  i doubt he even needs 4 years to accomplish his goals.

       He's not much worse than any of the previous presidents so I would either vote him back in or go 3rd party. Unless the democratic party puts up someone worthy.
