<p>They go into:
Mossad agents working with CIA and killing everyday Americans.</p>

<p>Terrorist bombings in the US being false flag events by people within the deep government. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a character that is most likely modelled after Alex Jones.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t believe they were allowed to do any of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please realize that in order to bring about a new world order, the previous order needs to be utterly destroyed. It is part of the hermetic plan to destroy any semblance of trust the people have in their institutions. That is how you destroy nations.</p>

<p>Why didn&#39;t they plant WMDs in Irak? Why would House of Cards, which expounds the corrupt system, be so heavily advertised? What about TARP, doesn&#39;t it look like a provocation, when monetizing 700b through the Fed would have been so much easier (as they did trillions more)?</p>

<p>Similarly the Trump-Putin propaganda isn&#39;t meant to be believed by (most) people. And again they got Trump in power by using the same reverse-psychology type shit (plus a super-ueber-villain and war criminal as the alternative).</p>

<p>Here is a post on C_S_T where I develop this idea: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5v7fwp/the_conspiracy_of_trust_or_why_didnt_they_simply/">https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5v7fwp/the_conspiracy_of_trust_or_why_didnt_they_simply/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There certainly is a fascinating mystery about the effects of &quot;meme magic&quot;, or things like the 100th monkey phenomenon.</p>

<p>I was stunned by the synchronicities (real or imagined) surrounding Kek during the election and how much of a feedback loop it all caused during the election. While the connections of Pepe and the ancient Egyptian frog god could be dismissed as a fun coincidence, I still can&#39;t explain the whole trip-code aspect other than it being some kind of message that is being channeled from the group mind and being manifested out of randomness (or something like that). It&#39;s just beyond coincidence.</p>

<p>I quite like the way you put it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe occult power operates on earth chiefly through psychological and memetic avenues, that is, in the minds of humans and in the realm of information transmission. But I also believe that the functionality accessible by these avenues is so far outside what is known or expected to be possible that the phenomena is effectively best understood as supernatural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that as well but idk in this specific case with Homeland it just seemed to be different. I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t though and you are right. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t know who Mossad is and after watching they will know they are all killers (maybe they want us to believe that?)</p>

<p>They show exactly how conspiracies are probably really carried out. Random killings of FBI agents to look like suicide etc.</p>

<p>For me it makes me believe in conspiracies even more because it makes them so plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its hard to say but time always tells the truth. This guy is kind of new and so far he is verbally destroying the enemies of the world and at the same time claiming to be a high level person who has an army that is fighting the cabal crooks. Those are bold claims. </p>

<p>I doubt its a stupid LARPer. This is either true or its a psyop. Don&#39;t underestimate the people. Very few are willing to do something as stupid as get people all excited for nothing especially since they themselves are part of the people. That&#39;s why I doubt this is a childish joke.

<p>If they aren&#39;t, then it&#39;s just a LARPer. LARPing doesn&#39;t have any negative consequences unless someone&#39;s identity is actually on the line, which in this case it&#39;s not.

<p>It could also easily be a psy-op, as you point out, but I don&#39;t see any reason this hypothesis is any more relevant than LARP.</p>

<p>Can confirm serious similarities between the storyline/plot of Homeland &amp; our current scripted chaotic geopolitical situation.</p>

<p>Mossad. CIA. Rogue US military elements. Sockpuppet farms. Patsies. Social media conditioning. Propaganda. Alex Jones character (O&#39;Keefe). </p>

<p>Based on what you&#39;re describing, it sounds like it&#39;s given an anti-Republican bias.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in republican or democrat but I hold a lot of conservative views and if mossad agents killing people and the CIA doing hits on people is bashing republicans then fuck republicans lol.</p>

<p>The whole season is a civil war between intelligence community.</p>
