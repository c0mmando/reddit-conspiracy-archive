    <div class="md"><p>Well, they could produce the video from the CCTVs in the area that nobody talks about. If there was more discussion of the CCTV, I&#39;d feel like reporters were doing their jobs.</p>

<p>Somebody could talk to Podesta about who he was referring to as the &quot;leaker&quot; who &quot;needed to be made an example of.&quot; Seems like that might be a critical piece of info, and not just for the Seth Rich murder but the Russia &quot;hack&quot; as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no police camera at that intersection. There is no evidence the convenience mart had a camera that faced the incident area. There is no evidence there is CCTV video to release. </p>

<p>We already know the context of the &quot;leaker&quot; email, which was about someone who was interviewed for a campaign job to re-make HRC&#39;s image who leaked it to the press that the campaign was trying to make over the campaign. Like 6 months before SR was in the picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the list of cameras provided by a Reddit user who&#39;s either very familiar or lives in DC? He provided a detailed list of specific cameras at specific intersections &amp; businesses that could&#39;ve captured footage of what actually happened. If I&#39;m not mistaken, he listed at least 10-15 cameras so I&#39;d be willing to bet at least one of them caught something that could help explain what really happened. Although the probability at this point of actually finding any of that footage is slim to none, if it is a coverup, I&#39;m sure any traffic cam footage has been edited or wiped as well as business owners &quot;relieved&quot; of their security footage by G-men. 
I don&#39;t think you can honestly say that there&#39;s either something definitely fishy about the whole thing or it&#39;s one of the biggest coincidences in recorded history. I agree some people stretch things a bit to far to fit into what they want it to be but that doesn&#39;t mean that the whole theory is baseless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why about it. Without seeing it I can&#39;t comment. All I know is that this is a residential neighborhood with one convenience mart on the corner. No DC police cameras. No evidence other videos or cameras exist. It&#39;s a stop sign at the intersection with no traffic camera. </p>

<p>So, as of right now, there is nothing to suggest a video or camera exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until footage is found obviously nobody can comment on it, that&#39;s kinda the whole point of this is to find out if there&#39;s any camera footage that contains evidence. 
I&#39;m just curious are you from D.C. Or live in D.C.?
You seem pretty confident of your knowledge of security camera locations in D.C. (Public and private)
I&#39;m just curious as to why you apparently know more than the rest of us do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Police camera locations are listed on the PD&#39;s website. Stop sign intersection was from google streetview. </p>

<p>The only private camera that I have heard claims of existence are from a convenience mart catty corner to where the incident took place, but there has been no proof of its existence. </p>

<p>The existence of other private videos is speculation which haven&#39;t been confirmed even exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you providing facts. If other private cameras existence is speculation, that&#39;s all the more reason an exhaustive investigation needs to be conducted to find out. Even at that things can be covered up but at this point it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re doing much at all as far as investigating goes, hell the internet seems more on top of it/ eager to find the truth regardless of what that is than the authorities. I can think of several people who don&#39;t want it to be investigated or the truth exposed. If people dismiss this without a second thought and don&#39;t think it needs to be investigated, theyre likely terribly naive to not believe some shady shit goes on at the highest levels of government and that things are often covered up using the vast resources of people in power and the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your first statement, I think there&#39;s more information pointing to some sort of cover-up than there is suggesting it was just a mugging gone wrong.

<p>I&#39;ve watched people on this and other subs building this theory the past week. False assumptions that were suddenly undisputed facts 24h later. &quot;Smoking guns&quot; that were actually loose connections. All while the initial assumption that there is a connection between Rich and Wikileaks is supported by... I guess the word of Julian Assange. Who is appearently protecting his source by spreading the theory that he&#39;s his source.</p>

<p>I watched this unfold under the assumption that it&#39;s completely made up, and all the leads until now have strengthened that theory more than weakened it. (With theory I mean the Wikileaks connection, there is an unsolved murder after all)</p>
