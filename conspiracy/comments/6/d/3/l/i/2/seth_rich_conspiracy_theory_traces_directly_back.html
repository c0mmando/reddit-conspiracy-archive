       Ed Butowsky, the Dallas wealth manager and frequent Fox News guest who paid for the private investigation into the murder of Seth Rich, is friends with and serves on the board of an organization started by White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was Butowsky who paid Rod Wheeler, the private investigator who made false claims that Seth Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks. Wheeler later retracted the claims, and Fox News retracted the entire story.

       Julian Assange used Seth Rich as an example of the risks their sources take and offered a reward for information leading to Seth's Murderer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we assume his murder was a random act of violence or a failed robbery, it doesn't change anything related to his association to wikileaks.

       Julian Assange also said he would time the release of his information to do the most damage to Hillary.  If you've watched any interview where Hillary's name come up, he can't hide his bias(not that I blame him).

       I feel the same way with all these claims about this being debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that assange went out of his way to mention Seth in relation to sources and the reward he offered is far more compelling than anything I have seen to disprove he was the leaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have said for a bit now that I am not sold on the murder mystery elements of this story though. It sounds like a good plot, but there isn't anything I find substantial enough to convince me.

       One sides dumps a bunch WashPo and NYT articles and fills the comments with cheerleading and complaints about this sub. The other side posts a ton of self posts, 4chan snapshots, and 30 second clips from MSM that serves their narrative.

       But there is one thing glaringly absent from our analysis of the Seth Rich situation. Despite the large number of low-effort submissions around, I have yet to see the one that says:

       Republicans HAve Majorities in Both Houses, but They Refuse to Investigate Seth Rich

       Written by Mary Rich and Joel Rich on May 23rd:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still, conservative news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that Seth’s personal email and his personal computer were both inspected by detectives early in the investigation and that the inspection revealed no evidence of any communications with anyone at WikiLeaks or anyone associated with WikiLeaks. Nor did that inspection reveal any evidence that Seth had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or to anyone else. Indeed, those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect — Seth’s job was to develop analytical models to encourage voters to turn out to vote. He didn’t have access to DNC emails, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emails, John Podesta’s emails or Hillary Clinton’s emails. That simply wasn’t his job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.

       Why would they know their grown sons access levels in the DNCs network?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if  they were told all this, which sounds like a really odd  detail to share with the family of a grown man who has an on going murder investigation, that presumes he didn't have access through an 'alternative' means. Some networks have EXTREMELY lax security on their internal network, and from what the FBI has said this was the case with the DNCs.

       The fact that this story is making the front page of the conspiracy sub and the Trump/Russia scandals are considered a "diversion" is pretty funny.  I mean, you'd think the conspiracy sub would recognize such a blatantly partisan smear campaign.  In looking at the comments at least it seems like there are quite a few people who aren't falling for it.

        Wheeler had been recommended to Rich's family by financial adviser and Fox News contributor Ed Butowsky. On Tuesday, the conservative businessman and occasional Breitbart News contributor outright lied about his involvement in Wheeler's investigation.
       </p>

        Butowsky admitted later to CNN that he was indeed involved in setting up the Rich's with Wheeler.

       The fact remains that Seth Rich was murdered and those who did it are on the loose.  The suspicious part is that nobody but Wikileaks seem to be interested in finding out who did it and why.

       I've been on this one too Joe. Reclaim New York not only featured Bannon but it currently directed by the Mercer sisters, and if you believe the claims of Mercer colleagues in Jane Mayer's New Yorker piece on Mercer, he fully buys into the "Clinton Kill List." This was an engineered propaganda event from start to finish.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Still, conservative news outlets and commentators continue, day after painful day, to peddle discredited conspiracy theories that Seth was killed after having provided WikiLeaks with emails from the DNC. Those theories, which some reporters have since retracted, are baseless, and they are unspeakably cruel.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that Seth’s personal email and his personal computer were both inspected by detectives early in the investigation and that the inspection revealed no evidence of any communications with anyone at WikiLeaks or anyone associated with WikiLeaks. Nor did that inspection reveal any evidence that Seth had leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks or to anyone else. Indeed, those who have suggested that Seth’s role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect — Seth’s job was to develop analytical models to encourage voters to turn out to vote. He didn’t have access to DNC emails, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee emails, John Podesta’s emails or Hillary Clinton’s emails. That simply wasn’t his job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these facts, our family’s nightmare persists. Seth’s death has been turned into a political football. Every day we wake up to new headlines, new lies, new factual errors, new people approaching us to take advantage of us and Seth’s legacy. It just won’t stop. The amount of pain and anguish this has caused us is unbearable. With every conspiratorial flare-up, we are forced to relive Seth’s murder and a small piece of us dies as more of Seth’s memory is torn away from us.
