    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t ya think that all these political philosophies such republicans, liberals, authoritarian, democratic, conservative etc are again just little groups people identify as, regardless of whether the values seem good or not they are two sides of the same coin. People squabbling over who&#39;s right and who&#39;s not, it&#39;s always the same. It&#39;s never gonna work and will always lead to same result. Until we start thinking for ourselves and stop supporting all these bullshit ideologies whether political or religious, nothing will change. </p>

<p>Its &quot;i cant figure out that putting people into camps &amp; keep the poor starved and stupid is evil so i just equate all political philosophies equally as a intellectual cop out despite some sides being argued by evidence and others by feelings of hate and lies paid for by the rich and powerful&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They kinda are though in a way because they wonder why terrorists would do such an evil act? Not that I condone these attacks but come on, they don&#39;t just do this for no fucking reason. I expected this reaction, I just don&#39;t see how it helps. We are all humans regardless of what we do each other so we are all responsible for everyone. Calling a terrorist just an evil man wanting to kill people is making the issue worse. It may be a reaction to how fucked up society is, like I doubt it&#39;s a coincidence that the attack was at an Ariana grande concert. A celebrity who looks like a 16 year old and is a role model to millions of young teenage girls and she&#39;s singing lyrics like &quot;I didn&#39;t know I was hungry until I tasted you&quot;. I hate how fucked western society is but I&#39;m not a crazy bastard who&#39;s gonna kill children but these people exist and they will do this fucked up shit if provoked as a desperate but futile attempt to change things especially when mixed with a concoction of extremist Islam. So gathering around and cuddling is just making the issue worse because your ignoring the root issue which is western society itself. Oh but that makes me a terrorist sympathiser with lack of empathy right... </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>thats like saying george washington and hitler are the same because they are both politicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s like saying that George Washington was okay with racism and Hitler loved his dog. Human beings, even human beings that we&#39;ve encrusted in layers of dogma, are still just human beings. Specific political movements are much more interesting that politics-as-sports dualities.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take an example. Health care... I&#39;m a classical conservative. I support the idea of universal health care in the US. Why? Because, as a classical conservative, I look back a generation or two and I focus on what worked well and what worked poorly, and adjust the present to reflect that reality, rather than trying to press new ideas into place, untried or make changes only to serve some special interest or simply avoid any change. When I look at the fact that <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">the US has spent more money, per capita, than most other developed nations</a> (prior to the ACA) to get a lower quantity and quality of coverage, I have to conclude that we&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>So, because I agree with a &quot;liberal&quot; policy, am I a liberal? No. I&#39;m a conservative who isn&#39;t afraid to back a change that so-called &quot;conservatives&quot; are unable to admit simply works well. Labels mean nothing. Working policy means everything.</p>

<p>Those are labels that you&#39;ve been taught to see as real things. There is no RNC or DNC. There are no liberals or conservatives.</p>

<p>There is liberal ideology and there is conservative ideology, but I&#39;ve never met anyone who perfectly embodied one or the other. We are people and if we become focused on dualistic dichotomies, then we have a tendency to ignore everything that doesn&#39;t fit that view. We blind ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people have no idea of the power structure on this planet it makes me laugh :)</p>

<p>to fill you in on some of it as it is very complicated i need to go back to the days on Noah in the bible , he had sons , they had the right to rule .. well there wernt many of them huh ?</p>

<p>so as time went by and more and more people came into being , tribes for4med but the right to rule was still dominant to one bloodline . </p>

<p>this bloodline gave birth to a sub bloodline and gave it to the right to COMMAND ( what most think of as the real ruling elite) .. they arnt .. the real rulers are unknown to the world .. but not to the ruling elite .. lets call them the ruling elite to make things simple ..</p>

<p>so the real ruling bloodline gave the right to command to one of the other bloodlines of Noah and in return they paid with the need for nothing ..</p>

<p>what this means is the ruling elite get to set the world up as  a theater ..</p>

<p>money was their invention and to those under their command they did not have the right to take what they wanted from the earth . they had to give back ..</p>

<p>hope this is making sense .. lets go on .</p>

<p>the need for nothing is simple , this bloodline is given everything and anything they ask for because they own the world , they laid claim to it via Noah , the first man to rule after the great flood .. so what this means is ..</p>

<p>what we think of the world is just something this bloodlines lets another do in return of anything they ask for .. this very small bloodline is hidden from the world , but ask the queen who gave her bloodline the right to rule and you get a little white lie or half truth, they say god . truth is , yes god gave Noah the right to rule and they in turn gave another lineage the right to command .. you will hear of the queen of England having the right to command .. keep track of this ..</p>

<p>the masons , Jesuits , Illuminati , rosy cross are not the rulers of anything , they are part of the theater of life created from this right to command </p>

<p>the world is to big for one man to be producer of this great show and the stage has many producers all creating a show of their own . those you think are pulling the strings of in the theater of war are only people given the right to command .</p>

<p>so why would those with the right to rule let those with the right to command do this to their planet ? simple .. they get what ever they ask for..</p>

<p>never needing to pay for food , housing .. you name it the people at the top of the right to command bloodline gave it with a big smile on their face .. wouldnt you ? i mean whats a Ferrari or Lamborghini to these people who make 3 billion a year   .</p>

<p>the world is an interesting place , there is power and titles all over the place that are owned by the most unsurprising ordinary people :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What your saying makes sense in the whole stage thing and the producers of the great show. Shakespeare said &quot;life is but a stage and we are all players&quot; or something like that. And it does make sense with there being not one ruling &quot;leader&quot; behind the scenes. </p>

<p>However, I seriously question this whole &quot;god gave Noah power&quot; and &quot;the great flood&quot; sounds a lot like biblical bullshit to me mate</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sounded like BS to me when i was told it until i started finding out all over this planet every culture has a story of a deluge or flood . and if we are to believe something or someone came from the sky ( heavens ) and this person or persons are responsible for the creation or manipulation of somethings DNA for man to come into being then who or what ever this was gave the only humans to survive the right to rule .</p>

<p>i have a hard time wrapping my head around the Darwin thing as there is no proof of a missing link beyond the texts that state there was an animal type creature that walked on 2 feet and suddenly had this massive leap in evolution and suddenly man appeared.</p>

<p>if we are to look at what we find in texts and from archeology we find both evolution and creation co exist  .</p>

<p>firstly evolution , the monkey man thing that we are meant to have came from . what did it evolve from ? how long did evolution take ? </p>

<p>say we got to the point of being no more than a monkey and evolution happened again and suddenly Neanderthal man appareled..</p>

<p>the missing link from   Neanderthal to modern human must have came from out side interference by something early man called &quot;God&quot; . if we are to believe this then those who claim to be the owners of the planet were given the right to rule over all other people then who am i to argue . if they came from another planet or dimension they have power i can not fight  against so there for they can give power to anyone they want i have no beef with them ..</p>

<p>but what if all the UFO sightings near nuclear silos are the &quot;gods&quot; of early man here watching us and shitting them selves thinking &quot;crap they back engendered one of our craft and are now building bombs that can destroy us , it is only a matter of time before they discover what we have done and where we are&quot;  </p>

<p>do those with the right to rule lost control over those with the right to command ? is there a power struggle going on ? is it a rebellion we do not know about ? are we already at war with ET ? </p>

<p>when hacker gary mckinnon found information on a nasa computer revealing earth already has a space fleet that is controlled by the navy , did he stumble upon a fleet of craft being prepared to go combat ET by dropping nukes on their world ?</p>

<p>my own view of this world is no one is in control , there are gangs fighting for power , wealth , land  , knowledge and doing a better job of it than any one sitting on reddit is doing ..</p>
