       Embarrassing story for the GOP on the surface but dig a little deeper and the motive for this body slam and punch combo becomes clear.

       <p>
        At that point,
        <strong>
         Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck
        </strong>
        with both hands and
        <strong>
         slammed him into the ground behind him
        </strong>
        . Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as
        <strong>
         Gianforte then began punching the man
        </strong>
        , as he moved on top the reporter and began yelling something to the effect of "I'm sick and tired of this!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jacobs scrambled to his knees and said something about his
        <strong>
         glasses being broken
        </strong>
        . He asked Faith, Keith and myself for our names. In shock, we did not answer. He then said he wanted the police called and went to leave. Gianforte looked at the three of us and repeatedly apologized. At that point, I told him and Scanlon, who was now present, that we needed a moment. The men then left.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To be clear,
        <strong>
         at no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression
        </strong>
        toward Gianforte, who left the area after giving statements to local sheriff's deputies.

        </strong>
        It is not clear if charges will be filed against Gianforte at this time.

        This reporter broke a story just a few weeks ago about Gianforte. He has about $250k invested in sanctioned Russian companies.

       When was the last time you saw anything that implicated the russians or the chinese in this sub that wasn't super old and basically confirmed? Everything has to be "CIA" or its CIA propaganda despite the fact that Putin is ex KGB and the KGB never really fell apart everyone just pretends they are harmless because the soviet unit fell apart thus the KGB must be defanged despite any contrary evidence. And nobody ever even thinks about the chinese.

       As much as I believe the CIA has committed terrible crimes they are a useful tool for people on the right, far right and Russian trolls to deflect any criticism of conservative actors whilst also being used to smear anyone on the left. (wapo = cia etc etc ad nauseum).

       That's not a personal attack at all though. All evidence (lets say his last 27 days of posting) points to a specific agenda that the commenter is pushing. He attacks me as being a low energy poster when that has zero to do with anything. He was called out and decided to come after me for that.

       Apparently the Sheriff
       <a href="https://twitter.com/reidepstein/status/867569873727221760/photo/1">
        donated to Gianforte's campaign
       </a>
       , which could mean nothing but is kind of interesting nonetheless. I'm not American so I don't know how your legal system works but I would have assumed a suspect would be held or arrested after an assault? Or is it just determined later in court because it's a misdemeanour?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the statement from Gianforte's campaign is funny because they literally blame "aggressive liberal media" when the Fox News account says Jacobs didn't show any signs of aggression.
