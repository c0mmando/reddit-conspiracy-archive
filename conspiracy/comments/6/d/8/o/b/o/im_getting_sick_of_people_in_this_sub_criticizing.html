Any fake account t worth half a shit has a handful of threads and comments in other benile subreddits before blasting their narrative.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m against the office if the presidency and the entire republic (empire)... Where it&#39;s the well educated drone king clown or the orange faced reality TV star clown or the 40-some clowns before... The system is corrupted so it doesn&#39;t matter who the puppet is... He is playing g the game just like they all do...  Let stop pretending there are 2 parties... Let&#39;s stop pretending we are represented... And let&#39;s stop pretending patriotism and nationalism are the same thing.... It&#39;s very small minded to judge the Donald while ignoring the terror state of Amerikkka.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t unpatriotic to criticize any politician, and you can be sure they&#39;re all corrupt.  It&#39;s unpatiotic to try to stifle people&#39;s free expression.</p>

<p>Every time a new president is &quot;elected&quot; some people without life experience or those with unrealistic ideals think <em>this</em> time we&#39;re getting a president who&#39;ll actually consider the US and its citizens important enough to actually serve us and the nation.  It never happens and it never will.  Remember all the starry-eyed optimism people had when Obama got into the White House?  How&#39;d that turn out?  Believe this: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and so on are just slightly different facets of the same evil. It only gets more bleak the further you delve into it. Everyone!  Pay attention to what&#39;s going on in nature here in the US and elsewhere.  We are being attacked by a subtle from of warfare intended to make our land unfit for life as we know it.  The same psychopaths who are doing this control our politicians through bribery, blackmail and threats against their opponents live and the lives of their families. These entities are superstitious and determined to make their false narrative &quot;truth&quot; even if it means the destruction of life on earth-- oh wait, that&#39;s part of their fairytale.  Sorry for the rant.</p>
