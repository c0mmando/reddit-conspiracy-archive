       I don't get the unilateral Trump bashing but with that said no politician should be above criticism especially the President. Its very important to pay close scrutiny to his actions and call out any bullshit you see. Its definitely not unpatriotic to criticize him. Still a lot of the crap he gets is undeserved( two scoops of ice cream, calling him racist, etc)

       hahaha right because i upvoted russian conspiracies its not like they actually exist despite all the evidence in the thread. , sure bud thats why i regularly post
       <a href="/r/new_zealand">
        /r/new_zealand
       </a>
       to pretend im one of them because the infiltration of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       is that important you are a joke. Infact thats why if you google varoksa you will get a NZ streamer! im that dedicated!

       Yeah but wouldnt they get the message that you aren't a shill the first time?  Doesn't copying and pasting the same shit in all these threads obviously make it look like y'all are muckrakers?  I don't think you are going to change his mind.  And I don't think anyone cares about your other posting habits.  Any fake account t worth half a shit has a handful of threads and comments in other benile subreddits before blasting their narrative.  I'm not saying you are a shill, but I'm saying you aren't doing a good job defending against these accusations.

       i am if you actually google my name like mentioned but that would require checking evidence on this sub so unlikely i guess... and see that its the username i use for literally everything from youtube twitch to literature forums. And its not for him its for people who may actually believe the moron and considering hes copy &amp; pasting in every thread they will see his too and thus no net loss.

       actually thinking about it people are that stupid they would go "oh copy paste response to the copy paste response must be a shill" because its in vogue these days to delegitimize and opposition to trump online as shill and they just want to confirm their bias.

       You gotta understand that shilling has become a huge problem here, and often from the left.  Right wing shills def exist but I imagine they target other subs than this one.

       no the narrative of the sub is that shilling comes from the left the only actual concrete proof of shills is a russian interview with paid shills &amp; chinese army online shill buildings, the only example of shilling on this sub that has been caught was a The_donald mod being caught forgetting to switch to his fake concern troll account so he ended up arguing with himself.

       Unless this is sarcasm I truly don't understand what you're saying. Voicing one's grievances is a cornerstone of American patriotism. People died so US citizens could have the ability to move and speak freely. Restriction of sentiment and speech is unpatriotic when discussing America.

       Yes, there is a disproportionate amount of shit being flung in his direction, but has this place ever been anything but critical of the Executive? People come here to scrutinize; the seat of the President will never be out of the purview of r/conspiracy users.

       I'm against the office if the presidency and the entire republic (empire)... Where it's the well educated drone king clown or the orange faced reality TV star clown or the 40-some clowns before... The system is corrupted so it doesn't matter who the puppet is... He is playing g the game just like they all do...  Let stop pretending there are 2 parties... Let's stop pretending we are represented... And let's stop pretending patriotism and nationalism are the same thing.... It's very small minded to judge the Donald while ignoring the terror state of Amerikkka.

       It isn't unpatriotic to criticize any politician, and you can be sure they're all corrupt.  It's unpatiotic to try to stifle people's free expression.

      <p>
       Every time a new president is "elected" some people without life experience or those with unrealistic ideals think
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       time we're getting a president who'll actually consider the US and its citizens important enough to actually serve us and the nation.  It never happens and it never will.  Remember all the starry-eyed optimism people had when Obama got into the White House?  How'd that turn out?  Believe this: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, and so on are just slightly different facets of the same evil. It only gets more bleak the further you delve into it. Everyone!  Pay attention to what's going on in nature here in the US and elsewhere.  We are being attacked by a subtle from of warfare intended to make our land unfit for life as we know it.  The same psychopaths who are doing this control our politicians through bribery, blackmail and threats against their opponents live and the lives of their families. These entities are superstitious and determined to make their false narrative "truth" even if it means the destruction of life on earth-- oh wait, that's part of their fairytale.  Sorry for the rant.
