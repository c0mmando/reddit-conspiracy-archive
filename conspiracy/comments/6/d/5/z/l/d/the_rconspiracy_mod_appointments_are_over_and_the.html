       I'm pretty sure they'd just toss out Orangutan cause he's not really a person is he? I thought he was just kind of a link spamming bot... prolific doesn't equal popular. It would be sketchy if he made it as a mod, cause he comes off as "fake" to me... I agree with the other mod choices... except that Justin guy... cause I've honestly never heard of that dude in my life... at least all the other ones I recognize and respect... although Shell might just be easy to spot cause of the flair.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they did a good job with the choices... but they really shouldn't have claimed that in the end it was science and math that lead to the new mods... should have been like the last round of newbies... the mods are totally within their rights to be like "These are the ones we chose cause they are the ones we wanted."

       Eh... I never see him comment... but I see him drop a dozen or so links a day of various quality levels... but I'm not really a frontpage kinda guy... I'm generally in the late night  new queue... that frontpage is a clusterfuck of idiots and outsiders... too much noise not enough signal for me.

       This sub is like a microcosm of the real world... we can all pretend that our votes matter... but in the end it's the ones in control that get to decide our fates... and they don't always agree with what the masses desire.

       Hey... don't be pickin' on my punctuation. You would have been one of my top choices... but yer a little delusional if you think your opinion outweighs the opinions of the people in power...

       I'm not defending it... I'm just explaining it to you... maybe you don't deserve to be a mod here if you are self centered enough to think you are the only thing that could have stood up and saved this sub... and without it the entire community will be destroyed. Too emotional... yeah it sucks that they pretended that it would be democratic and got your hopes up... but this little outburst of yours might just disqualify your candidacy when the next round of mod noms comes about.

       Just because they have a set of rules does not make those rules good or moral, this is the distinction you seem to be having trouble with.

       But seriously, learn how to properly use a period vs an ellipsis, your text is very hard to read.

       Whatever... yer like the only one butthurt about stuff to ever complain about my punctuation... I rescind my support of you for the mod position... too emotional. The mods were pulling a Willy Wonka on you and you just sold out to Slugworth. You could have kept yer cool and ended up a mod, but this little hissy fit doesn't reflect well on your stability.

       Yeah... this poor community. I see all those other topic complaining about how you didn't get the job... and I see all the throngs of people pouring into this topic to express their outrage at your unfair treatment... oh wait... none of that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       IT just shows that you'd make a shitty mod if you cannot be impartial and enforce the rules as they are written... because that if the job of a moderator. The rules are what is important, not how someone feels about the rules.

       Blabbering about the rules in an inflammatory topic isn't the best way to address the rules... especially since you haven't really quantified any specific grievances or remedies... it just comes across as childish venting due to a perceived slight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you honestly thought you'd end up as a mod... but I really doubt that is ever gonna happen now that you've done this horseshit... you would have been a shoo-in for the next round... but now... I dunno. The squeaky wheel doesn't always get the oil.

       Honestly, you really would make a terrible mod. Your ego is inflated and have delusions of grandeur. I truly hope more see this post and your comments within to others about how you are the only one who can save this community. That's some next level ego, son.

       Again, as I've said several times, I don't care that I lost, I'm more upset the wishes of the community are being overwritten by the mod team, when there was questions that the mod team was the source of the issues in the first place.

       The absolute last thing you want to do, if you're picking a mod is to base it merely on votes. You not knowing this, is 50% proof of shenanigans on your part in trying to get to be a mod here and 50% proof that you do not have what it takes

       Reddit has been in a slow decay for about 4 years now. The moderator infiltration toward a certain agenda just keeps spreading, ever so slowly. It's almost a shame it doesn't collapse all at once like digg did when their admins sold out to advertisers, but the compartmentalization of the subreddit system allows it to linger on, for better or worse. That's why I made my own sub, so I can at least control the moderation. If the reddit admins step in to shut it down, then that's a whole new thing, but I think that sort of thing has subtly happened before (by the admins forcing mod appointments through various methods).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad to watch, but it's also upsetting how slow and subtle it has been, because it means that many people haven't noticed because it's so compartmentalized and gradual.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly pretty frustrating to watch, and that's why I decided to actually run for a mod position.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what happened as a result indicates to me that the spread of controlled moderators is not going to be stopped. It's a long-term strategy to take over a website that is seen by millions, and then I wouldn't be surprised if reddit admins are paid to turn a blind eye to this.

       Why the fuck do you have to bring me into this (ie. single my vote out)? I voted for Justin because I thought he'd make a great mod (addition) here based on plenty of discussions we've had over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a straight up democratic vote doesn't work here on reddit because of bots, shills, and trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call me suspect, yet I was not the one who sought power (like you did), nor do I have a massive desire to be a mod here, because it may ultimately hinder/censor my free speech here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, leave me the fuck out of this. I'm not a mod.

       Dog will eat you too if it doesn't have food and you're dead, so that's not really a great basis of comparison:

       I honestly think it'd be about even, I think it has more to do with the bond between the animal and the owner. I think abusive owners are more likely to get cats than dogs, because cats are low maintenance and abusers are usually lazy

       You are a valued member of this community. I'd rather not see you get caught up in subreddit drama. Being that you were one of the users nominated it may appear that your post is an intentional ploy to "exact revenge" for being overlooked. I really hope that's not the case here.

       Celine suggested you contact the mods for any follow up questions. You should have done that before creating this post.

       I'm saying that perhaps the rules don't make sense, and perhaps the fact the wishes of the community were undercut by the moderator team was not a good thing. It's simply an opinion. Spinning this as me "exacting revenge" is very over-dramatic, I'm simply laying out what happened to me so people in the sub can see what goes on in the background. What's with the desire for all the secrecy?

       Just because they have a set of rules does not make those rules good or moral, this is the distinction you seem to be having trouble with.

       But seriously, learn how to properly use a period vs an ellipsis, your text is very hard to read.
