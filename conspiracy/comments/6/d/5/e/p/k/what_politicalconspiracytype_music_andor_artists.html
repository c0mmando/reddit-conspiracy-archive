       I thought this would be an interesting topic to cover.  When George W Bush was "elected" in 2000, I was only 16 and couldn't be less interested in global politics and elections and presidents and politics in general other than its basic historical relevance (I've always been into history).  That came at a time in my life when I was heavily getting into punk rock and hardcore and the subculture's history, listening to heavily political, populist-oriented and socially-conscious lyrics from bands like Bad Religion, Propagandhi, Strung Out, Black Flag, Good Riddance, and NOFX.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through those bands and their interviews I learned about writers and journalists like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Michael Parenti, Greg Palast, and was fully redpilled into political action and conspiracy by not only Bush's blatant theft of the 2000 election, but largely from the multimedia section of Propagandhi's
       <em>
        Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes
       </em>
       CD that had a huge excerpt of William Blum's seminal works
       <em>
        Killing Hope
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Rogue State
       </em>
       , two books that I think every single person should read if they want to understand just what the United States Military has been up to the past 60 to 70 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, I never would have heard of any of this or dived down the rabbit holes that I did if it hadn't been for the music that inspired me to look into alternative thinking and the questioning of authority that came part and parcel with punk rock/hardcore.  Anyone else have a similar story?  In what ways did music or art inspire you to "wake up" to the realities of the world we live in?

       Mos Def's The Rape Over (which was taken off his album unknowingly) introduced my to "the tall Israeli runnin this rap shit" AKA Lyor Cohen who owns 300 entertainment that manages Young Thug, Migos, and many other terribly influential artists that are pushing gun violence, racism, and drug use.
      </p>
      <p>
       He managed the beastie boys (almost all Jewish), Run DMC, Public Enemy, Will Smith, Jay Z, Kanye, etc. He's the most influential man in hip hop and he has destroyed the genre as you can see today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look up Lyor Cohen on Youtube and you can see he's an asshat

       I don't even know how I stumbled upon Immortal Technique, but he has a few woke songs. You can add El-P and his other project Run The Jewels to the mix too. The more I know the more underground woke rap I find. As a younger teen I was heavy into Dead Kennedys, but most of the messages flew over my head.

       I'm a firefighter that watched the towers go down while at work. We watched in silent horror for days, never even thinking once that our own "leaders" could be behind it. The somber realization of it being a false flag shook me to my roots, and nothing has been the same for me since.

       Dead Kennedys and Public Enemy got me at a very young age... I guess thats why I'm not really phased by any of the weirdness that crops up in politics now... Almost every single Dead Kennedys track is related to governmental corruption is one way or another... Only group I know of that mentions the Trilateral Commission...

       <br/>
       War is coming back in style
       <br/>
       There's generals here, advisers there
       <br/>
       And Russians nibbling everywhere
       <br/>
       The chessboard's filling up with red
       <br/>
       We make more profits when we blow off their heads
       <br/>
       Economy is looking bad, Let's start another war (when ya get drafted!)
       <br/>
       Fan the fires of racist hatred, we want total war (when ya get drafted!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Drooling fingers, panic buttons
       <br/>
       Playing with missiles like they're toys
       <br/>
       There's easy money, easy jobs
       <br/>
       Especially when you build the bombs
       <br/>
       That blow big cities off the map
       <br/>
       Just guess who profits when we build 'em back up
       <br/>
       Yeah, what Big Business wants Big Business gets, it wants a war (when ya get drafted!)
       <br/>
       Trilateral Commission goonies laugh and scheme for more (when ya get drafted!)
       <br/>
       Call the Army, call the Navy, stocked with kids from slums (when ya get drafted!)
       <br/>
       If you can't afford a slick attorney we might make you a spy
       <br/>
       Forget your demonstrations, kids today sit on their ass (when ya get drafted!)
       <br/>
       Just a six-pack and you're happy we're prepared for when ya get drafted
       <br/>
       When ya get drafted!

       <em>
        Frankenchrist

       in general was a masterpiece.

       Yeah... Frankenchrist is prolly my favorite... or Fresh Fruit... both are really good... but Frankenchrist is a bit more polished and well mastered... but Jesus... Fresh Fruit was recorded in 1979... Daaaaaaaamn that was a long time ago.

       Fresh Fruit is almost definitely their best overall, but I love the experimentation on Frankenchrist.  My favorite old school hardcore band and record will always be Bad Brains and the ROIR / self-titled though 😉

       Yeah... I think it was something like a 12 string electric bellzouki that gave Frankenchrist it's unique sound... plus the fact that the band had been together long enough to actually learn how to play music pretty well... they were rough and raw in the beginning.

       Check out Die Antwoord. They're occult as shit, but I'm like 50% sure it's satire. It's either satire or they're not hiding at all. Crazy shit, dope beats, fun as hell. Awesome videos too. Packed with occultism. Especially Pitbull Terrier.

       i was 16 in 1986. i can't remeber a time i wasn't politically minded, nor any of my friends, just unmotivated action wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       people completely misunderstand and mischaracterize genX. i don't think there was ever a more informed, politically minded generation, esp before internet made it easy, but we just saw it all as futile. we'd been told we were going to die any day now from the day we were born, first under a mushroom cloud or via a child molester, then by AIDS. we were born during watergate, watched iraq-contra in junior high, drugs for guns in the college.  we raised ourselves and parented our infantile parents, you can't do that without being aware about what is going on. also, i think growing up in the most tense decade of the cold war makes everything about the govt, and in our case, how fucking stupid and dangerous the govt was.

       if you aren't genX you prob won't see why because the effects are all hokey looking by today's standards--but bear in mind, unlike millenial apocalyptic fare, no one survives and it was a very real scenario that could happen any day, and in fact came closer to ever happening just a week before the show aired on thanksgiving with the ABLE ARCHER clusterfuck. i was 11.

      </p>
      <p>
       and the new press of houston, a tiny, free newspaper that educated me on things like how we assinated allende and installed pinochet and created death squads. this woke every punk in the inner loop.

       Idk if you listen to rap/hardcore hip hop- but I'll name three heavy conspiracy artists.  1.VINNIE PAZ!!!! Of Jedi mind tricks, heavy metal kings(&lt;-amazing) and self titled solo albums. 2 ILL BILL of heavy metal kings (&lt;- again, amazing album) self titled solo albums and 3.imortal teqnique (probably mentioned in this thread somewhere) I didn't read any comments, just came to drop these on you.   VINNIE paz's older work is heavily influenced by conspiracy/powers that be themes.
