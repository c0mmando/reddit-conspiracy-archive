    <div class="md"><p>The JFK tape isn&#39;t from 3 feet away from people attending the parade, first of all, secondly, I can&#39;t tell if this is being used as &quot;proof he was there&quot; or a photo to identify what he may look like. Did you get this from the news and if so can I see the article? There&#39;s a huge difference in context. If this is for ID purposes, I agree with covering the faces of other people. If this is being claimed as proof he was there, obviously this isn&#39;t sufficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really being used as proof of him being there or just an identifying photo of who supposedly did it? I can&#39;t tell because OP provided no context as to where he got this. There&#39;s a bit of a difference in what I would consider logical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Investigations into a group of people being private whilst the investigation is on going is not an issue.  It really is a matter of national security.</p>

<p>Honestly, anything could have been revealed by those images that the police weren&#39;t aware of yet.  If police are asking for information on him, it surely makes sense to keep what they know private, so they can corroborate stories and testimonies.  If this picture revealed him to be in McDonalds, they don&#39;t need 50 people calling up to say &quot;I saw him in McDonalds on King Street.  He seemed shifty.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see plenty of footage in the coming months and years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe it was a terror attack but there&#39;s a lot of questions around all of this. It was barely reported for the first hour after it happened, then it was being reported that a gas balloon had exploded (someone from my town was there they claimed there was enormous balloons and that one had exploded. Then eventually, maybe 3hours later, it was deemed a suspected a terror attack. Quickly after momentum gained. </p>

<p>As I said I do think it was probably a genuine attack, and I do understand that information in these instances is always going to take a lot of time to come to light but at the time so little was actually revealed for HOURS and then all of a sudden hours later 22 people were dead and this photo is ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree it was a terror account but like I said I know someone who was there who still believes it was one of the giant balloons, he&#39;s obviously mistaken ofcourse but the whole point of a conspiracy sub is surely to at least be aware of all accounts of events and the things surrounding them (hence this topic about a blacked out photo) so I figured I&#39;d mention it :)</p>
