       Dear People,
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how to start or what even to say but there is so much on my mind. 
We life our lives and some of us are awakening and see that something is wrong.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Right now, I love to see that there is a Disclosure Movement going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We totally need to understand that even if we don't believe in ALIENS then we should believe in HUMANS and our potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have technology that could change the world. 
Why aren't we using it!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, simply because some our dear people can't give up the idea of earning insane amounts of money.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Please watch "UNACKNOWLEDGED" by Dr. Greer to find out more.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       But what I wanna ask and bring to your attention is another conspiracy that is connected to this one.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So let me get one thing straight. I hate religion, I think it is splitting the world apart and teaching wrong things. I never believed in GOD, no matter what religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lately I start to see things different.
      </p>
      <p>
       First when I saw some videos of Dr.Erich van DÃ¤niken I noticed one thing: 
*Why are we seeing on one hand BUDDHA as a real Person that lived and that we only should behave like him and not follow radical his "rules".
*But on the other hand any other "god" we see as Imagination that might be in our hearts but not in real life.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I started to believe that maybe, all those ancient texts are real and they are describing a historical events.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look for example this guy:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0OOYtAfcFs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0OOYtAfcFs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He found out that archaeologists found in India a City that might be from the Hindu God Vishnu and might be older than 3000BC but all efforts were stopped by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in Egypt there are proves that show us another point of view on the texts and their gods but the government is refusing to let people look into it and even makes fun of them and undermine the credibility.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       *Why would it be good to make people believe that our civilization is only 2000 years old if it is maybe much older.?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Why don't investigate the past of the humans and why not look behind the ancient texts?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Why would it be bad if we would find out that Mankind lived 30.000 BC in a big civilization.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       All ancient texts speak about:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        WAR between some of the leaders.
       </li>
       <li>
        A big Flood
       </li>
       <li>
        Flying Objects
       </li>
       <li>
        Harnessing Solar energy
       </li>
       <li>
        THE Return of the GODs
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Is the world government trying to hide something really important for us? 
Is "GOD" really dead or are we just ignorant to see our past in a way that is beyond our understanding.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There is so much to talk about and this is just a quick overview of some of my thoughts.
What are you think !? HOW CAN WE BRING THIS INTO THE MASS THINKING OF MANKIND?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       In my Opinion there are several THEORIES connected to each other.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Quantum Physics
       </li>
       <li>
        Intelligent Cells
       </li>
       <li>
        Ancient Civilizations
       </li>
       <li>
        Extraterrestrial Life
       </li>
       <li>
        Zero Point Energy
       </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       P.S.:
      </p>
      <p>
       One more thing, NASA and People that are asked if there is ALIEN life out there, mostly answer with the phrase "We are not in contact with ALIENS".
      </p>
      <p>
       If those Lifeforms are originated from planet EARTH than they are no ALIENS.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that NASA, in theory, is speaking the truth.

       Seems like some of those most fascinating discoveries from ancient history were from cultures that were in touch spiritually, and that doesn't meant religion. And unfortunately those civilizations and cultures were eventually brought to an end by a government or foreign invaders.

       No sadly those civilizations end because they passed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They went somewhere and said "wait we will come back"
      </p>
      <p>
       But when they left the only ones left were stupid and ignorant people that are not open minded.
Sadly they started to see they roots as imaginations and metaphors instead of truly believing them

       There appear to be 21 comments on this thread but only 20 are showing up (at least for me). This is typically an indication that someone has been shadowbanned. They can see their own comment, but it does not actually appear to others on the thread. I am no expert on this, so please take it for what it's worth.

       Melchizedek's are mentioned in the Urantia Book. According to it, they are emergency sons of God. We had one sent here apparently, who went by the name of Prince of Salem.

       I think 'something' did happen in the past &amp; had happened more than once, maybe a reason that mankind "goes 2 steps forward", then
       <em>
        something happens
       </em>
       &amp; it goes 3 steps back. As if all the knowledge was lost. There seems to be a pattern that we are just know aware.

       Religion might be also just a kind of knowledge that needed to be educated to the following generations and in some point it got this crazy mafia like institution.

       A lot of why we don't know about our past history is because of religion. Religion was created as a means to divide and control people. I grew up in a very religious family and as I got older I had more questions. Why is everyone telling me that my religion is the right one when there are so many other religions?  My truth is that none are right and living a good life and treating others with the same respect you expect is the only way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people found out the truth of our history that would destroy their core belief systems and throw the world into chaos. Think of Catholics, mionions of members right?  What imwould happen if they all found out that the God they worship doesn't exist and that Jesus was an annual extraterrestrial?  Chaos.

       Why are you thinking that? Are you really believe that less in Humans? 
Why would people go crazy and throw everything into chaos just because they would knew that their religion and their roots are actually true and there is a "god" just not like we always imagined him.

       I think there would be definitely a group radical people (that we have now anyway) that wouldnt accept the truth but everyone else would just simply live their lives with this information

       If you delve deeper into the history of human kind (which is a matter of belief) then you'd discover that humans were created not by the God you imagine but an extraterrestrial race that was viewed as "gods."  The Annunaki created humans, it was detailed in the Sumerian tablets that they created humans as a slave race to mine gold.  Whether you believe that or not is your choice but when people realize that the God of the bible isn't a God at all then chaos would ensue. People wouldn't know what to believe in when the only belief system that matters is love and compassion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say chaos I mean a coflict of dogma on an individual level. Yes people would go on living their lives and some wouldn't accept that as fact. Once people realize that their history they grew up believing is wrong then the reason why religion was created in the first place, as a means of division and control, then people will wake up and true enlightenment will happen.

       Those tenets stand as moral markers for any of mankind, however look deeper into why there is religion in the first place. As a means to control the masses with absolution. Look at the crusades, the Christians believed Jerusalem belonged to the Christians and so they killed thousands of Muslims in the name of the Lord and vice versa.  A devout religious person does not question the direction of the church, mosque, temple, etc.. So they rule by absolution and separation from the rest of humanity. My belief is if the world is to unite as one humanity religion does not need to exist, then there can truly be love between people free of judgement.
