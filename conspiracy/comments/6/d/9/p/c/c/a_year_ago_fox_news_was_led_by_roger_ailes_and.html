<p>The execs at FOX News had a lot of the same goals as the globalist NWO. TPP, open borders, etc. and feel like their current lineup and approach makes it a lot harder to get those agendas passed. </p>

<p>There has definitely been a MASSIVE shift in management and programming over the last year though. </p>

<p>I am not a MASSIVE fan of FoxNews or anything, but I think they need some REAL competition. They monopolize the mainstream conservative audience, and there isn&#39;t anywhere else for people to go other than fringy websites.</p>

<p>Fox News&#39; entire business model was built around being the mouthpiece of the opposition party. The network makes money by making Republicans angry about how Democrats are supposedly screwing everything up for them.</p>

<p>Well, now Democrats aren&#39;t in power. It&#39;s <em>all</em> Republicans. Who is Fox News supposed to aim at, now?</p>

<p>The worst thing that happened to Fox was Trump winning the election.</p>

There is no better way to manipulate Trump than to control FOX. And chances are he&#39;ll never catch on.

    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive dissonance is amazing to me. No less than a month ago, the story broke that the NTY, Washington Post, Twitter and a whole host of other mainstream media venues were using Chinese bots to make their internet traffic look like it was exploding (when in fact they&#39;re hemorrhaging money and influence). In that same media cycle, Colbert and Rachel Maddow suddenly experienced an uptick in ratings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious that no one&#39;s making the connection.</p>
