       Who are Jack Abernathy and Bill Shine? Regardless of what you think about FOX news content they had been the only cable news network running a successful business model. Changes in the past year are good politics but bad business. I don't know who and I don't know what but I can't shake the feeling it's intentional and not incompetence.

       FOX News was always the mouthpiece of the GOP establishment. They would always have your usual GOPe neocon suspects on giving interviews and such doing their best to spin the crap sandwiches being fed to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The execs at FOX News had a lot of the same goals as the globalist NWO. TPP, open borders, etc. and feel like their current lineup and approach makes it a lot harder to get those agendas passed.

       There has definitely been a MASSIVE shift in management and programming over the last year though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a MASSIVE fan of FoxNews or anything, but I think they need some REAL competition. They monopolize the mainstream conservative audience, and there isn't anywhere else for people to go other than fringy websites.

       After Obama took away everyone's guns, instituted sharia law, declared martial law, locked everyone in FEMA concentration camps, then had them face the death panels, and had the UN invade and take over, there was no one left to watch Fox News' misinformation/propaganda campaign.

       Fox News' entire business model was built around being the mouthpiece of the opposition party. The network makes money by making Republicans angry about how Democrats are supposedly screwing everything up for them.
      </p>

       Well, now Democrats aren't in power. It's
       <em>
        all

       Republicans. Who is Fox News supposed to aim at, now?

       I kinda get the sense that TPTB are taking over the helm of FOX, the station that our great orange leader eats for breakfast. There is no better way to manipulate Trump than to control FOX. And chances are he'll never catch on. That's why FOX's narrative has changed drastically along with the disappearance of the staff.

       Cognitive dissonance is amazing to me. No less than a month ago, the story broke that the NTY, Washington Post, Twitter and a whole host of other mainstream media venues were using Chinese bots to make their internet traffic look like it was exploding (when in fact they're hemorrhaging money and influence). In that same media cycle, Colbert and Rachel Maddow suddenly experienced an uptick in ratings.
