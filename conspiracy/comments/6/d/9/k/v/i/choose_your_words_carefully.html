        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">66</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-25 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/cholera_or_gonorrhea.html">cholera_or_gonorrhea</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Because everyone so kindly indulged the post about the importance of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6cg8on/pay_attention_and_guard_your_energy_carefully/">paying attention</a>, I thought I&#39;d go further and talk about the magic of words as it relates to this most precious resource.</p>

<p>Words are the signposts of attention: they guide it, tell it where to turn, and thus affect our energies. Words dictate the route of attention, basically, causing it to flow to various ideas, institutions, and powers. </p>

<p>Meditation is in part so profound because it is the <em>absence</em> of word-chatter: the mind is left with nothing but pure attention, then, and therefore pure energy. It allows energy to pool in our own vessel, and therefore tunes us to our own god-like selves when the chatter forming our 3D matrix gets stripped away.</p>

<p>Since we all must live in this matrix, however, we should be very careful about the words we ingest (and put out). They are powerful, and they tune us to frequencies/polarities of either love or fear. This can be proven based on paying attention to how a word can make us feel instinctually. Case in point, <em>pay attention</em> to each of these words:</p>

<p>Genocide</p>

<p>Shadow</p>

<p>Murder</p>

<p>Infanticide</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not a sociopath, there&#39;s a good chance a part of you reacts to these words at a visceral level. And on the other side of the spectrum, there are these words:</p>

<p>Compassion</p>

<p>Holy</p>

<p>Sacred</p>

<p>Courageous</p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>Gratitude</p>

<p>These words carry different, lighter energies.</p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s self-evident we&#39;re run by powers that thrive on low energy. Words are another power tool by which they achieve this. The entirety of mainstream news--all of it, really--is siphoning attention and churning us into low-energy, low vibrational humans: hence, headlines and stories filled with negativity. This is an attempt to imprison our mind through the captivation of our attention. Our mind then thinks of death, thinks of war, thinks of terrorism. What we think about creates the fabric of reality. As such, we need to be vigilant about the words we ingest that are put forth by parties that do not have humanity&#39;s best interest.</p>

<p>The other problem with reading negative words is the tendency to push out negativity as a response, mostly because that&#39;s the energy level to which we&#39;re attuned unless we consciously stop it. This is harder than it seems, because negative words have a disarming effect: they lower our ability to think critically by kicking in the reptilian flight-or-fight part of our brains. If we feel harmed or threatened, it leads to a sense of defenselessness. This is why online shills use such <em>agressive</em> language. Words are vibrational weapons. </p>

<p>Thus, we need to take back the power of words. The internet has become such a tool of revolution because for the first time, humans are coding the scripts instead of TPTB. Humans are writing the words that shape attention and as such, we are paying attention to incredibly important things. </p>

<p>We need to use words, language, in such a way that <em>ennoble</em> us. It occurred to me just the other day that where I live it&#39;s common to say, &quot;brother&quot; or &quot;sister&quot; to total strangers. As in, &quot;brother, could you tell me where to find the bus stop?&quot; Or when receiving change, &quot;thank you, sister.&quot; This language is <em>profound</em> because it points towards a fundamental truth: we are all one. We are one giant cosmic family, in the big scheme of things. </p>

<p>Also use words to heal. The Hawaiians used what&#39;s called the Ho&#39;oponopono to forgive others and one&#39;s self. It&#39;s profound and is merely saying, &quot;I love you, I&#39;m sorry, please forgive me, thank you thank you thank you.&quot; It works for the reason that words are frequencies themselves. </p>

<p>But these are just a few examples. Other ways to take back the power of words includes affirming content you want to see; letting go of the negative shills. Don&#39;t engage. Don&#39;t lower your vibration. Either use words with levity, send good energy their way to dissipate their lower vibrations, or don&#39;t say anything at all. </p>

<p>Also use words to ennoble and enrich yourself. No matter what you think about Tony Robbins or other self-help gurus, they are right about one thing: the power of goal-setting. Of writing down your goals. Those who do this are quantifiably more likely to achieve their goals than those who do not write them down. It&#39;s not magic... it&#39;s just maintaining your attention, which then drives action, which then creates reality. It&#39;s truly as simple as that. All of it. Why do you think witches would practice incantations and spells? Why do you think only royalty had books? Why did the printing press revolutionize society? </p>

<p>Words create reality by using our attention, and often times our subsequent action, to drive us from point A (present) to point B (future). </p>

<p>Pay careful attention to how entities use words to shape your own psyche. Think carefully how entities use/manipulate words to describe our history. Think what they mean when they say the war&#39;s victor gets to write the history books. Think carefully how they use words to descibe our present events, knowing full well they shape our behavior and thus shape the future. When reading anything of question, detach yourself from its energetic imprint just as Buddhists detach themselves from thoughts. Recognize its existence but then let it pass. You lose when you surrender your attention, lower your vibration, and thus give your energy to them.</p>

<p>Eventually, you can transmute negative energy and turn it back onto itself, using the power of words. I believe the Rich investigation is an example. If you maintain love and good intent in your thoughts/actions, you can ricochet the energy of words instead of absorb it. You can also do this by reading enough words of truth. The phrase &quot;knowledge is power&quot; is true for a reason. Study words, books, and texts as if they are weapons of self-defense in an information war. Because that&#39;s what we&#39;re in. We are in an amazing time where we have more power than ever to choose the words and programming that go into our brains. The powers that be are attempting to close this window. It is not possible if we know our truth. </p>

<p>And so, my friends... choose your words carefully. Think about the words that you are consuming, because they are the fertilizer for your mind&#39;s garden. Weed it on occasion by being mindful, plant new thoughts and ideas, and share the bounty with others. Let your words be nourishment for yourself and others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>440 isn&#39;t strictly standard by any means. Many of the worlds most prolific orchestra use different frequencies. Generally any ensemble could tune to a variety of frequencies and almost all of the instruments can easily accommodate that. A piano would have to be retuned entirely. Some percussion instruments like xylophones would need to be rebarred entirely. Why would you prefer 432 specifically? Also A=440 is just one specific note so tuning to it wouldn&#39;t mean all songs would always vibrate at that frequency. Your statement really piqued my curiosity. </p>

<ul>
<li>sounds themselves have meanings and moods associated with them.  this is true for numbers, too.  See Daniel Tammet- the synesthete and autistic savant who SEES numbers as colorful shapes and has the ability to learn languages at a rate previously thought to be humanly impossible.  He has even created his own language based on concepts intuitive to and learned by him.</li>

<li><p>speech is magical in that allows us to bring an idea into being.   &quot;And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>words allow us to order and define ideas as systems.  they can also control the systems which we places these ideas into.</p></li>
<li><p>words can also be used to deceive- to spread untruth and to trick.  in law, words are very important.  when words have multiple meanings, once must de-CIPHER the coded language to determine what the words are saying.  Sometimes, a string of words can have multiple meanings, all of which are true- hence the importance of specification.  At the same time, this allows us to bond more closely by communicating in a way which is more than just the MEANING of the words, but the FEELING of them.  See postmodernism.</p></li>

<p>I was actually thinking about two of these words yesterday.  Like much of english- they&#39;re latin derived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>caedō (“cut, hew, kill”) +‎ -a (suffix forming masculine agent nouns)</p>

<p>-cīda m (genitive -cīdae); first declension</p>

<p>Noun-forming suffix denoting “one who kills” or “one who cuts” from nouns stems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The description is of an ACTION, and stems from one who commits that action.  In that way, it&#39;s accusatory and denotes intent.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-cida">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-cida</a></p>

<p>the word murder, is similar to the word for death in many languages- mort, mord.  but the old english: morþor, refers to killing in secret, yet is also synonmous with &quot;great sin&quot;.</p>

<p>but <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mor%C3%BEor#Old_English">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mor%C3%BEor#Old_English</a></p>

<p>Many of the &quot;positive&quot; word you chose are also related.</p>

<p>Compassion</p>

<p>Peace</p>

<p>Both draw from the same Latin route (root) - &quot;Pax&quot;  <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pax#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pax#Latin</a></p>

<p>While I would not apply the same positive vibe to &quot;sacred&quot;, which stems from the Latin &quot;sacer&quot;, meaning something devoted to the gods (as in for sacrifice).  &quot;You have forsaken me&quot;- you have sacrificed me.  &quot;For your own sake&quot;- sacrificed to your self.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sacer#Latin">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sacer#Latin</a></p>

<p>&quot;courage&quot; comes from the heart (life force)- the couer. the corps, core, center.  The Sacré-Coeur being the sacred/ sacrificed heart.</p>
