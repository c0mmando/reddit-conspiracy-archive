       Disclaimer: I do not claim to be an expert on aliens, or anything remotely close.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first starting looking into the alien cover-up that seems to be going on, I was all in. IMO, it's ignorant to think we are the only intelligent life in our universe, galaxy, or even our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently I started getting into the Annunaki, and reading up on my Sumerian mythology.  The more I discovered, the more something seemed off. Cultures around the world referred to these beings as gods, and there were multiple "races" of these gods. Some gods were portrayed to have more than one form they presented themselves in.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that the Aliens we discuss today are not from other planets, but they are from other dimensions. They manifest in different forms, and have for thousands of years. They have the ability to manipulate frequency, energy, vibration. This is what allows them to change their form. I believe that the beings we call angels, demons, gods, aliens, etc. are all beings from another dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are quite a few people in this sub who are more enlightened than I am on this subject, so I'm asking for any info regarding this topic. Even if it disagrees with my current views.

       Well according to the super string theory there are different dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not unreasonable to make the assumption that there are other beings able to coexist throughout these different dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also isn't unreasonable to assume these beings have "powers" use humans don't.

       I believe humans are capable of much more than we are taught. I have personally confirmed this through practice of martial arts (qi energy), but there is no visual evidence I can show to convince others.

       In the last few years I've been studying an art that utilizes pressure points, as well as small circle joint locks. The Grandmaster Instructor had a heavy emphasis on relaxing and putting conscious intent behind each of our strikes. This would be an example of how qi is used for combat. At first I thought the energy stuff was BS but after a few months of going to seminars I started to feel it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever felt someone staring at you from across the room? Or have you noticed that you can feel someone's intent (if they are upset you can literally feel it when they look at you). This would be a very simplified explanation of that energy. It's a natural energy your body has, and can feel like electricity when someone uses it in conjunction with a strike. I don't think it's quite as spiritual as eastern martial arts makes it out to be. (I could be wrong)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also began practicing Qi Gong and trying to meditate more. This has resulted in me feeling like I am more aware of energy.

       That's amazing. I've definitely felt those feelings you mentioned. This sort of mental energy you can pick up on... I've practiced meditation on and off (no real structure/schedule), and I've looked into qi gong and qi energy. I've tried some meditations and followed some guidelines of videos I've seen online. I haven't felt anything yet, at least nothing that I can positively be like "that felt like something" lol... I would love to be able to experience the physical energetic side of what you're saying... and from what I've learned about it I get the same assumption that its not as spiritual as its made out to be. But just the awareness alone of it, experiencing it, that's some sort of spiritual journey.
      </p>

       Thank you for sharing! Any chance you could point me in a good direction to learn more about qi/qi gong?

       Most of what I have learned about energy is that its completely controlled by intent. There are a lot of subtle changes you start to notice when you become more sensitive.

       This is a simple walk through for beginners. Most of what I have learned about qi gong was through instruction in class. This should at least get you started on your journey.

       This is unrelated, but the Grandmaster that I was training under passed away a few months ago. He was an ex-ranger and a born and bred southern boy. At his funeral, i was talking to his family members and close friends about this energy. One of his friends told me that he had gone through a point in his life where he practiced remote viewing. According to the person i talked to, Grandmaster was invited to a CIA remote viewing project to observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no way to verify this now, so take it for what you will. I believed it though. Grandmaster was a straight shooting, no bullshit kind of guy. He was probably my primary influence to study many of these conspiracy subjects.

       I think that there are different factions of these beings that struggle for control. I also think that these beings helped usher in our evolution in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the 13 ruling bloodlines are rumoured to descend from intermarrying with Annunaki. I believe the Bible refers to beings as "The sons of God" who are a result of fallen angels mating with humans. The book of Enoch refers to the Nephilim, and if my memory serves me correctly, they are the same beings.

       Good question.. Maybe they are not allowed to roam as freely for some reason. Maybe we do not need their aid in evolution at this time. Maybe they don't exist.

       I do not know enough about this subject to answer your question, sadly. That's really why I wanted to post.

       If your theory is correct, which I have seen in one form or another over the years, my answer is that they have simply abandoned us.  I don't think they are running things in the background.  Again, running with your theory... it would make sense to me that they came and put the pieces in place for civilization to take hold and have moved on.  I just don't see enough evidence that would make me think that the planet is being run by anything other than greed at this point.  I think the bloodlines that have the power right now, are just so well connected that they can manipulate things to ensure that they remain in power.

       The positive entities dont want to be here now because of how low our planet vibrates with fear and hate. Thats why the global consciousness needs to spread love and creation instead we all have a part in this and staying kind to one another is a huge part of it!

       They say 70% of eastern Europe comes from Tutankhamun bloodline.  Tutankhamun was the son of Akhenaten.  Akhenaten ruled for less than 20 years and made a great impact.  He also declared Aten as the 1 and only god.

       The vibrations and magnetic theory is really fascinating. Especially the theory that pyramids were used as a tool to magnify vibrations and alter Earths magnetic waves.

        My theory is that the Aliens we discuss today are not from other planets, but they are from other dimensions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're right, they are not from other planets. And you're also right, they are from other dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even today people that use psychedelics say they experience beings from other dimensions. 
My theory is that in ancient times, there were no wars on drugs. Especially the priests in their rituals would get high on psychedelics and "travel to other dimensions" where they met the gods which also explains the half human half animal beings common in DMT trips.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the UFOs, according to MUFON the most seen UFO is the big black triangle. I've seen one a long time ago and that's what got my interest. After years of digging I reached the conclusion that it's advanced secret technology owned by US.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also people with sleep paralysis that feel there's someone in the room which explains some of the abduction which are quite rare these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also a lot of people with an agenda or some that are looking for attention, money and fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the truth is a combination of all these reasons and maybe a few more that I'm not aware of. I'm not saying there are no aliens out there, but I doubt very much there are any here on this planet.

       Man is to Dog what God is to Man. Man is the Dog God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man's interactions with the wolf
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       the dog. In taming the wild beast, Man created an obedient follower devoted to pleasing it's Master and avoiding His wrath. When Dog does what is pleasing to Man, he is rewarded with play, treats, and love; he gets a place beside the fire, a roof over his head to protect him from the rain and a bemused Man to hug him and call him a silly puppy when it thunders. When Dog is displeasing he is punished. Man's anger is as frightening and loud as the thunder but yelling can also turn into beatings and worse - banishment from Man's presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Shaman is responsible for God but the Shaman's Dog is responsible for religion. The Shaman observed how his Dog treated him, applied that same devotion to the beings in his visions and turned into a Priest.

       Awsome post!!! I do agree with that conclusion as its the same that i came to. I believe these higher dimmensional entities to have positive neutral and negative backgrounds. But the ones that thrive on earth are mostly negative as our world seems to be engineered to keep us negative and angry. They would mostly be described as fallen angels. Once you study the occult and project monarch and egyption summerian txts and all those the big picture starts to come together. And its funny cause they convinced a large portion of people that they arent real and if someone figures it out and tries to tell people whats happening your considered crazy!! Have you looked into astral projection?

       I have skimmed the surface  of Astral Projection, but I haven't read as much as I would like. I would love to attempt, but i feel like i need to practice meditation a lot more first.

       After reading Julian Jaynes 'The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind', and researching mystery Babylon, I have come to the conclusion that God and God Kings existed, but we have lost the need for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think pre flood, mankind was living way too hedonisticly. God created the flood to clean the slate and start fresh. Humans were unconscious, except for the God Kings. The unconscious were controlled by the God Kings through their bicameral mind, via hallucinations, both visual and audible. This may have been God's way of teaching mankind how to live, as he see fit. Once we were on the right trajectory, the God Kings ceased. God revisited when he gave the 10 commandments and when Jesus reached enlightenment. His purpose was to remind and help us along our path here on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible all of this is aliens at work or some higher form or a Diety. Who knows. The top of the pyramid know all of these answers, but they're hiding this info from us pleabs.

       I think that there are definitely some kind of beings that feed off of negative energy, I think the Gnostics called them Archons.

       The positive entities dont want to be here now because of how low our planet vibrates with fear and hate. Thats why the global consciousness needs to spread love and creation instead we all have a part in this and staying kind to one another is a huge part of it!

       Man is to Dog what God is to Man. Man is the Dog God.

       the dog. In taming the wild beast, Man created an obedient follower devoted to pleasing it's Master and avoiding His wrath. When Dog does what is pleasing to Man, he is rewarded with play, treats, and love; he gets a place beside the fire, a roof over his head to protect him from the rain and a bemused Man to hug him and call him a silly puppy when it thunders. When Dog is displeasing he is punished. Man's anger is as frightening and loud as the thunder but yelling can also turn into beatings and worse - banishment from Man's presence.

       The Shaman is responsible for God but the Shaman's Dog is responsible for religion. The Shaman observed how his Dog treated him, applied that same devotion to the beings in his visions and turned into a Priest.
