    <div class="md"><p>Um, Trump babbles about military and intelligence regarding subs and a terrorist attack. </p>

<p>Sessions is caught in another lie. </p>

<p>The Trump budget has an error so large it renders it entirely unbelievable  </p>

<p>After attacking Saudi Arabia, he goes there and falls face down in acquiescence to Exxon&#39;s profits from Saudi oil and the defense contractors, and the infrastructure contractors.
Think hard now who is Trump&#39;s Secty of State? </p>

<p>It took a massive conservative push to counter.  and that secrete intelligence from Russia was considered false and the real question is why did someone keep pushing it? </p>

<p>And how can DWS&#39;s little fit measure up against any of that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has more to do with what she was freaking out about. The story has gotten nearly zero coverage from MSM yet is very relevant to national security.  And possibly corruption, but it&#39;s hard to know since there are no journalists reporting on it.</p>

<p>So if people start to share her freak out video, they will start to ask questions. Now with this &quot;fake russia doc&quot; story, people will be confused and just start talking about Trump if her name is brought up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the DNC purged any voters, we do know the Republicans began doing that in 2012 and continued right through 2016 and since they were purging possible Democratic voters it was easy to point fingers   and since the MSM is very definitely conservative controlled.  I will not claim DNC was responsible for purging voters that wouldn&#39;t even make sense. </p>

<p>And look at Arizona, a Republican controlled election system that blocked voters,  do you really think the DNC is responsible for that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not correct. Did they know that it was Russia-sourced contemporaneously? Or only afterwards? And the FBI were suspicious of it, they weren&#39;t fooled. The point you completely missed is that they were worried that unless they could completely dismiss it, it would get leaked and there would be more fuel to the conspiracy that the DNC and the DoJ colluded on Clinton&#39;s case. Think about how this sub would&#39;ve reacted if that was dropped. The FBI was afraid they&#39;re pronouncements would be tainted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Around 2002, Henry Kissinger was famously reported to have said that Israel has about a 75 - 80-year self life.</p>

<p>That, coincidentally, is about the shelf-life of the old Soviet Union.</p>

<p>It seems that every government hijacked by a certain group collapsed after about 70 - 80 years. Once installed into power, they behave greedily and recklessly and end up running the nation into the ground. They basically strip-mine, and then move on to the next country.</p>

<p>By my calculations, the old Saxon hierarchy in the United States was effectively supplanted beginning in the 1960s. That&#39;s when the Cultural Marxism move started to take over our educational system, our media, our government. Hell, even the FBI now has to send all its agents to the Holocaust Museum as part of their training and indoctrination. Suffice to say, this didn&#39;t happen under the old Saxon hierarchy.</p>

<p>As they acquired more power and more influence, the character of the nation changed. It ceased to reflect the host-population and started to resemble the people now running it. Hence the homosexuality-normalization campaigns, transgender normalization movements, anti-family and anti-Christianity agendas.</p>

<p>But to me the bellwether was the erosion of US citizenship started in 1967 when the Jewish lobby pushed to legalize dual citizenship in the United States (with the case of Beys Afroyim). This came hard on the heels of the 1965 Immigration Act (co-written by neocon Norm Podhoretz). </p>

<p>After dual citizenship was normalized (and people with loyalties to foreign nations were no longer held to be traitors), they started to re-interpret the 14th Amendment to hand out citizenship to the children of illegal aliens (in a larger goal to change the demographics of the country).</p>

<p>So if I had to put a date on the switch, I&#39;d say it began around 1967 in earnest.</p>

<p>We&#39;re on year 50, then, of what has historically been a 70 - 80 year cycle of collapse.</p>

<p>And now they&#39;re prepping to jump ship and set up camp in China (after the United States has been strip-mined). With the rise of nationalist movements, the neocons (and people like Henry Kissinger, who is now a lobbyist for China) are appealing to President Xi to make China the new home-base of globalism and &quot;rootless cosmopolitanism,&quot; as Stalin called it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a personal opinion on gays.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right: Every nation on Earth has had gays (and has gays now). But why do they acquire political power in some countries and not others?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the question being addressed.</p>

<p>Was homosexuality normalization common under the old Saxon hierarchy in America? That is to say, if I went back in time to, say, the John Wayne era, would the average person in the street loudly and proudly declare that he was for gay and transgender rights?</p>

<p>Was this something George Washington did?</p>

<p>We know that Thomas Jefferson didn&#39;t. Despite writing the Constitution and granting freedoms for a number of different groups, he did not consider homosexuality a positive social force, and in fact lobbied to have gays castrated. </p>

<p>So my question was: What happened sociologically between the John Wayne generation and the current generation?</p>

<p>My proposition is that the new oligarchy has high rates of homosexuality (much higher than the host population) so it&#39;s in their interests to normalize it and de-stigmatize it.</p>

<p>Even Sigmund Freud made the same observation, after studying the statistics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because from our foundations with the Puritans and protestants in general, homosexuality has been demonized. You said it yourself, homosexuality has always been around is around 4 to 5 percent of the population, why should it not be normal? Why does it have to be demonized? There is nothing wrong with it. And the 60s/70s and the civil rights and counter culture movement helped secure rights for the gay community and for other minorities.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you said it yourself: Homosexuality has always been around at around 4 to 5 percent. (I&#39;ve read it&#39;s more like 1.8% to 3%.)</p>

<p>You said, &quot;So why shouldn&#39;t it be normal?&quot;</p>

<p>Anything that happens at a statistically small rate is never considered normal. &quot;Normal&quot; isn&#39;t a moral definition; it&#39;s a statistical one.</p>

<p>Statistically, left-handed people aren&#39;t &quot;normal&quot;.</p>

<p>(And, yes, there were massive campaigns to place lefties in conversation therapy classes. In Catholic school, for instance, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands to &quot;normalize&quot; them.)</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not just gays who have been subjected to this. Any group that exists in small percentages in a society is rife for ridicule or abuse. Look at how redheads are treated, for God&#39;s sake.</p>

<p>Human beings are savage and petty. Like seagulls that will peck another seagull to death if you tie a ribbon around its leg. If the group senses that it&#39;s &quot;different,&quot; they will attack it.</p>

<p>Darwinists would say that this is an evolutionary mechanism designed to weed out genetic mutations. Animals (all animals) have this instinctive sense that if something is different it&#39;s &quot;bad&quot;.</p>

<p>As humans some of us have evolved above this animal level. (Clearly you have.)</p>

<p>I myself haven&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for redhead conversion therapy where I demand the government pay for hair-dye to &quot;normalize&quot; these individuals for the sake of society. I&#39;m also for rounding up left-handed people and placing them in special camps.</p>
