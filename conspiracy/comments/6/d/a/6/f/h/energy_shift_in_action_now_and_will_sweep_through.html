       Just a quick one to say I think we are through the worst of it. We all have our individual focus points... I'm from UK (Leicester), currently focused on election, Tories, monarchy, mi1-9, and on the periphery everything from sacred geometry to max Spiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not as clued up on some when it comes to occultist dates, just always had mad intuition, but I think we are through the worst of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a renaissance is coming chaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were meant to be in all out war by now with Russia and be gladly stepping into the vr augmented matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       May 22nd was a desperate last stab.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying a new 9/11 but it doesn't work anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       We won boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the work begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time to create a new reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time I posted was to speak out against the blatant Julian death distraction and I demanded one of you WizKids design a new encrypted cryptocurrency backed social media...
      </p>
      <p>
       We now have steemit. Which will take over no doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been predicting a mass migration like we saw from MySpace and msm. Upgrade.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gab. Steemit. Megaupload 2. VPN. Bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We learnt from our masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       With trump and brexit we played them at their own game and won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's time to love each other and go back into meditation and work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying thank you for all of the light you all spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are the illuminated now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's our time.

       Gots ya. I just see what their doing and people like yourself tell me that it's called project bluebeam etc.

       For years I was seen as either a nutter or prophet for merely observing the blatant manipulation of reality.

       Bluebeam would have been some big alien invasion scared where they woulda pulled the "We all have to unite to fight them" that is very cliché and would probably have managed to establish their famous new world order

       Instead we got a madman that fucking lit fire to their whole scheme from the interior. Now we wait for it to burn down and we should get a nice Phoenix from it. Society/Economic reset.

       They would've had to do it without giving any of the free energy tech out. That would've been very difficult, but I believe it would've been done with HRC. I liked how you explained it

       You're likely just in tune with a higher frequency. Some of us are. People consider us crazy because they quite literally cannot see the manipulations due to their inability to rise out of the lowest spectrum of density. When you awaken, you see through illusions. You 'rise above' via your internal frequency and are able to perceive truth more easily and fluidly. If you've heard ringing in your ears for a while now (not saying you
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be), it's apparently a sign of your frequency rising. Just a cool ass time to be alive, man. Just gotta keep our energy positive, despite what magic tricks the elite try to fool us with by bringing us back down to the lowest frequency, which manifests emotionally as fear, anxiety, depression, jealousy, lack, and so on. :)

       Loving vibes back at you, my brotha.

       We're entering the age where mankind recognizes that it has spend thousands of years believing it is its own thoughts. Once we recognize that illusion on a mass-scale, we will begin perceiving through the heart. This is going to be the age of the heart! So much beauty and joy and high frequencies! Be well, man.

       You know man! Power in their dude gotta carry that shit through all journeys come hell or high water.

       I'm starting to believe the heart is the mind in the shadows the subconscious like the pineal is to the eyes.

       The deeper our perception goes the further we will be able to visualise through each chakra node?

       Ah, beautiful. And I'm with you regarding the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that the heart is fundamentally who and what we are, but the ego-mind is such a clever illusion (it's so enticing to believe you are a separate identity from consciousness) and we believe we are the egoic thought structure, rather than the heart (consciousness/awareness) in which all thoughts have arisen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naturally, we are loving. It's why we feel broken when there are terrorist attacks. We know we're all brothers and sisters, deep down.  And we're entering into an age where things we've known
       <em>
        intellectually
       </em>
       (that everything is One, and everything is able to exist because of the fabric of love, which is what we are) are going to be come known
       <em>
        experientially
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you, man. I was a professional bodybuilder who enjoyed drugs too much. Now, I'm a vegan, spiritual, loving dude who is pursuing non-duality. Life's just so much more fulfilling when you let go of the egoic illusion. With that said, I certainly do miss that feeling of 'power' and 'domination' when the ego felt like it had won or done something 'right'. Idk, haha

       You are right--it's the darkest before the dawn but I think we're coming through it.

       Interestingly, "the darkest" is just our awareness of what's been going on for centuries.

      <p>
       For a little while it scared me. I kept worrying about my own safety and well-being, my own "death"... but then I realized that by caring about the safety and well-being of others, it assured my own. I guess that's best described as ego death (sans psychedelics), but it was an interesting experience.

       Dissolving the ego is metaphorical and speaking to it as if it's gone is a false delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were truly gone you would never speak of it.  It wouldn't exist and be a point of attention that you bring.
