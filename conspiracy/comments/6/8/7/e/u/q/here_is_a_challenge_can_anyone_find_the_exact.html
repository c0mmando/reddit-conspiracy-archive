        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t. I can find when Alex Jones started doing his first show in 1996 for KJFX-FM in Austin, and when he began doing his own show The Alex Jones Show in 1999, but what year was Infowars founded? PrisonPlanet.com also does not have a date on their banner, or on their &quot;About&quot; page.</p>

<p>I am curious because I speculate Infowars is a Stratfor operation, I think that it&#39;s no coincidence the year Stratfor was founded in Austin is the year Alex Jones started his career. I think they took a local public access guy who had family ties through his father to the intelligence community and groomed him into a mouthpiece for disinformation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. So, Infowars has only been around since 2007?</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious where Alex Jones received the funding to start Infowars if he did not receive funding from anyone but himself, according to his website.</p>

<p>Do you know if, or how one could determine, if before 2007 Jones was receiving income from PrisonPlanet.com?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not talking about starting an LLC, I am talking about creating the production studios, all the equipment, staff, etc. Where did he get that money if he did not borrow it, get a loan, and so on? Ad revenue? Supplement sales? When did he start selling supplements? If Infowars was founded in 2007, how did he acquire the funds to get the site going and keep it running? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel/zionists.  That&#39;s where he got it, I believe.  To be fair, Alex really did a good job at building his empire.  I listened to him 7 years ago or earlier.  Before he sold supplements and just sold arabaca bean coffee, tangy tangerine, diamond gusset jeans, and big berke water filters.  I think he has always been controlled opposition, but about 3 years ago or so it really became apparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. He must have sold a lot of coffee, tangerines, jeans, and water filters to start up that studio, right?</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t doubt he has a legit following, however I find it very hard to believe that without any financiers, loans, nothing, he was able to create what is basically an &quot;independent&quot; news network. His studio is massive and it is loaded with expensive equipment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if Israel is the answer, or he&#39;s not just a CIA sponsored mouthpiece. They found him, groomed him, helped get him going, and they use him when they need to.</p>

The capability to inspect the underside of freight ships and large vessels has always been of great concern for ports of entry, ports of call, and country port borders. *<em>It is well known that ships such as these have been frequently used to smuggle illegal drugs and contraband through ports of entry. *</em></p>
