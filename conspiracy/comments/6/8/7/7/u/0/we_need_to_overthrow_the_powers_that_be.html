Posting on reddit and talking about it is fine, but we need to collectively take action, the government is afraid of its own people above all else, the manufactured  terrorist threats were obviously an excuse to pass legislation to spy on their greatest enemy, which is us, the common majority, the many far outweigh the few that control this world, and we are exploited, yet still remain divided. This needs to stop, if the 450,923 people on this sub coordinated, pooled our resources together, it could make a HUGE impact in liberating humanity from this slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You pretty much nailed it. Everyone in this sub should watch the movie Equilibrium. No matter how great a society could be, human ambition, emotion, and apathy will always define the society. You can run 100 experiments of 100 people in a community and you&#39;ll get the same result every time. One person becomes the leader, two or three pull his strings, 5 or 6 are his cronies, the rest become divided into different classes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s programming right there. The behavior you see in film and that the authorities tell you is programming to make people believe that the violence, division, hate is all human nature and that we have already created the most fair society possible. It&#39;s a con trick to convince people to accept their enslavement. Just about all negative behaivior in people is a result of programming from the control system/their culture. We could easily use efficient means of production, entirely renewable resources, and automate the production of all necessities for comfortable living. Instead we live in a state of artificial scarcity where corporations purposely operate inefficiently because they an drive up profits that way. They make products that don&#39;t last long and need to be replaced, we ship stuff all the way across the world and back when it&#39;s obvious that we should localize all production. Through the use of automation we could set up production facilities for all necessities around each city, then there could be other facilities one per state or something that handle not necessities. We could run these facilities of any number of renewable resources that we know up and save a ton of oil/money/time in the process. </p>

<p>Once all basic necessities are being efficiently provided for all humans pretty much every reason for any kind of violence against others is eradicated. In the world currently most violence is caused by scarcity and a need to survive, or propaganda and false flags instigated by the elite to trick us into being hateful and scared. The concept that utopia can&#39;t exist that we all hear growing up is a trick to make us not try. It&#39;s one of many tricks. In reality we are capable of so much more than how we are existing right now, we could EASILY eradicate poverty if the elites and their manipulation were removed. We just have to use our critical thinking rather than accepting the words of others as truth, we have to show compassion for or fellow humans, and we have to WANT TO BE FREE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And how is this gonna be done? We can get riffles, shotguns, pistols and so on. They have drones, chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, missiles and properly a lot more things we have never heard of that would wipe out any resistance, and that about just the numbers of people in the army and police who is gonna stay loyal to government? I&#39;m sure if this was done on a mass scale, maybe in the tens of millions all around the world. But that isn&#39;t likely to happen, at least for now.
I believe waking people up with the truth is going to be more effective, since we will have strength in numbers this way, we can&#39;t out gun them. That&#39;s they when enough people have been woken, they will be fearing for their lives, and they can then be dragged out of their offices and be put to trail by the people</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to realize that for people to be public servants (congress, reps, etc) you have to truly be selfless. To help the people you serve. Unfortunately we have elected leaders that are so greedy they take money from pharmaceutical companies then vote on pharma regs. </p>

Every single person in government fired and replaced.
The highest punishment would apply to any government official accepting any money what so ever outwith their state salary.
New dept of auditors to constantly monitor the finances of officials.
Freedom of the press.  Abolish monopoly.

    <div class="md"><p>The only way things are going to ever change is through inner revolution. Those in power are overthrown all the time, and they&#39;re replaced with the same kind of person and dynamic, because people haven&#39;t changed in tens of thousands of years. We&#39;re still living in a consciousness in which power/dominance rules the weak. Until our consciousness changes to something higher, things won&#39;t change. This inner revolution starts with the individual. Do I seek power and dominance over others? Do I still view my experience as separate from myself? If one wants to experience a different external experience, go within and sift through one&#39;s own crap and see if there is another way to exist within. Inner revolution will change the outer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding, is the power that be, that rule this world, have ruled since the beginning of human civilization, there has never been a true shift in power, just different pawns put into place that take on the role of political leaders, their sole function being, to forward the agenda. Finding inner peace and understanding is important, but sitting idly and passively while enslavement continues is not likely to change anything, despite a personal change in perspective from looking within.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Overthrowing&quot; is still coming from a consciousness of war and attempting to gain power/dominance over those in power. Once someone truly experiences illumination, it all becomes clear that there is no separation between one&#39;s inner world and the outer. And when one goes to war with the external, it&#39;s only war with one&#39;s self. The observer is the observed, the observed the observer. No separation. The &quot;powers that be&quot; is really only your own mental construct projected outward.</p>
