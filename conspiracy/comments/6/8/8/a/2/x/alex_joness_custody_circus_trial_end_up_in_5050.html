      <p>
       I have really sat by, and not commented on the entire Alex Jones custody trial that just ended today.  I have never in my 33 years of life on this planet have ever seen the entire mainstream media, from Daily Beast to CBS, Good Morning America, CNN (daily), Steven Cobert (almost daily) monologues and updates during the last 2 weeks have disturbed me and an entirely new level.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been an concerted effort by these vampires to try and absolutely crucify a father, who married a woman and had 3 children with her, who had a divorce initiated by his wife and mother of his children, who the oldest, I believe Rex, who is 15, wanted to be with his father the whole time, dragged into court, where his now ex-wife, who already is making $43,000 a month from Alex while she went to most likely a drug rehab in Arizona for 5 weeks, demands he only be allowed visitation on "Monday's from 6-9pm (apparently the time his daughter had dance classes), on Saturday's from 11-6pm, and Sunday's sometime after church, but not overnight".
      </p>
      <p>
       He supposedly offered her 50 /50 custody, as well as $43,000 per month for the foreseeable future which she rejected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sub has a very mixed bag on their feelings of Alex Jones, but come on, this is the entire weight of the entire media-military industrial complex that is literally
       <strong>
        trying to only allow this father who makes all the money, have scheduled 11 hours a week, with supervised visitations with his 3 children.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way in hell that this would be socially tolerated, unless it's a cis hetero binary (fill in the blank) white male, no fucking way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire mainstream media has exposed themselves as willing to take a father's children away from him, despite whatever you say about Alex Jones the person.   This is probably the most public, and vicious execution of one's character, accross the media spectrum that i have ever witnessed in my entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what this sub thinks about Alex Jones the person, there is absolutely no denying, the complete and total seismic effect this man has had on my generation, and any other generation that isn't completely willing to accept the mainstream narrative of the 9.11 attacks.  Most every person today on YouTube, from Luke Ridouskwi (fuck that's a hard name to spell), to James Corbett, to James Tracey, Steve Piczenick, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning, Glen Grenwald, and even President Donald Trump Himself, all of these people have taken Alex Jones's courage, and continued the red pilling of their own followers.
      </p>
      <p>
       His effect on society, will go down in history as one of the most influencing people of this century, perhaps the history of this country.  That's undeniable.  But yet he's not qualified to raise his own kids according to the court system, the ENTIRE mainstream media, and the authoritarian marxists in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       This father who loves his kids, and provides for kids financially and  emotionally deserves AT LEAST 50 percent of his children's lives.

       Right. They have to resort to reporting about the person, because they've given up on reporting on the ideas, or the truth.  It's funny to laugh about bowl of chili.  SMDH....

       I'm honestly confused by what you mean "Reporting about the person". In my experience in custody trials as a child and later in life as a parent, a lot of what the courts look at is the character of a person. The whole chili and weed thing might sound funny, but people have lost complete rights to their children for less.

       I don't have a problem with weed, shit needs to be legalized already. That doesn't mean the courts don't have a problem with it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't he say that he was smoking it just to see how much stronger Soros was making it? That's the part that is weird to me. If the dude wants to smoke that's cool, but don't pull some bullshit reason out of your ass. Anyways like I said it doesn't matter what I think about weed, it matters what the courts think about it.

       That's the interesting part... Why did Jones have custody in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen that mentioned anywhere (not that I've been looking, mind you). Isn't it a bit strange that Jones had full custody in the first place?

       I don't think big celebs get this much media attention when they get divorced or have family problems. Personally I am surprised the media went so low as to make a custody battle global news.

       he attacks the media constantly. He just got  a taste of his own medicine. Besides, his sponsors are very powerful gefiltesharks. They will look at for him. How much do you want to bet that while you are begging for your life in a FEMA camp, he will be safe with his kids and "ex-wife" in another country? Israel, maybe?

       As far as I'm concerned, that stuff is his and his wife's private business; only Jones and his ex knows what really went on between them and in their home. That's all I have to say, anything more about his business would be a violation of the first sentence I wrote.

       50/50 is not allowed in custody battles.  The law will not allow for a stalemate.  51/49 is the best you can get because one parent has to be a tiebreaker.

       Source please. I would like to see the records. Not MSN bullshit narrative being pushed. He seams to say it's always been 50/50 custody till she went to rehab and it's all in court public documents. Would be interesting to read them to see if he is lying or telling the truth. What's sad like OP said is this is his family life which is bad for the kids involved. The wife went to rehab so she obviously had major issues that could be detrimental to the kids and they are seeing this all play out which is sick. No kid deserves this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather you like him or not they have been out to get him for a while now and IMO it's making people wonder more about him and could actually backfire. The day google was trying to fix the algorithm against him this sub had every other post a hit peace on him. It was rather funny to see the take down in action. The more they try to slam him the more people become interested. His base hasn't slowed down total backfire IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has a right to their own opinion. He does have a lot of credible guests and sources where he gets his information which is more than I can say for MSN anymore. Yes he can be a little nutty and outrageous but you have to have a certain something to draw people in or it's so boring you just turn it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again this is just MO and I'm not a huge fan but do follow a lot of his guests that are stand up people. I will say roger stone is a moron and AJ should've never went there for credibility reasons. The more people down AJ (especially when they lump him in with the good old Russian narrative crap) the more it makes me want to research because now days when a narrative is pushed this hard something is off. Just like Assange it's push a narrative and discredit discredit Russia bla bla bla.

       I was an infowarrior but this Trump BS was too much. For Alex to support any government especially one that is so transparently corrupt turned me off completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put into context. I realized along time ago that a true revolution does not start with an explosion or a violent event but begins at home with your family especially your children. I was disheartened to learn that he divorced his wife....affair....etc. While a man cannot be blamed for the crazy in his wife he has a responsibility to his children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dragging a family through a court battle is the opposite of defeating the New World Order, based upon what we know about Alex he has forsaken his private family for his public image and it's is sad for the kids and any movement for truth.

       While I agree with you that Alex in fact brought about this upon himself to some extent by having an affair, but to have the mainstream media so publicly and fully trying to ensure this father looses his children completely, without supervised visitations, is absolutely disgusting, and shows how evil they truly are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite what you think about Alex Jones (and I agree fully about his recent gay love affair with Donald Trump) the fact the media went so absolutely insanely out of the way to demonize a father in the way they did, and the unfair playing field the court gives to the mother from the start is too much for me to handle.

       Yea, that's the main point in the video, that court systems are absolutely tilted in favor of women.  The YouTube author states, that he is standing up and supporting Alex Jones, because if they can do it rich people like Alex Jones, they sure as hell can do it anyone.

       lol, come on mate, please.  Just think about it for a second.  Do you realize these people I've named have almost all publicly stated that Alex Jones has been a huge influence on them?   I suspect that a majority of people here have been influenced by Alex Jones in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is the gateway drug to the red pilling of millions of people, that's not debatable!  How many people never once questioned the events of 9/11, before watching Alex Jones?   He has undoubtedly been a factor in "waking up" more people to the realities of the actions of our government, then most likely any other person in the history of our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please name another person who has woken up more people then Alex Jones.  I'll wait...

       Lmao, I'm an infiltrator because I don't think Alex Jones is one of the most influential men in American history?  Whatever you say man.  Your account is 4 months old and I'm an infiltrator lol.   Eat a bag of dicks.  God forbid someone not view Alex Jones as a fucking American icon.  Learn how to take criticism from such absurd claims rather than crying infiltrator you fuckin moron.

       I don't have a problem with weed, shit needs to be legalized already. That doesn't mean the courts don't have a problem with it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't he say that he was smoking it just to see how much stronger Soros was making it? That's the part that is weird to me. If the dude wants to smoke that's cool, but don't pull some bullshit reason out of your ass. Anyways like I said it doesn't matter what I think about weed, it matters what the courts think about it.
