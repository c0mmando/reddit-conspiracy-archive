       Back in 2011, when the Arab Spring was in full swing, the Western media praised it as brave civilians overthrowing mad dictators, but the truth of the matter is that the Arab Spring was a giant astroturfing campaign, involving the CIA, the Military-Industrial Complex, NGOs and wealthy financiers. The Open Society Foundation, CANVAS/Otpor, Human Righs Watch, National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, and various other NGOs have willingly acted as limbs of the shadow government. George Soros is central to it. He bankrolled CANVAS and they, along with several other NGOs, trained middle-easterners as agents provocateurs before sending them back to their own countries to stir up trouble as "grassroots activists":

        http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/15aid.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof is in the pudding: Marko Papic's leaked Stratfor emails in the Wikileaks Global Intelligence Files, describing groups like CANVAS as "export-a-revolution" groups:

        https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=1767848
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Marko Papic is friends with Srdja Popovic, of CANVAS, who wrote this book:

        https://www.amazon.com/Blueprint-Revolution-Nonviolent-Techniques-Communities/dp/0812995309
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While the crisis was at its peak, the mainstream media continually referred to how Arab Spring-related demonstration and riots were organized online, using social media. The Snowden leaks, a couple years later, showed that the Five Eyes actively manipulate social media to sway public opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/">
        https://theintercept.com/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The same techniques, when combined with false online identities, could be used to organize a demonstration from the comfort of one's office, thousands of miles away from where it is set to actually take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet and social media are being used as vectors for weaponized propaganda from the East and the West alike. You cannot trust anything that you hear. The internet's usefulness as a place of free, unadulterated discourse has been polluted and perverted by intelligence agencies and special interest groups and their wealthy donors.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the endgame, here? Well, it's a number of things, from several competing interests with a stake in the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       One possibility is currency manipulation so certain parties can hit it big on the forex market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing is pipeline strife in Syria with Russia, with Russia not wanting a competitor for Gazprom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, Israel and its western intelligence agency allies are obviously trying to destabilize various nations that were their enemies during the Yom Kippur War, as a prelude to eventually dismantling Iran. They're trying to isolate them and remove any potential Iranian allies from the playing field.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a dangerous game our leaders are playing, and with Russia on the ground in Syria and Trump stepping up tensions with North Korea, it's looking like we're headed straight back to the damn Cold War, with WWIII looming right around the corner.

       Pretty much all there OP nice job. Though I would like to add that soaring food and oil prices were the triggers.

      <p>
       Lastly, the Arab Springs backfired badly, specially in Egypt where Obama was then seen as an unreliable ally leading to many gulf states to take lead roles in post-Arab Spring states, which would lead to even more strife among supposedly allied players.

       That's where the pipeline angle comes from. The Gulf States want an even bigger slice of the energy pie, because that's the only way they're going to be able to maintain their current luxuries in the coming post-oil world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The skyrocketing food prices in the Middle East leading up to the Arab Spring were largely a product of the Corn Ethanol Subsidy in the US, which has been backed by numerous administrations. Yes, even Obama, and even Trump. Monsanto, ConAgra and Archer Daniels Midland are all involved in this, as are their wealthy shareholders and their own interests. Which really makes me wonder if some player
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       that the subsidy would drive food prices up, and deliberately pushed it through to starve people out, in a kind of economic siege using globalism as the vector.

CANVAS is basically the same as OTPOR.
       </p>
       <p>
        OTPOR (means resistance) were a group of students from Belgrade who took down Milosevic. They were tangentially connected to U.S funding sources like NED, Freedom House and the Albert Einstein Institute and, through them, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of State. BUT, the US funding sources more lached on to them after realizing their potency than other way around.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The relationship between US NGOs and OTPOR was forged in the toppling of Milosevic's reign, and obviously continued on into the present. Soros was involved in that one, too:

       For the record, I
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       recommend getting tunnel vision about Soros and focusing exclusively upon him. There are hundreds, even thousands of other players involved in this who have just as much of a stake in it, but aren't household names. Some would probably gladly throw him under the bus if they didn't think it would backfire on them.

       You mentioned "five eyes" (but omitted Israel = 6th eye). In whichever case, you're directly aiming your missive missiles at Soros and democratic-activist NGOs, as if they are the tools of
       <strong>
        government-sponsored
       </strong>
       sting / spy operations. These NGOs might be tools, but
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       in the sense that they have been co-opted by the state-sponsored spy organisations mentioned (6 eyes). You're overriding message that these NGOs are Soros-approved, state-sponsored tools is thus biased and bunk.

       If your objection is because Soros funds good left-wing causes, too, or because it looks like I have an axe to grind, I assure you; I consider myself to be on the far-left. I object to valid left-wing causes - human rights, democracy, and civil liberties - being puppeteered by intelligence agencies and wealthy plutocrats and used as a tool to destroy the lives of the innocent.

       There is a big difference between "puppeteered" and "co-opted". Have you ever heard of COINTELPRO?

       And what is your point, exactly? If you actually look at what I posted there, you would see that I was voicing concerns that some actual bad actors may be trying to infiltrate valid causes. It's the same deal here. What, are we not permitted to speak with our ideological opponents? Is everyone supposed to just huddle over in a corner and engage in groupthink? That's not how free and open discourse should work.

       And yes, I know what COINTELPRO is.

       The real question is: Is it in the process of happening here?? Are all these.protests and marches organic? If you were someone sitting in another country watching the news about all the uprisings in the U.S., might you think it looked the same as the beginning of the Arab Spring? People should think about this and question why they're doing and saying what they are. If they're participating in a potential "divide and conquer" that's happening here.

       i can get behind the idea (and believe in it too), my main question i guess is - werent most those arab countries under pretty friendly (relatively speaking) regimes? even if "undemocratic"? was it a test run? pure play to loot &amp; profit of war cos fuck it?

       What was really telling was the use of the R2P, the "Responsibility to Protect", as an excuse to send the US to war in Libya, enforcing a "no-fly zone" which involved bombarding ground targets that had absolutely nothing to do with aircraft or supporting aerial operations. All of this was done without approval by Congress, unilaterally. So, basically, the US Army is now under the full control of foreign financial interests. This is something that should scare not only Americans, but anyone who might be a target of said financial interests. The R2P is a hypocritical piece of international law that disproportionately affects third-world countries and allows for their sovereignty to be abrogated without declaring war. If there were an uprising in the United States, would EU member nations be expected to bomb the continental US if the government suppressed it? Obviously not. Rules for thee, but not for me. That's R2P in a nutshell.

       i mean Libya they had reasons tbh (petro dollar, gold etc). just the others seemed unnecessary.

       wonder if at that point they had already planned to cause european demise via mass invasion of "refugees" from newly created war torn conditions (again, more $ from war)

       Well, it's not just the demise of Europe. The powers-that-be can't have people becoming wealthy and successful, because that means that they wouldn't need their financial services anymore. They need more debtors, and for that, they need an underclass. The refugees seem like a ready-made underclass. We should be asking our governments why they are trying to make millions of people homeless in order to line the pockets of fat cats.
