<p>No it wouldn&#39;t. Evolution says: that back then (and longer back) they were somewhat primitive (ie. Uga uga I bam bam u hed wit stik).</p>

<p>Structures such as these require immense knowledge of various sciences. Hell, we can not even recreate some of the shit from ancient times, with our modern tech/knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we have found enough evidence to suggest they had simple tools, and we cannot forget about the cave paintings in France that suggested they had an understanding of modern art concepts like perspective. </p>

<p>Alongside this ( and possibly predating ) we have ancient sites that yes, we cannot replicate today. So I imagine much like today, there was a disparity of knowledge and technical ability for whatever reason. </p>

<p>It&#39;s impossible to talk about these subjects without failing to mention the ice age. It&#39;s likely that a few communities kept their knowledge in tact all throughout the ice age. They became hubs of knowledge for the redeveloping world. </p>

<p>I would speculate that a lot of advanced societies existed prior to the last ice age. This would account for the coastal civilizations that are all underwater now. Look at Yonaguni for one example. </p>

<p>Anyway, if there were advanced civilizations prior to the ice age, it&#39;s hard to imagine that many sites would be leftover after miles of ice ground them to dust, and then theres the simple passage of time. It may sound convenient that there&#39;s &quot;no evidence&quot; but I think we should keep this in mind when we find seemingly advanced artifacts &quot;misplaced&quot; outside of established, known about, advanced communities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they&#39;re hiding things or don&#39;t want ordinary citizens to understand true history? The Pyramids used to align perfectly with Orions Belt in the cosmos. The builders of the Pyramids did this to give an exact date of when they were created. We did the same thing with the Hoover Dam, aligning it with the stars to tell future civilizations it&#39;s true date. I think it hasto do with events that happened 12, 13 thousand years ago and great mass extinctions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should educate yourself more on the history of the pyramids. They are not a mystery.</p>

<p>Egyptian society is 8000 years old. After about 3000 years their kings became obsessed with reincarnation. They believed that they needed a home when they were reincarnated. The first monument of this kind was just a 20 foot high wall that surrounded the kings burial site. </p>

<p>That monument was cool, but his some wanted something bigger, so he build a rectangular wall, put a ceiling on it and then built another wall on top of that. This was the first &#39;stepped pyramid&#39;. There were a few more of these before the great pyramid at Giza was built.</p>

<p>After the great pyramid tons of pyramids were built for around a thousand years. Archaeologists have been all over these and there is tons of details about who built them and how.</p>

<p>One common misconception is that they were built by slaves. In actuality they were mostly built by  volunteers. Egyptians were religious fanatics and working on a pyramid was like going to mecca.</p>

<p>Inside the pyramids they left not just their garbage, their shit, their footprints and occasionally their bodies from workplace disasters. They also left a lot of graffiti. The graffiti mostly says things like &#39;Imhotep was here&#39; or &#39;The River Phoenix crew is the best crew!&#39;</p>

<p>The idea that they are anything other than what they appear is not supported by any evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>AFAIK it is still the accepted view. I mean it&#39;s pretty hard to argue with well done archaeology. And when you have graffiti saying &quot;I built this thing&quot; and yet you want to believe that it&#39;s not true....i dunno but it sounds like some pretty low effort thinking.</p>

<p>Egypt had written records. We still have those records. They <em>said</em> they built the pyramids. They told us how they did it. The drew pictures. They left and incredibly detailed archaeological record. </p>

<p>I really think that anyone who ignores all of that evidence in order to hold on to a fantasy is just a mental child.</p>

<p>But my claim is based on a preponderance of evidence. I mean we have 8000 years of archaeological history showing a fairly simple culture evolving into a great civilization. The sphinx is one thing, with some weird anomalous details. But in the other column we have millions of data points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think wikipedia is a really good place to start researching a topic you don&#39;t know much about. The point is not to trust the source of the information, but wikipedia gives you a relatively stable point from which to start investigating the different sides.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in trusting any source of information. That&#39;s why I&#39;m into cryptocurrency projects - they are based on mediating trust-less interactions. </p>

<p>But everyone knows wikipedia, and therefore no one who is vested in a subject ignores it&#39;s wikipedia entry. When you read wikipedia you know you are seeing the grudging compromise of many people with different perspectives. It&#39;s a good middle ground and helps you figure out what to look into next.</p>

<p>By reading that article I see that there are at least two major schools of thought on the matter. One is the standard Egyptology thoughts on the age and the other is an archaeologist who thinks there is physical evidence of the Sphinx&#39;s date being off by 1000 years.</p>

<p>Based on this thread I know some people think it is much older, as much as 50,000 years old. In the past when I have followed links that make these claims they are on silly websites about physics and channeling. I don&#39;t give any credence to those beliefs any more than I do any other religion. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean it is a closed deal. I would love to see evidence of the Sphinx being super old. I think that would be incredible. I&#39;ve agreed to look into the Graham Hancock dude, but if he is just making shit up then I do think you guys are a bunch of suckers.</p>

<p>I also think we need to address the preponderance of evidence that just doesn&#39;t make sense if there were another more Ancient Egypt. We have archaeological evidence of primitive people living in the area before the Ancient Egyptians. We can see their stuff. Am I supposed to believe that they lived with the other Ancient Ancient Egyptians but somehow only the Primitive Egyptians stuff can be found?</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard to swallow.</p>

<p>Schoch is a Yale educated Geologist and associate professor, and so if you hold archaeology in high regard, I imagine you&#39;re more likely to listen to a geologist.</p>

<p>Going back to your original statement, you said that Egyptian&#39;s were religious fanatics. And it wasn&#39;t slaves that built that pyramids. Does that discount the &quot;you have the option of dying or volunteering&quot; kinda of situation? It seems like a bit of a stretch to assume manual labor of that degree is based on religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I completely disagree with your statement on Wikipedia. If you are someone that seeks truth, the first thing you should do is ignore a user edited website that tells is clearly manipulated to tell the version of history that is most palatable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion is not really an exact enough word. There were no other societies around when Egypt developed a civilization so their were no other religions. There were stone age people and there was Egypt. Everything that was worth considering was basically Egyptian and so their concepts of identify, life, death, property, order all of that could be wrapped up in one concept. The Pharaoh was a living god who lead everything.</p>

<p>And when the Nile flooded, people had to evacuate to the desert and order was kept through the priesthood based state. During the monument building period people were organized by their neighborhoods back home and they worked on incredible monuments that anyone would have been proud to work on. They didn&#39;t need to be compelled. They were fed and in their beliefs the Pharaoh kept chaos at bay.</p>

<p>No, because I am just a guy responding with things I have learned. I like talking to you, but I definitely don&#39;t have time to go find references for all the knowledge in my head. </p>

<p>If you read actual archaeology reports you will find that they are sited, documented and peer reviewed. It&#39;s a competitive field. It&#39;s not like any two archaeologists agree on everything. </p>

<p>Go be an archaeologist. Digs <em>need</em> volunteers. You can learn for yourself that these people are truth seekers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not either. I just call bullshit when someone comes in and says, &quot;I&#39;m a psychic and the pyramids are 50,000 years old. Archaeologists are all lying to you because they hate knowing things&quot;</p>

<p>And that is most of what pseudo-archaeology is. It&#39;s people making stuff up without doing their homework and ignoring the great effort made by people who are doing the work.</p>

<p>But not all of it. I&#39;m driven by a desire to uncover more history and people have been around for a long time. I want to believe I just think real archaeology is the best way to find this information and I wonder who really benefits when r/conspiracy thinks archaeology is fake.</p>

<p>Its a couple of hours long but at the very least it lays out clearly what the accepted history of egypt is. From there you can challenge or question whatever details you want.</p>

<p>The tl;dr.... once a upon a time there were Bedouins who spent the rainy season at a lake that appears in the desert when it rained. The climate changes and the rains never came again. They wandered in the desert until they found the nile valley. There they created the first great civilization. </p>

<p>The evidence of all this is normal archaeology stuff - site sin the desert and the valley with lots of details that can be dated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I dont see where you are going with it. It might be exciting but thats because there is a lot of interpretation. If I live in a 500 year old house, and &#39;poop&#39; in the garde  and in a thousand years someone finds my poop, by your logic the archeologist will date that house at 1000 years old give or take. Which would not be accurate.</p>

<p>So someone can find poop or pollun or lichen on a rock but by no means is that verifiable proof of the structure around it. </p>

<p>What written records are you referring too? I have been to Egypt three times and each time a certain piece in the museum was given a different description. We dont actually know 100% what the hyroglyphs mean, it remains a best guess. Egyptology has held a monopoly on the story because it benefits Egypt.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say I find your poop in the garden near your house. Does that tell me how old your house it? No. </p>

<p>Now lets say I find your body encased in the foundation of your house? Then lets say I try to determine if your body could have been placed in the foundation after it was built and prove that no, it <em>had</em> to be there before the foundation was poured. </p>

<p>If I did all of that and then carbon dated your body, would you agree that the house could not be older than the body? </p>

<p>Now how about if I found around 100 such pieces of data around your house. And lets say using have a dozen different dating techniques we found that all 100 pieces of data agreed that your house was about 1000 years old. </p>

<p>And then I find the 500 year old poop. What that tells me is that someone pooped next to a house that was already 500 years old when they pooped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree. Unless a space was cut into the foundation of the house after it was poured. Then it wouldnt be true.</p>

<p>What bodies were found in the foundation if the pyramids? I am aware of chambers. I am aware that Ehyptologists have blocked invetigation of chambers thay have been found beneath the Great Pyramid amd the Sphinx by sonar. I am aware they ceased the German exploration of other internal chambers using the robot that got so far, found a door then the scientists lost thier visas. I am not aware of any bodies being found in the foundation.</p>

<p>Using the anaology that it is detective work takes it further from science and closer to humanities. You are basically stating it is down to personal interpretation of evidence that cant be tested. Thats why detectives have forensic scientists come in to verify. Archeology doesnt really have that kind of scientific support to hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? Alright I&#39;ll be honest, I think I just have no idea what you think or want. I certainly don&#39;t think the ancient Egyptians were inferior to modern man. I think they were modern man. They were the first great civilization in the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say, that I could agree with that.  Even just focusing on the Sphinx being extra old is still pretty counter to mainstream Egyptian models.    But it seems possible.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t giving archaeologists enough credit.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say I find your poop in the garden near your house. Does that tell me how old your house it? No. </p>

<p>Now lets say I find your body encased in the foundation of your house? Then lets say I try to determine if your body could have been placed in the foundation after it was built and prove that no, it <em>had</em> to be there before the foundation was poured. </p>

<p>If I did all of that and then carbon dated your body, would you agree that the house could not be older than the body? </p>

<p>Now how about if I found around 100 such pieces of data around your house. And lets say using have a dozen different dating techniques we found that all 100 pieces of data agreed that your house was about 1000 years old. </p>

<p>And then I find the 500 year old poop. What that tells me is that someone pooped next to a house that was already 500 years old when they pooped.</p>

<p>Archaeologists aren&#39;t a bunch of hacks. They are detectives.</p>

<p>Honestly I like to think that what we do here on this sub is a sort of archaeology. </p>
