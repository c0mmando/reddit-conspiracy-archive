       Meaning, are they just putting on a fake show for us? Basically, they make it look like the front runner is hated by the establishment yet he somehow wins. Now the people believe the antiestablishment guy is at the top but in reality he is an establishment plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way the people back him the whole time regardless of what he does while being fooled that the establishment is at war with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This back and forth confusion goes on for 8 years and Trump ruins it all in the end just like our previous presidents have. At that point we realize Trump was against us the whole time only to be fooled yet again by another establishment plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is what's happening but IF the cabal has once again fooled us, this would be the most sensible theory on how they are doing it.

       We live in a constant state of confusion, so wouldn't surprise. Which is why I didn't vote, nor will I ever. I also do not support government, because this is the kind of shit you get when you have government... Tis' all bread and circus, not sure why many others do/did not see this.

       The guy who is a master at whipping up anti-establishment sentiment in favor of a political candidate is Roger Stone, Trumps right hand man. Check out Stone's connections to Roy Cohn and the deep state.

       He's not an establishment plant, but he -

       the establishment and
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       the media - has only one ideology and modus operandi: greed.  Greed is a zero sum game.  You can't care about the people you're looting or the country/planet you're exploiting to the point of exhaustion or collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the media, Trump gets ratings, ratings = profit, and thanks to Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, the news is an organ of transnationals and as such, the sole objective of a news division is to generate profit for the parent company's shareholders.  The fact that anything involving trump - especially anything controversial - is the lead story every fucking night is a direct function of greed.

       Trump's zio owners are actually in panic mode.  The allegedly dumb sheep worked out Trump in a few weeks after he took office.  The hatred and disgust is tangible.  So the zio owned media is now trying to shore up Trump's stocks, believe it or not, whereas prior and for a while after the election, the media was still pretending to pan Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing Trump has achieved is to point the spotlight directly at Zionism and Israel as responsible.  Which is why money's being injected into positive online commentary about Trump.  It's not working though. People know who owns Trump and more are voicing it every day, worldwide.  (((They))) went to far.  They always do.  Trump is dog-dirt in the eyes of the vast majority.  And so are his masters

       I don't think it's all theater, because the theater started long before he was elected, and he was put in the role of "sure loser" to HRC. That didn't happen, so I think what they're doing now is honest and desperate – quite often more absurd than imaginable.

       Eh I think they didn't expect Trump to win but they had a plan for it just in case... The confusion among the democrats and the feigned sincerity of Jill Steins push for a "recount" was evidence enough for me of them trying to push the public into wanting to overthrow our president. (lol if only they would set a precedent like that for us. Then we would feel empowered to do so with any corrupt fucker.. anyway..) But I think Trump quickly realized how far the Corporation called the US Government will go to get its way. I think he fell in line and is playing by their rules since the time he had his son get a ride from Secret Service and they snapped inappropriate photo's on purpose. That was probably the sign to him that "if you don't play along we will kill your family, it's that easy for us".
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may be smart at getting ratings and manipulating public opinion but he is far from having the know how of engineering the type of social manipulation that is being pulled off right now. He is 100% following orders of the zionists and/or globalists. His 180 on all campaign promises was either him being defeated or being a pawn all along. There isn't any 4d chess going on right now. Until the public wakes up as a whole there is no hope of destroying the evil that controls our country. I believe Assange is under the same type of duress. No one is allowed to know about their super secret child rape parties and human trafficking schemes. So they most likely were going to murder his family if he released anything further concerning Hilary and Podesta's involvement in these affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just my personal opinions but all signs point to two likely conclusions. Trump was controlled opposition from the start. Or wanted to do some good and was soundly defeated once getting into the foray. These psychopaths abuse emotions and use them against their enemies any way they can. They lack empathy and are willing to murder to cover up anything they don't want known. With a completely controlled press it is too easy for them, and our first steps should be to take our press back.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is in bed with the Jews and most likely Israel along with China. That is probably who are supporting him and allowed him to get this far up the political ladder. The China hard talk was most likely theatre as well. I wouldn't be surprised if Kushner was sent in to marry into the family and position Trump for a takeover of the "deep state". Infighting between the elites only lets us know that something big is coming and only a few are going to be calling the shots. They are not even concerned with hiding their dirty laundry anymore and to me it makes it all the more plausible that a major recession and or great worldwide depression is coming, but that is just personal opinion here. They are harping for war so bad because it is an easy fix to the bubble that is about to burst. And without money, internet, and tv the general public will be outraged and very quickly will realize the government doesn't give two shits about them.

       This vid goes into the political usefulness of keeping the situation confusing, theatrical. I find it an interesting parallel - Mr Art Of The Deal is quite savvy with Apprentice/MissAmerica theatrics, many of his former t_d fans are bewildered by his willy-nilliness &amp; they are becoming vocal, and it isn't hard to imagine that he has producers on his real team that know what this Surkov guy is on about. Studying Surkov could give insights on what Trump may be able to accomplish,
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       there is intentionality to his theatrical confusion.
