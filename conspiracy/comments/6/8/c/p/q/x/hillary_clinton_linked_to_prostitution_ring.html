<p>&quot;Eric McFadden, who was Hillary&#39;s Catholic liaison in the primaries, was arrested yesterday forrunning a prostitution ring. The transition political people know.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-16-catholic-prostitution_N.htm">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-01-16-catholic-prostitution_N.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/ytkrx">http://archive.is/ytkrx</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>He has been charged with seven felonies, including pandering obscenities involving a minor, promoting prostitution and compelling prostitution, according to a Columbus Police Department spokesman.</p>

<hr/>

<p>&quot;He is someone that had been engaged in work in the faith community for a long time and was someone very known by people in the faith community, and that led to his hire,&quot; said Keith Dailey, Strickland&#39;s spokesman. Dailey called McFadden &quot;well-regarded.&quot; McFadden had been co-founder and national field director for the Catholic Alliance for the Common Good, a grassroots organization based in suburban Columbus</p>

<hr/>

<p>These sick freaks always seem to look like charitable Godly people on the surface. They build up trust within their communities. Behind everyone&#39;s back, they are practicing unbelievable acts. It&#39;s so horrifying. You never know who you can trust.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This is what he was really like...</p>

<hr/>

<p>Police believe McFadden was the man they have been looking for in connection with an online prostitution ring that was run from craigslist.com, according to a report on the website of Columbus television station WCMH. Police cracked the ring when men involved in a website that posts reviews of prostitutes held a raffle for sex at a brothel near downtown Columbus.</p>

<hr/>

<p>For years, police have noticed a man involved in prostitute discussion boards under the names of Sullivant Guy, Broad Street Guy and Toby, according to a report in the Columbus Dispatch. They now apparently believe that man is McFadden. Two others were also arrested in connection with the ring.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;d like to see &quot;important&quot; or maybe even &quot;new evidence&quot; flair on this post. This email link has not been submitted here before.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>I guess that Hillary Clinton must have ordered a background check on McFadden before having him as liaison, revealing his interest towards young females, so knowing about this in advance. This leads to an important question: Was Hillary Clinton protecting a pedophile?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Police also note that on McFadden’s online posts, he claimed to be the “guru” of prostitution in Columbus, Ohio. He wrote reviews on prostitution services as well as advice on how not to get caught, reports NBC 4. source</p>

<hr/>

<p>NBC 4 has deleted the article (redirecting link) mentioned as a source above</p>

<hr/>

<p>Archive of that NBC 4 post is compromised as well, a snapshot was taken but...</p>

<p><a href="http://www2.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/crime/article/dublin_man_sentenced_for_promoting_minor_as_prostitute/20489/">http://www2.nbc4i.com/cmh/news/crime/article/dublin_man_sentenced_for_promoting_minor_as_prostitute/20489/</a> | 02:39:58 December 08, 2014</p>

<p>I got an HTTP 301 response at crawl time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did find a quote of that NBC 4 article claiming he got ONLY 1 YEAR IN PRISON:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A former member of Governor Strickland’s cabinet soon will be headed to prison on charges related to prostitution. Robert Eric McFadden was arrested Wednesday, Jan. 14, after police said he helped promote an online prostitution ring. Columbus vice detectives said McFadden was the “guru” of Columbus prostitution and ran Web Sites that evaluated local prostitutes. McFadden of Dublin was sentenced on two felony charges of compelling prostitution of a minor Thursday. McFadden was sentenced to one year in prison after he pleaded guilty to the charges a month ago. He also must register as a Tier-II sexual offender for the next 25 years. source</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to engage anyone who disputes that there is a large shill presence for both sides on this sub. Nor anyone who condescendingly tries to imply I can&#39;t believe people might disagree with me then proceeds to feed me the pathetic line about providing proof for a court of law.</p>

<p>You&#39;re in r/conspiracy. Asking for irrefutable proof of conspiracies here is tantamount to running into the set of a kids show and screaming in terror that it&#39;s all fake and scripted. How ridiculous that behavior is here, and it&#39;s proof you don&#39;t know wtf this sub is about. Not to mention the idiotic fact that if anyone had irrefutable proof for or against this or pizzagate or any of it then it would be settled and no longer worthy of the sub anyways. I mean Jesus, dude.  </p>

<p>I, and many others, believe this shit to be true. Sure we (right wingers) hate the left in its current form. Sure, it&#39;s likely that despite Trump having many enemies, Reddit is largely influenced to see Trump as more hated than he really is thanks to shills, censorship and corporate media. But when I see people like the ones who have invaded the sub only to behave completely different than the usual subscriber and to talk nonstop about the invasion of t_d anytime something anti left is brought up then to act like everyone should think it&#39;s totally normal for leftist speech to be considered correct while gilding each other and causing strange voting patterns... well then sir all I can say is, you might not be fake. But even so, most of them are. And it has jack shit to do with me being disagreed with.</p>

<p>Now go ahead and respond that my wall of text is ridiculous and how ignorant Trump supporters are and how we brigaded the sub and how there is just nothing to see here but Trump brigade bots. Be sure to point out how we can&#39;t seem to understand that most rational people even on this sub think pizzagate is stupid while you concern troll by admitting something obvious that makes it seem like you belong like how &quot;you aren&#39;t a Hillary fan either&quot; or some other nonsense.</p>

<p>I am asking for some hard evidence. Any argument you have saying it isn&#39;t possible is mere immature deflection on your end. You can&#39;t make wild assertions and than act like it&#39;s ridiculous to expect people to ask for some evidence of your claims. </p>

<p>Yeah, if people had evidence it would be being reported. Sort of like the Trump conspiracy you right-wingers ignore because you yourself admitted you hate the left. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re blinded by your partisan politics and are only interested in perpetuating a political hit job, regardless of facts or evidence.   </p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation? Is there a reported story by a reputable source that should raise my eyebrows over what they did? Or is this more of the Pizzagate emails level of evidence? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Already there have been sweeping arrests of child traffickers and pormographers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because those people always existed. I don&#39;t see how just because they exist automatically makes whoever you decide is guilty. It&#39;s called <em>evidence</em> for a reason. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To imply that PG might be real is far from wild and baseless</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty wild and baseless. The fact that I need to continually ask for any real, reputable, actual evidence. One that doesn&#39;t require me to use your code to re-translate an email into what you assure me it actually means. </p>

<p>Real evidence. I shouldn&#39;t need to ask over and over only to met with your typed up assurances. Surely you have some, if not, your allegations are the definition of wild and baseless. </p>

<p>You and others defending them without asking for a thorough investigation is the real mystery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes. It&#39;s a real mystery to demand evidence of your damning accusations prior to wasting tax payer money on an investigation you wouldn&#39;t even believe because facts and evidence don&#39;t mean anything to you from the beginning anyway. </p>

<p>What the mystery here is why your standards are so low and why you think any reasonable, intelligent person should lower their also. Common sense, logic, reason, these are all important traits. </p>

<p>Those aren&#39;t traits you find on Infowars and through Alex Jones. </p>

I&#39;m not going to entertain your bullshit demands because I&#39;m a simple man who doesn&#39;t go to tilfoil hat parties and call everyone out. I believe that there is a very well documented child abuse system in Hollywood that is frequented by powerful people including politicians. I feel that I have seen enough to believe that the Clintons are part of that machine and that it is very likely they are involved in horrible shit.

<p>...Trump did what now? Are we crediting Trump with breaking up some elite pedophiia ring all of a sudden? How do these goalposts keep moving without you providing any semblance of evidence? </p>

<p>Yes, this is a subreddit about conspiracies. That doesn&#39;t mean when you make a hypothesis that you consistently circlejerk and obsess over that one specific one. You need to use evidence to build on it, or it&#39;s proven wrong, debunked, etc. </p>

<p>You seem very overly defensive when asked for simple evidence to substantiate your far reaching allegations. There is far more evidence that the current White House is compromised and an actual conspiracy is taking place in the form of obvious nepotism then there is anything about Pizzagate. </p>

<p>I find it very strange you think there is some sort litmus test or purity test to be here. Is there something wrong with breaking down your argument line by line and addressing your points? Does a cohesive argument threaten you? Is skepticism not welcome here? </p>

<p>Is that what I was doing?

<p>I did? What legit investigation am I in opposition to? Once again you&#39;re taking your conspiracies to new heights where everyone around the corner is only what you assume them to be, regardless of facts or reason. </p>

<p>Your personal opinion is not what a fact is, and it&#39;s not the dominant factor in our shared reality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and if this kind of constant stream of accusations and circumstantial evidence existed around Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is literally an FBI investigation confirmed into Trump and his campaign. Trump is a well-known and widely hated real estate owner in NYC. </p>

<p>Trump has a former Goldman Sachs banker turned media propagandist on his National Security Council. Literally tons of actual circumstantial and <strong>proven</strong> evidence is there, yet you&#39;re turning a blind eye to it and engaging in blatant character assassination whenever someone asks you for anything close to the same level of credibility in your accusations against liberal politicians. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you will be asking for proof of everything posted here just as often since of course there is no way you&#39;re overly invested ONLY on this topic</p>

<p>I ask for evidence of any accusation or conspiracy as a general rule. Why wouldn&#39;t I want proof of a claim? Or do you think conspiracy theories are some sort of religion where blind faith and adherence is the only thing that&#39;s important? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t care though, because I have you pegged and that&#39;s all I needed to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fine. You can peg me as whatever it is you want to imagine. The reality is that you&#39;re incapable of providing any proof to your claims and engage in hostile character assassination and slander at the first sight of any questioning to your narrative and world view. The same way a religious extremist lashes out when you question their beliefs. </p>

<p>You still don&#39;t understand the point.  Every single one of us struggle with cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other things.  It&#39;s part of being human.  The difference between you and I is that I will earnestly recognize my biases and attempt keep myself honest.  Instead of engaging in meaningful discourse, you immediately became adversarial and avoided the question entirely.  You&#39;ve still avoided answering the question when it was basically a litmus test for self awareness and you have shown yourself for what you are.</p>

<p>here&#39;s the thing. in the real world politics isn&#39;t just about circlejerking about how much of an expert you are. like say, hillary clinton did.</p>

<p>it&#39;s about decision making that usually disadvantages one or more parties to the benefit of others. you can&#39;t simultaneously pursue outsourcing policies that benefit the 1% while protecting middle class jobs in america.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>&quot;This shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has followed politics in recent years. Society, fuelled by hyperpartisan news outlets and social media echo chambers, has created alternative realities for us to inhabit, full of self-reinforcing platitudes and free of any pesky information that might upset fragile world views.&quot;</p>

<p>I read this the other day and it said, so succinctly, what I had been worrying about for over a year.  All of us struggle with things like confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance because it&#39;s part of human nature.  Recently, however, it seems that it&#39;s acceptable to only visit places that won&#39;t challenge your views and essentially become willing sheep.</p>

<p>I know that Clinton has done some fucked up things.  I also recognize that Republicans have baselessly attacked her for more than twenty years.  I don&#39;t just believe things about her because I want to.  I require evidence and objectivity when discussing whether or not she is responsible for something, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case for many others.  That kind of mentality does, in fact worry me.  Doesn&#39;t it worry you?</p>

<p>Bill and Hillary studied and practiced vodoo in Hati.</p>

<p>Canabilism in hati goes hand in hand with vodoo rituals.</p>

<p>You really need to do some basic research on Kuru.  It is untreatable and once symptoms begin appearing, you have a year at most to live.  There are no cures.  Prion diseases are terrifying and it&#39;s apparent that anyone who has made the claim that &quot;Clinton has Kuru&quot; has no understanding of the disease.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I like this board.  I&#39;m a skeptic at heart and end up attempting to disprove or call into question several of the conspiracies on this board, but it&#39;s still interesting to entertain the idea.  Essentially force myself to confront ideas and notions that I espouse and I walk away with a more informed opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No you&#39;re absolutely right I don&#39;t know enough about the disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just a quick heads up;  An admission of ignorance earns a great deal of respect from me.  There aren&#39;t a while lot of folks who will do that on this board.  Either way, read up on Kuru and diseases involving prions if you want to scare the shit out of yourself.  They&#39;re horrifying diseases and once you find out that a prion is basically a misfolded protein... pray that one is never transmitted via air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of people on this board who have a thirst for knowledge and truth outside of the mainstream. A large portion of the time it&#39;s heresay or baloney,  so it&#39;s important to have healthy scepticism in a board like this</p>

<p>And I&#39;m sure the excitement you may recieve from running into a theory that stumps you is worth sifting through the bs. </p>

<p>I love to learn and if someone can present me with an irrefutable position I&#39;ll gladly admit I&#39;m wrong! It means I&#39;ve now learned a new thing. 
I&#39;ll be reading on Prion diseases right after my school reading, thanks!</p>

<p>Take Mark Foley for example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mark Foley scandal, which broke in late September 2006, centers on soliciting e-mails and sexually suggestive instant messages sent by Mark Foley, a Republican Congressman from Florida, to teenaged boys who had formerly served as congressional pages. Investigation was closed by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) on September 19, 2008 citing insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges as both &quot;Congress and Mr. Foley denied us access to critical data&quot;, said FDLE Commissioner Gerald Bailey.[1] The scandal grew to encompass the response of Republican congressional leaders to previous complaints about Foley&#39;s contacts with the pages and inconsistencies in the leaders&#39; public statements.[2][3][4][5][6] There were also allegations that a second Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe, had improper conduct with at least two youths, a 16-year-old page and a recently graduated page.[7][8]</p>

<ul>
<li>Lied about relationships with foreign governments</li>
<li>Lied about financial ties to the Russian government and mafia by Trump&#39;s son&#39;s own admission.</li>
<li>Lied about meetings with foreign elites in order to gain security clearance</li>
<li>Glaringly obvious nepotism</li>

<p>Amen.  I keep getting this &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; vibe from this subreddit and that&#39;s pretty odd.  It&#39;s totally fine to practice whatever religion best fits you, but there seems to be this pearl clutching evangelical group of prudes that have taken root here.  It&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t really expect to see.</p>

<p>Ugh, especially when they&#39;re accusing someone of having Kuru.  This usually pertains to Clinton, but it&#39;s something that is easily disproved with a basic google search about the prion disease.  It seems like it&#39;s become more frequent that people just &quot;want to believe&quot; something and not really have the knowledge in the subject to back up their opinion.  That, in my opinion, is the epitome of intellectual dishonesty.</p>

<p>I really hope that the FBI got to the servers first, but I fear that he was able to delete the evidence.</p>

<p>Luckily me and lots of other anons collected lots of evidence at <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/9578637.html">https://8ch.net/pol/res/9578637.html</a> (NSFL!) and <a href="https://voat.co/v/tribenet">https://voat.co/v/tribenet</a> (NSFL!).

<p>Nor anyone who condescendingly tries to imply I can&#39;t believe people might disagree with me then proceeds to feed me the pathetic line about providing proof for a court of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I said preferably. Or at least evidence that is something more than an email taken out of context into a secret code that you insist it must mean. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re in r/conspiracy. Asking for irrefutable proof of conspiracies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am asking for some hard evidence. Any argument you have saying it isn&#39;t possible is mere immature deflection on your end. You can&#39;t make wild assertions and than act like it&#39;s ridiculous to expect people to ask for some evidence of your claims. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the idiotic fact that if anyone had irrefutable proof for or against this or pizzagate or any of it then it would be settled and no longer worthy of the sub anyways. I mean Jesus, dude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, if people had evidence it would be being reported. Sort of like the Trump conspiracy you right-wingers ignore because you yourself admitted you hate the left. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re blinded by your partisan politics and are only interested in perpetuating a political hit job, regardless of facts or evidence.   </p>

<p>In the end, you oppose investigation and that is shitty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did? What legit investigation am I in opposition to? Once again you&#39;re taking your conspiracies to new heights where everyone around the corner is only what you assume them to be, regardless of facts or reason. </p>

<p>Your personal opinion is not what a fact is, and it&#39;s not the dominant factor in our shared reality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and if this kind of constant stream of accusations and circumstantial evidence existed around Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is literally an FBI investigation confirmed into Trump and his campaign. Trump is a well-known and widely hated real estate owner in NYC. </p>

<p>Trump has a former Goldman Sachs banker turned media propagandist on his National Security Council. Literally tons of actual circumstantial and <strong>proven</strong> evidence is there, yet you&#39;re turning a blind eye to it and engaging in blatant character assassination whenever someone asks you for anything close to the same level of credibility in your accusations against liberal politicians. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure you will be asking for proof of everything posted here just as often since of course there is no way you&#39;re overly invested ONLY on this topic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I ask for evidence of any accusation or conspiracy as a general rule. Why wouldn&#39;t I want proof of a claim? Or do you think conspiracy theories are some sort of religion where blind faith and adherence is the only thing that&#39;s important? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just don&#39;t care though, because I have you pegged and that&#39;s all I needed to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fine. You can peg me as whatever it is you want to imagine. The reality is that you&#39;re incapable of providing any proof to your claims and engage in hostile character assassination and slander at the first sight of any questioning to your narrative and world view. The same way a religious extremist lashes out when you question their beliefs. </p>
