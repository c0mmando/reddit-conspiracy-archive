       I believe the right is promoting Christianity and vilifying science and education to keep people ignorant and complacent. While the leaders of the right thump the bible to rouse the rabble, they rape the land and line their pockets while the people pay the price with polluted lands and waters.

       And a SJW prevents education by promoting social causes (feminism for example) how? I'm not defending them, I'm just curious as to how they would impede education. Perhaps by forcing their narrative over another?

       Disregarding organs and chromosomes in such a way is an affront to science. Your "identity" is fine and dandy, you do you, but that hasn't really been the case. Completely tuning out the undeniable truth about what makes you genetically YOU is foolish at best, dangerous at worst

       No. I don't believe that is their intention, even if it may be an unintended consequence to whatever varying degree. It is human nature to want to be accepted, and we as humans should strive to find comfort in each others happiness, instead of being pre disposed to condemnation. However the varying degree that i mentioned, is that just now in time, are we at a point where we can medically and psychologically analyze where we are at. There are numerous case studies, only available now, detailing how a transgender person goes on a longer timeline. The information is very interesting, and disregarding it would be dangerous.

       We should strive to accept others, but in turn we must strive to accept ourselves

       Yep. And what I find most amazing is that there's a strong intersection between the best of the religious right and the best of the hippy dippy new age left. I'm familiar enough with both worlds to realize a lot of it is the bloody same thing when distilled to its key messages.

       At one point in time; you are absolutely correct
      </p>
      <p>
       Not today though. No real use for christianity anymore, doesn't have the same pull. Take another look around you. Establishment science is becoming the new religion, and it is blasphemous to question against the prophets nye and tyson. You are just suppose to accept whatever answer they spoon feed you, and you are an idiot if you choose to question any further.

       I can see that. The immediate accusations if someone denies climate change, etc. I can understand a resentment from some people there. But do you think that what has happened with science in the past twenty to thirty years equates to the hundreds of years of religious dogma and the effects of all that time?

       Hundreds? You're talking thousands. Without a doubt, religion has long had its teeth in society. I feel that christianity's grip is slipping though. Other religions seem to show a different reverence amongst us. Its less stigmatized to blaspheme against christianity than say, islam or judaism. You even would get less shit in public forum if you said "the bible is straight up bullshit and lies" than you would saying "but how certain are we vaccines are 100% safe?" You can completely shit on christianity and suffer less static as you would something else, but not 100 years ago. Its bite has significantly weakened over time.

       Let me ask you; do you live in a predominantly christian surrounding? I was raised catholic, and was so relieved how little of an impact christianity in general had over my life once i left home

       I do not live in a predominantly christian surrounding, no. Not anymore. I feel like I have seen both the religious side and the non. And while religion does not impact my life, I feel that religion and christianity in particular does influence many in the US. And while posting something against vaccines may not be well received by the general public, here in r/conspiracy it would probably be fine (I think?) but I am getting plenty of downvotes for this post.

       I think huge portions of the US vote along religious lines. In certain parts you cannot hold office if you are atheist. Our new administration is full of bible thumpers and the EPA is being gutted of protective measures (called "over regulation") so that the path can be paved for industry (factory owners) to make money. Religion drums up a lot of feverish voters (and throw in some islamaphobia for patriotism). And I feel like I am out on a limb writing this in this sub.

       I agree with what you say here. I suppose the question standing is whether those people truly believe in their brand of snake oil, or is it simple a means to an end? Maybe a little bit of both? Religion as a whole has severely stunted our species' progress throughout history, but then again, "progress" is a very ambiguous term

Move your ass to saudi arabia then come back &amp; tell me which predominately christian country is worse.  Fucking up the environment to drill for oil.  Denying science.  Beheadings.  Ok bro.

       I blame islam for not being tolerant of womens rights.  I do not accept beheading while a person is still alive an acceptable form of punishment.  Linda Sansour wants sharia friendly laws in the united states.  If i have to choose christianity or islam i choose christianity.  Modern islam causes more serious problems than modern christianity.  I have as much tolerance for islam as you do christianity.  Fuck islam.  Fuck christianity.  But fuck modetn islam.  Go watch some beheading videos.  Mexican drug cartels think its an acceptable form of punishment as well.  I have no tolerance for a religion that claims to be persecuted while ignoring its very serious flaws.  Christians are not beheading people that disagree with them.  Or fucking public stonings?  What is this shit?  Are we still living in biblical times?  Saudi's are on UN's human/womens rights watch group &amp; they still behead people.  Fuck your tolerance.  You should be condemning it.

       Well if we are going to bitch about religion lets make our focus on the fastest growing globally one spreading extremism.  Christianity, buddhism, hinduism... They all have their flaws but none are as bad as islam.  Judiasm outside of israel isnt as bad.  But fighting muslims because some old ass book says its your promised land is dumb as fuck when literally every other country surrounding your doesnt want you there so you get countries around the world to come to your defense when the peaceful solution is to get the fuck out of there.

       I suppose my reason for posting wasn't just to bitch but to try and talk about a subject that immediately impacts people around me. There is not much I can do to change public sentiment in Israel or Saudi Arabia. I am an outsider to those people by religion, location, and culture. But with the religious (mainly Christian) influence in US politics I may have a chance to start a conversation with someone who has not looked at the information in the same way I have and perhaps ideas could be shared. I was being down voted yesterday and today came back to a pretty positive conversation. It's been 12 hours since someone called me a shill!

       I live in the States so for me the Christian vote is stronger than anything else here and effects more people. By not specifically calling out Islam or other religions I hardly think I was protecting them. This illustrates a problem we have in this country and why the right is able to distract people so easily. "What me? No! Look over there! They are worse!!"

       I don't think that I need to have been personally hurt to point out a wrong. You realize that Christianity is responsible for many reprehensible acts, right? Burning witches, crusades, children's crusades... I feel that the Christian right is doing all that it can to insert Christianity into our government and policies where no religion at all belongs. A religiously affiliated government is exactly what gave rise to the extremism you are trying to point out.

       It's not strictly "the right"-- it's Council for National Policy, Dominionist /Fundamentalist extremists. They also push for full privatization/demonize government writ large so they can institute their psycho Christian program throughout the country, and no one will be able to tell them no when the "free market" allows anyone with enough power and money to rise to the fore.
