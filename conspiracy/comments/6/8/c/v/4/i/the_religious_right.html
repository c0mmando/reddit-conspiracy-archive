<p>Disregarding organs and chromosomes in such a way is an affront to science. Your &quot;identity&quot; is fine and dandy, you do you, but that hasn&#39;t really been the case.

    <div class="md"><p>No. I don&#39;t believe that is their intention, even if it may be an unintended consequence to whatever varying degree. It is human nature to want to be accepted, and we as humans should strive to find comfort in each others happiness, instead of being pre disposed to condemnation. However the varying degree that i mentioned, is that just now in time, are we at a point where we can medically and psychologically analyze where we are at. There are numerous case studies, only available now, detailing how a transgender person goes on a longer timeline. The information is very interesting, and disregarding it would be dangerous. </p>

<p>We should strive to accept others, but in turn we must strive to accept ourselves</p>

<p>Not today though. No real use for christianity anymore, doesn&#39;t have the same pull. Take another look around you. Establishment science is becoming the new religion, and it is blasphemous to question against the prophets nye and tyson. You are just suppose to accept whatever answer they spoon feed you, and you are an idiot if you choose to question any further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hundreds? You&#39;re talking thousands. Without a doubt, religion has long had its teeth in society. I feel that christianity&#39;s grip is slipping though. Other religions seem to show a different reverence amongst us. Its less stigmatized to blaspheme against christianity than say, islam or judaism. You even would get less shit in public forum if you said &quot;the bible is straight up bullshit and lies&quot; than you would saying &quot;but how certain are we vaccines are 100% safe?&quot; You can completely shit on christianity and suffer less static as you would something else, but not 100 years ago. Its bite has significantly weakened over time.</p>

<p>Let me ask you; do you live in a predominantly christian surrounding? I was raised catholic, and was so relieved how little of an impact christianity in general had over my life once i left home  </p>

And while religion does not impact my life, I feel that religion and christianity in particular does influence many in the US.

    <div class="md"><p>I think huge portions of the US vote along religious lines. In certain parts you cannot hold office if you are atheist. Our new administration is full of bible thumpers and the EPA is being gutted of protective measures (called &quot;over regulation&quot;) so that the path can be paved for industry (factory owners) to make money. Religion drums up a lot of feverish voters (and throw in some islamaphobia for patriotism). And I feel like I am out on a limb writing this in this sub.</p>

There is not much I can do to change public sentiment in Israel or Saudi Arabia. I am an outsider to those people by religion, location, and culture. But with the religious (mainly Christian) influence in US politics I may have a chance to start a conversation with someone who has not looked at the information in the same way I have and perhaps ideas could be shared.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that I need to have been personally hurt to point out a wrong. You realize that Christianity is responsible for many reprehensible acts, right? Burning witches, crusades, children&#39;s crusades... I feel that the Christian right is doing all that it can to insert Christianity into our government and policies where no religion at all belongs. A religiously affiliated government is exactly what gave rise to the extremism you are trying to point out.</p>
