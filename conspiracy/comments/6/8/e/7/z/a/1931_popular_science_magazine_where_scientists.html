<p>I don&#39;t know what to believe, but you cannot tell me that you 100% buy the globe Earth theory.  Not after looking at all of the evidence for both sides and discerning what is fake psyop propaganda and what is plausible.  </p>

<p>In 1931 black men were dragged out of buildings and hung by lynch mobs. This is not the society ones should use when discussing scientifically intelligent moments in human history. </p>

<p>He has no intention of looking at both sides of the argument. He even admitted he knows very little about the &quot;flat earth theory&quot; and doesn&#39;t feel the need to actually test it in any way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the hostility I see is from people hurling insults at the people questioning the shape of the earth. It&#39;s a sad day and age when people wanting to do real science with an open mind are pilloried by those indoctrinated with dogmatic groupthink, treating the government-approved science as a religion or cult. If we don&#39;t correct this, we are headed for the dark ages. </p>

<p>As anyone who frequents r/conspiracy should know: question everything, even the most simple of the narratives. Question the so-called authorities, especially the space agencies. When they say the earth is a sphere, you should not only consider the statement false, but assume the opposite- if NASA says the earth is a sphere, the earth is probably flat. </p>

Truth is at first ridiculed by the masses (the same masses who currently worship the saints and dogma of science).

    <div class="md"><p>Why would that not happen on a flat earth? The sky is real, what you observe out there is real, but incidentally what you observe could not happen in a heliocentric model, ie- warping through space at 600 million miles per hour, all the while spinning, orbiting sun, and orbiting galactic center, the stars should not be in a predictable swirl around Polaris, never deviating through millennia. There is a much simpler theory for the stars- they swirl above and we remain still.</p>

<p>As far as ships disappearing over the horizon, I blame that for this whole spinning ball theory mess, because that was the first time over 500 years ago that they said that we must be seeing curvature, after which they invented theories to further explain the problems of a spherical world. But now we have good consumer telescopes to bring those ships (bottom obscured by thousands of averaging waves) back into view, which would be impossible on a big ball, no? </p>

<p>But no one has ever filmed a video of a ship passing over the &quot;horizon&quot; and simply getting smaller and smaller until it can no longer be seen. It&#39;s always the same... the ship disappears from the bottom up while the top is still visible, until the top also drops below the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen those videos which show the boat starting to vanish, but there are videos with s much greater zoom which show the same thing, which can then be zoomed further to see the whole ship again. The further out on water, the more waves will average to obscure the bottom. Far ships will always have their hull obscured partially. Salt flats are much better for viewing what definitely appears to be a flat earth.</p>

<p>The earth may indeed be round, but the drop of 8 inches squared per mile of curvature that science preaches is wildly wrong, if there is curvature at all, meaning the earth is much, much bigger than science says. Objects which should be thousands of feet below the line of sight are seen completely at distances of 60 plus miles, like the Statue of Liberty or other such objects. Whoever started this conspiracy so many decades ago could not have predicted the kind of telescopes and camera zooms readily available to the public today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the geometry is why it could not happen on a flat earth. If the earth were flat, the path of the stars would be straight lines instead of arcs. The height of eye is the limiting factor for sight. this is why you can see further from a higher location. Lookouts on Navy ships know the distance to the horizon because the distance is (relatively) constant from their point of view (height off of the waterline). This is calculated with relatively simple geometry/trigonometry. In this particular case, Google can be used for good. Nevermind that Google Earth exists, you can check the distance to the horizon from a particular height with the search engine. This is ancient knowledge. Trying to talk to FE people reminds me of that famous Lisa Loeb song (ack!!!)...</p>

<p>That&#39;s an easy one: not if the stars rotate and the earth is motionless.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, but there is something called a vanishing point. If you stood on train tracks headed off into the distance, the two tracks would appear to point inward until disappearing at a point. Things get smaller and smaller as they go into the distance until not seen anymore. Interestingly, ships which have vanished, previously thought to have gone over the curvature, can be brought back into view with a telescope, which should be impossible on a big ball.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>distance to the horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does the horizon always rise to eye level? If we&#39;re on a big ball, the horizon should always lower as you rise in altitude from a balloon going straight up, but that is never observed. Why is no curvature ever observed from these balloons when observed through a non-fisheye lense even at over 100,000 feet high?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>waterline</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think they call it &quot;sea <em>level</em>&quot; I wonder? Maybe because the level of the water is exactly as you would expect water to be: level, as in flat. water doesn&#39;t curve, and shouldn&#39;t adhere to a sphere, especially not a spinning one. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, until an alphabet agency took it over (Ooo they even changed their name to Alphabet). I wonder what comes first the chicken or the egg: does an alphabet agency specifically start these things and then control them, or do they let them grow organically and then take them over? Either way it has nothing to do with flat earth theories, aside from information control by said agencies and propaganda and all that. </p>

<p>if this was true (and the earth was flat) then the stars would make straight lines horizontally across the sky. This is obviously not the case.</p>

<p>the vanishing point is a function of <em>resolution</em> which is just as real as the curvature of the earth. the distance to the horizon (assuming perfect resolution) is calculable in several different ways. If you are interested in disproving this, you should at least <em>try</em> to familiarize yourself with the ancient knowledge that you discredit. BTW, the ability to grasp geometry was how the original illuminati cults distinguished the worthy from the unworthy. Believe it or not, this same geometry has been expanded over the last three centuries through calculus and harnessed through engineering in order to add precision to our understanding and mastery of curvature. </p>

<p>If this was true, it would be a whole lot of flights. Using the refresh rate that we see on Google Earth, orbiting satellites make a lot more sense for gaining aerial footage of <em>all of the earth</em>. Beyond this, Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the globe (with 15% error) a couple of centuries before Jesus is supposed to have existed. Do you have an explanation for why we do not observe other flat realms from our flat planet? Geometry is real, homie... this is why Polaris is the same number of degrees off of the horizon as your number of degrees north latitude (assuming that you are in the Northern Hemisphere). Get a sextant and visit a buddy a few hundred miles to the north or south of you.... <em>it changes based upon your position on the globe</em>.  You don&#39;t sound dumb or evil. I believe that you will at least check to see if what I am telling you is true (it is - we are all in this together). We will never escape Illuminati rule if we can&#39;t figure out the shape of our planet (and plan our agriculture, architecture, and engineering accordingly). Peace.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it takes a bit of imagination to entertain the idea of a flat earth and how it would work. You have to imagine a flat round disc with either a dome or another flat plane overhead, on or beyond which is either the illusion or hologram of the stars, either way not thousands of light years far. This dome, or at least the image on it, spins. When observed through consumer telescopes, stars and planets (from &quot;wandering stars&quot;) do not appear as balls of gas, but pulsating colorful electricity, vibrating at different frequencies (the explanation is twinkle from the atmosphere, but doesn&#39;t explain the variance in shspe, color and vibrating movement of the stars). The appearance of disc or even spheres in the heavens doesn&#39;t prove the shape of the earth, just that those objects appear round. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Eratosthenes calculated the circumference</p>

<p>That is entirely dependent on a sun 93 million miles away. The shadow evidence is still applicsble to a flst earth, considering the earth may be local, and move around in a circle above the circle of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>azimuth to Polaris </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Polaris is above the center of the earth but closeby, the further you move from the Arctic, the lower Polaris would appear in the sky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>illuminati cults distinguished the worthy from the unworthy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why they keep denying my application. Incidentally, if the globe earth is a true conspiracy, it would have to be a massive mother of all conspiracies, dating 500 years and involving not only the major nations of the world, but the secret societies which control these governments behind the scenes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Geometry is real, homie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s fake. Homie don&#39;t play that. It&#39;s just as real on a flat earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this was true, it would be a whole lot of flights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trillions of dollars TPTB have at thrir disposal is very real. The power of the secret societies is real. If this is a real conspiracy, they will go to great lengths yo keep up the deception. If the Illuminati is behind this, wouldn&#39;t they continue the deception at all costs? It would actually be easy for them flying back and forth, keeping the illusion of space agencies and satellites. Indoctrination and continuous brainwashing takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if the earth is flat, hollow, concave, or a sphere much more massive than they say., but they are lying to us about something.</p>

<p>The moon landings were fake af. Just the same, humans have used reference points in the skies to track their position over land (or water). The history of navigation is highly interesting and valuable for understanding our concepts space and time. Believe it or not, it actually involved a lot of weird occult shit. Ultimately, the greatest revolution in navigation technology was probably the clock (one that can function normally on the seas)- this enabled men to nail down latitude (which was a key for crossing the oceans).</p>

<p>Only if you agree that what they are saying is true and take it at face-value without doing your own research.  They clearly haven&#39;t watched a full lunar eclipse where you can actually see the shadow of the Earth crossing the moon:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/total-lunar-eclipse-09262014/">http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/total-lunar-eclipse-09262014/</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, if there were some &quot;other&quot; object blocking out the light on the moon, then it would be visible to those on the other side of the Earth who would see it in front of the sun.  We clearly don&#39;t see that happening.</p>

<p>Moreover, the image that the person uses to demonstrate what a lunar eclipse looks like, isn&#39;t a lunar eclipse at all, but rather a normal full moon rising over the Temple of Poseidon.  The redness is due to atmospheric distortion, not an eclipse.</p>

<p>Difficult to trust somebody who makes so many basic errors to be honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m outside all the time, I&#39;m a landscape photographer.  While contrails are definitely an issue, they only appear on days when the conditions allow them to linger.  In terms of California, contrails form frequently there due to the upper atmospheric humidity that frequently is present there.  </p>

<p>You can check the current status here:</p>

<p>The problem is that airliners could actually curb the number of contrails in the air with only a 1% increase in operating costs, it&#39;s quite remarkable that this isn&#39;t a bigger issue:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and I hear people throw around &quot;peer reviewed&quot; like that is some sort of magic event that suddenly makes a study accurate.</p>

<p>Also, this pretty much makes me suspicious of ANYTHING from the scientific community:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, admits that at least half of the scientific data they have on record is falsified</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)60696-1.pdf">http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)60696-1.pdf</a></p>

<p>Dr. Marcia Angell, a physician and longtime Editor in Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), which is considered to another one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world, makes her view of the subject quite plain:</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine‚Äù</p>

<p>So this crap keeps flooding the /new queue, and if you downvote without commenting people cry <em>&quot;B-B-BUT MUH CONSPIRACY!, I&#39;m being kept down by THE MAN!&quot;</em> So to combat that you have to go and tell the OP why they&#39;re being downvoted. </p>

<p>I would say I do but the truth is I dont need to &#39;buy&#39; into anything. Theres about a bajillion satellites in orbit and plenty of video evidence and astronaut testimony. Then theres the fact that you need only go to about 35,000 feet to see the curvature of the earth with your own two eyes. As for the map logos....how would you display all areas of a sphere on a 2D surface? That just seems like common sense. </p>

<p>Im open to the petri dish/advanced race concept but the earth being flat is just a preposterous notion at this point. And ask yourself this: what advantage does portraying the world as a sphere instead of a disk give to those who would describe it that way?  Occams razor would be handy right about now...</p>

<p>I can interpret real comments just fine - But you seem to be ignoring conflicting accounts from Piccard. If he makes one claim that you take on its face value, then other claims must be taken equally seriously. If those claims don&#39;t match reality, then you&#39;ve got a problem. </p>

<p>This is from the Wikipedia entry for moonlight. If you are atop a mountain and look out at the range, you will see the further mountains appear bluer the farther they are, until toward the horizon they appear faded blue, whether the mountains were green or snowy makes no difference. The same flying above an archipelago: the further the island, the bluer it appears.</p>

<p>The air is gas, it appears blue at a distance, therefore Piccard&#39;s observations of a blueish gas have merit. </p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s the shadow of the Earth on its atmosphere opposite the setting sun.  This wouldn&#39;t be possible if it were disappearing due to perspective rather than setting below the horizon.</p>

<p>Because the shadow grows as the sun goes further below the horizon?  This can&#39;t be explained away by perspective, it clearly shows that the sun goes below the horizon and doesn&#39;t disappear in the distance.</p>

<p>You have yet to provide a single observation for your incorrect theory, so this is really pointless.  Unable to investigate something for yourself and instead make assumptions about what other people are trying to show you.</p>

<p>In other words, OP was lying about being on the fence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they pretend they are &quot;proving&quot; flat Earth and then they throw some convoluted nonsense out there to make the investigators look batshit crazy.  Researching this involves huge lessons in discernment, which is why I have so little respect for those who shrug it off with nothing more that a passing glance.</p>

<p>Because the shadow grows as the sun goes further below the horizon?  This can&#39;t be explained away by perspective, it clearly shows that the sun goes below the horizon and doesn&#39;t disappear in the distance.</p>

<p>You have yet to provide a single observation for your incorrect theory, so this is really pointless.  Unable to investigate something for yourself and instead make assumptions about what other people are trying to show you.</p>
