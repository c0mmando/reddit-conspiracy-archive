       I want to know about Rothschild's central banking system. I think most of the world's government's would need to immediately reform or face revolutions. The amount of money out there flowing to the wealthy elite is disgusting.

       I read  that one of the Rothchild brothers sold all his stocks in England to trick people into following his lead and doing the same. Then went and bought up everyone's stocks to gain cheap control of England's money. Heard a lot of creepy stuff about them.

       This is a popular myth promoted leading by film-maker, Bill Still (The Money Masters) and G. Edward Griffin, (The Creature From Jekyll Island) there was never a crash of the British stock market, and as claimed by both conspiracy theorists, easily seen by referencing the charts/data of this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other-words, the Rothschild's never took over the Bank of England...

       <strong>
        <em>
         The Enduring Rothschild Myth
        </em>
       </strong>
       <a href="https://www.mises.ca/the-enduring-rothschild-myth/">
        https://www.mises.ca/the-enduring-rothschild-myth/
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The enduring Rothschild myth centers on the London Stock Exchange, the battle of Waterloo and Nathan Rothschild. The story is most famously told in the film ‘The Money Masters’, produced by Bill Still. In the movie Still tells us that Nathan had posted an observer by the name of Ruthworth at the battle of Waterloo. His mission was to ascertain the victor and relay this information back to Nathan before the general public could become aware.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The result of this battle would have had significant consequences on the value of British bonds (“consols”) since a victorious Napoleon would present a credible threat to the British government. As it so happened, Napoleon was defeated and Mr. Ruthworth dutifully relayed this information to Nathan days before official informants could do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nathan then spreads the rumour that Napoleon was, in fact, victorious. The Rothschild’s intelligence network was legendary and investors believed what they were hearing was genuine. This caused a panicked sell-off of British consols at the London Stock Exchange. Nathan used this opportunity to purchase huge amounts of these securities and when news of the genuine victor reached London, he profited immensely from the trade.  With the vast amounts of wealth he now controlled Nathan was able to bring the British government and Bank of England under his influence.
      </p>

       A fantastic tale… and a complete myth.

       People are purposefully made stupid and that ignorance is used to control them. Who is it that created the education system in America? Rockefeller. Who is it that set up the standards of academia in this country? The rich. I think everyone should read more and learn as much as they can.

       you are very, very stupid. Religion was an invention of the elite to keep the people in line. Some people are so fucking stupid that they still believe in it today, people like you, and your family. It's sad, and its fucking pathetic to know that people as stupid as you exist freely, and you breed. Please so us all a favor and remove yourself from the gene pool by any means necessary.

       Right. Money is fiat, meaning it is worthless, and it's value is enforced by government edict. A society that allocates resources appropriately has no use for money, and money itself is what oppresses us.

       Its contradictory merely to claim "money is worthless" yet its "value is enforced by government edict." If money holds no "value" as you claim, then how is the "value" of money to be enforced by law? You are accepting two opposing ideas and believing both to be true.

       So you believe in a "moneyless" society even though no such society ever existed in the recorded history that did not

       Its too simplistic to state as such, ask yourself why you believe this to be the case when all money does is account and is exchanged for goods and services. How is persons agreeing upon trade between each other oppressive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it merely the medium that measures the value of exchange; or is it a manipulation of the nature of money itself that makes "money" oppressive? (For example, if someone requested you to paint a room which would take 3 hours, how is agreeing upon a price that accounted for your time and labor, harmful to you, to be paid for in money?)
      </p>
      <p>
       You should think this through more FuckenUnCuckeD, do you really believe any exchange is harmful or is it the manipulated effects of money that makes it the exploitative medium?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some quotes that I had saved while reading through some old books, it may help to summarize.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         “The sole use of currency is to facilitate the great process of exchange, by superseding the necessity for barter. Nor has it any other use than what is either directly or indirectly incidental to this purpose. For were it the case in any country, that no one therein had ever occasion to exchange any property or privilege which he possessed, or any service that he could render, for something which another possessed or could render in return; or, that only such exchanges were desired as barter could readily accomplish; then, in such country, currency would manifestly be of no use, nor indeed would it have any existence.” – Edwin Hill (1856, Principles of Currency: Means of Ensuring Uniformity of Value and Adequacy of Supply, page 55)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “The money of a country is that thing, whatever it may be, which is commonly accepted in exchange for labor or property and in payment of debts, whether so accepted by force of law, or by universal consent. Its value does not arise from the intrinsic qualities which the material of which it is made may possess, but depends entirely on the extrinsic qualities which law, or general consent, may confer.” — John P. Jones (1890, Speech of Hon. John P. Jones, of Nevada. May 12 And 13, p. 65)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “The logic of the situation, and the reasoning of all the leading authorities on money, lead irresistibly to the conclusion that its value does not reside in the material, but in the stamp; in other words, on the legal-tender function impressed on that material. It is an order for property and services.” — John P. Jones (1890, Speech of Hon. John P. Jones, of Nevada. May 12 And 13, p. 65)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “The true money standard of any country is not the material of which the money is made. The standard is not a concrete object, but a numerical relation. It is the relation between the number of units composing the monetary circulation of the country and the numbers of the population. It is the legal-tender function that constitutes money. It is the power which the law imparts to any material to pay debts and liquidate obligations. It can not for a moment be doubted that the money function, being conferred by the supreme authority, is the all-sufficient guarantee of the money value. There is no necessity for re-enforcing that value with any inferior value that may attach to the material on which the money stamp is placed. The money function is immeasurably the most important that can be conferred by society upon any material, and it is absurd to urge that that function is not of itself sufficient for the maintenance of the value of money. All the value that money can possibly have the totality of value that can exist in the shape of money in any country will attach to anything upon which the sovereign authority stamps it, whether the material on which the stamp is placed be gold, silver, paper, or anything else.” — John P. Jones (1890, Speech of Hon. John P. Jones, of Nevada. May 12 And 13, p. 78-79)

       <li>
        <p>
         “Two persons having an equal amount of money or an equal quantity of goods, wares and merchandise, cannot both make money out of each other. What one gains the other loses. This rule is true of any number of persons, may, it is applicable to all of the individuals of a nation. It is only when there is an increase of the original capital that there is a legitimate object of commercial pursuit. It is the same when the amounts of original capital are dissimilar, the proportions must be maintained or there is trickery or injustice, not to say robbery.” – Charles H. Robinson (1898, The Destruction of Poverty, p. 127)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “A token issued by one is received by all and their products are transferred in consequence thereof. The circulation of the token rests upon this proposition: That the holder has in the token, an order on each and all of his neighbors for their surplus products. By common consent they pass from one to another, and thus facilitate the easy transmutation of one man’s labor into something else desired by him. But is this not the exact purpose of all trade, local, national, universal? Can Commerce find any other design for her varied million daily exchanges, except that one set of men prefer, above their own, the manual creations of their neighbors? The final analysis of the motives for all trading leads to this simple fact, that each finds his advantage in the transfer of his surplus product.” — Taylor Rogers (1897, Scientific Money, p. 13)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         “Money is like railroads, a mere implement of exchange. Scientifically it ought not to be a commodity. As it is a mere medium to effect exchanges, its volume should be regulated with reference to the value of products in course of each exchange. This could never be done by taking a commodity of extremely limited volume in nature, like gold or silver, and stamping it as money.” — Hon. Thomas V. Cator, of San Francisco (Quoted in Taylor Rogers “Scientific Money” 1897, p. 83)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Its far to simplistic to state such, ask yourself why you believe this to be the case when all that money does is an accounting system in the exchange of someone's labor and production. You can study the history of money throughout any period and people have always used a "medium" represented in any material that accounted for the exchanging of goods and services. Again, a "moneyless" society has never existed that did not tokenize the work of others.

       How can money process no value and be worthless, yet is redeemable for goods and services; and acquired by labor and production of the populace. If you believe money has no value, why do you process to acquire it, and work as such? Its easy to blame the negative effects of money upon "money" when a mere exchange causes no injury, do you blame the object which kills a person, or the influence that held malice intent to kill, its the same illogical reasoning.

       Why would you advocate for a "moneyless" society then should you not see trade and commerce as bad? If money only represents labor earned and received from the overall pool of wealth in a society, why seek a "moneyless" society? It sounds contradictory.

       Do you see money as barter? Money supersedes barter, allowing the exchange of goods and services in a uniform trade, (ie. I want something you have, yet you don't want anything I have to trade) its nothing more which allocates the exchanging of time, labor, production and "resources" acquired if you will.

       What in the ever loving fuck are you talking about? This makes absolutely 0 sense. Capitalism is when the means of production, goods of production, instruments of labor, and means of labor are all privately owned, and exist solely for the purpose of producing capital, in order to receive resources from other owners of these resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, take the healthcare industry. What is the purpose of the healthcare industry? To heal people? Fuck no- it's to make money. Sure, a cure for cancer would make millions of dollars, as would a cure for HIV; nay cure for any disease could be sold for a lot of money, but after a while, you will start to see a decline in sick people. Less people are coming to you or healthcare. You are in effect,
       <em>
        losing customers
       </em>
       . The healthcare industry is not trying to come up for cures for diseases, they are instead researching profitable treatments. Why? Because curing a disease is
       <strong>
        bad for business
       </strong>
       . If their job was to heal people, their industry would shrink, and they want the opposite. Apply this formula to everything that exists to understand capitalism better.

       Socialism is when the workers own and control the means of production, as well as the instruments of production and labor, and use them in order to create a system of resource allocation controlled by the workers directly. They wouldn't own it because of socialism- they own it because they are the ones fucking making it. The concept of ownership, is something else that does not quite meet the standards of existence.

       As for the healthcare industry, no one is forcing you to be treated by a doctor. Its easy to conflate "Capitalism" and "Free Enterprise" to then detest money, rather than its subverted nature. The same with Governments, however big or small. You can research the move from sect-tribe, to village, to towns and holds and countries, States and nations and they always are influenced by the growth of commerce.

"money" when not corrupted is merely an accounting system nothing more.

       right, it's totally possible for us to not be smart enough to ever achieve it, you have made that quite clear.

      <p>
       The phrase "for free" only exists in a world where everything costs money. There would be no such thing as "free stuff" because everyone would have equal access to resources.

       We already do that, and the vast majority of our jobs are completely obsolete and only exist in a world of capitalism. If we lived in a money-less society, automation would be a good thing, instead of here where it takes away jobs. As advanced as our technology is, it is only advanced in the ways of capitalism. Everything has planned obsolescence. We also don't know two things: 1. We don't know what our current understanding of the sciences is even capable of, we have only seen it
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to exist under capitalism. 2. We don't know what kind of new technology the elite (government, military, billionaires) possess and hide from the world.

       Dude you are impossibly stupid. In no way, shape, or form does Africa and India resemble anything close to what I'm talking about. They do not live in a moneyless society, and the people who live in shit, and don't use money at all

       It's common knowledge that Russia hacked the dnc.  But that's all they did.  They got all of the data about the illegal activities people like podesta and Clinton were doing and released it through wikileaks.  They did this in order to manipulate the American publics mindset hoping that the election would be swayed.  Nothing untoward.  Just some stolen emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when I say hacked, I mean a simple spearphishing scam.  That's all.

       Your "common knowledge" has no relationship to "what actually happened outside the fake news MSM".  Wikileaks categorically said that the Russians were not involved, and the person who gave the data to wikileaks
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       said that the Russians had nothing to do with it.

       The reasoning, the emotional affect so loved by media manipulators, is completely made up but MSM fake news, and you've been completely fooled. Fuck, you're not meant to

       It blew my mind when I read it the first time. All those times where people said "there's no plan to get rid of white people" are rebutted with there literally being a plan for it.

       That our current understanding of ww2 and the holocaust has been purposefully manipulated and falsified in order to demonize nationalism and promote their goal of a NWO as well as giving jews a "get out of jail free" card so to speak because everyones afraid of being labeled an anti-semite just for asking a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note: I am not denying that the holocaust happened to some extent, I just dont think what weve been told is the truth about it

       You are right. This issue is SO HUGE.  They Holyhoax lie provides the ideological foundation for the jewish/NWO agenda of seeking to destroy all white nations with mass immigration -- i.e., by saying that any whites/Europeans who oppose mass immigration are "racist Nazis" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Red Cross records show that around 280,000 people died in the German-run camps, and probably less than half of those were jews.  The deaths were overwhelmingly caused by typhus and other diseases, which resulted because of the general breakdown in conditions inside Germany and Poland due to the war.  There was no plan to mass murder the inmates at the camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sacred "6 million" number is a Kaballistic figure that was claimed dozens of times by the jews in the decades before WW2.  The German WW2 camps were only internment and slave labor camps to intern perceived threats in a war-time environment -- similar to camps run by the U.S. government in which they interned Americans of Japanese and German ancestry on U.S. soil during the war.

       You dont because they don't give a fuck about you like they dont give a fuck about me.  Idk why everyone always immediately reacts like people are saying every single jewish person on the planet is involved in the conspiracy.  Its the elite like the koch brothers and the rothschilds and other old jewish money families that are the problem.  They use the front of the jewish religion to push their agendas.  Not that i think christianity or islam is any better, they all do the same shit, it just so happens jewish money is the oldest because they were the only religion that allowed usury during the conception of banks in human history.

       The white race is being killed off by the elite class that runs and controls Western civilization. All anyone needs to do is look, and they will see this happening all around them. A few points to ponder:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        white birth rates are falling around the world
       </li>
       <li>
        whites are encouraged by the media, which shapes popular culture, to have fewer babies and to have them later in life
       </li>
       <li>
        abortion is encouraged and facilitated
       </li>
       <li>
        birth control is encouraged and facilitated
       </li>
       <li>
        the institution of marrage is under attack in white nations
       </li>
       <li>
        inter-racial sexual relationships are heavily pushed by the media
       </li>
       <li>
        homosexuality is encouraged
       </li>
       <li>
        trans-genderism is encouraged
       </li>
       <li>
        the Christian religion (which supports white traditions) is under heavy assault
       </li>
       <li>
        men are being feminized and emasculated across the West
       </li>
       <li>
        women are told that they should act like men (i.e., not have babies)
       </li>
       <li>
        career women are held up as the ideal; women who raise their own children are looked upon with contempt
       </li>
       <li>
        massive non-white immigration is being forced upon Western nations (and only on white nations)
       </li>
       <li>
        whites are trained in the schools and  the media to have contempt for their history and their heritage
       </li>
       <li>
        anyone who champions white heritage is automatically branded a racist and a Nazi
       </li>
       <li>
        the history of the white race is massively distorted in the schools
       </li>
       <li>
        white children, and only white children, are taught in the schools and media to hate their own race
       </li>
      </ul>

       And here's another "secret" as to WHY the jewish/NWO elites are trying to do this.  The white/European peoples (especially the Anglo-Saxon and Germanic peoples) are the REAL descendants of the Israelites.  This is a Satanic plan to attempt to destroy the true chosen people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, of course, the white/European peoples and nations are the most powerful in the world and are the biggest opposition and obstacle to the jewish/NWO elites and their plan for a totalitarian Satanic one-world government.

       Well you put together a list of a lot of problens but very few if any of them are strictly white problems, and some of them affect white people much less than they do other races like the sterilization and forced abortions on blacks all throughout america.  Also i have no idea wtf youre talking about, in school my history book was practically "americas the fuckin greatest man, guns, liberty and manifest Destiny am i right guys"

       There's really just
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       conspiracy. It's the enslavement of the human race and the forced conditioning that is self perpetuated from parent to child. This is what it is... They are using mental manipulation combined with time to force our race to adapt and evolve to
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       mold (whoever they are is besides the point). They have successfully removed a large portion of our humanity and compassion towards our own race and are continuing to do so at this very moment. They are also conditioning our bodies through means of chemical interference in the air we breath, the water we drink and the food we consume. This is removing our ability to critically think and is also poisoning us so that we never reach our full potential. Any conspiracy we discuss ties into this. It's all connected to us and the potential that we once had (and still do, really). I personally think we're on the verge of a comeback though.

       I want people to know that religion is the original conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because religion is the original conspiracy that blends cultural expressions with mysticism and authoritarianism. Early religion "started" as a way to explain things that were not understood but quickly became a way to keep the masses in line. Opiate for the masses, indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even today, even among conspiracy theorists, you still have the vast majority who believe the same bullshit lies that constructed the power structures they rail against.

       Get on my level and start looking into astrology correlations with current events, and study chakras, numerology, dip your toe back into r/conspiracy time to time to see what page everyone else is on still, and realize that everything that Tila Tequila talks about in her latest YouTube videos is real. Despite how fucking crazy she sounds, please pay attention to all her videos. Don't be closed minded, put the pieces together. If you want to know the truth you won't be a hater and you will head my advice.

       You can't call something fake without doing the diligence to find out what it is and how it works, and then decide if it's real or fake.

       Really that's kind of embarrassing to have that kind of mentality when you're on a conspiracy/truth seeking forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's closed minded and radiates ignorance. why don't you actually look up the things mentioned, and understand how it works before you dismiss it.
      </p>

       I didn't want to end up on r/conspiracy, I got here when pizzagate broke back in November and I've been falling down the rabbit hole ever since. And I thought flat earth was a psy ops, and that Tila was MK ultra'd and a psy ops too, bitch sounds crazy- but she is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just pay attention. You're not going to get very far in finding the truth if you shut down ideas you disagree with or don't understand/ find ridiculous. That's exactly what I did, and guess what. Here I am, trying to talk to a hater.

       right, it's totally possible for us to not be smart enough to ever achieve it, you have made that quite clear.

       The phrase "for free" only exists in a world where everything costs money. There would be no such thing as "free stuff" because everyone would have equal access to resources.

       We already do that, and the vast majority of our jobs are completely obsolete and only exist in a world of capitalism. If we lived in a money-less society, automation would be a good thing, instead of here where it takes away jobs. As advanced as our technology is, it is only advanced in the ways of capitalism. Everything has planned obsolescence. We also don't know two things: 1. We don't know what our current understanding of the sciences is even capable of, we have only seen it
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to exist under capitalism. 2. We don't know what kind of new technology the elite (government, military, billionaires) possess and hide from the world.

       Dude you are impossibly stupid. In no way, shape, or form does Africa and India resemble anything close to what I'm talking about. They do not live in a moneyless society, and the people who live in shit, and don't use money at all

       You are so fucking stupid, and I really don't mean that as an insult; I mean it as an objective observation. You are completely incapable of understanding something that you are not familiar with. Enjoy your cognitive dissonance.
