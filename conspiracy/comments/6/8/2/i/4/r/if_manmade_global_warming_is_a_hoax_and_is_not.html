       Nowhere near as much as being made off the fossil-fuel economy. That's why they are fighting it.

      <p>
       If everyone had their own power generation facility capable of powering their home and "fueling" their vehicle, how would the elites be able to charge us a fee for simply living our lives? Tax the sun and wind?

       The population has to pay taxes (a hell of a lot more taxes) to maintain the military forces used to protect the oil supply.

       You mean governments have lost the ability to pass laws? I mean if they wanted to make a new tax, all they would have to do is pass a law to do it.

       Climate change is whatever they want it to be. On the one hand, all production requires CO2, so by controlling CO2 you can control all output. You control thinking. You reestablishing religious control through a new priesthood, and then can sell "indulgences".

       The basic reasoning behind the profit model of carbon taxation and regulation is that carbon itself is a key element of life itself and regulation or taxation of carbon effectively acts as regulation or taxation of life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who knows High School biology should know that there are a few primary resource systems we need for life to exist:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The Water Cycle.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The input of Sunlight.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The existence of key mineral nutrients.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The interaction between the Krebs and Photosynthetic cycles.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The regulation or taxation of any of these elements represents a problem because it is effectively a tax or legal control upon life itself.  It's basically a tax for existing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, a key component of the Krebs/Photosynthetic system is carbon dioxide.  In fact, it is the major input for the Photosynthetic system and the major output for the Krebs system.  And as animal life forms, human beings make exclusive use of  the Krebs system.  Which means that by taxing carbon dioxide, the output of our life process, they will effectively be taxing
       <em>
        the human right to breathe
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you say, we're doing this just to tax the machines.  Baloney.  They wouldn't tax people using wood burning stoves in Alaska if their goal wasn't to attack human life.  It may take a few years to settle the law but it will certainly evolve in the direction of giving the elite controllers the authority to tell people to die at a whim.

      <p>
       First, adding a new pointless tax on every good that people can own, as this will do, would be politically disastrous.  If there were no looming threat of an immanent crisis, the public outcry against the suggestion that we pay taxes for our cars, heating our houses, and growing our food would be massive.  And rightly so, because it's demanding people pay more money for everything they need to survive.  It's an austerity measure which generates hostility from those who have to suffer for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, here's the real problem.  The scientific community hasn't acted like scientists when it comes to climate change.  They've acted like they are pushing an ideological agenda.  Science has never been about generating a "consensus."  It's basic science 101.  What is the scientific method?  It's about observation, hypothesis, testing and re-testing.  You cannot force your "laws" down peoples' throats with science and expect them to take this uncritically.  That's what cults do, not science.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, this is exactly what climate scientists act like.  They tell people "this is truth, believe it or you're a climate-change denier and we'll shun you."  Meanwhile, their rich advocates fly around in polluting jets to conferences around the world and expect the public to believe that their own austerity is necessary to save the world from a disaster.  Why not practice what you preach, Al Gore?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now we see where the skepticism comes from.  First, it's suspicious because it's asking for austerity.  Second, it's suspicious because its proponents act like cultists.  Finally, it's also suspicious because the proponents are goddamn hypocrites.

      <p>
       That's not what's happening.  The carbon taxes are being levied on people's cars, electricity and homes not on the fucking factories.  But even when corporations do pay anything, they pass along the costs to the consumers.  So, either way the public gets fucked.

       Don't think I'm a fan of them, either.  Both are contributory toward the problem.  But, my focus in this is to explain why some people can honestly think the climate change is a scam.

       I generally think global warming is a thing, and some percentage of it is man made, though the exact amount is up for debate.  It's based on simple concepts that see use in low level engineering, so it's certainly possible for humans to modify global temperatures both deliberately and accidentally.  How much is man made is my only real question.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the question of why it would be a hoax, or how someone would benefit:
      </p>
      <p>
       Identifying basic human existence as a possible source of world catastrophe has a number of benefits.  By linking industrialization and population to very bad things, governments with greater power can pressure those of lesser power to comply with industry slowing demands before they become competition.  Environmental impact could then be used as a rational for military action, even going so far as to show that a civilization is more damaging to the world than the subsequent fallout if they were annihilated via nuke.  With that in mind, it would make sense for the military to fund climate researchers that would support this hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could they keep all the scientists on a short leash?  That one's harder of course.  Shame works somewhat, but it isn't an absolute solution.  If however the military had already thoroughly researched the topic and knew an alternative explanation for global warming, they would have the knowledge needed to encourage researchers to look at misleading information.  This would require a military/civilian scientific segregation that doesn't generally seem to exist though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't buy into it, but the motivation behind doing this or something similar seems simple enough.
