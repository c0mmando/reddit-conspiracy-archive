    <div class="md"><p>happens all the time. But its mainly fentanyl and other finalized drugs that get siphoned. They are alot less controlled (in storage warehouses) vs. the base opium from poppy (which is in a highly controlled lab environment) This is why we are seeing heroin cut with Fentanyl. Its easily obtainable because there is multiple companies that manufacture it (FL Has several big ones) and unless they get audited by the FDA or DEA, the missing drugs go unnoticed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. I thought that was all coming from the research chemical scene, as you can buy things like Butyr-Fentanyl quasi-legally from China. A gram of that mixed with 999 grams of an inert substance, theoretically, gives you a kilo of passable heroin. The problem is hot spots though. An even distribution is nearly impossible, and an extra grain or two leads to overdose and death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for all your questions, it depends on the company. If they are a small privately owned company then its more likely they do dodgy stuff. But a large publically traded company wouldnt have upper management involved due to the potential financial damage. Its typically someone who is planted in the company for the specific purpose to get the stuff out without anyone being aware (they have access to what is called the Batch Record and will modify the amount in the computer system because all of that has an electronic chain of custody). Alot of times they work as a slighty above entry level worker in the warehouse or production lines</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ben Venue Labs - given a warning letter because a disgruntled employee pissed in a vat of vaccines. They were still shipped and they didnt have a recall process, so there are people with someones piss that got injected in them. Sanofi-Pasteur - Multiple warning letters for dodgy manufacturing techniques of vaccines, but because they have a monolopy on several big ones (Zika, Yellow Fever, etc) that is government funded, they are still allowed to produce product. Heartware in Miami - Handfuls upon Handfuls of patients died from their heart implants because of poor design and manufacturing, still making the product. Baxter - Made Heparin and got the pig intestine chemical from a Chinese supplier. The supplier ran out and then manufactured inert drugs that were basically just water in a vial, several people hemorrhaged out in the operation room. Baxter was still allowed to do their thing, even though they were complicit in the act. Purdue Pharma manufactured opiates and was privately owed, they were busted for doing side deals and pushing the drugs to people who didnt need it to get them addicted to the painkillers by paying off doctors and pharmacies. VistaPharm in FL is a privately owned company that manufactures controlled opiates, they were so out of compliance the DEA and FDA halted their manufacturing (they had no records of their batches, they bought used equipment that tainted the drugs with metal and the equipment was over 30 years old). Zimmer is the largest implant manufacturer in the world and they have been under a &quot;remediation&quot; for 5+ years and still are because people are dying left and right due to several things. Wright Medical got busted for allowing bacteria to form on their implants (called pyrogencity testing). I could go on for DAYS</p>

<p>I believe the opium that is eventually refined into pharmaceuticals is produced on plantations owned by the pharmaceutical companies. You know who gets marijuana the cheapest? The guys who grow it. Their cost absolutely cannot be beaten-it&#39;s solely their time, fertilizers and seeds.</p>
