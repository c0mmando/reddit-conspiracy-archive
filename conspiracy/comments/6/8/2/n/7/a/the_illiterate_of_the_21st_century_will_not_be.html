       Good quote. Things I have had to learn, unlearn and relearn recent years:
Medicine and nutrition since it’s intentionally designed to make you sick.
How the monetary systems, media, democracy, science (so called) and our societies actually works. Hint – An Elite runs the entire show, but have carefully crafted the appearance of democratic societies and free media. In reality all media is controlled and our politicians are just puppets
9/11
The lunar landings and space travel (Yes ISS IS fake)

       yeah it's a little nutty considering you can buy a telescope and watch the space station... and go visit the rockets and watch them take off or talk to the astronauts or get rich and spend $20 million and get the Russians to take to you there.

       I don't agree with you POV on lunar landings and ISS. I think that, at the most, lunar landings were faked at first then accomplished later.

       Um, sometemes parts of meteors reentry, but most of them burn up in the atmosphere just like a man made object would. And then they crash at high speed because reentry does not slow you down that much, especially not down to a speed where it possible to deploy a chute.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the most impossible thing with reentry is that they claim that a capsule shaped like Apollo would be able to be stable entering the atmosphere at 30000 km/h. I just cannot happen. Imagine a Apollo capsule shout out over a lake at high speed. What happens when the capsule touches the water? Same thing would happen if you try enter the atmosphere from the vaccum of space at 30000 kmph

       Yes, it ablates. That's a crude way to describe an ablative heat shield. A man-made ablative shield is also engineered to not break up on reentry, unlike say a meteor.

      <p>
       Or rather, they don't slow down a big rock because the meteor is dense all the way through and has an irregular shape. A capsule, shuttle or any man-made object designed to reenter is:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Probably pressurized (though it doesn't have to be

        Probably light (compared to a big rock)
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So they slow down much more rapidly. Also you will have to source that.

       I beg to differ. I think comparing hitting a waterbody at high speed on earth is a pretty reasonable analogy to what would happen if you tried to enter the atmosphere from an earth parking orbit in which you need to have a speed at about 30000 kph to stay in orbit. And even if the effect would be slightly softer you still would enter a violent spin. Something shaped like the Apollo capsule is not stable, but then again nothing can be stable in near vacuum, and one side of the ship would come in contact with the upper atmosphere first sending the ship into a irrecoverable tumble. Rudder or corrective rockets would not help at that hight, not that the Apollo capsules had any.

       It isn't. For one, air is a gas, and water is a liquid. The cohesion between the molecules miles apart. Both air and liquid flows around the body, but while a plane CAN go supersonic, a submarine can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the atmospheric density increases slowly from approximately 0 atm. to 1 atm. over a distance of about 120 km. This is completely different from hitting a liquid waterbody, which would have a very limited amount of density. It would be like hitting a brick wall, vs hitting an ever increasing amount of oxygen molecules and whatever other gasses.

       You can easily make a capsule stable in the air stream. Concentrate the mass up front, and make it so that any "delta-thrust" applied in one direction is countered by another. It's aerodynamically stable by the book.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No it would not. It could be very close to tipping, but the center of mass being further forwards would push the capsule back into position. The airstream around it would not allow it to ever enter a tumble, because of the principles of aerodynamics. Sure, it can in theory become completely irrecoverable, just like an airplane CAN stall. But you would have to start the tumble high up on purpose, and if luck is on your side, you can still recover. See
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_5#Mission_highlights">
        this
       </a>
       story how a Soyuz capsule which entered the wrong way, managed to flip around because the unintended parts broke off and the aerodynamic characteristics made it stable.

      <p>
       What height? Upper atmosphere and vaccuum, RCS did the job fine. This is not so important when your reentry is more or less ballistic (Apollo wasn't, it was a skip reentry), and more important on fixed wing like the Shuttle. Later on, the RCS would be used for rotation around the Y-axis, and offset mass controlled the rate of reentry.

I don't find that plausible. Look at the two persons that made an parachute jump from extreme height. Both got into an irrecoverable spin and skilled parachute jumpers are very good at cancelling spin.

      <p>
       And regarding comparing to enter water at high speed I agree water has very different density but I still think it's a valid thought experiment considering the insane speed you have in earth orbit. There's no way anything could re-entry without starting to spin violently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked at the Lunar Landings and manned space travel extensively and my conclusion is that it's all lies. It not a few pieces of anomalies. It's a truckload from every angle you look at it. Here's some gems regarding re-entry:

       Of course I base myself on the NASA story. You try to counter NASA, so I will have to back them up with the information they present. But this is also basic aerodynamics. Center of Mass in front of Center of Lift always applies when some lift and drag are generated, and reentry does just that.

       I think this the essence of the different views we have on this. NASA and it's backers will of course never give you any reason to question the Moon Landings or manned space travel the same way as a church will not give you reason to doubt the existence of their God.

       I have read the "criticism" before, and I have looked at the "not-criticism" (footage from NASA I guess), and the story still holds. I calculated the delta-v budget by hand, and it made sense. I've looked at the various shadows, VA belts and what have you, and the explanations still made sense. What else do you want me to do? Read yet more stuff?

       No I won't and it wouldn't change anything. If investigating space travel and discussing it with people has tought me one thing it that our core beliefs, for example that NASA and the government would never get away with lying about this, cannot be changed by facts with most people. And you have all the facts you need already at Aulis at r/moonhoax and several other places.

       Cool, and I don't mean to preach meat eating either. But if there's one thing I've learned from looking into nutrition, it's that animal fat is essential to us and that we should avoid grains and sugar. So vegan  with lots of butter is pretty much the ideal diet :)

       Problem with dairy is the conditions for the animal and also cows have to birth calves to produce milk, what do you think happens if the calf is a male? Do your own research and make up your own mind. I'm not as strict as I used to be, but its been 18 years now, more than half my life. I don't need animal fat I'm living proof.

       There is some research into blood types and diets and I believe there are a couple blood types who have a near impossible time with a vegan diet. Take this all with a grain of salt and educate yourselves.

       Veganism isn't a psy ops. It's origins are with ahimsa and the south Asian religions. There's no evidence humans thrive on animal fat, if anything there is evidence that saturated fat in excess causes issues. Going vegan dropped my LDL heroically.

       There's nothing special about butter for example that can't be found in coconut oil, a similar molecular structure

       I wonder pontificating on this point just two days ago with my children. It used to be we had choices, 3 channels and some UHF. And this, son, is how we get 8 years of perfect strangers: they make a turd sandwhich with shows you love in the front and back, and after two seasons of "don't be  ridiculous" they can now move that show anywhere in the week and YOU'LL STILL WATCH IT. 
(There was perfect strangers rant on teen titans... )
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway it devolved into a "y'all have TOO MANY CHOICES" rant about how that eventually leads to lots of shitty, time wasting choices. (Example, most of youtube, most mobile video games, etc..)

       Canceled my cable... I read books now. The last straw for me was I thought the Honey Boo Boo saga but when I chanced across RuPaul's Drag Race I knew paying for television was over.   Cable used to be about commercial free tv. now i pay to watch more commercials than actual show. And the shows are so ridiculous.... canceled.

       I would assume that "learn, unlearn and relearn" is some description of the process of re-evaluating your beliefs and opinions based on new evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       From within the context of a particular conspiracy theory, those who are unable to engage in such mental gymnastics will be undesirable in the one world order. All truth can be made mutable, and those with the power to establish the new truth will be threatened by those unwilling to accept the new truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a more mundane perspective, your capacity to continue evaluating and re-evaluating what you perceive as the truth is one measurement of intellect.
