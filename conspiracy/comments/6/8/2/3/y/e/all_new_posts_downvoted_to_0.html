    <div class="md"><p>This.  It also effects comments too on various subs.  Either they target new posts and comments on specific subs (they definitely do) or they are logging users and down voting based on acct/ip (looks like they do that too).</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a simple redditor.  I go have maybe 10 subs, mostly conspiracy or video game related.  Sorta irks me a bit because I don&#39;t post or comment often, only when I have something to offer.  It is blatant suppression of critical thought.  I even had one recent post shadowbanned in r/askthe_donald.  I simply asked where voters stand on the mountains of evidence that Kushner has been financed by Soros, provided a few links, kept it eloquent, polite, and short.  Hmm, no bites?  I&#39;m seriously curious... so I log out check the sub... it&#39;s not there.  Yet when I log back in, it&#39;s there and not marked deleted.  That could just be mods though not wanting redpills in their Q&amp;A.  Still though, the fuckery is astounding.</p>

What really grinds my gears is that much of propaganda and psywar is easily noticed and understood by myself, but it seems like everyone else either doesn&#39;t see it, seem to care, or automatically thinks you&#39;re nuts.  The latter is fine, I get it... they&#39;ve bought into the programming.  The first, I think can be summarily viewed as these people are just stupid.  It&#39;s the middle block that confuses me.

<blockquote>
<p>A recent poll conducted by the University of Virginia Center for Politics shows that 93% of those who voted for President Donald Trump approve of the job he is doing.</p>

<p>In addition to the animal question, the poll is unique in that it explores the grayer areas within what approval means. When asked to identify the strength of their convictions, 42% described their approval as &quot;strong&quot; while 51% placed theirs in the &quot;somewhat&quot; category.</p>

<p>The release notes that &quot;men were more likely to be strong approvers than women (44 percent of men were strong approvers vs. 39 percent of women); respondents over 65 were the only age group where strong approvers outnumbered somewhat approvers (48 percent-46 percent).&quot;</p>
