       The original post was deleted due to rule 12, so I figured I'd take screenshots and repost.

       They are in reverse order, so the top image is the end of when downvoted started. Since taking those screenshots all new posts have been downvoted too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been 2 posts that were not downvoted in this time period, both related to Pizzagate.

       Their upvotes didn't come from this post, you can see in the screenshots these are the only posts to have avoided the downvotes (those 2 Pizzagate posts and the 2 posts talking about the downvotes).

       Thanks. This is a public service. My information is sub mods do not control vote manipulation,
       <em>
        Reddit
       </em>
       admin does that. It takes a lot of effort and patience to curb vote manipulation and your efforts do not pay off 100% of the time. It's like the road you travel which you know could use more speed traps but doesn't get 'em.

       Yep. I've pissed off a few people and still get followed.

       One guy still follows me around and PMs because I commented over a year ago saying if I was on that Korean Ferry that sank I wouldn't listen to the captain and I would get the hell off. For some reason he was obsessed with telling me that I should stay on and listen to the captain. It's creepy.

       Off of Reddit and into real life, they can't stop the momentum of the truth, which is why they are now blatantly seeking to destroy the forums in which it is propagated. Spread the word to your family and friends and don't forget that most of the shilling we see on reddit is just that...manufactured consensus to make us believe that we are in the minority.

       This never happens on any other sub ever. I mean it just doesn't you know. This is completely new to reddit and posts on new are never just down voted.

       This has been going on for some time now, and exactly how quality content is prevented from reaching the front page. For content to be visible, it has to attain more upvotes from users than other subs to compensate for the burying of content. It's unfortunate, yet hardly surprising.

       This.  It also effects comments too on various subs.  Either they target new posts and comments on specific subs (they definitely do) or they are logging users and down voting based on acct/ip (looks like they do that too).

       I'm just a simple redditor.  I go have maybe 10 subs, mostly conspiracy or video game related.  Sorta irks me a bit because I don't post or comment often, only when I have something to offer.  It is blatant suppression of critical thought.  I even had one recent post shadowbanned in r/askthe_donald.  I simply asked where voters stand on the mountains of evidence that Kushner has been financed by Soros, provided a few links, kept it eloquent, polite, and short.  Hmm, no bites?  I'm seriously curious... so I log out check the sub... it's not there.  Yet when I log back in, it's there and not marked deleted.  That could just be mods though not wanting redpills in their Q&amp;A.  Still though, the fuckery is astounding.

       Good video.  Yeah, I was certainly aware of the manipulation.  What really grinds my gears is that much of propaganda and psywar is easily noticed and understood by myself, but it seems like everyone else either doesn't see it, seem to care, or automatically thinks you're nuts.  The latter is fine, I get it... they've bought into the programming.  The first, I think can be summarily viewed as these people are just stupid.  It's the middle block that confuses me.  I don't see any room for neutrality when forming an opinion on the fact that you are being deceived or enslaved.

       Always in public, never in private.  Realists must accept reality.  However, it is somewhat of a moral obligation to society to portray positive behavior in public.  Our feelings shouldn't dictate behavior.  In a face to face discussion I would never decry others to be stupid.  However, that doesn't change the fact 3/4 of the population are in-fact, not as smart as the remaining quarter.

       it happens in lots of subreddits it is a strategy to get your content to the top. just have your group spam downvote everything that isn't you. I usually go to new in my favorite subs. I recommend everyone who subscribes to a sub to browse all. you get to help steer the sub in the direction you want. upvote what you consider good content downvote what you think is shit posts.

       Sorry to hear. It happens to pretty much everyone who posts in this sub now. I've found it's better to simply delete and repost if necessary. Maybe give it a few hours, or days, and try to make sure it hasn't already been posted by another user since.

       People that supported Trump still support him.... WOW! The poll was done only of Trump Voters.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The poll involved 1,000 Trump voters and was conducted between April 17 and 19. The center also held 8 focus groups with participants of various political leanings.

       And the poll you link show that his support is down among those that voted for him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A recent poll conducted by the University of Virginia Center for Politics shows that 93% of those who voted for President Donald Trump approve of the job he is doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the animal question, the poll is unique in that it explores the grayer areas within what approval means. When asked to identify the strength of their convictions, 42% described their approval as "strong" while 51% placed theirs in the "somewhat" category.
       </p>
       <p>
        The release notes that "men were more likely to be strong approvers than women (44 percent of men were strong approvers vs. 39 percent of women); respondents over 65 were the only age group where strong approvers outnumbered somewhat approvers (48 percent-46 percent)."

       Can somebody explain this? I went to new and just started upvoting everything. turns out, only certain posts counter will go up if you upvote them. others stay at 0 even if the are upvoted.

       Pizzagate gets downvoted to hell because it's fucking retarded. Unless there is new information stop wasting people's time. It makes conspiracy folks look like morons when this is associated with things that may have actually happened. Its embarrassing.

       This has happened for a while now, and it happens in most subs. In most cases it's just people wanting to make sure their post gets up top, so they and their sock puppet accounts downvote everything else while upvoting theirs. It's also a tactic utilized by companies for "organic advertising ".

       I wouldn't doubt that there are other people wanting to suppress certain information from getting out.

       Why don't r/conspiracy just change the way people vote? I see on other subs that you can only vote UP if you like it. There is no down vote because it's been removed by the owner mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would solve the problem?

       Unfortunately, not really. That's not actually a Reddit feature and just uses CSS tricks to perform like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be easily disabled using something like Reddit Enhancement Suite that allows you to disable subreddit styles.

       I don't mind it. Most of the new posts in this sub are hot garbage and don't pertain to anything about conspiracy

       We're doing well it seems - cracking the thick shell of them - I'm wondering - given reddit's most likely infiltrated through the gills - if there's a better place one of the mods can post at the top for a safer - more open minded - less shilled out place for this info to go - here - it's like a game of duck hunter to them - we sometimes have to flood the shit out of it so some can get away - aka above 50 upvotes

       Always keep in mind that this website is open forum. Could just be someone emotional who downvotes things when they get butthurt from reading them. Or it's the CIA. either way.
