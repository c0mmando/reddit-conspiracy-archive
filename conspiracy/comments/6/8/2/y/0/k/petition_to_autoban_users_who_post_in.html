<p>This might be an example, except...9 comments, none actually advocating doing that or plotting something. 32 upvotes in total, that&#39;s it. The naked truth about that post? OP is totally right, and a replier makes this astute observation I&#39;m sure few here will actually admit the reality of:</p>

<p>&quot;The newer astroturfy stuff is different. It&#39;s missing the playfulness and speculative wildness of the old stuff, but at the same time it takes itself completely seriously. It&#39;s also completely loaded down with political agenda to a much greater degree. It&#39;s obvious political propaganda.</p>

<p>I find it very disturbing, especially knowing that both the Soviets and the Nazis and other European fascists of the early 20th century made heavy use of conspiracy theory as propaganda. Some of the stuff that&#39;s going on today feels very much like the organized assembly of lynch mobs via conspiracy theory and witch hunts. It&#39;s being done with a degree of sophistication that suggests to me that it&#39;s being intentionally coordinated, with grassroots mobs like 4chan /pol and the various alt-right subreddits being seeded with information and led to desired conclusions.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Confirmation bias?  haha...just kidding.  I thoroughly enjoy hanging out in libertarian subs and honing my message for a particular topic.  But I also like going to alternative leaning subs to defends those positions which either forces me to adjust through learning, or solidifies my stance and find that a very important part of my belief system.  I have a great time getting into heated (but very civil) discussions on wayofthebern.  There are some really great folks in that sub who have completely opposite political beliefs than myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I made a call to action like that at, idk, 4chan, would that be alright? How about T_D?</p>

<p>I am seriously tired of the partisan BS. We all have opinions related to politics, but treating this sub like a team sport is not okay.</p>
