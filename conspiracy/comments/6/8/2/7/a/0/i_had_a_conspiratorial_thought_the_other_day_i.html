       I am of course talking about the Soros globalist groups introducing muslims as fast as they can everywhere Soros globalists are about to get lynched.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now please dont someone say I am talking about jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The little jewish lady down the street as a much in common with Soros globalists as a flea does to a dog. In fact she is probabaly kept more in terror by them than i am and soros and so many of them may not even be jewish. There is good reason to beleive many of those globalists arent even jewish and they hide amongst a jewish holocaust cover to deflect criticism. (lets claim we are jewish then they cant criticise us because.. Holocaust)
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why I and others carefully use the term globalist and not jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is no doubt that people were really getting smart about these Soros globalist schemes and suddenly having a bunch of tourist slaughtering muslims around means people are no longer debating or as outraged about what people like Soros are doing to control whole populations for their profits and turning them in one themsleves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a more evil alternative does create cover for evil

       I had a similar thought...
      </p>
      <p>
       But, along these lines:
      </p>
      <p>
       The "globalists" have a strong enemy. A group that wants them dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the "globalists", encourage/provoke a conflict between that other group and the West (see about Elliot Shimon, for more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the most violent enemy is taken care of by means of a war with a nuclear West. The "globalists" use an age-old 'Omg don't kill us, cos others did that and they were evil' approach to control the West.

       What i believe is the Jews, at least the ordinary ones, are like regular people, they are tricked into believing the jewish elite will save them. They are tricked into thinking that they are Semites but in reality they are not and they actually come from eastern europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elite are cannibalistic and at the last days, these Jews will be turned into the most worthy final sacrifice for their gods like Baal and Moloch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holocaust killed more Germans than "Jews" and it didn't even purge the "Jewish" elite. It's simply a massive human sacrifice ring that will be used to establish further globalist and Zionist actions like the United Nations, "Israel" (Actually satanic) and NATO (Which is made to weaken America and other western or pro-western countries)

       I'm sorry man - I'm Jewish, but I must be out of the loop on these emails I'm supposed to be getting from the tribe to keep me in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not the most observant in the world; just stick to a few cultural traditions on the important holidays, but I'd warn against making conclusions about an entire group of people based on a few pieces of anecdotal evidence, particularly when sourced other individuals
       <em>
        on the internet.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's probably plenty of pro-Jewish propaganda out there, for Jews and non-Jews alike; however there's plenty of propaganda for everyone of every set of beliefs, religious and non-religious.  I can't tell you how many people I used to know would forward around those spam emails with unverifiable (or just plainly false) theories just because they agreed with the ideas behind them.  Just because you think or agree with something doesn't mean it is true.  This is something I've had to realize over the course of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all constantly presented with something to be afraid of, whether it's WWIII, random attacks, or simply your neighbor next door having a nicer car than you.  I wouldn't say that the "average" Jewish person is any more manipulated than any other identifiable group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if this is a good example or not, but I would imagine that Armenian children are reminded of the attempts on their extermination (or any other group that has experienced the same), however if you asked a Turk official, they might deny the same information.  Who do you believe?  If you were Armenian, how would you feel?  If you were a Turk, how then?  If there was an attempt on the extermination of your people, it would only be rational to be hyper-aware and vigilant about that after that event.  I'm sure blacks were super paranoid about slavery after they were freed, and if not paranoid about slavery, about getting lynched or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I may be rambling a bit at this point, but I just wanted to chime in and provide a piece of my own evidence, from my own life.  Naturally, I know other Jews as well, and some of them are hyper aware of antisemitism and that sort of thing; there are also others who don't really give much of a shit.  It can be very convenient to make generalizations from outside another group of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay vigilant, search for the truth, and remember to think critically about the issues you care about.
      </p>

       Isn't it any different for any other religious group? The only difference is jews being less are closer to the curtain of the jewish say than say muslims or Christians therefore its easier for a greater percentage of jews to peek behind the curtain.

       This is completely speculation but I wonder  that during the 20th century there was a silent civil war between the Rothschild's/Zionists and non-Zionist European Jewish leaders who disputed what path they  were following.
      </p>
      <p>
       This prompted the Rothschild's to use various tactics to remove their Jewish rivals (including the Holocaust) and anyone else that could pose a serious threat (There's some reports that Roth's may have financed the Nazis).  Ridding their enemies, the Rothschild's could have installed loyal Zionist members (Jewish or otherwise) into positions of power that continue to this very day.

       All religious groups are hierarchical with people at the top who think of those at the bottom as expendable to some degrees. It isnt any different in judaism. Jews with power can lord over jews with roots in Israel just fine.

       You're right it is a very common tactic used throughout history to.  It's been used before in America, however, this whole Soros conspiracy is just ridiculous.  The man is a wealthy philanthropist, yet if he decides to give money to any particular group it's like he's the ring leader of the whole show. I'm not saying he's a great guy, but it doesn't make any sense to me how so many people think this guy is taking over the world.

       Get more education on what he has done.

       I remember reading about durijg a period of time in the 60's or 70's how some zionists in Israel knew there weren't enough immigrants coming into Israel so thet bombed jews in other countries with false flag attacks which scared those jews with fears of anti semitism so more jews immigrated to Israel.

       They want people to say that those who critise them for massive financial scams and overthrowing countries for their own profits and control are anti semitic so they can shelter as untouchables behind the curtain of the holocaust.

       I mean they are Jewish, though.

       There's a reason for it - early Catholics wouldn't lend money for religious reasons so the Jews became the bankers/creditors.

       In hollywood its becmlome common to fake being jewish and gay to get jobs because its so discriminating there. What proof do we have anyone is jewish?

       The genetic test are showing huge proportions of people who thought they were "the chosen people" are not. So tuet were sucdessfully becias etuey were in a club that was fictional in membership qualifiifations but promoted from within to the exclusion of outsiders and they did the work.

       It doesn't matter if they are orthodox jews or genetically related.
What is important is that they consider themselves to be an ethnic group, and that the jewish ethnic group gives preferential treatment to other members of their ethnic group, all while trying to blend in with non-jews and hiding their activities.

       It's really obvious.. look after the Trump victory, all of a sudden Jewish Centers are attacked. Where the hell did that come from, there were never any anti-semetic rhetoric during DT's run. Turns out it was a Jewis guy in Israel calling in threats. It's like they don't want to be out of the spotlight for a minute... the 'oppression spotlight'

       True.  However the conflation of the two doesn't mean that the information isn't fundamentally accurate.  It just means that it's being applied to cast aspersions on any anti-globalism which examines too closely the Jewish elite (as opposed to the ordinary, normal, rank-and-file commoner Jews who have been just as much the victims of the Jewish elite as the rest of us if not moreso.  The elite have demonstrated abundantly that they're perfectly content to throw their own rank-and-file out if that will enable their agenda.).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm unhappy that anti-Globalist opinions are now being conflated with anti-Jewish.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The study of the history, behavior patterns and symbolism of the known NWO organizations confirms a significant amount of overlap with the globalist Jewish elite.  I'll summarize.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vatican continues to use ancient Babylonian occult symbolism beneath a superficially Christian veneer intended for the public.  It appears to front for the continuing Babylonian order of mystery-priests who'd set themselves and their political figures up as spurious god-kings during the original Babylonian Empire.  Both history and Scripture tell us that the regime began in the Babylonian Empire, and then the ruling system hopped like a flea onto the political systems of the Medo-Persian Empire, the Greek Empire, the Roman Empire, and then the Roman Empire in its repackaged form presenting as Christianity in an effort to subvert the upsurge of legit Christianity that arose in the Middle East in the wake of Jesus and His followers.  Because when you really want to get in there and knock something over, you pose as it and then do it from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do the Jewish elite figure into this?  Both Judaism and the Babylonian / Chaldean power structure originated in the same neighborhood, at about the same time.  We know that by Jesus' day the Jewish commoners were not only contending with overt political oppression from Rome, but also internal subversion within the ranks of their religious authorities which manifested as plenty of  hypocrisy, formalism and literalism in the synagogues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chaldea had become a place of learning where, as the Babylonian Empire would sprawl out into neighboring territories, the assimilated intellectual elites from these absorbed territories would come to learn the Babylonian arts and sciences.  When they arrived to Chaldea, they had the distinction of not being required to give up their native religion but instead were allowed to keep their native religion... but they were indoctrinated as Babylonians and grew in their values morally and intellectually, not unlike the way our modern public schools give students a sense of what's socially and politically normative.  Result: Professing Jews who were increasingly Babylonian in their thoughts and principles, commanded by an Empire with an expansionistic conquest agenda.  If you were Babylon, what would you do with these superficially Jewish scholars?  You'd send them out to the surrounding regions to subvert the thought and morals of your military targets and bring them into ways and values favorable to your agenda.  Beyond a certain point military conquest
       <em>
        per se
       </em>
       would have been unnecessary; simply gaining control over the thought and political systems of your neighbors would suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-evidently, this is a scheme which continues today.  Nations are superficially distinct, but their systems and officials serve the globalist agenda instead.  The People remain largely unaware of the situation, but they and the society in which they live are increasingly subverted very gradually with each successive generation.

       I'd say it would be way easier to turn groups against one another by taking advantage or in group/out group psychology, dehumanization, religion, race, etc. Seems a lot easier and it's been done in the past. For example, it was a lot easier for Hitler to do what he did and have the amount of support he did at the time if he could convince you that Jews were less than human.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also look into the political machines of the 1700-1900s such as Tammany Hall which essentially controlled in it's sphere of influence and helped only immigrants with certain demographics gain influence in politics.

       Downvotes from the right wing Donald here. They're so fucking delusional. If you think a demagogue will bring you to freedom you can be led right out again. At the end of the day you're right, capitalism and the ability for people to hoard wealth and capital forces people into virtual wage slavery. Without economic freedom we can't have any type of freedom. As long as you have to slave yourself for bread you cannot think about the greater problems.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So the CIA/Hollywood complex is suggesting the “well-oiled and well-armed multinational group of elites” behind the alien conspiracy are…
       </p>
       <p>
        1) the “military industrial complex,”
       </p>
       <p>
        2) the political-level “world leaders,”
       </p>
       <p>
        3) the “governments,” and
       </p>
       <p>
        4) the “corporations.”
       </p>
       <p>
        But as any student of this conspiracy should know by now, these four groups are NOT the bosses; they are mere mid-level minions. Operating above all of them is the banking complex (the commercial and central banks), and operating above the banking complex are the real bosses and their top-level minions (the Occulted Powers):
       </p>
       <p>
        1) the Roman Empire (the Catholic and Orthodox Churches + associated global religions and priesthoods),
       </p>
       <p>
        2) the royal families,
       </p>
       <p>
        3) the Jewish bankster families,
       </p>
       <p>
        4) the Freemasons and other secret societies, and
       </p>
       <p>
        5) the Mafia and other sanctioned criminal groups.
       </p>

        Did you notice how NONE of these five groups was mentioned as taking part in the alien conspiracy? And why is this? As I said before, the CIA and Hollywood don’t want you to know what’s really going on and who’s really behind it. They want you to believe in benevolent aliens so they can pull off the next step of their “End Times” plan to unite the world under a theocratic dictatorship (and have us believe it’s a paradise).

       Or, they want individuals to consider many extraterrestrials as hostile, so if they pull a false flag--a 9/11 like event with a seemingly real alien invasion/show of force, the populace will happily go along with whatever Uncle Sam recommends we do. From the research I've done, it seems that most ayys are benevolent--I mean, the ones that made it here are obviously extremely intelligent, capable of seeming FTL interstellar travel, and by many accounts, telepathically interfacing with other sentient lifeforms--plus, if they wanted us dead, we'd all be dead. Some of them probably have death star-esque technology that makes thermonuclear weapons look like children's toys. To me, it seems most of them seem to abide by a non-interference policy, which makes sense. The less they interfere with our activities, the less likely it is we will do the same to them.

       Kevin McDonald wrote about this in his book "Culture of Critique", and yes, he wrote about jews and their subversion of USA. Jews promoted INA 1965 because they didn't want to be the only minority in the country. Now they promoting muslim migration in Europe and North America.

       Serious question, how did george soros become the king super villain in your theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is HILARIOUS:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Thats why I and others carefully use the term globalist and not jewish."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By saying you 'carefully' use one term and not the other means that you MEAN the other but are careful to hide it.

       Research soros. From his near destruxtion of the britsh economy to his active roles in revolutions around the globe that have resulted in the deatths of thousands to his financing of violence right here in america  now.
.i know of no singke person who has done worse and financially benfited more.
      </p>
      <p>
       And dont forget his nazi thug days. The scene in the movie  "woman in gold" where the nazis come to the jewish household and seize things. Thats what soros did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And about your wording nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No it means i mean what i say and not the words other people try to say i mean
      </p>

       So scelrew you and your false flag antisemitism that hurts the cases of real antisemitism when they happen because people like you create false flags all the time..
      </p>
      <p>
       The worldxs antisemitism fatigue is directly because of you and people like you constantly making false claims.

       You're describing a scapegoat. You're on the right track though, you still have a ways to go. Our current scapegoats are race, gender, and money.

       Not if they are seen as the enablers. In relation to muslims soros globalist groups are seen as the triggerfinger loading and pulling the trigger, liberals as the gun and muslims as the ammo.
      </p>

       I think soros is a fallguy. It would have to be a huge network of bankers industrialists etc. . How come soros is relatively prominent in the media?
