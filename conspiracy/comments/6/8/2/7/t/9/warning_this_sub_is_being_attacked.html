       Stealth Downvoting bots. That is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe reddit is bought down under maintenence today so it can install a system that downvotes all new posts in dissendent subs, or to make bots that downvote threads in those subs. In other words, this maintenance manipulates the system into downvoting all new posts in dissendent subs by themselves, or introduces bots into dissendent sites that get around user checks to do so. Since this site does not allow new users to post, the maintenance might be used in order to activate these bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all i need is concrete proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other subs might be attacked so be warned.

       Alright, I blew this off at first but now what I'm seeing is odd. Most posts sitting around 55% or less (which is fine if their shit posts) but some are of these are just legit posts about studies we should be informed about.

       On 4/26 I think Reddit went down a total of 3 times.
I know it went down at least once but for me it messed up 3 times. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed this.

       Unfortunately this doesn't really bother me. I could care less what I say that gets down voted. If this is an attempt to get people to stop posting here it is just going to fail miserably to the hardcore conspiracy reddit people.

       Here is how to fight stealth downvoting. 
Go to your settings for Reddit.
Look at your comments setting. 
Look for:
      </p>
      <p>
       don't show me comments with a score less than  [  ] (leave blank to show all comments)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a number in the box erase it. 
Then, no matter how low comments gets downvoted, you will still see them all.

       How could they make it not a surprise? It seems to be late at night US time, when traffic is low. I doubt it's worth it to really devote resources to try telling people it's going down for a few hours a year.

       Don't be a moron. There are plenty of stupid ass posts with no proof but there are also plenty of well structured posts that have a lot of proof and evidence to back them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Pizza/PedoGate. If you spend some time actually looking through sources, evidence and doing some of your own research you can see there is mountains of evidence that point towards it. No concrete proof like "x is a pedo here is a pic of it" but A LOT of evidence pointing towards it.

       According to reports he shot a single bullet or he shot multiple shots. Pretty easy to know if you heard 1 or multiple shots.

       Are the Cincinnati Reds actually running an exotic animal smuggling ring? Are the Girl Scouts of America really running a mind-control scheme? You can make up anything and then go find some bullshit that "proves" it.

       Actually when you look at the list of code words that an autistic teenager made up and posted on 4chan, you'll see that they are both true actually.

      <p>
       For example, when you're looking at the Reds
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortstop=illegally poached panda
ERA=shipment of stolen animals
Starting pitcher=elephant meat
      </p>

       These things came from 4chan, so obviously they are true and not made up. The rabbit hole goes much, much deeper.

       The same anonymous teenager who started 4chan with his (totally not made up) code words has also posted code words proving that the Cincinnati Reds are running an exotic animal smuggling operation. You can see this in the official documents from the Reds and Major League Baseball (which is covering for the Reds, obviously).

      <p>
       You can be an anti-exotic animal shill all you want, but this theory is just as real and just as founded as Pizzagate. They come from the same source, what more do you want?

       Do a search. You won't find pizza anywhere on there. The FBI documents covered the symbols for boy love, but in no way confirmed or even mentioned pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza connection was made by 4chan users, as
       <a href="/u/JoePesciOfGoneFishin">
        /u/JoePesciOfGoneFishin
       </a>
       mentioned. But PG proponents have conflated the two, and now go around claiming that the FBI corroborated the code words.

      <p>
       How does this work? Do I pick a word, search the emails to see if it's used more than x times, decide that must mean it has some relation to pedophilia / is code for something related to pedophilia, then decide on a meaning?
      </p>
      <p>
       I searched the emails for "burger," this appears 332 times vs. 149 for "pizza," I can't decide between whether that means the act of a child being sandwiched between two pedophiles, or it's code for a 'husky' child.

       I don't know why they would mention a handkerchief, but the most obvious reason is because it's actually a handkerchief, and the pizza related map is a description of what's on the handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only suspicious if pizza and handkerchief are codewords, and the only evidence for those codewords comes from 4chan, not FBI documents.

       LMAO every fucking time with the "i-its from 4chan so it MUST be made up".
      </p>
      <p>
       The code words go all the way back to the beginning of 4chan (Which was in 2004 I believe). And maybe they existed before then.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is like saying because a teenager called weed "Pot" it's impossible that it would be code a adult would use. This whole argument is completely fucking retarded and it's so obvious it's specifically used for people who have only heard of 4chan as "The bad part of the internet", So they automatically believe the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       REMINDER: There is a MOUNTAIN of coincidental evidence supporting Pizzagate. Take half a hour looking at even a tiny bit of that evidence and then think of the fucking chances of it being fake.

       exactly. its working backwards, its cheating from a theory standpoint. the evidence points to a theory, you dont come up with the theory first then try to justify it. In this case:

       I've asked for the best four or five pieces of evidence and it always starts with a list of take-out foods that staffers frequently eat in DC. That town runs on pizza and whatnot. But its just gotta be pedo code, which somehow every person in pizzagate following supposedly knows.

       The main problem with PedoGate is people are too focused on a single pizza place in DC being the centre of it all. Obviously it fucking isn't, that should be fairly obvious. It was just the first one to raise suspicions.

       Dude, have you ever in your life tried to trademark a logo? It has to be something that no one has trademarked or similar enough to possible be confused with one. Local businesses choose unique and strange logos all the time. A lot of times its a reference to something that isn't immediately obvious, but having nothing to do with something nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take
       <a href="https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/60PjkXB8lLsFMdpgmez8hA/ls.jpg">
        East Side Pies logo
       </a>
       here in Austin. Infodorks started camping out and harassing these poor folks (who are friends of friends of mine and make damn good pizza) because they claimed it was a reference to the illuminati or some such shit and therefore just
       <em>
        haaaaad
       </em>
       to be part of pizzagate. Isn't it such a coincidence that a part of the pizza pedo conspiracy just happens to be in the hometown of Alex Jones, where he and most of his staff live? Amazing! The truth is that East Side Pies abbreviates to ESP and so the logo is a riff on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take some coincidences and make some story up with zero additional evidence if you want. But others of us want something concrete. If its such a large ring, why have no children come forward? Why do enthusiasts make stupid claims like the presence of a basement in the pizza place, which has no basement?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is exactly what I'm talking about. That's for the demo.

       There is plenty of other evidence along with the fact of the logos of the two pizza places located near each other. Official pedo code words being used in official linked emails of people involved with the Clintons, people being charged with child trafficking in Hati being pardoned and then being put on Hilary's campaigns, the people who own the land those pizza places are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on and on but I'm not prepared to unload all the evidence I have read into this thread because it would take too long and if you really want to debunk the whole claim look at the evidence for yourself and provide a reason for each and everyone single piece of evidence that is a very odd coincidence.

       In the second link, there is no source for the "code words." they're just listed there with no reference as to how they are "official." Can you maybe explain where the code words come from and what makes them official? Because your link blows donkey sick.

       So, why is "blows donkey dick" used? A link is a collection of letters, formatted so that a computer can understand it. How can a collection of letters suddenly go, and fellate a donkey?

      <p>
       Or, is it that you admit that in your usage of slang, you try to convey an idea using words that have a predefined meaning, to express a new idea, that you do not explicity want to stat out? Oh, wow, it is allmost like using slang conveys more that you are on the "inside" of a group, making self referential messages that are not easily understandable to the non initiated.

       Because I could not find a single source for your claim, and would honestly be interrested in how you managed to track down what an anonymous user in a messageboard who posted that wrote. Maybe you have access to trackers, maybe you have elite hacking tools, who knows. The possibilities are endless.

       But if you use refferences like "an unnamed expert said, without revealing his evidence", then I would call bullshit on your "fact" the same way you called bullshit on my "fact".

       AAAh, so you have an autist from 4-chan showing interrest in a word is evidence that they made it up? What was that about not taking "Things 4channers take interrest in" for 100 as evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because if we take your pic of "They made that up for luls" as evidence, we could get into how unfair it is that we can't cite wikipedia as evidence, when there are edithathions to make wikipedia say what you want. I mean, by your own standarts, all you have is someone used the background of 4-chan, the iconic style, then wrote "Check out this double speak", and then send it to the new york times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still stand by my claim. If you can't defuse my argument without deeming 4-chan unreliable, or "fake", but then come up with why what 4-chan wrote is actually relevant, hell, what do you want?  Is 4-chan in or out as a reliable source?

       The problem is that once it was proven that the pizza place had no basement or kidnapped kids, people had to move the goalposts. Gotta move on to the stuff without evidence against it.

       Seriously? It's the way they talk about the food. I can give you 5 emails which are about food talked about in very strange sentences. You can try to explain them if you want. Also email about a torture chamber, kids with their ages mentioned being in a heated pool for older mens entertainment etc.

       This is played out throughly on the r/AskTrumpSupporters subreddit. No matter what trump says or does, it was the right thing. Perfect example; he just recently decided he's going to stick with nafta. Suddenly shockingly, that's a good thing with trump supporters. Check the threads, you can't make this shit up.

       trust me, it's fake, ok. Just, you're wasting energy on this, creating negative emotions foryourself and others who read your words. It's fake. There definitely must be pedo politicians in washington, but i have two theories - this whole pizzagate thing was a political bogus show to screw hillary, because she indeed might be related to some pedos. 2nd possibility, it was a fake news event, but the motive was to draw a real fireline. By burning a strip of land so to say, they warned and shut down all the pedos and politicians who might have been getting more and more engaged by this...bloody unspeakable allegation.

       I expect every government to make some attempt at influencing public opinion in a target country when the circumstances suggest that a government's leadership has sufficient interest in supporting or preventing a particular political outcome.  Whether such attempts will have a material impact is a separate inquiry.

       I'd determine which specific activities I could attribute to the government in question with a reasonable degree of certainty, then speculate over the magnitude of the impact from those activities, while keeping in mind that the magnitude of the impact will vary geographically and significantly depend on the complex interactions of various prevailing themes in existence just prior to zero hour for the planned mission, all the while recognizing that the hypothesis supposing enough of an impact to change the election outcome cannot be falsified through empirical or any other means.

       Any information operation is intended to influence the target population.  The important details would be the specific resources and methods employed.  Accurate information regarding those factors would help inform how best to prioritize the interests of the American people when dealing with Russia going forward.  Never react.

       "How best to prioritize the interests of the American people" is a topic of substantial disagreement among Americans.

       I could see the establishment doing the reverse, upvoting various conspiracy theories in these subs to distract from real conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Promote chem trails while signing an executive order to allow coal companies to dump chemicals in rivers directly. Also planes are emmiting toxic substances... it's CO2 and our world is baking but no one beer cares about how the republicans are going to dismantle any climate change initiatives at the behest of large fossil fuel companies. The sec state was the president of Exon mobil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate and Clinton foundation stuff while the government swamp is filled twice deeper. Sketchy Russia connections. Out in the open nepotism. Erdawan just gave himself dictatorial powers and trump congratulated him becuase he has towers in Istanbul... same with the  Philippines etc. Remember Flynn who promoted pizza gate was an actual foreign agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now democracy and freedom are at risk around the world. Erdawan seized control, dueterte is murdering people outright, Venezuela is in rebellion. Governments are generating fake news, monitoring communications, tampering with other countries elections.  Big companies run the show. People are dying from opiates while for profit prisons make money on millions of young men on weed convictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this sub has found the real deal... the earth is flat, D.C. elite are torturing and diddling kids in ironically named pizza shops, planes are spreading mind control agents, the Rothchilds and elders of Zion are secretly out to neuter the rest of the world... the powers the be probably make upvote bots for these sites/forums.

       Companies, governments, politicians use social media and complex algorithms to deliver specific content, fake information, and marketing aimed at you... you think you make your own decisions while you are flooded with microtargeted ads and content follow you on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is about reducing people to consumers. Latest fashions for clothes you do not need, pictures of airbrushed models to make you insecure and buy cosmetics and sumpplements... everything geared to insercutiry, a constent need for more stuff to fill a void.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything reduced to a torrent of short sound bites... people get used to this torrent and are unable to do complex long cognitvely intensive tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a classic example. Its either an oganic outgrowth of a preconditioned popoulation or actively pushed narrative by some entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically snippets of information, intrigue, linked to together with loose associations. No time intesive cognitevely complex information.. rather just intuitive random associations. Add in the aura of mystique by adding in nefarious organizations and leading political oepratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tap into a national dislike and distrust of the hilary campaign. Also, emotionally charge it... pedophiles using innocent kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in an an anti establishment pro trump angle... and people take this hook line and sinker. Promoted on some sites (infowars whose star admitted to it being an act) to some people in positions of power (flynn, aka russian agent)... and it gets credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then 100s of people on the internet do "research"... aka image searches and simple good searches, and then spin them into the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun except this distracted from an election where trump describes walking in on changing teen Ms USA contestants and groping women without consent... where he has sold our country out to foreign and corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun until some ass shows upto comet ping pong with a gun...
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun until people's busnisses and empoyes suffer...
      </p>
      <p>
       We got played and now coal companies can dump chemicals into water ways, big oil will get their pipeline so they can get canadian oil to ports to ship to other countries, defense contractors get more orders, healthcare to poor people gets cut, erdawans get licence to do what he wants in Turkey, private prisons get a break, marijuana is not getting legalized at a federal level while sessions is in charge, we bombed syria, companies and rich people will get tax breaks blowing holes in our deficit while poor people dont, and not action on climate change, social programs to help the opiate epidimic are under attack...
      </p>
      <p>
       You got played r/conspiracy and some small independent pizza shops took the brunt (papa johns thanks you btw).

       your writing and style is definitely top notch, but i can't tell if you're being over dramatic (i do too sometimes) or what? yes, believe me pizzagate is all fake, pushed by the establishment to discredit itself, in whose eyes? don't ask! it was just a bogus thing. Trump is fine, the bits of dirt here and there don't stick like the way the entire career of hillary clinton is a big pile of shit. yes the net is bad, but you also have ad blockers if you think you're being played. you're not actually, google doesn't WANT to find you and screw you. It knows you by search strings you have searched and it is programmed to give you the ads related to what you search. Sure, maybe you know more about all this, but it just seems you know you're being dramatic, but your words...they're spreading real...discontent.

       Trump is only fine because he has been incompetent. He has sold out the government, bombed Syria, done nothing of what he promised but has made sure big companies can pollute, appointed an AG who thinks canabis is evil, proposed a healthcare plan that was more costly and worse than obama care, proposed cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, plans to gut the EPA, destroyed climate change intiatives, wants to cut funding for science, cut funding for combatting the opiate epidimic, set a new low for nepotism in the govement, spends millions of federal tax dollars on trips for himself and his family, set a new standard for hiding conflicts of interest... I mean what has Trump done to promote transparancy, the common persons interests, roll back the military industrial complex???

       No sane person is going to run for office or get power because it is impossible to penetrate the average consumer citzen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years of lies mean no one is willing to listen to complex points or naunce. Consumer voters won't listen to bad news. No one wants to change. Coprotations are geared to short term profits and reward sociopaths.

       Coroporations, religions, special intersts  seak to dismantle the insitutions of western democracy... and the public goes with it and as income inequality grows the voice of the people further shrinks. Companies have their own voices now protect by SCOTUS and billions to amplify it.

       We have lost touch with the enlightenment principles upon which our governemnt is founded. We look backwards instead of forwards. Americans and Europeans, softened by years of plenty cannot even comprehend how bad things can get.

       Perfectly said. I always thought the same about 9/11 conspiracies. Oh let's focus on some bullshit YouTube video trying to prove the airplanes were fake, but let's not look into why all the hijackers were Saudi and we don't dare do shit to Saudi Arabia.

       Simple. They want the impressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare it to me. Sure, I can get a forum up, and install 20 k bots on a server that upvote and downvote stuff, but that makes a lot of false impressions.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the opposite end, if I install the bot network herder on my server, and tell someone, if you wanna manipulte the comments, just download an exit node, and leave it on your machine. Thus, if you wanna upvote, lets say, hillary clinton is the next messiah, 20,000 times, whil downvoting "I have had it with this motherfucking big government shills in this motherfucking sub", if you now use the bot herder, you would get 20.000 distributed machines and different IP's .
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, lets think this one step further.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problemn social media sites have is correct / active users. If I am one user, but have 50 accounts, the site gets 1 user, but 49 fake ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if I use a new IP for every account, and lets say space it out a bit, I am a step closer to being undistinguishable from real accounts. 50 "real" accounts, in advertising, are much more valuable then 49 fake accounts and 1 real one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it is in the best interrests to clear up the number of fake accounts, but accounts that have a unique IP, don't post from macros, and so forth? Wow, that is indistinguishable from real accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, lets assume you are evil kenievel, and wanna post your stunts and upvote them too. You know, under the idea of, "advertisements". How would the company of reddit do this?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem becomes a bit worse if you assume the company is under watch. Not from outside (FBI, hackers, ect), but from inside as well (Disgruntled employees). So, you have to keep the number of people that "know" extremely small.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about moving that bot herder outsuide of the company? How about placing it on the server of a different entity? How about having multiple of these?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the company could be forensically investigated, all you would find is, the evil kenievel stunts were upvoted by 50 different people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you fucked with the databases, shit, people would know. people would get it. someone would blab, or just investigate out of curiosity, or something of the likes. And one insider to the company that blabs, and manages to substantiate it enough to give it credibility, and BOOM, you are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is where it gets interresting.
      </p>
      <p>
       For years, we have seen that different organisations have "tools" for social media manipulation. Hell, they have a network for 50 k employees, most of them do their work dutifully, why should they pay to use reddits botheders when they could simply write their own? After all, a LT in langley and an LT in germany will not neccessarily complain if the network is a bit slow, if all they use their internet for is sending emails and occasionally watching some movies. If the network now says, you are part of the botnet, what's so bad about it? You log onto reddit, look up the herder, upvote and dowvote according to your work list, and you logg off again. you can do this with a script under 1 MB. Even pictures usually have more.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it would be in the best interrest of reddit to encourage this kind of behavior.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         it gives them plausible deniability ( we didn't know nothing)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         it gives them more unique views.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -it prevents the advertisers from exactly knowing how many impressions are fake and how many are true, thus driving up the price reddit can ask for advertisement.

       A lot of posts get pasted/linked elsewhere where normal behavior and thought are dominant, then it draws outsiders here who begin downvoting everything with their rudimentary ideas of the world.

       I've had my own posts sniped, posted elsewhere, and subsequently brigaded and when that happens the entire thread becomes spoiled with parrots spewing the established narrative.

       FUCK EM ! I will still be reading the new posts. Votes have almost no effect to me when it boils down to information being extracted. You guys should start following my footsteps. Why are you panicking about downvotes? Read the info-process it and then make up your own mind.

       here is some proof i posted on a another thread. Upvoting all new posts only bring certain posts above zero. some stay a zero regardless of upvotes. haven't tried from multiple accounts yet.

       People here hate Alex Jones, but at the very least, they need to admit that the destinies of everyone in the conspiracy theory community are tied with his.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is our poster boy. You didn't vote for him, but he is our figurehead in the public eye right now, that's just the way it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's bad enough that you pile on him with the rest of the mainstream media like the effigy he is, just from the other direction with insane theories that he's bill hicks kidnapped by the CIA and forced to be a disinformation agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can at least admit that when shit is hitting the fan for him, the shit waves strike our shit shores.

       I've noticed that anytime someone creates a new thread topic about
       <strong>
        Pizzagate/Pedogate
       </strong>
       that it gets brigaded by trolls who post condescending messages, for the purposes of derailing or confusing anyone not familiar with the leaked Podesta emails or leaked Alefantis Instagram pics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also noticed trolls come out in droves whenever there's a good thread topic about:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ron Paul - he talks a lot about the Military Industrial Complex &amp; the Deep State, but "dissenters" come in to bash him or to bash the OP.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Julian Assange - whenever someone posts something positive about him, such as one of his recent tweets, the trolls come out with their typical smears against him, saying he's a Russia spy or a Mossad spy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tulsi Gabbard - whenever someone posts about her "Stop Arming the Terrorists" bill, the trolls come out to denounce her as being unpatriotic. The most vile trolls talk about her meeting with Assad, which they say make her a Russian puppet. Like, wtf??
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This sub has been invaded by trolls or shills. For what purpose is anyone's guess. Paid trolls, bots programmed to post when key words are triggered, etc.

       You missed the entire point. You can disagree, as can anyone else, but many of us are witnessing the "brigading" by trolls/shills to purposely derail threads.

       Honestly we are at the point where r/conspiracy needs to move to a new home.  The amount of attacks by shills is already ridiculous and getting worse, and Reddit completely supports this kind of Orwellian censorship anyway.  Really isn't that hard to go somewhere else or at least set up shop where the mods and users both can be more proactive about removing/banning shills without hamstringing themselves by not being allowed to call anyone out thanks to Rule 10.

       reddit was down last night, so many people likely searched "reddit maintenance" to determine if it was site wide. r/conspiracy was one of the top search results when i searched. i came here, and immediately saw tired "but my pizzagate theories!" shyte, and quickly got my downvote finger smoking hot. i'm guessing by the comments here that i wasnt the only one that reacted that way. mystery solved.

       to clarify: I wasn't seeing it on pizzagate threads, though I guess a smoking hot downvote finger may be a bit harsher on other kinda-shitty posts that might otherwise have been scrolled past. I don't know. Just wish OP had some data.

       It's partisan horseshit that's why.  I wanna see more of the posts like "debunking the attack on ecigs" the other day, or "more people are smoking mj than drinking and the gov. wants to keep profits high for booze co.s"  Also 9/11, and similar stuff.  Both the virulent anti-trump stuff AND the constant anti-hillary posts are so annoying.   This isn't r/pol or r/t_d i don't know why so many people try to make it either one.

       This theory is dumb.

       All you have to do is create a couple hundred users and a single bot. As long as your bot is white-listed (because as you know, you've always had to identify your bot via headers) your bot can use multiple users to do whatever it wants.

       Every time I see a post like, "THIS SUB HAS GONE TO SHIT" or "this sub is under attack"  I always have to wonder, "How long long have you been here? Shit."
       <br/>
       This forum is pretty similar to others in that they are all Ground Zero of the propaganda war's raging.  I mainly like reddit because people are slightly less feral here than they are at GLP, for example which is so full of racists, shills and CJW's that it makes the /T_D seem Antifa in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't fully understand the role that conspiracy forums like this serve. As long as we're arguing over dogma and talking points given to us by either people that play character's on TV or more mundane mainstream talking heads like Anderson Cooper or trash like Sorcha Faaaaaaiiil or Steven Greer we aren't organizing to take back our rights. They aren't going to destroy r/conspiracy. It's the same with "OBAMA HAS THE INTERNET KILL SWITCH" conspiracy floating around here before the election. TPTB would never, ever kill the internet unless they were going to replace it with something even more soul destroying.  It is a pretty effective method of population control because it is so effective at influencing people.

       I'd agree - too many systematic downvotes not equivocal to the mind type found in this sub - unless trolls continually scroll through "new" and just downvote everything with an unjudging fury - I've also noticed a lot more stuff being gaslighted - the aldous huxley post about a mentally ill person who's the worst is one who you can't tell is mentally ill - wtf is that shit doing on this? Think about it - just the slightest gap within the mind and it allows the whole flock in

       This sub has been under attack for years. It comes and goes in waves, but there are always bots and shills all over r/conspiracy, all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest joke about this sub is the rule saying you can't call someone a shill. Like, really? I understand not going into a witchhunt and posting personal information but calling someone a shill is going to do what? Attract large lawsuits? Ignite the endtimes? They literally can not every verbally justify why that rule is in place, and I have believed it was created to protect actual shills for years.

       Yea the guy who had an IMDB page and shot a single bullet through a wall into a computer hard drive yea?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to reports he shot a single bullet or he shot multiple shots. Pretty easy to know if you heard 1 or multiple shots.

       Companies, governments, politicians use social media and complex algorithms to deliver specific content, fake information, and marketing aimed at you... you think you make your own decisions while you are flooded with microtargeted ads and content follow you on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is about reducing people to consumers. Latest fashions for clothes you do not need, pictures of airbrushed models to make you insecure and buy cosmetics and sumpplements... everything geared to insercutiry, a constent need for more stuff to fill a void.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything reduced to a torrent of short sound bites... people get used to this torrent and are unable to do complex long cognitvely intensive tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is a classic example. Its either an oganic outgrowth of a preconditioned popoulation or actively pushed narrative by some entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically snippets of information, intrigue, linked to together with loose associations. No time intesive cognitevely complex information.. rather just intuitive random associations. Add in the aura of mystique by adding in nefarious organizations and leading political oepratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tap into a national dislike and distrust of the hilary campaign. Also, emotionally charge it... pedophiles using innocent kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in an an anti establishment pro trump angle... and people take this hook line and sinker. Promoted on some sites (infowars whose star admitted to it being an act) to some people in positions of power (flynn, aka russian agent)... and it gets credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then 100s of people on the internet do "research"... aka image searches and simple good searches, and then spin them into the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun except this distracted from an election where trump describes walking in on changing teen Ms USA contestants and groping women without consent... where he has sold our country out to foreign and corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun until some ass shows upto comet ping pong with a gun...
      </p>
      <p>
       All fun until people's busnisses and empoyes suffer...

      <p>
       We got played and now coal companies can dump chemicals into water ways, big oil will get their pipeline so they can get canadian oil to ports to ship to other countries, defense contractors get more orders, healthcare to poor people gets cut, erdawans get licence to do what he wants in Turkey, private prisons get a break, marijuana is not getting legalized at a federal level while sessions is in charge, we bombed syria, companies and rich people will get tax breaks blowing holes in our deficit while poor people dont, and not action on climate change, social programs to help the opiate epidimic are under attack...

       Perfectly said. I always thought the same about 9/11 conspiracies. Oh let's focus on some bullshit YouTube video trying to prove the airplanes were fake, but let's not look into why all the hijackers were Saudi and we don't dare do shit to Saudi Arabia.
