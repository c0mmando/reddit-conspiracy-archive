If we wait to long the humans will be duped to be controlled but if we can get people to understand whats actually going on then they might break free from the machine and start doing something about it. We just gotta look out for our brothers and sisters and help shine our own light as bright as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually had a terrible idea about this the other day.
That this is all part of their plan.
Basically they want the public to know everything they&#39;ve done, all the horrible, sick things they&#39;ve done to children etc.
What would happen to them if we knew?  Most people would find it hard not to take revenge on them.  I know I would struggle with it.</p>

<p>Remember the movie Se7en? John Doe sets himself up to be the last sacrifice.  He corrupts Mills into commiting murder and completing Doe&#39;s plan.</p>

<p>So if we are Mills in this scenario, we are tricked into turning away from God.</p>

<p>Romans 12 :18If it is possible on your part, live at peace with everyone. 19Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but leave room for God’s wrath. For it is written: “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any proof of what you say about Gods existence?  No, it&#39;s your belief.  They (tptb) certainly believe in the adversary.  Like truly believe that it rewards the evil things they do in its name.  Ask yourself why they believe that.  Maybe because they have reaped those rewards?  They worship the material, the here and now.<br/>
Now lets say all this is real.  The spiritual warfare/battle for souls. 
They (tptb) are victims as well.  Satan doesn&#39;t actually care about them, they are pawns in his game.  They will have sold eternal life for temporary gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is lack of evidence accepted as evidence.  What would you accept?  A vision, meeting God?  At what point would you believe? Maybe that&#39;s the whole point of it being obscured.  There has to be faith.  </p>

<p><strong>Then, beginning with Matthew 13, Jesus began to teach with parables, which are designed to hide things about the Kingdom from the ones who rejected and opposed Him, but to reveal things about the Kingdom to His disciples. So Matthew 12 marks a real turning point in the life of Christ, and therefore also in the message of the book: He came to His own, but His own received Him not; and so to as many as received Him He gave the authority to become the children of God. The family of God is made up of true believers, and not natural blood ties.</strong>

<p>Evidence.  I&#39;m a skeptic, so I&#39;d accept evidence.  Shouldn&#39;t be difficult for a supposedly omnipotent being, assuming they actually cared about their creation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a cop out answer, trying to say the complete lack of evidence is intentional and therefore supportive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe it but my faith came only in the last few months, through seeing many little things over a lifetime that added up to something I couldn&#39;t deny.  </p>

<p>I was a huge skeptic myself until very recently.  Like, I KNEW there was no magic man in the sky haha.  All changed now though.</p>

<p>How did I come to believe? I saw enough evidence of the other side, of the devils work.  If you&#39;re willing to look into it yourself, ask yourself if the catholic church is satanic?  dagon hat, tammuz, idol worship, nimrods tree, ishtar etc And keep following leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree but I&#39;m also not an expert in this.  I claim no special knowledge, this has all been intuited and felt by me.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t intervene because we have free will.  We have to decide to seek God.  It wouldn&#39;t be love if he forced us to feel it, would it.</p>

<p>Now, you have the devil who is jealous of Gods love for us.  It seeks to corrupt us.  The horrible things in this world are done by us to each other.  We choose the easy road for quick fulfilment, we are tempted and decieved into doing things like forsaking God, hating each other for manufactured reasons etc.  The father of lies has an appropriate name.</p>

<p>The quickest and easiest way to explain it would be:Those psychological experiments where a child is put in from of some treats.  They are told they can eat them now if they wish but if they hold off for a while, soon the room will fill with treats.  The devil would be a voice on a speaker saying &quot;eat it now, eat it now, no more treats are coming, you&#39;re being tricked&quot;</p>

<li>&quot;One True God&quot; doesn&#39;t intervene because we have free will.</li>
<li>Except uh-oh, wait.... you also have the free will to to ask &quot;him/her/it/us&quot; to intervene, after all who are we but One True God afterall.</li>
<li>And OTG can&#39;t leave out those who would deny themselves free will, if they in fact will it freely.<br/>
Which brings us to:</li>
<li>Those who wish to deny others free will.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Thus as we move from 1 to 4 we can begin to see the transition of a common perception:<br/>
Duality, or OTG as seperate gods, or &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Satan&quot;, or &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;  </p>

<p>And so you have this sort of gradient that was created as a natural process of a huuuuuuuuuuuuuge computer that&#39;s also this teeeeeny tiny little thing. And it sort of asks itself - Who or what am I? And it wants to experience itself in every way possible. And it seems like, if you want to achieve truly infinite experience, that there is this specific sort of process, or logic, that follows the thought of experiencing oneself completely.<br/>
And what arises from this process is a natural choice between serving others and seeing that as serving OTG and yourself, or serving yourself and seeing that as OTG, or even the choice to not choose and not give a shit.  </p>

<p>Consider OTG from the complete perspective, looking from outside.<br/>
It is all the mass. Everything. Impossibly large. Its gravity infinite, it crushes itself. It is a single point. Impossibly small. It is dimensionless, undefinable.<br/>
There is no space, and with no space there is no motion. With no motion, there is no time.<br/>
With no time, there is no thought, for thought is the very definition of time! What is there to thought, but to go from one thing to the next. To inquire, and process, and learn, all constrained to the dimension of time.<br/>
OTG has infinite knowledge, yet no thought. Or perhaps it&#39;s better to say OTG has infinite knowledge, <em>hence</em> no thought.<br/>
Not wanting to miss out on anything, OTG creates space, and time, and free will, and thought, and the very concept of experience. Infinite eyes grown to watch itself, infinite ears to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re falling for the completely false, propaganda concept of God as some entity separate from us and the universe. God is source of consciousness. The physical universe is merely an experiment of experience where &quot;God&quot; splits itself into countless pieces(the Big Bang) and the point of the experiment is for all of the split off pieces to evolve to the point where they remember that they are actually God or source having an experience and merge again into Unity. This experiment is complex beyond our ability to perceive, it has many levels or dimensions. In the end though it&#39;s all just &quot;God&quot; or &quot;source&quot; though, nothing can truly harm anything else as it&#39;s all part of the same unity. All &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;wrong doing&quot; is simply caused by our severely limited perspective, at a higher vantage point all the pieces of source are just playing a game.</p>

<p>I like to think of our reality as a kind of Divine Comedy, a great story. Like all great stories it plays out a battle of good versus evil, light versus dark. It&#39;s the story of duality. I have a deep longing to understand truth, in my search I have studied the stories told in many religions to some degree, from Christianity, to Buddhism to Hinduism to paganism, Gnosticism and beyond. From my perspective all of these religions tell the same story, with all of the perceived differences being a natural effect of people from vastly different cultures describing truth in ways that they can understand. It&#39;s nearly entirely allegorical in most cases. For instance, in my opinion the story of Lucifer is an allegory for humanities decent into ego identification. Lucifer represents the ego, which is a hidden trickster in our mind that distracts us and leads us in circles. The ego is the root cause for our sense of division from the world around us, it is naturally indoctrinated and strengthened by the culture throughout childhood. The ego is the inner narration in your head, the voice that judges others, judges ourselves, feels jealousy or anger, and drives us to strive after shallow goals and materialistic items due to a constant worry about what others think.</p>

<p>The spiritual teachings all try to lead you on the path of ego transcendence. Once the ego is transcended there is a state of blissful unity and complete understanding of why everything is as it is. Ego identification is Hell, while Ego transcendence is Heaven. That&#39;s why Jesus said &quot;the kingdom of heaven is inside you.&quot; He was expressing that the way back to God or Source is within ourselves, it is a state of mind rather than a physical place. </p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;m just rambling at this point but here&#39;s your answer. I used to be like you, I couldn&#39;t believe in God from a young age because I saw so much pain in the world, and the way I learned what God is from others made me feel that there&#39;s no way that God could exist. Then I discovered quantum mechanics, followed quickly by some psychedelic experiences. After that I all of the sudden knew with absolute certainty that there&#39;s more to reality than that which we perceive with our senses. That was about six years ago, what I&#39;ve written above is an extremely generalized version of what I see as Truth now, though I know that there is still so much to learn, I feel quite confident in the core of my understanding at this point. </p>

<p>These words won&#39;t convince you of anything though. You will have to follow your own path and learn things out of your own curiosity and desire to find truth. I can only show you a sign post, you must travel down the road on your own. In the end, all roads lead to the same place. ;) Have a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your explanation of God sounds like the simulation theory though or close to it. </p>

<p>The whole &quot;everything is god&quot; concept essentially works the same way as a video game world.</p>

<p>Take skyrim for example. The game has so many different types of characters/objects etc within it but at the end of the day each individual object is just part of 1 object called &quot;skyrim&quot;. </p>

<p>The objects within skyrim don&#39;t have the ability to perceive what they actually are nor will they ever actually know what the outside world(our world). They don&#39;t have the ability to exist outside of the game.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the same sort of encapsulation exists within our universe therefore you have no ability to exist outside of the universe when you die.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s views are simply reactions to the events/world around them. I was raised catholic so figuring out &quot;the truth&quot; for me was that religion is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, calling it a simulation imo is just a label though. Its just our way of putting the information we&#39;ve gathered about reality into a concept that we can easily understand. It could be that we are legitimately inside a computer as a simulation, and the computer would be &quot;source.&quot; Or its just a mental universe, and the source is the &quot;Mind of God.&quot; We can use the different concepts about the same truth as a way to relate to that truth, thats how the variety of religions work as well. The labels are just sign posts pointing to the underlying truth, we choose which sign posts to follow, but in the end they all lead to the same truth. </p>

<p>I dont know if you&#39;ve ever heard of Thomas Campbell, but he&#39;s a physicist who had a bunch of out of body experiences when he was younger. Those experiences as well as his understanding of physics lead to him seeing reality as a simulation. He has a series of books called &quot;My big TOE&quot;(TOE=Theory of everything) Where he uses logical process to explain the way that reality functions and the nature of our interaction with reality. He does a fantastic job of merging science and spirituality. Its basically a Bible or Bhagdavad Gita for the scientifically minded person. I highly recommend it.</p>

I hope this isn&#39;t taken in offense, but ever time I read something like this, I&#39;m reminded of the &quot;Hidden_Hands&quot; interview. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the consensus is on that, it&#39;s probably a hoax.
Regardless, reading the transcript of that interview really did change my mindset. </p>

<p>It was just information, take it however you want. No agendas. But it spoke to me and made a lot of sense.
It touched on basically the same thing you mentioned, different dimensions, <em>this</em> reality being akin to a &quot;show&quot; and that we will all meet and have a a laugh afterwards. </p>

<p>It was an extremely new and unique viewpoint, at least for me. And it&#39;s something I&#39;ve always wanted to know more about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve read that. Many things that are said in there are the same truths that I&#39;ve found in a bunch of other places. It serves as one of many of the sources that led me to the same basic truth. If you&#39;re interested in the kind of stuff talked about in the hidden hand interview, I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://www.lawofone.info/">http://www.lawofone.info/</a> if you havent already read it. I think the key to figuring out what parts are truth is by reading many different sources and taking everything that is the same in all or most of them as the parts most likely to be accurate. If you can find many sources that say basically the same thing then you can be more and more confident that the information is accurate and has a minimum amount of distortion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly universal law of free will. If they can dupe us with the truth in front of us then no bad karma on them. Thats why sci fi is a good one for them. Matrix literally tells us whats going on and we dismiss it as sci fi so it cant be real. Lol we all need to take a step back and look at the full picture. And its huge and its fucked up and its complicated but its possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Beast from the Sea  -Revelation 13
1 And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. 
He had 10 horns and seven heads. 
On his horns were 10 diadems, 
and on his heads were blasphemous names. 
2 The beast I saw was like a leopard, 
his feet were like a bears, 
and his mouth was like a lions mouth. 
The dragon gave him his power, his throne, 
and great authority. 
3 One of his heads appeared to be fatally wounded, 
but his fatal wound was healed. 
The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast. 
4 They worshiped the dragon 
because he gave authority to the beast. 
And they worshiped the beast, saying, 
Who is like the beast? 
Who is able to wage war against him?
5 A mouth was given to him to speak 
boasts and blasphemies. 
He was also given authority to act for 42 months. 
6 He began to speak blasphemies against God: 
to blaspheme His name and His dwelling — those 
who dwell in heaven. 
7 And he was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. 
He was also given authority 
over every tribe, people, language, and nation. 
8 All those who live on the earth will worship him, </p>

<p>everyone whose name was not written 
from the foundation of the world 
in the book of life 
of the Lamb who was slaughtered.</p>

<p>9 If anyone has an ear, he should listen:</p>

<p>If anyone is destined for captivity,
into captivity he goes.
If anyone is to be killed with a sword,
with a sword he will be killed.
This demands the perseverance and faith of the saints.</p>

<p>The Beast from the Earth
11 Then I saw another beast 
coming up out of the earth; 
he had two horns like a lamb, 
but he sounded like a dragon. 
12 He exercises all the authority 
of the first beast on his behalf 
and compels the earth and those who live on it 
to worship the first beast, 
whose fatal wound was healed. 
13 He also performs great signs, 
even causing fire to come down from heaven 
to earth in front of people. 
14 He deceives those who live on the earth
 because of the signs that he is permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, 
telling those who live on the earth 
to make an image of the beast
 who had the sword wound and yet lived. 
15 He was permitted to give a spirit 
to the image of the beast, 
so that the image of the beast could both speak 
and cause whoever would not worship 
the image of the beast to be killed. 
16 And he requires everyone — small and great, 
rich and poor, free and slave — 
to be given a mark on his right hand 
or on his forehead, 
17 so that no one can buy or sell 
unless he has the mark: 
the beasts name or the number of his name.</p>

<p>18 Here is wisdom: 
The one who has understanding must calculate
 the number of the beast, 
because it is the number of a man. 
His number is 666.</p>

<p>The Rider on a White Horse -Revelation 19
11 Then I saw heaven opened, 
and there was a white horse. 
Its rider is called Faithful and True, 
and He judges and makes war 
in righteousness. 
12 His eyes were like a fiery flame, 
and many crowns were on His head. 
He had a name written that no one knows 
except Himself. 
13 He wore a robe stained with blood, 
and His name is the Word of God. 
14 The armies that were in heaven
 followed Him on white horses, 
wearing pure white linen. 
15 A sharp sword came from His mouth, 
so that He might strike the nations with it. 
He will shepherd them with an iron scepter. 
He will also trample the winepress 
of the fierce anger of God, the Almighty. </p>

<p>16 And He has a name written 
on His robe and on His thigh:</p>

<p>KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</p>

<p>The Beast and His Armies Defeated
17 Then I saw an angel standing on the sun, 
and he cried out in a loud voice, 
saying to all the birds flying high overhead, 
Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 
so that you may eat the flesh of kings, 
the flesh of commanders, the flesh of mighty men, 
the flesh of horses and of their riders, 
and the flesh of everyone, 
both free and slave, small and great.</p>

<p>19 Then I saw the beast, 
the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to wage war 
against the rider on the horse and against His army. </p>

<p>20 But the beast was taken prisoner, 
and along with him the false prophet, 
who had performed the signs in his presence. 
He deceived those who accepted the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image with these signs. Both of them were thrown alive 
into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
21 The rest were killed with the sword
 that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.</p>

<p>...continues, amazing saga lasting at least 2K years, then forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, calling it a simulation imo is just a label though. Its just our way of putting the information we&#39;ve gathered about reality into a concept that we can easily understand. It could be that we are legitimately inside a computer as a simulation, and the computer would be &quot;source.&quot; Or its just a mental universe, and the source is the &quot;Mind of God.&quot; We can use the different concepts about the same truth as a way to relate to that truth, thats how the variety of religions work as well. The labels are just sign posts pointing to the underlying truth, we choose which sign posts to follow, but in the end they all lead to the same truth. </p>

<p>I dont know if you&#39;ve ever heard of Thomas Campbell, but he&#39;s a physicist who had a bunch of out of body experiences when he was younger. Those experiences as well as his understanding of physics lead to him seeing reality as a simulation. He has a series of books called &quot;My big TOE&quot;(TOE=Theory of everything) Where he uses logical process to explain the way that reality functions and the nature of our interaction with reality. He does a fantastic job of merging science and spirituality. Its basically a Bible or Bhagdavad Gita for the scientifically minded person. I highly recommend it.</p>
