       They aren't blurring pictures, the pictures are blurry because the resolution isn't high enough to see ground level details.  All of the very detailed images you see form GE, especially the new version, are taken from planes, not space.  That's why we can now see actual

        real life textures on buildings
       </a>
       and it doesn't have to be procedurally generated.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we have hundreds of planes flying over the south pole taking pictures, we'll get the same results.  There are lots of fascinating things about Antarctica, let's not dumb down the excitement of it to "google is censoring it".

       The sats are more or less used to get general shots of areas that aircraft can't reach (when it comes to Google Earth that is).  Later, when they're able to send aircraft over these areas, they get more detailed photos.  Kinda like in art when you create a rough sketch of something, and then go back later and flesh it out with more detail.

       lower resolution satellite images with higher resolution aircraft images. For parts of the world that generate less interest or where aircraft imagery is unavailable they use satellite imagery only.

       So that's what satellites really are? When airplanes, towers, and cables do literally anything that satellites can do at a fraction of cost and effort, it's no wonder people think satellites are a hoax. Satellites = airplanes!

       Then a plane is even better than a satellite for taking pictures of earth. All they would have to do is fly over enough of the earth and you've got your satellite imagery. That may be an answer why the only pictures of earth as a whole are pieced together. Telescope satellites may just be high-altitude planes. Towers and cables take care of anything else satellites are purported to do. It's a wonder they even claim to have and use satellites.

       It's hilarious that you guys would rather believe that the big conspiracy is scientists lying to you, rather than oil companies pushing this bullshit that climate change doesn't exist so they can keep fucking with the environment and making billions. Don't you guys usually "follow the money." Wake the fuck up.

       The climate change movement has just as much money bankrolling it, if not more than the oil companies. Look at how they discredited nuclear energy in the 70s and 80s.

       It is in the interest of China to make competing countries less competitive and more heavily regulated that they are. They can both want that for other countries and maintain their own low standard to maximize their profit.

       Except that China has released one major study on Climate Change, and it's exclusively about how Climate Change will affect China.  If they were pushing "the climate change myth", why wouldn't they release a study on how it will affect other nations?
      </p>
      <p>
       US scientists have been noting and trying to rally the flight against global warming since the 50s, but China only really started changing policy to fight climate change in 2015 - not exactly generations.

       The argument that China is pushing the climate change agenda with the help of google is far fetched at best.

       The "follow the money" angle is simple. It is the liberals way to fight back against the oil industry who doesn't bribe them like they do the conservatives, so they use this manufactured crisis as an excuse to tax not JUST those industries and bind them with regulations, but eventually trickle this extortion down to the people who use their products.

      <p>
       Meanwhile climate change prediction after prediction never comes to fruition.

       The hard truth is that climate has never been and never will be a stable system. Trying to turn it into one is only practice in impotence akin to kicking water uphill.

       I went on a massive extended Alaskan cruise about 4 years ago that took me through about half of that route. It was a spring cruise and was EXTREMELY cold for the northern leg and absurdly rainy for the last half.

       It seems horrible the way I made that sound, but I genuinely liked the whole thing. It was great being that far away from civilization, but still being able to go grab some fresh pizza on lido deck.

       Right but we know CO2 is a greenhouse gas; we've known that for decades.  We also know that CO2 levels are higher now than they've been for longer than humans have been around, and we know that when CO2 levels were higher than this, the global temperature was significantly higher than it is now.  This is all verifiable and backed up with evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The defence to that used to be global warming isn't real, and then it was global warming isn't man made, and now it is, "Well, we don't really know what heating the planet up is going to do".  It's all these excuses so that highly profitable companies can avoid changing the things that make them so highly profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       and you know, I'm almost fine with people not believing in climate change.  It seems crazy cognitive dissonance, but whatever... The crazy thing to me is when they oppose EPA regulations on dumping chemicals in to rivers.  This isn't like "40 years out, that river..." no, we just filled it with waste and in a week killed everything in it, and it's going to take 100x the money saved by dumping it vs. disposing of it properly to clean that river.  How can people not see that murdering the ecosystem we rely on for clean air, clean water and clean food is going to hurt our entire civilization?

       Water vapor is actually the single most prevalent greenhouse gas on earth and one of the most dangerous because it can cause a positive feedback loop that causes more and more water vapor to be introduced into the atmosphere and even has the effect of amplifying the effect CO2 have...
      </p>
      <p>
       but I don't think it is a great idea to politicize, regulate, or tax the boiling of water or the use of it as a coolant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also in agreement for the most part about that latter section, except I don't think the EPA are really that nobel of an agency...
