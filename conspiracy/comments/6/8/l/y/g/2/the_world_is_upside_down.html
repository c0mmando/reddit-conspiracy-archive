       This post is not going to be necessarily deep or complex. It is just going to be about some thoughts that deeply trouble me as I start the work week. Sometimes I feel like I do not recognize the world I live in - of course, these are only generalizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       *People are exhausted but have no choice but to keep working and working more. Work for the sake of work is valued in our society. The other day I saw the cashier at Wal-Mart with the energy drink, and I felt for her. Rest and relaxation are becoming more of a rarity.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *Good is only valued if it can be showed off on social media. Good has to be tied to a profit, or a celebrity, or a selfie. Do not forget that you should never feed the homeless on the streets though.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        We are more "connected" than ever right? We can access others' lives at anytime, but the human element is missing. Social media often creates envy and jealousy, not love and friendship. Every time I post about this, I get comments on how it is just a tool, and it is how we use it. However, I have to say that it is not only a tool when Facebook admits to purposely manipulating its users. It is not a tool for a 14 year old, waiting for 300 "likes" on the latest selfie. The problem is that balance of social media is not promoted, and now everything is connected to social media. There are countless studies on the negative aspects, yet they are mostly ignored. It is not *only
       </em>
       a tool when we are the tools.

      <p>
       *We spend endless amounts of money to go to college and get a degree, only to end up jobless and drowning in debt.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *We are giving our youth the full power of adults before they even understand and know how to handle that power. From choosing their genders to getting phones in the 2nd grade, our kids are being treated as if they are...well...not children. Do our children have their childhoods anymore? Do they play outside? Or are they glued to their phone as soon as they get home from school? I am throwing a lot in here, but as somebody who works with children, I do not envy this upcoming generation.

      <p>
       *Our food makes us sick, and even when people DO have health insurance, it is still terrifying for most to go to the hospital, even in an emergency. There is no denying that food is more processed than ever, and there is no denying that our health care system in America is a joke. This is NOT a conspiracy, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       People may have food, but that does not mean they have nutrition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us not forget for those who live healthily and do all the "right" things, cancer rates (among other diseases) are on the rise.

       *Our education system is a disaster. I have written much about this all over Reddit, so it is hard to summarize everything here. Let's just say that poor schools are punished for poor performance, and their funding is cut. Wealthy schools are given more money for good performance. If there is any sign that our schools are failing, it cannot be more clear than the treatment of teachers. Underpaid, burnt out, and villainized, more and more teachers are leaving the profession:

      <p>
       The issues in education are endless, but do not worry, because the testing corporations are still making their money!
      </p>
      <p>
       *We hear all about love and breaking boundaries and barriers today, but doesn't it feel superficial? It is so easy to preach about love, kindness, and compassion for others, but our actions always speak louder than our words.

      </p>
      <p>
       *People can call me old-fashioned or too "conservative" but what are our morals and values today? Who are our role models in increasingly broken homes? All I ever here is "do what you want as long as it makes you happy" but is this really the right way?

       *Materialism, consumerism, and greed. What do people live for? Is there time to think about the existential questions of life, or is it more important to make sure our social media presence reflects how "happy" we are...Is there any depth in our daily lives? Or do we live through mindless celebrities? One of my favorite books is called "The Unbearable Lightness of Being", and I feel the title is quite fitting for this world. The constant stress to "keep up", and the illusion of the American Dream...are what we live for?

       What do you feel the consequences will be?

       *There is an emphasis on youth and beauty, but the wisdom of the elderly is denied. More and more have become obsessed with "living forever", a theme prevalant in pop culture. Transhumanism is no longer science fiction. Yet, technology is good for the sake of technology right? The ethics issues behind incressing use of technology are simply ignored.

      </p>
      <p>
       *Mental illness and suicide are on the rise. Yet people have to hide their true feelings from the world. It is almost impossible to get "good" mental health care that is not atrociously expensive, even with "good" health insurance. More and more are suffering silenty with anxiety and depression. Mental illness and suicide are on the rise among Americans. But do not worry - one of your friends just posted a status about how great their life is on Facebook!

       I can keep going. As I get ready for work, these thoughts just bombarded me. Many may say I am ignoring the "good" in the world, or that I am being too serious. I disagree. I feel our society chooses to ignore the "bad", and until a person is directly affected by something I mentioned in this post (or something I did not have time to mention), empathy for others is nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solace comes for me in the beauty of nature (which is continually being destroyed), the power of words (even if people are increasingly apathetic), and my relationships with others (though I find them harder to maintain as people, at least to me, are increasingly self-absorbed).
      </p>
      <p>
       The world feels upside down today, but I am going to work now, and I have to tell my students that they will be okay. (Non-intended rhyme).
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I did not expect this to blow up. J am replying to as many people as possible because it means a lot for people to read and comment. Even if you do not think anybody will read or care what you have to say, I will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever gave me the gold, I wish I knew who it was. Thank you!

       I feel the same way, and I find it sad that people who feel like this are labelled as depressed or some other mental illness. There's this quote I heard, "It’s not really a measure of mental health to be well-adjusted in a society that’s very sick." I think that's fitting.

       Isn't crazy that this issue is just swept under the rug?

      <p>
       People who have mental illness have to feel shame and do not get the proper care and attention they need. For many, suicide seems like the most viable option.

       Chomsky once stated that the true metric for how great a society is can be found in how they treat their dis-enfranchised. The mentally ill, homeless, veterans, etc.; by this metric it is hard to call America "great".
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a book called "Hagakure" (my copy is being lent to a friend currently so I'll have to paraphrase) that states that virtuous ideas and concepts
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be whispered into the ears of the young. These are like seeds that will grow to bear fruit once the young become adults. This is just not done anymore and future generations will suffer for it.

       Beautifully said. I see how we treat those who are suffering in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       People separate themselves from the homeless, mentally ill, etc...thinking they are not "like them". But I think we are all closer to the "brink" of suffering than we fully realize.

       Our society elevates people who objectively are morally corrupt and possibly mentally ill. Narcissists run companies and hold positions of power. We admire and respect the ruthless businessperson who tramples on everyone else on the way up and is then lauded as the epitome of success. Then we wonder why society is falling apart at the seams everywhere else.

       Lots of mentally ill and homeless just want to be left alone. They don't want to be part of this shit society with its shit customs and manners and hypocrisy. So please don't say the solution is to build institutions to force these people into so they can be 'recuperated' by the same sort of people they abandoned society and 'reason' to avoid. Don't require people to go through a thousand programs and sign a thousand forms and interviews and bullshit to get free stuff, or they just go without completely. Got more vacant homes than homeless people. How does that work?

       It's still done. For example, it's done by advertisers who target children, so that they can instill narratives of consumerism into them, while they're impressionable and formulating their place in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       More useful to "society" if their place in the world is "to buy shit that isn't needed." So called Youth Culture is a disgusting thing. If there is some attempt at this that is contrary to those messages, I haven't seen it.

       I just try to keep in mind that everyone is a human being that needs love and compassion and community. So much of today's world is about the material. It is sad, and we should be experiencing a range of emotions both negative and positive, yet we repress anything that makes us uncomfortable. I think most people feel powerless to change their situation and rationalize it by thinking if they just worked harder things would work out or if those people would get their stuff together I could do better.

       Are you bored with the usual materialistic values and dogmas? There are other types of info. Unofficial info, from certain trance channels that outline how reality is created. And info about what is underneath and wihin seemingly empty matter. Look up Seth and Elias, for info on the subjective consciousness and our paradigm shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your thread is a good one, our world as it stands is pointless. We don't have any earthly goals but war and money. More realize this now than in the past century for sure. Where are we headed if we continue this bland materialism and corporate pyramid scheme. We're heading towards extinction of individuality.

       I can say what I'm doing I would be doing regardless if I got paid. It's a service to others too, what I do.  I don't really think our society is important and will last in this form though. I see people in the rat race and don't understand why they are doing it and why we all do this. I just survive in it somehow.

       What is mental illness really, though? Many who are "diagnosed" with something as a result of tough times to me that is just called life. I was diagnosed in 93/94 with ADHD and given no lie 11 then 7 dexadrine pills a DAY. I have a tested IQ(I know these tests are bs) of 150. My brain processes thoughts and decisions lightning fast and very few can keep pace with me mentally. Apparently this means I have a mental illness rather than just a brain that processes things very quickly.  Why is this a bad thing, other than the fact I recognize and call people out on their bullshit  as soon as I detect it quickly in conversation.

       It goes both ways. Issues that are real disorders may not be addressed and disorders that aren't present may be diagnosed in a way to make the patient feel like they're getting results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly don't feel like pharmaceuticals are the only way to address it, so i agree with you in that regard.

       I do tend to agree with you that many of these more commonly seen "disorders" are over-diagnosed. I don't claim to know why this is, beyond ofc kick backs and greed, plus an ever-widening list of symptoms in the DSM, but here's the thing that I feel like a lot of people seem to overlook, or not understand: these things only become a "disorder" when it begins to affect your life in ways that you cannot handle or deal with, when it becomes much too much for you, something you cannot get a grip on no matter how hard you try and it's causing you to despair. If a person has all the symptoms of a certain non-severe/acute mental illness but is not bothered by them and is completely comfortable living their life then there is no need to treat them... For example, with your ADHD: if you'd been unable to complete your schooling, no matter how hard you try and this becomes distressing to you. This is the key. A good doctor and/or psych would explain the difference to you, and yes, I realize "good" doctors are hella rare these days... realize too, though, that your doctor is often used to working with patients who WANT a quick fix, they WANT medication for minor, almost nonexistent issues, they are unwilling to put in the work... when you are used to working with that every day, yes, sometimes assumptions are made which shouldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "good" doctor really is a wonderful thing... it took me 30 years to find one but now that I have one, I can honestly say that it was turned my life upside down, in a very good way. She is amazing. I never even realized that doctors like this actually existed but now that I've found her(by a serendipidous accident of sorts) I cannot imagine seeing anyone else.

       Sorry for the delayed response to your very detailed and thought out post.  With my ADHD I quit my meds against everyone's wishes at 24 because I felt like a zombie. And again they still wanted me on 4-5 dexadrine a day at that time which was nuts. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA even though I literally never studied, had a successful military then state corrections career (until being Injured on the job in both) so I don't feel like my ADHD has ever held me back in life. The unique perspective I gain from life is worth the struggles I've faced IMO.

       I was diagnosed HFA (high functioning autism) in 2008, IQ of 175, take anti-anxiety meds to filter out all the extra noise of the world.  I think processing information faster than "normal" people and calling people out on their bullshit scares people.  It upsets the "social norms" that everybody tries to cling to - the facade of treating everybody nicely while stabbing them in the back.  I wonder if we are seeing more than people's bullshit and that we see the world's bullshit and we're not supposed to.

       We are undergoing a total inversal of society:
Conservative and Liberal politics have been switched/fused to embody neu-feudalism.
"The Truth" that the MSM presents is usually a lie.
The two genders have been swapped and fused into a transgender/cis-gender to further trans-humanism.
"World peace" has become a permanent state of warfare.
Pedophilia is getting pushed in the MSM to become socially acceptable.

       (SPOILERS)
In the film Cpt. Jack Sparrow has been "banished/died" and moved to a realm that is considered to be "beyond this worlds end."
      </p>
      <p>
       This real looks like a completely white desert with no trees, structures or otherwise like the sahara desert IRL (only that the larger stones/pebbels are white crabs).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pirate crew of the portagonists plans to rescue Sparrow. They get maps and sail towards the world end, where they are literally turning their pirate ship upside down in the water and sink to the ground. Then they are "Teleported" to the realm where Sparrow is.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is noticeable that two (undead) pirate crewmates tie themselves to the ship-masts to be standing straight while the human pirates are upside down. I think the freemasonic hollywood wants to symbolize the inversal of life the death (upside down)
White the "worlds end" is lifes end itself.

       I went through it in my early 20's and honestly it would of been alright if it was just the therapy that I wanted. Just a 3rd perspective more or less to my feelings but it was "manadatory" for me to take medicine. Went with a co-pay system. Therapist cost me $20 for an hour session that was weekly. Cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       However to get my prescription meant I had to sit down with an entirely different Doctor for 10 minutes and that 10 minutes cost me $200 on top of $40 for the pills. Fucking cash cowing the mentally ill was one of the worst things I've personally witnessed. A lot of the people who came in and out weren't bad off and only needed some advice like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully I've always been anti pill and my goal was to get off them as quick as possible unlike the ones who are totally convinced they can't feel good without the meds. Some honestly can't I get that but milliond of Americans are either completely misdiagnosed or literally tricked into believing they do.

       I had a dream 8 years ago. A lot of what's been happening now as in the dream, including this past election cycle. (I have like 3 or 4 memories of the election cycle though. One instance Clinton won, and it led to global war)
I remember at the end of the dream though...something happens. 
Either a global currency reset, or something causes the government and the banks to forgive all student loan debt, and offer debt forgiveness to others.

       Maybe we finally have a call to audit the Fed, or audit the Military. Didn't the Pentagon misplace 6.8 trillion dollars? That's tax money. We should demand a refund.

       In one version of the election, Sanders is elected President...and things start improving immediately. But...things are so great that people refuse to believe any of it is true, and chaos ensues. 
People who don't understand political science or world history, but fear "communism" and "socialism," plan violent revolt. They're being handed necessities free of charge. Everyone on equal ground again. But people still panic. It's too much at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then Trump gets elected in another version. but he's not really the President. It's Greek theatre. It's a distraction to keep everyone busy while they prepare some sort of world changing announcement. Either we've achieved world peace through technology and diplomacy, or Aliens are real. Free energy becomes a thing for the whole planet? The Egyptian Gods were real and they're back? I can't remember it's fuzzy.

       The global debt forgiveness is a way to usher in the new world order. It begins with a crisis. Then a false promise of peace to get support for the new world order. Eventually they'll try to disarm the people but some will resist.

       I mean, maybe, but probably not. As long as there's been humans there's been opioid addiction and what with black markets and the internet being what they are today, I can't see it going the way of the dinosaurs anytime soon.

       I wonder if heroin is a more concerntrated form of opioid. You know like smoking the plant marajuana is less potent than the synthetic one? I would bet it is processed and imported specifically to addict and enslave a population. Why are they so intent on controlling our behavior? Thanks for posting it got me thinking.

       It is. Opium(natural plant form) itself is pretty addictive on its own, contains a mix of opiates like morphine, codeine, thebaine, etc. But they acetylate the morphine and makes it way more potent and more addictive. Kinda like how coca leaves are a nice pick me up and used culturally, but with the right chem and process, becomes addictive cocaine.

       Honestly, I think as long as there is hope in the world, we have a chance. The moment anyone decides that they can't make a difference is the moment they lose. If we give up hope, we let the evil of the world win.

       Maaaaan this hits home. Thing is, thinking about these things really can cause depression. The mental health benefits of optimism vs. pessimism are real. The problem is that in our world, being a realist, cynic or pessimist are one in the same because of all the things OP mentioned. This is why so many people choose to ignore the true world we live in and indulge in social media and bullshit, even though it's hardly any healthier in the long run. It's disgusting that we literally have to choose to sacrifice our mental wellbeing just to be engaged in our society. Those two things should complement each other.

       It's hard to recognize hell in a handbasket and continue to get up and go to work every day. Sounds like your students have the benefit of a grounded teacher, I hope venting here allows you to face them less burdened and with some glimmer of optimism.

       I wonder if people truly understand empathy. It is not "feeling sorry for". It is the ability to see and understand a person's unique perspective, even if you do not agree

       I don't think there is much benefit to calling the world shitty.  Lead by example, be a force of change, get your head on straight and don't be a sheep.  That's how to make the world a better place and the best way to evoke the changes we all seek.  Sorry you went to so much trouble to make this and I am sure my comment will be downvoted to hell because misery loves company, but everyone who is on the service-to-others quantum timeline is really going to be okay.  If you let the illusions of a shitty world get you down, the "powers that shouldn't be" have won.  Those who only work with service-to-self frequencies will go to another hellish duality timeline.  It really is going to be all right.

       I feel like there is a balance. I still wake up and do my best every day to be a good person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I feel I am constantly told to just ignore and undermine real issues. Nothing changes because I feel people would rather not face it.

       Discussion is good. Counter-arguments are good.

       I think you really should ignore the "real issues".  Because most of those are manufactured by the elite as control mechanisms and the only way to become truly free is to not allow them to steal your happiness

       Well, I definitely have my spiritual journey where I have come to some of this understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in my spiritual journey I have learned service to others is the greatest way to serve God.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I will serve God by doing what I can for people, which often means speaking out about the bad in the world.

       You can speak out without internalizing and you can help them take back their power by not wallowing in despair.  Collectively we create the reality we experience.

       I mean, on one end, do I really have the means/experience/skills to survive some ELE? Would I want to? If it's going to happen, sure I'd think that i'd like to know before hand to prepare, but part of me realizes that I maybe better off being one of the first to go quick, than suffer through some horrible post apoc nightmare.

       Either that or get your ass to some nice stable non fault line area waaaaaay above sea level and start choking down as much survivalist teaching as you can. and even if you do that, they'll just come and take all your shit and stick you right back with everyone else in a fema camp.

       I guess we can kind of agree to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like that we all can be forces of change. I probably cannot break up the global elite, but maybe I can help my student, or a stranger on the street. Maybe I can promote beauty in my area or go on
       <a href="/r/suicidewatch">
        /r/suicidewatch
       </a>
       and talk to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I can discuss larger conspiracies with people so we start to learn we are not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we can unite for good causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in the end the world is ruled by evil, but I do not think change, growth (consciousness or spiritual), or action are impossible.

       I think we do what we can do, and then yes, we must accept that they may only be so much.

       I meant more in the idea of preparing or not preparing. As far as doing something to stop it? or inform people?

      <p>
       People don't like to hear about this shit. they'd rather be happy and smile, I've had friends yell at me for bringing it up cause it stresses them out lol.

       If I go into a rabbit hole and I start to really think about it, it gets to a point where everything is just pointless.  So I have to just "forget" for a bit that most of the stuff we all do is just perpetuating this cycle.

       What is the post? "I make 15 dollars an hour" sounds a lot better than "I sold an hour of my life for 15 dollars."
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, despite getting paid (in meaningless 'dollars' backed with NOTHING) you are really just a slave, building pyramids for some fucking shithead. Illusion of freedom is worse than no freedom because many people are tricked by illusions and don't realize they are slaves until it is too late. Or they never realize and never have a reason to fight against it. Because they think they are free.

       Right there with you man, I think like that all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was venting to a relative who seemed to be aware as well, but they had already given up, they said that's just the way things are.  That's probably the case with a lot of people, at least I'd hope they're at least aware of the situation they're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       We go to work, were making someone at the top even more rich, to make money to buy things that are just going to break or waste our time or make us even more sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even trying to enjoy some hobbies can be affected thinking this way, so it really does have to be put on "pause" to socialize without wanting to shake everybody and tell them what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the only thing we can do is make others aware, or try to.  And at the most, disconnect from the system as much as possible like others here have done.

       Its a waste of time. Even if you succeed knowing is half the battle. They have other priorities. Work hours get longer and longer and pay is less and less. Its to keep people!e too busy to have time to care or effect change. Even if they know they just don't have the time to do a anything. After all, there is the mortgage, and the boss needs me to stay late, and the game is on, and star wars comes out soon, and Timmy needs braces.

       Once enough people know that everyone else knows, there's no reason to fear rising up.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one does anything because no one else they know does anything, or it's just that one "crazy" guy who's into those things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when people learn that "hey, everyone else thinks this situation is shit too, they're not really happy just the way I'm not", I think people then would be less afraid to do something.

       No reason to fear? You mean besides being stomped out by the PIC?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at countries like north Korea. Everyone knows its shit but keeps quiet because fear of repercussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows shit is fucked but the just accept it. The line for revolt gets pushed further and further every year. Pretty soon nothing less then publicly culling millions of cute babies playing with cuter puppies will get people up in arms. And when they do, the gov will stamp down on them so hard they'll decide it really isn't that bad after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       They own the media. They dump chems in our food and water. They have the money and they spend all our taxes on military that will stamp us down if we rise up. They have enough FEMA camps to round us up. Stick us in amtrak death trains and foam us like they do to chickens with bird flu.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i hate to break it to you, but dude, I'll be surprised if the the world doesn't end in the next 2 years. Some might survive. But not me and you. Unless you're really some rich ass billionaire or politician masquerading as a common reddit tinfoiler that is... Are you? Can you get me a spot in one of those underground shelters? One away from the fault lines, I don't want to start the new world buried under tons of granite...

       The two year thing doesn't surprise me, I just didn't wanna jump to the first thing that came to my mind.  I've been feeling like SOMETHING is going to happen, there's just this feeling lately that something big is going to happen, but nothing has.
       <br/>
       I've had people tell me they've felt that their whole lives and the show keeps on going.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have a smidgen of hope that the people in the military wouldn't turn on the people they're supposed to be protecting (yes we all know that the military hasn't been being used for that).  I just feel like most military people also know it's all just BS, and if they had an order to mow down civilians, its either kill em or court martial right?  Hopefully they turn the weapons toward whoever is giving the order.

       Sorry bud, if I had a sweet underground survival cave, i'd save you a spot and a few grams.

       Nibiru/binary stard has been gag ordered since Regan so I get what you're saying. Every generation thinks they are special in that the world will end in their lifetime.   But it just feels like something is coming. They are changing earthquake numbers, spraying in front of the sun every day, making FEMA camps and presidential orders about space weather, while at the same time sweeping it all under the rug.

       And I've read about foreign troops stationed in america for that very reason. To put down our own civilians in case of upheaval.

       June 2017. Speech by a prolific leftist. Agent provocateur lines up the shot and takes them out. "Protests" ensue. Buildings and business burnt by "anti-fa" types across the U.S. Nationalists (Trumpers) ally together and civil war breaks out in major cities across the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Situation deteriorates, National Guard is attacked and overwhelmed. Infighting begins within the U.S. military as ideology is questioned. U.S. requests U.N. presence. Chinese, Russian, and European troops land on American soil. Factions emerge, and seeing weakness, China captures Hawaii and attacks the west coast. Lines are muddled and total war spreads across the entire contiguous U.S. Canada watches on, with poutine and gravy in their laps... for now.

       In a capitialist society, we have the power as consumers to demand what we want. When we demand for cleaner and healthier foods the food industry will spawn new businesses catering to these demands. Unfortunatly the majority of us is still stuck on garbage luxuries such as 300$ t shirts and 100$ cupcakes that are the fault of the massive advertisement industry ramming this junk to overid our subconcious but we humans also have freewill to breakout of this system. We can demand better food, cleaner air, no more wars, we the people are the ones who hold the power.

       If we take the time to look at kids in africa dying from the lack of water, isis or mexican cartels or slave labor in factories, etc. what disaster can eclipse the current problems that are already plaguing the majority of humanity. Only a small percentage of us even have the luxury to worry about healthcare, most of the world is living on less than 1$ a day in hell conditions. I think we need to realize humanity encompasses every single billion of us.

       The other half is exercise.  It's one thing to eat well, and to provide the body with the fuel it needs.  It's another thing to use that fuel in a productive way that allows the body to function as it needs to.

       I honestly would beg to differ. About a year ago, I was exercising and eating pretty well, but I was always a big snacker. Soda and water all day long. I grew muscles, but still looked and felt like crap. on this new diet, I exercise but nearly as much as a year ago, more bodyweight type stuff. I am pretty ripped now, have abs again, not seen in 20 years!

       Diet is about 75%, I would bet.

       Nothing wrong with drinking a lot of water!  I've probably drank the equivalent of 6 bottles of soda in my entire 27 years on this planet, so I can't really speak for it...but that stuff is absolute shit.  Water is great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with snacking either!  I myself snack a lot, but it's healthy snacking - a few celery sticks, carrots, and some peanuts, or a banana with homemade peanut butter, maybe a fruit smoothie with fresh local fruit every now and then.  If you're on a diet, or trying to gain muscle, snacking is great.  Smaller meals are better, especially if you exercise a lot.

       Great idea with the sports drink! Coconut water is the bomb.

       Yes, avocados are my go to snack, I usually just cut in half, salt, pepper and red onions and eat it out of it's skin, like a little natural bowl.

       Coconut water is great, but too much of it during competition can cause bloating and an upset stomach.  I mix it in with water and the orange juice i make and some salt.  Works great.  Usually the formula is a few oranges (I use 3 or 4 because I like a really fruity taste), probably half a small bottle of coconut water, and the rest water, with some ice cubes too to keep it cold or from getting too hot.  A pinch of salt and a little bit of lemon juice (sometimes i add lime juice too) and it works just fine.

       I love me some avocados... another snack I do is drop an egg in a half and bake it in a toaster oven, salt and pepper.. I like a runny egg, so it's perfect. maybe some red onions (always have them around)

       I love runny eggs, occasionally I'll throw in some salsa (store bought, and it doesn't have processed sugar or gluten, so I'm good), and some gluten-free bread to go with the avocado and have a proper Mexican breakfast.  Yum!

       Looking good doesnt always mean good health. True health requires proper testing such as getting blood work done to figure out nutrient deficencies. From my research its nearly impossible to aquire optimal micro-nutrients levels only through food and supplementing is necessary.

       I don't know why my comment deserved a downvote, but here is the podcast which made me take the plunge, this was an ultra marathoner who realized that a grain based, sugar based diet is horrible. I follow what he says in the podcast, and not only do I look beter, I feel better. My hands used to ache all the time, not anymore.

       True! I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease related to eye muscles (i know, weird. My own body attacks my own EYE muscles), I was so sick I had to quit med school because I was failing my subjects cos I couldn't study well (doctors put me in depressants to decrease brain fx whilst increasing my prednisone or corticosteroid to HELP inflammation= increase cortisol= increase stress).
      </p>
      <p>
       I eventually became bed- ridden. I was so sick of being sick so I researched on alternative ways to control my autoimmune disease and guys, after 9 years I am off any meds!
      </p>
      <p>
       It was when I started eating well and exercising properly and, not to mention removing toxic people and thoughts, that my body helped itself heal as well so yes, I do believe diet and exercise helps! But society tells us otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the long post. I just want to share how eating well and exercsing reallg helped in controlling my disease. :)

       Haha I changed my eating habits, I eat paleo, lots of fish oil and exercise and I breath and drink pure water. I am doing well but can you imagine a baby being injected with that on a monthly basis and the effect on the body? I was sick for about a year and I had to make a big change to get better. Children and babies have no way to even express how they are feeling.

       I honestly think its 3/4 the battle. When I get away from sugar for a few days even when I eat a banana I notice the amount of sugar in it.

       Cutting out anything is unnecessary really. People over think this shit way to much. Its all about balance while making sure your body gets the necessary nutrition daily and consistently. The only change that made any significant impact was intermittent fasting for me.

       I think cutting out GMOs and unregulated chemicals is important.  Refined sugars, wheat, most dairy, and processed foods are pretty much devoid of nutrients and just starve the body.  Organic means a lot less exposure to herbicides.  I'm a huge fan of intermittent fasting, I fast 16 hours/day

       I fast 16 days in lifting and 18-20 when I'm not. Honestly though, the whole organic thing is a huge scam, because unfortunately 99% of food in a grocery store is processed in some way.

       Yes, I may have some fruit in the AM, coffee with cream. But mostly I skip breakfast. For lunch I will have a huge salad, lettuce, spinach, kale, peppers, onions, carrots. I may have some rolled up lunch meat and cheese (no bread) if Idon't have a lot of salad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dinner is meat, steak, chicken, fish (all types) and cooked veggies. I eat around 1 pm and 6:30 pm. ISince this diet began, I do not snack and I'm usually never hungry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I drink a ton of water, if I go to a bar, it's vodka club with limes.. easily the most boring part, but oh well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to have less than a gram of sugar a day and can usually achieve this. Look , if I'm at a b-day party and cake is served, I'm not going to be a jerk, but I try to make it a smaller peice.

       I skip breakfast too, actually I feel better when I extend my fast. If I wake up and chow down a huge meal I peak for around 30 mins then get that crash.

        not

       Diets with healthy fats are important. Your brain and hormones are made of lipids. I believe diets that are anti-inflammatory focus are most important. Fat was demonized by the sugar/grain and various of big food industry through bad science and lobbying in fda.

       Heres a good start:

       Paleo, wow, when ever my girlfriend switches to that her weight plummets and she no longer feels hungry. It's a bit expensive (carbs are sugar, cheap and shitty; meat is expensive), but it's great.

       Good way to save money, go to a big box store for your meat and store up. You can buy huge platters of meat and break them down into smaller bags and freeze them. Veggies are a bit harder to do this, but what I do is run to a nearby Korean market for veggies every other day.

       After leaving home, and moving around the state, I have yet to meet any true friends. Everyone seems so self absorbed. I don't have anyone close to me anymore. The world is so cold these days. Once my parents are gone I will be truly alone, and my fear of dying as such will be more poignant than ever.

       not if you willingly accept something, then become aware of its covert purpose then refuse to walk away from it. At that point, you accept being manipulated. Do you not get that process? If you see something is wrong and dangerous but refuse to walk away from it, you are complicit in the agenda.

       Alternative media avenues or face to face. There has been communication for MILLENNIA without either of these things. I assume most of the people who cant grasp that dont remember a time without social media, which is why there is this echo chamber of people just asking "What do i do without social media" The answer: have a real life.

       During the past there weren't more than 7 billion people on that planet and internet didn't exist. Communication was different due to both the tools available and the amount of people to communicate with. Times change. Care to point to some alternative media avenues? Would love to communicate face to face with someone concerning issues with their poorly run government, but that cannot occur as that could be

       Reddit is passive in terms of its marketing, they dont directly market to your inbox, emails, etc. Because of the anonymity it doesnt allow for them to gather specific demographics about people, unless they willingly submit. There are tons of chat boards, AIM type devices, Web Pages and Meet Ups that allow people to discuss these things privately. Meetup.com is pretty cool that allows people to create meet ups for specific topics. I went to a Nick Redfern meet/greet/discussion that was pretty cool, and it was local, in turn putting me in contact with many like minded people.

       yes, this is true, but you are saying something is both black and white. You have a 30 page bitchifesto about social media and its ability  to manipulate people, then say it can be used in a balance way. If a tool is meant to manipulate you in a covert way, you can NOT find a way to use it balanced.

       Its not ad hominem or false analogy. You have clearly pointed to your belief and disdain for the manipulative mechanism of SM, then walked that back with the use it in a balanced way arguement. Which are opposite sides of the same argument. You want social media, but know its manipulating you. You wont admit that you have taking both points of an argument to suit your own desires and not the factual information you presented. Henceforth, the 12 year old with a stove. You know its dangerous, but out of sheer unwillingness to walk away, you will keep touching the hot stove and then complaining that it burned you. If you want to keep throwing surface level debate logical fallacies, you wont win. Its a typical liberal move to spout off a bunch of log fallacies to try to back someone down, but that wont work with me, especially when you moved your own goal post.

       I think there is a plenty of other ways to communicate information. Both Passively or directly. Social Media communicates directly what it wants too, in order to manipulate. There are plenty of ways to pass info. The entire purpose of social media is to manipulate for profit. If thats is the core of its purpose its much easier to use a passive method to communicate instead of forcing something you personally enjoy into fitting a specific desire of a group of people.

       I want to change system, but it starts with honestly including being honest with ourselves. How can you make the statement "no one controls me", when that just isn't true? Like I said unless you're living on Walden pond there are aspects of your life which are controlled whether you feel like a prisoner or don't.

       Controlled info that people willingly participate in is not a conspiracy. If i download an app and then realize its manipulating me, but then i say "ahh thats ok, i really like this app" then its a disease of choice, not a conspiracy. a Bingo Wing is flabby flailing arms.

         We are more "connected" than ever right? We can access others' lives at anytime, but the human element is missing. Social media often creates envy and jealousy, not love and friendship. Every time I post about this, I get comments on how it is just a tool, and it is how we use it. However, I have to say that it is not only a tool when Facebook admits to purposely manipulating its users. It is not a tool for a 14 year old, waiting for 300 "likes" on the latest selfie. The problem is that balance of social media is not promoted, and now everything is connected to social media. There are countless studies on the negative aspects, yet they are mostly ignored. It is not *only a tool when we are the tools.

       The best thing I ever did was delete my Facebook 5 years ago. It began a long journey of actual self-reflection which led me to the conclusion that my need for approval from other people shouldn't come from "likes" but instead from actual relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a few close friends who I love and a wife that loves me. I love to live simply and let others simply live. I think pursuing a life that balances faith, family and self-improvement is the only way to find true peace.

       Here is a recent Reddit post on this very topic.  "The more time a young adult uses social media, the more likely they are to feel socially isolated. Study suggests use of social media doesn’t present a panacea to reduce perceived social isolation. Past studies have shown that social isolation is associated with an increased risk for mortality."

      <p>
       Reddit is the only "social media" that I use or even have an account with.   Truthfully, I do believe I feel more socially isolated, as the post title puts it, in the time since I have used Reddit.  I cannot imagine if I also had facebook, twitter, snapchat, and a myriad of other social media apps on my phone.

       I don't understand why people find this surprising or really anything but common sense. It seems reasonable enough that any time you're spending on your device(s) is time you're spending WITH YOUR DEVICE and it's "information". It's impersonal, it lacks in human contact, connection, etc.

       My only real complaint is the food one. You only get over processed foods if that is what you buy. You can still buy fruit, veggies, meat and fiber and be fine dietary wise.  All the processed shit comes from eating fast food or buying prepackaged items. If you buy your own stuff and cook all you own food you will feel great and can know exactly what's going in you.

       I'll be real here. I'm a pretty big dude, you know I'm fat. I use to buy all prepared processed stuff, cuz I thought it was cheap and easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past idk like 4 months I've completely changed my diet. I buy fruits, vegetables, meat, some grains and other odds and ends. My bull has gone down, substantially. I spend about 200 a month now, 50 a week or so. I was spending more before because 6 frozen dinners at 5 a pop is much more money then 11 dollars for 6 chicken breasts ot the 8 dollars I spend for 6 turkey cutlets for my lunch. For 20 dollars though I know have all my protein for the week. The other 30 is getting fruit which i agree gets expensive, and vegetables which are pretty cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Healthy food isn't hard to make or prepare it only is if you choose to do it that way. I felt the same way before I said fuck it and started doing everything myself. I will admit though I have a tool for cooking that cuts my cooking time of meats on half which is a godsend. I have an electric grill that cooks both sides of meat at the same time. But otherwise it would still only be like 20 minutes from start to finish to cook  your meat. Most of the other stuff is eaten raw after being washed off, or just a simple bake for 20 mins with some salt and pepper thrown on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not on top Chef so my food is kept super simple  the most complex stuff I make is either my fancy fried rice or stir fry which are both fairly simple to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it sounds like I'm down playing food deserts or talking down to you, I'm not and I'm not trying to sound that way. As food deserts are a very real thing that fuck over large chunks of the population that live in cities and other times in rural areas. I mean it's a real problem when it makes news in the city of Chicago and surrounding subarb that 2 new jewels and also a whole food are going to be opening in the city, it really showcases the problem.

       Yeah the sugar addiction is def real. And so is emotional eating. These two things cause real problems that don't get addressed. It's easier to just bounce from fad diet to fad diet then to change your lifestyle and admit it could be you that's the problem,  people never want to blame themselves or hold themselves accountable.

       Not true at all.  Healthy food is cheaper than fast food, but you have to prepare it yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you go to the most expensive grocery stores such as Whole Foods, healthy food is much cheaper.  Produce is cheap.  You're just choosing to eat more processed stuff.  Farmer's markets are even cheaper.  And if you have a family member who isn't working, they can get a job pretty easily at a place like WF where family members get a 30% discount on all products.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cut out processed sugar a few weeks ago, and it's been going well.  Granted, I'll break the diet exactly 3 times a year (to eat a homemade cake, made on my, my brother, and my father's birthdays), but other than that I've been only getting sugar from fruit.  I'm already gluten-free (celiac's disease), so cutting out more crap from what I eat isn't hard.

       I agree with a lot of things you've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what it boils down to is personal responsibility.  Each of us have to make decisions that affect us and our families and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take food, for example.  My family has been gardening since the 1930s.  While we don't get all of our food from our gardens, we do get fresh vegetables and fruit during the season, and grow enough to put up for the winter and early spring.  If we have surplus, we share it with neighbors and friends.  Otherwise, we belong to a local food co-operative.  Once a month, an 18 wheeler from Erewhon shows up at someone's garage and we spend a happy few hours dividing up 50lb bags of beans and rice, cutting up wheels of cheddar cheese, and distributing boxes of dried fruits and vegetables.  It's fun for the adults, and the kids learn about taking inventory, purchasing and cooking from an early age.  We only eat vegetables, fruit, cheese, eggs (from our own chickens), dairy, whole wheat bread (that my wife bakes), and once in a while, locally raised beef or pork as a treat.  We're not vegetarians, we're just frugal.  The kids drink milk, apple cider we make ourselves, or water.  We do go out to eat once in a while, and yes we splurge on something yummy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding cell phones and other devices, we don't allow our children to have their own cell phones or other devices until they are old enough to pay for them on their own.  We don't give them allowances, but we do pay them for work they do that are above and beyond daily chores that every child has such as splitting wood for the stoves, turning over the garden by hand, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       About reading.  I read between 2-3 books a week.  It's down a lot since I was younger when I read 4-5 books a week.  I'm reading all of Graham Hancock's books and following up on the references in them.  I recently read a biography of John Lennon which was fantastic.  I still love to read.  There's nothing better than curling up with a good book and a cup of tea for a few hours.  I do watch movies on Netflix once in a while, but I threw my tv set out in 1999 and don't miss it one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       About materialism and greed.  I've been frugal most of my life and even more so now that I'm old.  Frugality just means being more present in life.  I don't have any credit cards.  If I really need something, I save up for it and pay cash (or buy a prepaid card).   don't care one spit about what my neighbors or friends are buying, I don't give a shit about fashion or clothes.  I like mine to be comfortable and sturdy, last a long time.  I like clothes that I can go canoeing in if that makes sense.  My cars are paid for and well maintained.  My house is paid for and cared for.  My only expense other than utilities is taxes and insurance.

       If you're referring to my life, it's not very hard, it's very affordable and doesn't take a lot of work.  It's just life.  Sure it takes organization and patience, but otherwise it's very healthy and positive in every way.

       I recently discovered the power and strength Jesus can give you,  I want people to just take a look jesus one more time, he is the role model the world needs, if everyone could just see  there is a God  and he cares about us, he created us and I know he loves us. There are powerful forces out there that are making the world upside down. We really need Jesus more than ever, he will make all happy and the world whole, I know it!

       That is amazing! I want the whole world to see his love. I know it sounds cliche to some, but we really need the power of Jesus, through him we can literally fix all of this. Thank for the reply I needed that. :)

       By what he did for me. I'm in my 30's, he healed my pain I had in my life, nothing has worked before accepting him. Once I took that step and fully believed he died for us, because that is how much he loves us, all those cliche Christian phrases you hear all made complete sense. There is not really one thing that I can point out to make you understand, its a sum total of things I have learned and felt. One tho, I love conspiracies been interested in them for 10 plus years, and once you keep digging and digging, you will find that there really is a bigger picture going on, and ultimately everything is trying to get your focus away from Jesus. What I have noticed is ultimately what we are seeing is God and lucifer are battling for our souls. I know it sounds crazy, but what you experience by accepting Jesus is absolutely amazing!

       There is a Machine Head song,
       <em>
        Imaginal Cells
       </em>
       , in the song they have voice overs from a book called
       <em>
        The Biology of Belief and Spontaneous Evolution
       </em>
       . The content of the book and song definitely confirmed a bias for me so I don't take it very seriously at all, but the words spoke to me on a "spiritual level" and gave me a positive outlook despite all of the chaos and the overall gloomy feel of the beginning of the song and voice over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the authors site:
       <a href="https://www.brucelipton.com/books/spontaneous-evolution">
        https://www.brucelipton.com/books/spontaneous-evolution
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is a copy of the audio:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJpsb0krC_4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJpsb0krC_4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically the content as I interpreted it basically says we're due for a time of social upheaval as society clashes with the new ideas being put out there by the younger generations, there will be a rise of mental illness and suicide, as there normally is noted during times of strife and turmoil, and there will be a rise of other symptoms of change and strife, war, increased poverty, and so on. However there also will be a rise of new ideas as the younger generations take the reins of leadership and the overall progress of man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now these times won't be easy because as you can see the more conservative of us aren't giving in without a fight, but to the authors they are dinosaurs railing against the march of progress, they are stuck in the old ways of thinking and if they don't get out of the way societies progression will grind them underneath.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am far more progressive than anything else politically, but a lot of my leanings are more centrist, like my stances on the 2nd amendment and war. But I keep my eyes are always down the road while still using the past as lessons to learn from them for the future. So this spoke to me and I agree with the observations and the overall hypothesis, it definitely made me feel like a bias was confirmed for myself.

       This has all been weighing pretty heavily on my mind lately too friend. No matter how dark the world around you is, keep letting your light shine and do the best you can to open the eyes of those around you. Set the best example you can for everyone you cross paths with. Don't let these thoughts kill the love inside of you. If that happens, they win and you become nothing more than part of the problem.

       By "the world" I guess you mean America? Because a lot of the stuff you mentioned (education for example) is not the case in a lot of country. I think it's dangerous to write his as a worldwide problem because it downgrades just how ridiculous the American system is by making it seem as if this is normal behavior in the developed world.

       I agree with a lot of your post, but there are some upsides in this upside-down world.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no denying that food is more processed than ever
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would say one solace here is that we also have a lot more choice in avoiding these processed food than we did 10-20 years ago. There has been a huge consumer push away from processed foods as it came known how awful they are for you. So while there are so many processed foods on the market, consumers do have the choice to not buy them in addition to a wider variety and access to fresh foods. We need the education in place to move people away from these foods, but at least now the options are out there. Additionally, while food deserts still exist throughout the US, luckily there has been a shrinking trend it how far people have to travel to access fresh foods. Which I think lack of access was a big reason a lot of people weren't eating fresh foods.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        More and more have become obsessed with "living forever", a theme prevalant in pop culture.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The concept of eternal youth isn't a new trend. The fountain of youth tale goes back to the 5th century BC and there have been several tales over millennium of eternal youth in addition to idolizing youth and beauty. I don't think on it's own it is a horrible trend, but what terrifies me about it is that we a now getting very close to making it a reality with scientific advances. It then comes to question how much strain will we put on an already overpopulated earth if are birth and death rates are not similar. Additionally, the ability for the older generations to be able to work way past standard retirement age also creates job shortages already strained by automation for the younger generations. We are already seeing some of this occur today, and a lot of it isn't because the older generation feels healthy enough to work, it's because they do not have enough of a security net to retire, so they work out of necessity instead of desire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also within all of this ties the worry of wealthy vs. poor. If there are these scientific advancements, they will be extremely expensive either at first or forever depending on the technology. With this comes the question of do only the wealthy deserve new grown organs, genome alterations, guaranteed cancer treatments, etc., just because they can afford them? We of course see this occurring today with health care, but what happens when it is life span or life altering? Money seems to cure a lot of issues within the system, it can buy you water once there are fresh water shortages, it can buy you food once there are fresh food shortages, it can buy you a new heart once your current one wears out. Which all of this feeds into the worry of automation, where those that are on top of it and own it will only become wealthier if something isn't done now to prevent it. I hope we can sort it out, but like you said we never will if you do not get corporate interests out of our political system.

       To your pointing on feeding the homeless, I realized something was very wrong even as a teen prior to joining the military, when the restaurant I worked at would throw pounds of food away each night stating policy. I thought of this happening nationwide nightly and all the waste, it made me sick.

       It sounds horrible but from a business POV what do you think would happen if you kept feeding the homeless every night? They'd tell all their friends and you'd become a magnet for the homeless, scaring paying customers away at the same time.

       Build homes or apartment complexes, on government land, create a resource center where they could learn job skills or get their GED if they don't have it. There are a whole bunch of resources we just allow them to waste. We could start asking Uber or Lyft to ask for donations of canned food once a week. They both serve millions of customers daily combined. I'd think that would solve some issues about hunger. I've tried to reach out to Uber about the idea, but they haven't put forth anything yet. All we have to do is use our brains and figure out ways to fix societies issues.

       *Mental illness and suicide are on the rise. Yet people have to hide their true feelings from the world. It is almost impossible to get "good" mental health care that is not atrociously expensive, even with "good" health insurance. More and more are suffering silently with anxiety and depression. Mental illness and suicide are on the rise among Americans. But do not worry - one of your friends just posted a status about how great their life is on Facebook!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to trust mental health providers and pharmaceutical companies even.  Our health care system is profit driven, so patients are at best, a second priority to profit margins and shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Mylan.  If you went to a car lot and found a car with a 4000% markup, you would expect that to be a pretty good fucking car, right?   But it's not.  It functions the same as all the other cars.  It looks like all the other cars.  You'd walk right off the lot, right?  Of course you would, because only a fool pays 4000% more for a product that does the same as the other 9 identical products on the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, with Mylan, it's not just the over-priced car being made available next to all the other cars - that alone is audacious enough.  In some states, it's the only car on the market.  In some cases, Mylan was in a position to sue if you DIDN'T buy their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like being told "You have to buy a Ford."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Because they invented the Model T and the process by which all other cars are produced.  They put more into research and development of the Ford, so they need to charge more per car to recoup their investment."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well, that makes perfect sense.  How much is this Ford?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's 1.4 million dollars."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Are you shitting me?  I can't afford that!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sure you can. Your car insurance is going to cover 80%"
      </p>
      <p>
       Until "health care consumers" - those are people, by the way.  The media doesn't even call people people in these situations.  Until people stop paying for overpriced care - including hospitalization, prescriptions, etc - things will not change.  The health care industry has no motivation to change because we keep overpaying them like they are doing us a real service.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they aren't.  They are lying to you and billing you to do it.

       You nailed it on the head. Especially about mental health, having severe depression their is not much quite like it. Real depression is basically slow torture and it's so stigmatized by society it's just incomprehensible. Having to deal with the struggle for over 10 years now due to things in my past that stayed with me. But if it wasn't looked at so sideways I gurentee I'd be feeling better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could ramble on for hours. But I posted this in a thread asking what is going to happen next? It's a little political and not eloquent at all but you can see where I'm coming from --
      </p>
      <p>
       *I know what's NOT going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone realizing their political bullshit is not a team sport. That we all are stressing every day for mostly the same reasons. That we as a collective conscience should stop being angry idiots fighting for a side, blinded by common sense that is right in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That somehow this huge gap between radical view points in the grand scheme of life is so obviously detremental​ and easily avoidable if everyone that claimed to be a 'good person' just let some compassion in for their fellow man. I'm not a preacher or some hippy. I just have no idea why people can't have a rational adult discussion with one another while avoiding seriously harmful personal attacks on another's​ character like it doesn't affect them. The term 'troll' is so fucking dumb yet is engrained in society now. It basically means it's ok to trigger people and be an asshole. To create hated for someone you don't have a fucking clue about. Everyone acts like they are the good guy and in the same sentence they add in that OTHER people are *insert terrible deeply personal accusation about a person because they read a sentence and it's different from what they believe in so of course they are wrong'.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the future will just be more divide more hate more of the things everyone preaches they are against while they are doing the same. fucking. thing. As a whole, the society of developed countries at least could be coming together and proving how much we have evolved. But instead, everyone is letting the politics they claim to dispise rule freedom of individual thought. The past couple years have made me go from a happy goofy guy, to a cynical depressed hermit. I just look at Facebook for 2 seconds and want to vomit. Even people that are 'red pilled free thinkers' have alot of bias toward anything that makes them have to engage in good rebuttals to their discussion. It's just people staunchly kicking their feet and yelling at a brick wall while nothing is accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's the biggest downfall in my opinion. It's all of us, it's the absolute disappearance of heartfelt compassion that allows good debates between us 'regular' people that live out all the shittiness that happens in some statistic you see on a spreadsheet. Out of a discussion with both sides trying to understand comes rational thinking, connection and maybe common ground that would spread and be a thing that could stop this fucking soapbox self promoting 'gotta get more acceptence in a mouse click!' culture that is a cesspool.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of us. And I am right there with you guys are just small examples of a system that has infected every inch of society. So fuck it. Stay hateful and watch the world be destroyed by fucking normal people that I bet alot of us would think they are insane but turned out untouchable because they accumulated a man-made product that says 'even though I'm a frail 70 year old you could probably kill by patting on the back to hard, somehow people are still so disillusioned they just let me do my thing.. oh sometimes they blog about how I'm Satan but it's not like anything would happen besides a little ad revenue for them.'
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - I've lost my mind mostly lurking while everyone yells over each other about how the world's turning to shit when they don't realize they are a major reason why shit is the way it is.*

       I know this sub is not a fan of Marx, but the later-Marxists talked about this as well: Unchecked capitalism ends up commodifying EVERYTHING in the search for exchange value. Art, music, cultural features, things that are intangible are transformed into units of commodity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take our personal metadata for example, now even THAT is being commodified. Things like our demographic data, our personal search histories (which reflect our thoughts or lifestyles to an extent), those are increasingly commodified to be bought and sold by the people with interest in doing so. Soon, technology will advance even further and our own biometric data might be as well with RFID implants!

       Canadian here - the OP's post is more relevant to Canada than ever!! We are more overworked than ever. The cubicle nation is alive and well here. People have less time to themselves and spend more and more time at work away from family and friends. The Canadian Dollar has crashed, real estate is border line unaffordable, jobs are being lost at a rapid rate. Canada has more consumer debt than America. Kids today are spending way more time online than any previous generation, being raised by social media, pushing off traditional human relationships. Canada was sold out to the major banks and corporations long ago. The problem with most Canadians is that they think they are better of than our American neighbors.

       This is only going to get worse as the population is changed by the multinational elites. All Western nations are being changed into poor countries with no majority populations but rather nothing but minority populations with no voting power and no commonality. All these are symptoms of a deeper problem that isn't being addressed because the establishment has pushed multiculturalism and tolerance so hard that no one can criticize or do anything about what they brand as the future. This is the future and it isn't going to get any better.

       I think about these things a lot, maybe it's because I recently crossed the big 3-0 and feel emptier than ever. Why do we go to work? Does anyone seriously ponder 'why we work'? Is waking up early, and rushing through traffic to to the office day in and day out healthy? Is banging out

       the most important thing in your life? No sane person can survive for years on end in a passive aggressive corporate environment - so why do we do it? This kind of lifestyle is literally killing us. Don't get me wrong - I'm not advocating laziness. What I'm saying is spending a lifetime in a job you hate isn't doing your health any favors. Once trapped inside the corporate world you start to lose: your ambition, energy, curiosity (is anyone here forced to conform?), creativity, and overall zest for life! I don't have the answers, but for the first time in my life I'm starting to wake up to theses issues we see all around us....

       Our productivity has increased, however we are still required to spend the standard 8 hours at work.  10+ hours if you're in a industry where you buy into the thought of "getting ahead".  I think that inflation and the constant uptick in the how much basic goods (food, shelter, fuel) cost are rigged to keep us on the never-ending treadmill.

       Observe for yourselves the decay of the sense of sin, the growth of innocence and irresponsibility, the strange modifications of the reproductive instinct with a tendency to become bisexual or epicene, the childlike confidence in progress combined with nightmare fear of catastrophe, against which we are yet half unwilling to take precautions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the outcrop of dictatorships, only possible when moral growth is in its earliest stages, and the prevalence of infantile cults like Communism, Fascism, Pacifism, Health Crazes, Occultism in nearly all its forms, religions sentimentalised to the point of practical extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the popularity of the cinema, the wireless, the football pools and guessing competitions, all devices for soothing fractious infants, no seed of purpose in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider sport, the babyish enthusiasms and rages which it excites, whole nations disturbed by disputes between boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider war, the atrocities which occur daily and leave us unmoved and hardly worried.

       When I discovered the idea that the world was not a globe, from youtube videos, it was almost an instant acceptance for me. I never really put much stock in space, space flight, astronauts, and all that other NASA jazz. The way the information was presented for me it just made sense, logic and reason are key tools as well, on top of that everything that NASA has ever presented is nothing more than drawings/CGI and of course it is a government agency and we know they have a tendency to lie. The NASA mind game is brilliant in my opinion, it's like the red-headed step child who just wants to go to space and save humanity, but really it's just another sham. The lack of visual evidence for the shape of our earth is surprisingly absent especially considering the fact that we are supposedly at the top of our game as far as technology is concerned. Seems like it would be simple to put a gopro camera on a rocket and just blast it into space with a live feed. Yet, it is no where too be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, I know the game that our controllers are playing and want to keep slaves as slaves. If the cows figure out how to get out of the pen then all the profits run away as well. Cows are easy to keep locked in, all you have to do is secure the fence line. Humans are not so simple since we can just jump a fence. So what do you do to keep beings that know how to reason locked in? You take away their ability to reason and take away their hope. If we live on a ball floating in space in the middle of nowhere and this is it, taxes and death, then you have successfully enslaved an entire populous. It is in our nature to explore, and when you take the ability to discover out of the hands of the individual and place it in the hands of the story tellers then you are in full control of their destiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still trying to figure out how we got here, I think the Greeks are the perpetrators of our current calamity. Plato's cave is very telling, especially given the fact that Plato had slaves. So why would he just imagine the idea of putting people in caves instead of just putting people in caves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even sure if that answers the question, I tend to ramble because I can't help but see all the connections.

       My thought is that sometimes you just have to live your life.  Constantly bogging yourself down in negativity (reality) can sometimes be a way to hurt that.  There's a reason there is r/eyebleach for moments like this.

       Our society is teaching us to expect things. To be taken care of immediately. To hurry it up. At the same time, our corporate overlords are giving us cheap products because planned obsolescence is the new standard. Most of us break something and throw it away and buy a new one. In fact, dismantling some products voids its warranty! I am just crossing my fingers for the future and I hope we all get our shit together soon and stop our irrationality in the states. 
And thanks for this post, like other users have said, I too am thrilled r/conspiracy is delivering solid OC!!

       Amazing post OP! I was reading through some of your past posts as well, and can completely empathize with your statements. I'm also a teacher, and having to put myself in a good mood for the sake of the students is always challenging. It leaves me feeling like I should be honest, but at the same time, I can't allow myself to make them feel frightened or upset because of the state of affairs worldwide. :/
      </p>

       The question of "what do people live for", has been one for the history books! Personally, I believe in fate, destiny, opportunity, and karma all existing within our world at the same time. Each individual is wholly connected with one another, yet, we have the ability to ignore that and focus on our own selves, for our own sake. I believe that our own abilities in being able to chose what reality is "true" for us, makes it so things like mental illness (depression, anxiety, ect.) can manifest itself in novel ways. There's a great article on this -
       <a href="http://www.esotericscience.org/article16a.htm">
        http://www.esotericscience.org/article16a.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Put simply: destiny is opportunity and fate is karma. We are in control of our destiny but have no control over our fate. Destiny cannot be forced on us; if we are forced then it is our fate. Destiny gives us an opportunity to turn a situation to our advantage and accomplish something great through our own efforts. It is designed to give us the best opportunities for the development of our consciousness, but it is only an outline – not an exact script. It doesn't detract from our free-will in any way, because we decide exactly how we want to act in any situation."

       I tripped balls with this on my mind once and was told by who claimed to be Mother Nature that we are in a time of turmoil because we are basically in labour as a species; giving birth to new way of experiencing. A perspective that would be born from our thoughts, technology. Everything alive on earth is the same consciousness and it's the will of this collective to do ANYTHING to evolve

       I just posted something extremely similar with a new twist. Maybe we can start a movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       My paper focused on the fact that all of our jobs are useless and probably serve only to produce income for the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, chairs produced for workers to sit on to work at call centers using phones purchased from companies, which all use legal documents and paperwork, and there are paper companies, legal companies to keep these companies in check, car companies so the workers can drive, using oil from oil companies who have power to shut down any counter arguments against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should steal money from this companies to fund better things. Chairs don't need to be made by humans. Use 3D printers. Take the money from chair companies away because at this point they are a detriment to society, with their production wasting away resources and intoxicating the planet and destroying the lives of uncountable future generations, stealing their free will. Since we can prove this, this means these companies aren't entitled to the free will that harms others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vegan food should be free since vegan food is required to feed meat. Meat can cost to reduce demand and reduce environmental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah go read mine, I'll stop there so I don't go on too long.

       Externalization of the Hierarchy, the kind of stress and degeneracy long found amongst the esoteric and the elite have been pushed onto the greater society. They produce chaos, from which these same groups can form the society they want to have, which likely won't be a nice place for most of us to exist.

       I really appreciated this post. You brought up aspects of society that, while talked about on this sub frequently, your commentary made me see it in a different light.
      </p>

       the present is bleak and the future is horrifying. If more people were conscious of the source of these issues, maybe we could prevent or even reverse the downward spiral.

       Thank you!! It is not that I am trying to be overly bleak and depressing, but maybe it is good if we are honest about reality. Not everything can be sunshine! I feel ignorance is what keeps people down.

       you're welcome. 
specifically ,the focus lack of morality , lack of respect for older people and the disconnect. 
I also appreciated that you wrote the post because like me, you hope that something among the many things that is wrong with society, will change for the better.

       Man I feel you. Social media is really weird when there's an entity like facebook that controls it all. But I have some good news for you. The blockchain is coming to mainstream. It will change the way we interact in the internet. Just take a look at steemit.com. There is no central entity on this social network. It's more like the community as whole that brings up the discussions about stuff that they want to see. Like a big group project

       As I walked to work this Monday morning, I found myself looking at the faces around me. They look like zombies on autopilot, going to do something they don't really like, because they have to. To sit in front of a screen, chained to a desk, deal with people they don't like just because they have power over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of world do we live in that this life doesn't just pass for normal but desired? How can anyone ever be happy without turning to something, anything to jolt themselves out of this hell?

       Ugh, man, OP, you hit it all on the head...I've been so disparaged lately, literally just crying from the state of the world around me. Just looking up in the sky everyday reminds me how little control I have over my life, as chemtrails litter my blue sky like a fucking checker board. I feel like a tiny ant, just here to consume, work, consume, work, get sick, buy treatments, consume, die, ala "They Live". I could say so much more, but just thanks for posting, I don't feel so alone

       I quit Facebook and truly am so much happier. Started going to the gym and I actually look good enough now to show myself off but I have no desire to (humblebrag, I know). It's amazing not being tied into that false social-reward system - it's all fake and meaningless. Real friendships are in person.

       The more the world looks like the movie Idiocracy the more worried I get and it's pretty spot on now. We act as if pop culture icons are superior roll models. Fame is need to be elected to office while morals and traditions are frowned upon. We elected a substitute drama teacher to lead my nation because he had nice hair and said he would make pot legal. We are all brainwashed non thinkers. I am sure I am infected but I just do not know it.

       get off facebook, it is compromised. if you are still on facebook in 2017 it is probably because you deserve it. improve yourself and stop being dependent upon awful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       that really is just the key. poisonous, toxic people run off of the esteem of others. stop "liking" sowers of discord. if you are a sower of discord yourself, stop it. if you improve yourself and the people you like turn negative towards you, remove them from your life, they are crabs in a barrel trying to hold you down.
      </p>
      <p>
       people are afraid to be lonely but cavorting with fools is a wretched existence more base than the loneliest life.
      </p>
      <p>
       it really is as simple as this: stop putting negative energy out into the world, stop giving positive energy to people who are negative, form positive relationships with good people and the results will astound you.

       This is exactly what's happening in my life regarding with people who I once treated as friends. They ended up backstabbing me. And you're right, the good people who stayed still astounds me up to this day! If it weren't for the good, right people in my life right now, I would've hated myself so much for thinking that I was exactly what my old friends were gossiping about.

       The power of words is something we should all take to heart. No matter who you are, speaking words of wisdom right from the heart has a powerful capacity to move others. Music made from this play can't help but be beautiful, and that's part of the reason why the music industry exists to produce soulless oppressing music. Some music frees the mind and spirit, and some oppresses it. I'd encourage anyone here to begin playing an instrument, and watch it's effect on your own mind. A good beat can literally take your mind to another place. A good rhyme will place shit in your subconscious mind. Illuminating it for a moment in time. Why do you think the outside world is so loud sometimes? ;)

       Late but thanks for bringing this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spend a lot of time chasing down these questions. What I've primarily ended up at for the moment, as a trigger for many of these issues, is the advent and use of group psychology (only worsened by media and consumerism pressures through the cognitive science revolution).
      </p>
      <p>
       The early work on crowd psychology "legitimized" that crowds are irrational and should be guided through manipulation of the subconscious (which could be argued - look at the fall of civilizations prior). Many who seek power could easily stop here and gain a lot of capability to mold public opinion; after two or three centuries of this, the narrative of "society" is one that clashes with what individuals know and hold true. Placed in this contrast, we find ourselves, well, upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically, this power mixed with means of capital allows the "deep state" to manage the narrative of society through managing exposure of information, controlling it through commercial pressures, showing a society that will further depend on that narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started getting into this stuff with Jung and then Freud, which backed up what I read from Foucault, Chomsky and Zinn. But I didn't really get it until I looked at Edward Bernays and Le Bon, who spell out crowd psychology - and a narrative of "control is good for people," which tbh I can't say it isn't on some level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that all can show more understanding of why things are as they are. I would be more specific to each point and this relation but I am typing on my phone.

       I'm so with ya.  Absolutely sick of the way the world is, imo the only positive things going on are the upending of bullshit isms (such as the anti-transexual people, the only point of yours i disagree with.  Let people be who they are)  It's just a result of the fucked up system of crony-capitalism we live in.  Seems hopeless but i got to have a little faith that we will overcome!

       Go ahead i respect ur opinion but i truly believe it is plain wrong to dicriminate based on someone's gender identity.  I just have a lot of friends who are trans, and although i'm not myself i dress in drag once in a while for kicks.  I don't think society should dictate what you can and can't wear, and whether you need to be feminine or masculine or anything.  Be who you wanna be!

       What would the purpose be?  I for one hate the hyper-masculinity that's driving our culture to the brink of destruction.  Self-proclaimed "alpha males" shitting all over everyone else just because they want to feel good about themselves and the size of their dicks.  Sociopaths is another word for the "top" people in this category, AKA the very people this sub rails against.  That .1 percent that rule the whole world, and i'd venture that at least a good amount of why they do it is because of a percieved need to be "manly" and accumulate more and more wealth, and destroy the lives of as many people as they can.

       Preach OP!! but do not let these thoughts dominate you or they prevent you from using your full potential for good. People are waking up to these changes everyday, more and more we all just have to keep spreading little seeds of positivity and awareness and not let ourselves be silenced. Pick one thing from the list to work on and keep letting others know how you feel.

       I would say almost all of these problems stem from a major lack of a relationship with G-d.  TV shows and many internet sites just ridicule religion as some archaic thing rather than allowing people to think about the Creator-creation relationship.  TV shows (at least sitcoms I used to watch) often make fun of the people that believe in G-d.
      </p>
      <p>
       It paints this black and white view of spirituality. Buy in reality we are spiritual beings temporarily in physical bodies in finite world...with an infinite Creator.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some very helpful guidelines for all people who chose this path, and the path is paved by the Creator himself.  I feel like most of us a re playing a very complicated game without reading the instructions at all because so many are brainwashed into thinking that the game doesn't have a designer.

       There are a lot of people that don't try to develop that relationship with G-d, so the "face/countenance" of G-d is turned away, just as a father will turn away from his son after the son disobeys the moral rules that strengthen the foundation of the entire household.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people have a lot of potential and while there are many people choosing the dark path, the moral path is still available to all, and over the last few years, people definitely have been waking up and switching paths.  It isn't something that happens overnight, but it is one of our main purposes for existence.

       This is sad because the elderly have wisdom in areas where the new generation will be weak.  They are written off because they may not be tech savvy.  It is important to know how things have changed over a long period of time as well as the knowledge gained from it.

       This is profound.  Not only do they feel they need to hide the problem due to social pressure, they are also bombarded with people trying to show off how great their life is.

       I agree that most of society does.  Many think, "what can I do about it" as well, which, in turn, causes them to not worry about it.

       I find solace in all of these things as well. I agree with your points in parentheses and find the contrast of the two very profound.

       Sometimes when I try to come up with a closing sentence, it ends up rhyming for me too.  :)  Not only does this rhyme, but it really hit me emotionally bringing everything you mentioned together and applying it to your teacher/student relationship.

       I appreciate your post and resonant with your message but was there ever a time in which the world wasn't upside down or cruel? I read post about the glorious days of the past and how the issues were minute. While they were different, saying that these problems were better than those today is not fair.

       I'd add one thing: to the bit about connecting to others on social media. This is the thing, we are not connecting to others, not other humans, but our devices instead. Why people generally have a difficult time making this connection/realizing this, I do not know... it seems just so obvious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, the bit about the charities, the selfies, the "bragging" on social media, etc... You've already touched on it well, there's not much left to say other than it drives me nuts.

       I agreed so much with your post. I have watched our culture devolve through the use of technology. It has become ridiculous. Even in the past 2 years I have seen more of the neighborhood children stay inside and play video games. It is so sad. we have to disconnect and unplug for our sanitizes sake. Because of technology we work longer  and earn less than ever. People just accept it. It baffles me. 
I hate Facebook always have. It's shallow and the platform is ugly and visually unappealing. I have never understood the appeal to the masses.

       School loans: when you buy a house you must prove that you can afford it. With school loans there is no such requirement. Students are being forced to buy an education without the slightest idea if they can afford it. Who goes into debt without an income? It is the equivalent to a loan shark. The schools are complicit they are enslaving our workforce and no matter how much you make your take home income will always be just so. It's a racket. The best thing I ever did was go cash and forget about the fico score. The control that the credit industry has on us is enslavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The education system is a mess and teachers are not only underpaid but also held in low esteem. BUT I also blame teachers. They choose not to change the system from within. They simply follow orders accept whatever nonsense the administration orders and instead of enlisting the voices of the parents and the children to demand change, no the majority of teachers are complicit and sheeple. I have come to the conclusion that sheeple are dangerous. I used to be a teacher and loved it. when common core took over I was shocked at how many teachers supported it. So many teachers are letting themselves get replaced by robots through their free use of technology. It's insanity. The world is upside down. The mentally ill psychopaths are running it. The population is enslaved yet they think they are free. We accept lies and corruption from our politicians whe. We should be literally knocking on their doors demanding they keep their committments. Yet we the public must come to work every day on time if we get sick we get fired and lose out health insurance. Yikes! 
Is it me or has anyone noticed that the culture has grown meaner lately. When I was younger if someone would get fired we would collect money for that person. Nowadays the coworkers make fun of the fired or laid off person. It's so strange to me where did this mean spirit come from?

       For some reason they view parents as an annoyance instead of partners. I hear so much complaining about the administration taking away nap time from kindergarten for example, and parents complaining but no one works together. It's an us against them mentality. Teachers have a lot of influence, but for some reason they don't use it. They are underpaid and unappreciated but they need to enlist the parents to demand better. Why don't they? . I remeber when homeschoolers were the weirdos now I see it as admirable.

       I think society has divided teachers and parents as enemies. Part of this is because many parents want to be friends, and teachers are trying to enforce standards. Creates a lot of conflict

       Just want to say I am SO glad that your post blew up! And made it to the top of hot. There are more of us out there, who feel this. Imagine the people who don't even go on Reddit? I have been thinking those same things as you posted and I have renewed hope that we are delusional, maybe just maybe this actually a movement. Movements and cultural revolutions start because of a fanatical minority. Are we that minority? I have more hope once again thank you for posting this.

       I feel like there is a balance. I still wake up and do my best every day to be a good person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I feel I am constantly told to just ignore and undermine real issues. Nothing changes because I feel people would rather not face it.

       Discussion is good. Counter-arguments are good.

       Beautifully said. I see how we treat those who are suffering in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       People separate themselves from the homeless, mentally ill, etc...thinking they are not "like them". But I think we are all closer to the "brink" of suffering than we fully realize.

       Coconut water is great, but too much of it during competition can cause bloating and an upset stomach.  I mix it in with water and the orange juice i make and some salt.  Works great.  Usually the formula is a few oranges (I use 3 or 4 because I like a really fruity taste), probably half a small bottle of coconut water, and the rest water, with some ice cubes too to keep it cold or from getting too hot.  A pinch of salt and a little bit of lemon juice (sometimes i add lime juice too) and it works just fine.

       Lots of mentally ill and homeless just want to be left alone. They don't want to be part of this shit society with its shit customs and manners and hypocrisy. So please don't say the solution is to build institutions to force these people into so they can be 'recuperated' by the same sort of people they abandoned society and 'reason' to avoid. Don't require people to go through a thousand programs and sign a thousand forms and interviews and bullshit to get free stuff, or they just go without completely. Got more vacant homes than homeless people. How does that work?

       It's still done. For example, it's done by advertisers who target children, so that they can instill narratives of consumerism into them, while they're impressionable and formulating their place in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       More useful to "society" if their place in the world is "to buy shit that isn't needed." So called Youth Culture is a disgusting thing. If there is some attempt at this that is contrary to those messages, I haven't seen it.

       In one version of the election, Sanders is elected President...and things start improving immediately. But...things are so great that people refuse to believe any of it is true, and chaos ensues. 
People who don't understand political science or world history, but fear "communism" and "socialism," plan violent revolt. They're being handed necessities free of charge. Everyone on equal ground again. But people still panic. It's too much at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then Trump gets elected in another version. but he's not really the President. It's Greek theatre. It's a distraction to keep everyone busy while they prepare some sort of world changing announcement. Either we've achieved world peace through technology and diplomacy, or Aliens are real. Free energy becomes a thing for the whole planet? The Egyptian Gods were real and they're back? I can't remember it's fuzzy.

       Our productivity has increased, however we are still required to spend the standard 8 hours at work.  10+ hours if you're in a industry where you buy into the thought of "getting ahead".  I think that inflation and the constant uptick in the how much basic goods (food, shelter, fuel) cost are rigged to keep us on the never-ending treadmill.

       Sorry for the delayed response to your very detailed and thought out post.  With my ADHD I quit my meds against everyone's wishes at 24 because I felt like a zombie. And again they still wanted me on 4-5 dexadrine a day at that time which was nuts. I graduated with a 3.5 GPA even though I literally never studied, had a successful military then state corrections career (until being Injured on the job in both) so I don't feel like my ADHD has ever held me back in life. The unique perspective I gain from life is worth the struggles I've faced IMO.

       There are a lot of people that don't try to develop that relationship with G-d, so the "face/countenance" of G-d is turned away, just as a father will turn away from his son after the son disobeys the moral rules that strengthen the foundation of the entire household.

       The people have a lot of potential and while there are many people choosing the dark path, the moral path is still available to all, and over the last few years, people definitely have been waking up and switching paths.  It isn't something that happens overnight, but it is one of our main purposes for existence.

       There is always hope.  The message and the Truth will spread.  Those with hope and dedication must take the torch and enlighten the path.

       I've never personally used it, but I think asknoah.com is probably a good place for people that want the purest form of an instruction manual for life and happiness.
