       Hey guys
      </p>
      <p>
       You may have seen me around here introducing people to the recent developments in unified physics that prove we live in a fractal holographic universe. I run
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       - and you guys always seem receptive to the latest developments in this area, so I figured I'd throw this up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to write up a post detailing the latest on developments in theory behind how the EMDrive works, and how it fits into a unified physics framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go through the most high level explanation of unified physics -
      </p>
      <h1>
       Basic Unification Theory
      </h1>
      <p>
       The vacuum is full of energy, it is a superfluid lattice of light. It is unperceivable unless it is spinning, which is what we see as matter. Matter is space spinning, and space is ground-state light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream physics predicts that the vacuum should be absolutely
       <em>
        teeming
       </em>
       with energy, on the order of 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams / cm
       <sup>
        3
       </sup>
       of space. This number is extraordinarily high and so it has come to be known as the worst prediction of physics, the vacuum catastrophe. This is simply because we don't perceive this energy --- I don't have to explain to you guys that perception and reality are two different things :p.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't perceive it because it is in a geometric ground state, a geometry that expresses no vectors of force in any direction. This geometry has the capacity to shift, and thus become polarized or active, making it perceivable. The dynamic is similar to the 'time crystals' articles that have been floating around.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Holography
      </h1>
      <p>
       So - if we take this vacuum energy, which is made up at the smallest level by something called planck units, which have a definitive size, mass, and time as a fluctuation of energy, we can prove the proton is holographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you simply divide the proton by these vacuum fluctuations size and multiply by a vacuum fluctuation energy, you end up with the mass of the observable universe inside of each proton - the proton has a holographic representation of all protons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Precisely 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams worth of vacuum energy fit inside the proton, the mass of the observable Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can then derive the rest mass of a single proton by applying the holographic principle, which postulates that the surface of a black hole can encode the volume. Since the proton has this immense amount of energy, we can treat it as a black hole and apply the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you do this, by dividing the surface planck units by the volume, and multiply by the planck mass, you yield the rest mass at 10
       <sup>
        -24
       </sup>
       grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this is stating, plainly, is that each proton has physical access to the information of the entire Universe, but only a very tiny slice is expressed locally as mass, the rest is non-local.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because these surface plancks are terminations of wormholes that connect to all other protons. All protons are entangled through this wormhole structure of space, validating another theoretical concept in physics called EP=EPR, which states rather than entanglement being 'spooky action at a distance', it is simply caused by physical wormholes in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       These wormholes are possible because of the massive amount of energy in empty space - it essentially turns our Universe into a giant singularity (or Bose Einstein Condesate for our physics guys) where instantaneous information transfer can happen across spacetime - in essence, macro quantum entanglement across scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the most basic and fundamental level of reality, you are
       <em>
        touching
       </em>
       every other point in the Universe.
      </p>
      <h1>
       The EMDrive in Unified Physics
      </h1>
      <p>
       Recently Aerospace America released another article that details how they believe the EMDrive may work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are unfamiliar with the EMDrive, it is simply a microwave magnetron inside of a closed can, turn on the microwave and you get thrust, which seemingly violates our laws of physics, because there is no force being pushed out of the engine, there should be no force vectors (i.e. a rocket only moves because of it's exhaust, no exhaust, no movement).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we just have to change our perspective, and that's what the Aerospace America article postulates.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the vacuum is full, and entangled, and electromagnetic waves can interact with it, what's happening is the magnetron is creating a density gradient in the field, just like a boat propellor does in water, and the EMDrive is literally
       <em>
        pushing against the quantum vacuum
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Here is thier explanation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As for the physics behind the EmDrive, White and his team speculate they may be seeing a manifestation of what’s known among physicists as a quantum drive or Q thruster. Such a thruster works on the well-accepted principle that
        <strong>
         empty space is not a vacuum but is frothing with fluctuations in quantum fields, with pairs of virtual particles perpetually forming and mutually annihilating.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on an interpretation of quantum mechanics known as pilot wave theory, these vacuum fluctuations can be thought of as a dynamic medium that guides, or pilots, individually observed, “real” particles. And as a medium, the quantum vacuum’s constituents can interact and exchange momentum, not unlike a fluid, or a plasma.
       </p>
       <p>
        As White sees it, the EmDrive can leverage electromagnetic fields to couple with the quantum vacuum and induce a slightly preferential flow in it. “A terrestrial analog to think of is a submarine that sits in the water,” White explains. “It takes advantage of the fact it’s embedded in its propellant.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       </a>
      </p>
      <h1>
       So what's pilot wave theory?
      </h1>
      <p>
       You may be familiar with the copenhagen interpretation of QM, wherein we have all of these paradoxes like light being both particles and waves, the weirdness that comes out of it such as multiverse theory and quantum immortality - because of experiments like the double slit.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is another completely logical, completely rational interpretation of QM that gives all of the same 'answers' as the Copenhagen interpretation, without any of the paradoxical weirdness - and it's called Pilot Wave.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilot Wave postulates that what we are seeing with particle/wave duality is simply a
       <em>
        particle that makes waves in space.
       </em>
       Sounds too simple, doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmC0ygr08tE">
        Here
       </a>
       is a video of someone re-creating
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of the weirdness of the double slit experiment using
       <em>
        oil drops on top of a vibrating bath
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why the fuck aren't we taking pilot wave as fact?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because it necessitates something that is very uncomfortable for physicists, and that is inherent non-locality. Essentially, for pilot wave to work the way we imagine it might, it means the entire UNIVERSE needs to be entangled with itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well - thats what unified physics is finding - the entire universe is entangled and fractally self-referential, it is holographic - the information of the entire thing can be accessed no matter which particle you peer into.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is most likely the nature of morphic resonance, mystical states, occult ritual practice, etc - the information of the whole is encoded at every point in space.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Zero Point and Antigrav
      </h1>
      <p>
       The EMDrive is, in essence, an anti-gravity device.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other scientists who have had similar experiments in modulating gravity through spinning electromagnetic fields, for example
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Tajmar">
        Martin Tajmar
       </a>
       who was able to create anti-gravity through spinning superconducting ceramic, this is in effect the same dynamic as the EMDrive - you are spinning EM fields that end up creating a spin in the quantum vacuum, which creates a pressure/density difference, allowing antigravity effects.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Following the work of Podkletnov, physicist Martin Tajmar, a professor of space propulsion studies at Dresden University of Technology, produced anomalous inertial effects (generation of small amounts of thrust or momentum) by spinning superconductive tori, as well as spinning superfluid helium. In the experiments performed by Tajmar and his research team, spinning superconductive rings and superfluid helium (both at a temperature of 4 kelvins), produced an acceleration in a laser gyroscope positioned above the apparatus (but not in direct contact with the apparatus). That is to say, the laser gyroscope itself experienced a minute acceleration in the same direction of rotation of the spinning superconductive discs (gyroscopes are used to detect accelerations and changes in orientation)
       </p>
       <p>
        Interestingly, the effect only occurred when the superconductors and liquid helium were spinning in a clockwise direction, but not counter-clockwise.
        <strong>
         Tajmar has theorized that in the Southern hemisphere the counter-clockwise direction should produce an acceleration in the laser gyroscope in the direction of rotation of the apparatus while no similar acceleration will be observed for the clockwise direction of rotation, as occurs in the Northern Hemisphere. This is an important detail, as it is absolutely consistent with Haramein’s amendment of Einstein’s field equations where torque and Coriolis effects are considered. Tajmar’s experiment therefore confirms that the structure of spacetime has Coriolis dynamics present due to fundamental torque as the result of a gradient in the vacuum energy density producing the gyroscopic rotational effects of a body, such as the earth.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Make no mistake about it, our understanding of unified physics will catapault us into the next evolutionary stage of humanity. We're talking wormhole traversal, antigravity, zero point energy extaction - it goes on and on.

       The video really did it for me. This is a fantastic write up, boiohboi, this oddly tickles my brain cells. Idk why tho, I've read into the "holographic" part of it. I have yet to read into the pilot theory, but now that you've given me this nice summary haha, I hope you get many upvotes for this W00T

       It's not logical or rational. It's an attempt to change reality to fit a worldview. The "paradoxical wierdness" of pilot wave is the "pilot wave" itself, this imaginary guiding wave that exists outside of 3 space that we have to believe in.

      <p>
       That's because it is too simple. You forgot the part about the nonphysical guiding wave which is necessary and is no different from the imaginary waves implied by the schrodinger wave equation.

      <p>
       That's hydrodynamics, not quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, the "weirdness" of quantum mechanics goes far beyond the double slit experiment.

       Based on your criticisms, it appears you do not understand Pilot Wave theory. You may want to study this completely acceptable theory in more detail before making baseless and erroneous statements excoriating it. The guide function is not an imaginary wave existing outside of 3D space... I don't know where you would have even gotten this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the central tenets of Pilot Wave theory is that particles occupy a real position in space, even when not observed. That is, Pilot Waver theory is based on realism. In addition to a real configuration, particles have an associated wavefunction that describes the space of all possible configurations – this is the same wavefuction of Bohr-Heisenberg mechanics, the evolution of which is described by the Schrödinger's equation.
      </p>

       Since Pilot Wave theory does not suffer from the inherent indeterminacy of Bohr-Heisenberg mechanics, there is a deterministic equation that describes how the wavefunction of all possible configurations will evolve over time. This actual description of pilot wave theory runs completely counter to your unfounded statement of “an imaginary guiding wave existing outside of 3d space that we have to believe in”.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for it not being logical or rational, again you obviously don’t know what you are talking about. Pilot Wave theory is one of the most realistic, physical, and intuitive interpretations of quantum mechanics that exists. In the words of Lehman College astrophysics professor Mathew O’Dowd: “Pilot Wave theory is perhaps the most solidly physical, even mundane, of the complete and self-consistent interpretations of quantum mechanics… yet it is still considered unorthodox. Why is that? Because orthodoxy equals radicalism plus time”. I suggest checking out the full discussion here --

      <p>
       That’s the point, quantum mechanics may be explainable via hydrodynamics, because space has a fluid dynamic property, the pilot wave field, that interacts with “particles”, informing the system how to evolve overtime. The fact that macroscopic hydrodynamic quantum analogs can completely recreate wave--particle duality, particle diffraction, quantum tunneling, quantized orbital energy levels, the Zeeman effect, etc. is an empirical demonstration of the primary postulates of Pilot Wave theory --

       Yes, and these other features are described in Bohmian mechanics because it is inherently nonlocal, so entanglement across spatial and temporal frames is an essential feature of the theory and would be expected to be observed in any appropriately conducted experiment.

       From the Director of the Standford Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leonard Susskind:
       <em>
        “It is obvious that the Copenhagen Interpretation cannot be the last word. The universe is filled with subsystems, any one of which can play the role of observer. There is no place in the laws of quantum mechanics for wave function collapse; the only thing that happens is that the overall wave function evolves unitarily and becomes more and more entangled. The universe is an immensely complicated network of entangled subsystems, and only in some approximation can we single out a particular subsystem as THE OBSERVER.”

       No, no, no. That link does NOT show an EMDrive. That is an ionic lifter, and it works on entirely different principles. A high voltage is applied to the wire at the top, ionizing the air around the wire. The ionized gases then rush towards the oppositely polarized aluminum foil, creating lift.

       You obviously missed that part in the video where he disproved the claim that it is ionic wind. But even if it is ionic wind, what does EMdrive even mean? Electro magnetic drive. Basically using electricity to create propulsion. The lifter does just that.

       By your logic, you might as well compare a car and a mag-lev train, because they both utilize electricity. The electricity is used in extremely different manners, however. In a car, the electricity is used to combust gasoline. In a mag-lev, the electricity is used to create magnetic fields which repel each other.

       Saying that an ionic lifter video demonstrates EMDrive is vastly incorrect, and I'm fairly sure u/d8_thc would agree. If not, I'll happily concede

       Why is semantics always the go to argument?  I presented a demonstrable, reproducible propulsion from electricity example, but that isn't good enough. I guess you are talking about the magnatron to resonant chamber theory that is not reproducible, demonstrable, violates several laws of physics, and is used as justification of several fringe theories of physics ideas.  And you still ignore the disapproval by experiment in the video showing the thrust isn't from ionic wind. According to Newton's 3rd law changing the polarity would change the direction of force, but it doesn't.

      <p>
       That is thoroughly incorrect. Regardless of the polarity of the circuit, the ion lifter will propel the same direction. This is because the emitter generates ions regardless of the electrical polarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have the positive lead on the emitter, it generates positive ions, which rush towards the negatively polarized collector. If you change the polarity and attach the negative lead to the emitter, it generates negative ions, which then rush towards the positively polarized collector.

       You're basing your beliefs on this issue in a single video made by a YouTuber that is either fully ignorant of electrical theory or is intentionally hoaxing

       You can remain willfully ignorant on this subject or perhaps do a bit of your own research and actually understand how the lifter works. This is a nice place to start:

       Unit for energy is Joules. I see no Joules. Therefore I am confused.

       Density is kg / cm

       I wasn't sure though because I was under the impression that different materials had different amount of energy in them. And as I type that out I realize that its probably based on the mass, so the type of material becomes irrelevant.

       We're reaching a point where those following conspiracies are starting to entertain the thought, "Hmm. This shit is actually insane. Our reality is
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       foreign;
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       other than what I thought it actually was. Is it that insane to think the illusion goes deeper than something related to politics, or bankers, or wars? Might there be more?" And it's the people like you, OP, who are capable of taking such complex understandings of the fabric of reality and putting that information into clear, easily relatable paragraphs for people like myself to then go on questioning the world outside and the world within. This shit
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       go deeper. We've been lied to about the literal fabric of reality. We've been lied to about what we literally are. We've been groomed to believe our thoughts, which has prevented us from recognizing the fact that we are, fundamentally, consciousness/awareness. We've been trained to believe that we are separate from the universe -- we all feel that we can
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       the universe, rather than
       <em>
        out of
       </em>
       the universe. But threads like this one, OP, are what we need now.

       A deep calling to question truth, critical thinking, pure honesty, and fearlessness. Those are the ingredients for the unveiling of an unfathomably freeing truth. Thank you for your time putting this together.

       -- This is actually consistent with my theories about life: Life as we know it exists to create consensus about what is reality. This is the true meaning of life, we are reality consensus mechanisms. A good metafor would be blockchain technology, where every living creature is a node in the blockchain, trying to reach consensus with other nodes over reality. This is also the true explanation for evolotion, it is simply a slippage on perception over long periods of time. I came with this theory after looking at a tree for a long time: Trees are so incredibly random, with hundreds leaves, and branches. But I felt there is still some sort of logic behind their design, then it struck me: Leaves are sensors. A tree is a machine full of sensors. They sense reality and feed it back to the 'blockchain'. Reality is the sum of all perceptions. The following article partially proves my theory (read the part about the double slit theory):

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more signs in nature that confirm the consensus mechanism theory, maybe one day I will write a long blog post about it or something.
