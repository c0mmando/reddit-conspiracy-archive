       One day there was quite the turmoil on both 4chan and Reddit. Appearantly there was childporn all over Twitter. Thousands of users alledgedly saw thousands of Twitteraccounts with childporn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another write up from a Reddittopic about it:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5e48pf/what_is_going_on_with_this_twittergate_thing_and/">
        source
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Essentially, Twitter users @0hour, @Eclipse_OW, and @WonderChick were able to create scripts that tracked Twitter accounts posting child pornography and the accounts that followed them. An estimated 25,000 accounts were found related to child pornography, some of which were active for at least a year, if not longer. Soon after the accounts were brought into the public eye, the accounts started to get suspended, but @0hour and @Eclipse_OW had their accounts suspended as well.
People in r/pizzagate are frustrated because from their perspective it appears that Twitter's been focusing more on silencing those with differing politics than making sure their site doesn't have child porn on it.
This isn't the first time child pornography's been an issue with Twitter.
Article on The Guardian discussing it in 2012:
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/twitter-failure-child-pornography">
         https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/twitter-failure-child-pornography
        </a>
        EDIT: @Eclipse_OW has been unsuspended. Suspension was for "retweeting images or links of child porn
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't online when all this happened, but ofcourse it was something that blew my mind. How could that have been on Twitter so out in the open and for so long? Are there not bots crawling the tweets? Are there not feeds or ways that even the most obscure twittermembers sometimes are viewed by outsiders?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I started wondering: how was the childporn shown? Was it like a twitpic embedded in the message? Or where they links to websites? It was really difficult to get this question answered and while asking I've noticed that even though tons of people have seen it, nobody was able to post a censored screenshot of the actual thing. They said that no-one captured it because that would make you possess childporn, but I dont believe 4chan and Redditors are so afraid of the 'cyberpolice' (hehe) that they don't dare to take a screenshot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I've never seen any reports in MSM. Where I would think that "massive amounts of childporn on Twitter" is in fact a juicy story that at least a bunch would jump on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, was this an elaborate joke or way to draw attention? Or has this really happened?

       As stated in the OP: appearantly it was huge with many accounts involved and many regular internetusers stumbling upon (hardcore) childporn. But somehow nobody is able to tell how it was shown, or took a screenshot as proof?

       That's at least something! Still not really evidence that childporn was indeed all over Twitter, but it's much more than nothing.

       I'm glad you still have the Google doc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also remember personally witnessing this--I watched it go down in realtime. I clicked on some of the accounts and saw the unsavory descriptions of who was looking for what.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I was definitely NOT going to take screenshots. Hell no. Possession of CP is no joke, esp if you're a conspiracy theorist and already paranoid of being on some "list." In fact, I remember that everyone in the subreddit was warning against merely pulling up the usernames because of the high risk of viewing CP. To answer your question, the pics were shared by the usual re-tweeting and uploading/passing. Nothing fancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall that the spreadsheet of usernames was distributed in hopes of people reporting the US-based accounts over to the local police, especially because so many of the idiots used their Twitter handles elsewhere and their real names were sometimes discernible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember @WonderChick's profile pic was a chick (baby chicken) wielding machine guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's my recollection, fwiw.

       When it was all happening I came across lots of sick accounts that had very inappropriate pictures of children but a lot of them may not have been "posed", but just used for CP purposes. ugh sickens me to type out but I never myself saw any hard core cp

       You're right to be cautious. There's a lot of BS and dramatics around it but underneath all that, its just a localised version of a real worldwide problem.

       It was real. People had Cp pics as their profile pics and other cp stuff in their pictures in general. I didn't look around too much as it was disturbing.

       You won't find many screen's shots as that would amount to having child porn. Probably have better luck finding some one who's did on one of the chan onion sites.

       I saw it happen with my own eyes... cause the two major accounts... a girl whose name I don't remember and 0_hour were both tagging @FBI in all the reports... I follow mostly FBI accounts on twitter so I was surprised to see people tagging @FBI cause that doesn't happen very often... (They were also tagging @Jack)... anyways, I was wondering what the flood of mentions were about so I clicked on one of the links out of the tons of them in my feed... The Twitter account that it linked to not only had kiddie porn posted inline as tweets, but even the banner across the top was gay kiddie porn... it was that blatant. The kid in the banner was maybe 12... looked to be hispanic... was photographed in a barn or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it was real assuming that if the one link I clicked on before I noped the fuck out of there was like all the others they were spamming to the FBI... I didn't verify any of the other ones... cause fuck that noise. In all my years on the internet that was literally only the 2nd time I've seen child porn... Ugh... that image is still burned into my brain.

       It happened. I was on line and followed 0hour at the time. They would find different Twitter users who had all kinds of images and links. I never clicked so I can't comment on the pages. I got the impression there were varying levels of depravity. It's also true people like 0hour were banned that night. He kept making new, similar names and continue. Then he'd be banned again.

       I do believe it has happened, but on the other side I'm still sceptical as people only are able to show the list that was created by 0 hour. Some say its still happening. Still can't wrap my head around it being so out in the open, MSM not reporting, Twitter ignoring it and not 1 (censored!!) screenshot... Not one person made a screenshot, copied it to paint and blacked out stuff and reuploaded it to the internet? In many countries they are not even THAT strict if you do something like that. Hell, a couple screencaps would not lead to persecution in the western European country I live in. Somehow its just weird that no one can actually proof that it happened - not 1 censored image, only a list of accounts and "I've seen it" Not trying to annoy you, it just still seems like something doesn't add up somehow.

       Last I heard about twittergate was when I was talking to Eclipse herself, she claimed that she was doing interviews with various people including Philip DeFranco and Breitbart, which never came to light (so a lie?)
      </p>
      <p>
       She seemed a little unstable, but Twittergate was definitely a real thing and she did a great thing exposing those scum.

       Holy shit!!! I was going to type a longer comment analogizing that moment of my life to the moment when Neo "wakes up" in The Matrix but didn't have time. Wow. Yes that is exactly how I felt but more horrified.

       Can confirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the woman's tweet about it within 10 minutes. I clicked through many, many of the accused accounts, and yeah, it was as bad as everyone says. I also did not save any screencap for the same reason nobody else did.
      </p>

       It's a goddamn tragedy that we no longer have a functioning FBI--this is their job, why the hell is it left to chaotic Internet vigilante mobs to compile evidence of some evil stuff going on in plain sight?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tangentially, if you want to hide secret messages in plain sight and guarantee nobody will search for it nor save a copy, hiding it in Steganographic CP images would be the only way to get away. Who knows, maybe that's why FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6 seem to be so moled up by Pedos and in on it helping them, because it's all some sick Number Station communication network that is too late to shut down now?
      </p>

       Btw 0hour is a total fraud basement dweller. (In the bad way.)
He steals content without attribution, he constantly lies (ZOMG BREAKING NEWS DEEP THROAT INSIDER SAYS MASS ARRESTS TOMMOROW).
      </p>
      <p>
       And who the hell still fly under the banner of Anonymous and flaunts a Fawks mask? Anonymous was always a convenient smoke screen for CIA to run Arab Spring coups with Plausible Deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when Sabu DDOS'd cia.gov? That shit was staged. CIA did it themselves to give Sabu credibility. The term for creating False Flags to make your informants not look like legit enemies is called "Sheep Dipping."
      </p>
      <p>
       No real Anon associates with that poisoned brand anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, 0hour is such a Larper that he might even be some bizarre shill paid by David Brock to discredit Pizzagate by flooding it with so much disinfo that any Normie will take once look and believe "these people are lunatics."
The only thing that makes me think he's just some loser is that he's too stupid to be effective at accomplishing Brock's agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know Team Clinton was personally stung by Pizzagate. That Hillary, Podesta and Reines all tweeted about it in fearful tones of denial demonstrates that the smear worked. That all the big MSM bobbleheads simultaneously blacked out discussing it at all, while viciously clamping down on censoring and banning and suspending anyone just asking about it also lends some credence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally got IP banned on 4chan for posting calm, reasoned, evidence-based questions about it back in the week of the Election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who gets nervous and can't open up their closets to show there are no Pizza Skeletons might be hiding something. Who does that? I don't know anyone who wouldn't immediately open the books up for inspection if millions of people accused them of being Pedos.

      <p>
       Where there's smoke there's fire... even if you had to help it along by starting the small fire in a ruse to trick everyone to flee the building, but then a really fire broke out because something-something-gate is real.

       Sometimes I wonder if social networks have a secret place that's hidden from the majority of the public that caters to this sort of thing for certain folks. Like  pay to play sort of thing..
