I don&#39;t judge and will listen to anything reasonable. (Apologies if this has been posted a million times before)</p>

<p>But my stance is, the technology to accomplish such a feat just wasn&#39;t there in 1969. Considering humans can just barely leave orbit now, it seems unfathomable.  No one has done it since, China,  Russia. Are people seriously that gullible? The moon having no atmosphere, the temperatures would be far too extreme for any space suits in the 1960&#39;s to adapt with. And that&#39;s assuming humans made it through the radiation belt, which I HIGHLY doubt. And yet people will fight to the death that it did happen. Like most things in life, if something seems too good to be true it probably is fake. If we still can&#39;t replicate a trip like that in 2017, don&#39;t you think it was easier to hoax in 1969 then actually pull off? Total bs in my opinion. Please prove me wrong though :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what claims are made about Chang&#39;e 3 in relation to the Apollo missions, but this is from Wikipedia regarding Chang&#39;e 2:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>China&#39;s second lunar probe, Chang&#39;e 2, which was launched in 2010 is capable of capturing lunar surface images with a resolution of up to 1.3 metres. It claims to have spotted traces of the Apollo landings, though the relevant imagery has not been publicly identified</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing that&#39;s wrong with them is that the moon hoax theory claims that the photographs were staged by NASA, shot on earth in a studio, not on the moon. The anomalies with the photos are a main reason people began doubting NASA&#39;s claims in the first place, as people began to notice elements like shadows going in different directions, illuminated astronauts that were standing in shadows and should have been dark, the lack of blast crater beneath the lander, and many more.</p>

<p>So for someone who already thinks NASA is full of b.s., one more image from that same government agency isn&#39;t going to be very convincing. </p>

<p>But even looking at the images themselves, they don&#39;t really show anything. They&#39;re indiscernible and contain no detail. The LRO was said to orbit about 70 miles above the moon and this is all we got, which seems very disappointing. Even what are said to be tire tracks in the photos raise more questions, because some of the original Apollo photos show the lunar rover with no tracks in front of or behind it. </p>

And I believe space suits in today&#39;s day and age DO have the technology to withstand the extremes, but you didn&#39;t see volcanologists walking inside volcanos in foil suits in the 60&#39;s. So for them to pull it off on their first try is a little hard to imagine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Nazis started the space race really with the first long range liquid fueled rockets. </p>

<p>After WWII the US and Soviets picked up the German scientists who made rocket attacks possible. The V2 developed by the Nazis in 1942 could have reached space but instead they pointed them at London. </p>

<p>Sputnik 1 launched in 1957 and marked the start of the space race proper, strategic military advantage was desired and this new frontier was the prize. Dominance of space would mean the ability to reign down nuclear weapons on the enemy, right? </p>

<p>The Apollo mission consumed around 4% of the federal budget at its peak</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File%3ANASA_budget_linegraph_BH.PNG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File%3ANASA_budget_linegraph_BH.PNG</a></p>

<p>In today&#39;s money Apollo cost around $125 Billion with an additional $80 billion for production of the lander and  Saturn IV. </p>

<p>Technology has exponentially improved in the decades following but there is not the same incentive to visit the moon as there was when the technology which made it possible was new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were casualties. And near misses like Apollo 13.</p>

<p>The mission avoided major radiation zones and detectors on board measured less than 3 rads for the 3 days trip to the moon. A lethal dose is 300 rads/hr.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important discoveries made in space was reported by the very first American satellite, Explorer 1, in 1958. It was revealed that several huge layers of radiation particles are trapped by Earth&#39;s magnetic field, called the Van Allen radiation belts. This discovery came as a considerable shock as here was a previously unknown but very real peril, which made certain regions of space uninhabitable without a prohibitive weight of shielding. However, it was soon realized that the VARB represented an obstacle to be bypassed, not a complete roadblock. By choosing suitable orbits it was possible to avoid the most intense levels of radiation; and to outward-bound spacecraft the belts were no serious menace because the vehicles passed through them swiftly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going to bed but that definitely looks like a very interesting read. And for the record. I&#39;ve watched a Neil Degrasse Tyson interview where he states how there is satellite images from different countries of foot prints on the moon where said landing occurred and it&#39;s dumb to think otherwise. I respect him and his opinions greatly. There&#39;s just a part of me that can&#39;t get over the primitive technology compared to today, and places especially like Russia or China have never attempted it. It just seems to me like it would be a suicide mission, if one little thing went wrong it could be catastrophic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All great points!! </p>

<p>There&#39;s another that I find intriguing.</p>

<p>If you watch an ISS mission on youtube the EVAs are so incredibly boring, but this is good because it means they are taking the utmost care and precision undertaking even the simplest of tasks. It clearly illustrates how dangerous the vacuum of space is and how careful they have to be to ensure nothing goes wrong.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the Apollo landings.  They&#39;re singing songs, kicking rocks, falling over, playing golf, jumping around and ruining (expensive) experiments.
If they truly were in the vacuum of space and one puncture to a suit would mean one or both of them wouldn&#39;t be returning home, I doubt this is the kind of behaviour they&#39;d be participating in.</p>

<p>People will say, oh they were so thrilled to be on the moon, or that&#39;s how they were in those days ... rubbish.
It it meant the entire mission would fail and the president would have to report the loss of the crew, there is no way they&#39;d have taken those risks.</p>

<p>They&#39;d have taken tentative, carefully considered steps and actions just like the ISS crew does nearly 50 years later only a few hundred miles above us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, just wanted to add that the people telling you that there&#39;s no reason to go &quot;back&quot; to the moon, well every space agency including NASA and Russia&#39;s Roscosmls disagrees and that&#39;s the dumbest concept anyone could ever try to get another person to believe. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to go back but there was a reason to go like ten times in a row back then? Such a pathetic logical failure that also directly contradicts what talking heads from NASA and elsewhere are saying to this day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the time the argument is &quot;Why <strong>haven&#39;t</strong> we been there again?&quot;. And the answer to that is, NASA had to cut funding from the frankly ludicrous spending during the &#39;60s, which resulted in von Brauns unrealistic plans being set aside, and the Shuttle took form through Air Force support. NASA would then spend the next 30 years banging their head against a wall.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I know very little of Roscosmos, but they dropped their unfeasible lunar plans either just before of just after NASA made it. They would continue work on Salyut and LEO stuff.</p>

<p>For some reason, every space program says &quot;We want back to the Moon&quot;. NASA keeps pushing Orion, which is a dead end project, which is somehow going to build lunar outposts and stage us to Mars in 20-30 years, despite NASA in total having 1/8 the budget of Apollo. It smells of bureaucratic mess and contractors being contractors to me. Nothing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)#Orion_Program_mission_schedule">here</a> says jack shit about a Moon landing nor a Mars landing. Those are just ideas floated for the future, with no hardware in development.</p>

<p>Roscosmos has even less budget and bolder ambitions, but they don&#39;t even have a rocket or hardware to point to. Don&#39;t know why so many news sites keep saying that they&#39;ll be back to the Moon within 12 years.</p>

<p>The same goes for Elon Musk&#39;s plan for Mars colonization: Where&#39;s the plan, where&#39;s the budget? Building the biggest rocket in history and have it reusable?</p>

<p>A lunar return plan becomes worth considering when they have a solid plan and a reason: Testing hardware for Mars, mining Helium-3 etc. Constellation planned to use the Moon for the former, but that eventually got scrapped since, again, too expensive and nobody saw the point. Best bet for lunar return is probably EM-1, which I think will fly. Second best is probably China and their plans, but I believe they will get cancelled as soon as they see a pricetag.</p>

<p>Considering humans can just barely leave orbit now, it seems unfathomable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not wanting to, and not being able to, are not the same thing. The expense of the moon missions was enormous. Justifying that expense was, and is, the difficult part.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the temperatures would be far too extreme for any space suits in the 1960&#39;s to adapt with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you say. Can you back that up with an argument as to <em>why</em> it would be impossible?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that&#39;s assuming humans made it through the radiation belt, which I HIGHLY doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the part that gets me... you believe there is a radiation belt because the scientists told you there was, but you don&#39;t believe the scientists when they tell you it is possible to pass through that belt in relative safety by keeping the exposure time to a minimum.</p>

<p>Why? Why do you only believe <em>some</em> of what they tell you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we still can&#39;t replicate a trip like that in 2017</p>

<p>Who said we can&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of how temperature works in space. Radiation,  so if you&#39;re standing in sunlight it gets really hot, and if you&#39;re not, it gets really cold. Temperature systems installed  in space suits compensate for this. Again as I said before,  the moon has no atmosphere.  And in 1969, the technology for needed temperature systems in said space suits more than likely was not actually there. Think about your vehicle you drive now. If it&#39;s newer, the heating and cooling systems work significantly better than they did in vehicles 10 years prior. What&#39;s this have to do with anything? Human life will probably not be in jeopardy if your car on earth doesn&#39;t heat up fast enough on a cold day. Completely different story for a space suit on the moon. Do you understand? </p>

<p>So this all hinges on your incredulity? You say it was &quot;more than likely not actually not there&quot; based on nothing.</p>

<p>Absolutely nothing.  What kind of trash analogy is that?</p>

<p>Technically nothing is out of the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>Correct. </p>

<p>The mission was complete and researche went in other directions (shuttle, space station etc)</p>
