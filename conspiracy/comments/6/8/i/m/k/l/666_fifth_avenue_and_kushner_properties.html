        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Jared Kushner (son in law of D.Trump, the president) bought 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City, for a record breaking 1.8 Billion dollars. Most paid for a single building in Manhattan.

<p>They plan on renovating it for an even more record breaking 12 billion dollars. According to Google, it would be the second most expensive building ever built.

<p>The history of the 666 Fifth Avenue building was first built by Tishman Realty and Construction. It was sold and resold a few times before being sold by Tishman Speyer,a branch/break off of Tishman Realty &amp; Construction to Kushner Properties.</p>

<p>Notable Tishman Buildings: One World Trade Center/Freedom Tower, Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center

<p>Robert Tishman is also a member of the oldest Cornell Uni secret society, Sphinx Head. It is &quot;of the nature of Skull and Bones&quot;.

<p>I had never heard of this society before but influential people in its ranks and one class even built an Egyptian tomb for their club house, which was later purchased by Carl Sagan (?)

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;.....From 666 Fifth Ave., the Tishman family went on to be &quot;ranked #1 as largest builder of commercial buildings in the nation&quot; by 1968. <em>Among the Tilman&#39;s high-profile construction projects are Disney&#39;s EPCOT Center, Madison Square Gardens, Chicago&#39;s Hancock Center, Morgan Stanley International European headquarters, and ... the World Trade Center in 1972 and even the WTC building 7 in 1987.</em> Moreover, the design for the &quot;Freedom Tower&quot; was submitted by the Tishman Corp. and they are managing construction on the project:</p>

<p>&#39;Just as Tishman was the only firm with the knowledge and technical skill to accomplish the Herculean task of constructing the original twin towers of the World Trade Center thirty years ago, we have once again been selected to manage a monumental project. When completed, the Freedom Tower will be the tallest building in the world...&quot;</p>

<p>Side note:  score one more for the crappy (intentionally?) design of Reddit that all of this info has been posted before, dozens of times, on this sub.
