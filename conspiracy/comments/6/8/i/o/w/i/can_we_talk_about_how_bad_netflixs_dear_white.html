        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(It seems in my efforts to make it known that how I felt about this show, and how I felt about race, I apparently offended some people. I am biracial, and I&#39;m not going to pretend I like black people or white people, I like people. I my efforts to bring people together by trying to destroy the word &quot;race&quot;, I merely divided even more.)</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;d like to state that first off, race is a lie meant to divide us. I am biracial, I&#39;ve never identified with the white population or black population, I am who I am. This show makes white people out to be, literally evil devils. Even the white people in the show who try to help the blacks are made out to be uninformed idiots. This show is meant to divide. If not for the sometimes poor writing, I believe this show is worst than 13 reasons why. This is race war propaganda that panders to black people. </p>

<p>Edit: never expected this to get this big. Just so you know where I stand, I am against racism, but only because the world we live in makes its that way. People give to much power to labels, which is also a theme to the show. If you are offended because I said race isn&#39;t real, well I  feel sorry for you. There is no science behind race, it&#39;s just a label. Gay, straight, Muslim, we are all dumb humans regardless. Example of a dumb human: people who still think race is a real concept.  Still stand behind my comments. And I&#39;ll be against racism for as long as race exists. </p>

<p>Edit: second edit, I seem to see two camps. The people who believe race is still a thing and people who don&#39;t. But there also seems to be a camp of people are slightly racist. Let me be clear, do not promote your backwards beliefs. The original conspiracy was that this show was being used as race war propaganda for anyone wanting to know. </p>

<p>Well duh, race only ever existed because of geographic isolation. With that completely done away with it&#39;s only a matter of time. Sure, cultural isolation can slow it down, but it cannot bring it to a halt. </p>

<p>What is your definition of often? When was the last time? Maybe you should watch some videos of officers being shot just doing basic things like traffic stops and you might understand what kind of pressure they face on a daily basis so of course there will be some unfortunate things happen when you have as many encounters between regular people and criminals as the police do every day. Unarmed white people get shot too as do other groups. </p>

<p>Police work is dangerous. Cops get killed in traffic stops sometimes too. But the danger is part of the job and they know that. Cops are potentially risking their lives on every encounter, but regular citizens should NOT be forced to fear for their life every time they encounter a cop when they have no bad intentions just because &quot;it looked like he was reaching&quot; or &quot;his wallet looked like a gun&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly. theres a reason the stats only get reported broken down so far.  If you critically think about it though...ok so if african americans are 13 percent of the population and responsible for aprox 50 percent of the violent crime, well, from working in a state prison for 5 years with over 4000 inmates that its the young black males committing most of these.  The &quot;young bucks&quot;  nowadays have no respect for the old gang codes of honor, or the oldheads inside who try to guide these dudes.</p>

<p>A black person is a citizen with rights no different from a white person. No one should be treated as a threat if they don&#39;t show they are. No one, black or white, should have to risk their life in a police encounter when they&#39;re not trying to cause violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some do come from those environments and do great things in life. You&#39;re missing my point, which is that they don&#39;t disproportionately commit crimes when the data is stratified by socioeconomic status. Reasons for that are varied, from getting into crime via actual desperation for money, to single mothers working 3 jobs not able to look after their kids, to the school-to-prison pipeline which disproportionately affects black children as they statistically face harsher punishments in schools for the same offenses as white children. Black people aren&#39;t naturally just violent. You&#39;re making things up by your assumptions rather than research. </p>

<p>Maybe? The question was &quot;<strong>Are black people naturally inclined towards crime?</strong>, and I provided a statistic from the NYPD that state that blacks commit more crimes. Are blacks more likely to be poor, too? Sure. But there&#39;s poor whites (and poor Asians, poor Indians, etc.) out there who aren&#39;t committing anywhere near the amount of crimes as blacks. Why&#39;s that? <strong>Hmmm</strong>. Why do blacks commit more crime than any other race regardless of income bracket?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you stratify the data by poverty, the gap narrows significantly. Poverty is a bigger indicator of crime than race itself. But there is still a gap, you&#39;re right. And this is where we bring it into the context I&#39;m talking about. From highly-documented discrimination in schools and courts to difficulties in finding work. There is no evidence beyond correlations that they&#39;re just naturally violent, and tons of evidence that there are social issues creating that correlation. </p>

<p>And then you could say, of course, regardless of the reasons behind it, is a black man more likely to be a criminal? Statistically, yes.

<p>Should we assume from these statistics that a random white person is more likely to be carrying illegal weapons or drugs than a random black person? By your logic, yes.

<p>Okay, so you&#39;re one of those who thinks every black man who commits a crime was only doing it because the white man forced him to, right? You know what causes crime? <strong>The people who commit crime.</strong> No matter your hand in life, you have a <strong>choice</strong> to live a life of crime or an upright life. If both me and my friend - who both grew up poor in a predominantly black neighbor, with crime going on all around us - if the two of us can grow up and not end up in prison, <strong>why&#39;s that</strong>?

<p>No</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying a combination of factors in our culture, caused by a lot of things (not just white people) but still contributed to by white people and our histories, created a system in which black people are more likely to commit crimes. We still have free will, but we are also still influenced and molded by our environments and things that take place in our lives.

<p>This is always said like it&#39;s just ok, but when I watch people in support of illegal immigrants, they always mention some bs (imo) stat about how the crime rate of illegal immigrants is much lower than that of American citizens.

<p>I think this should be obvious, but it mostly has to do with their history in America.

<p>They are not that different in mobility compared to other racial counterparts at that income.

This stems from issues I talked about elsewhere in this thread (all highly-documented), from racial discrimination in disciplinary actions during schooling, to phenomena like stereotype threat, to discrimination in the job market (which I&#39;ve witnessed firsthand in my field). The whole &quot;gang and drug culture&quot; issue is a cop out that&#39;s not the root of the problem, and in many places is slowly fading away while problems of poverty remain the same. </p>

<p>People of low socio-economic statuses commit crimes at a much stronger rate than blacks do compared to whites. Blacks are just much more likely to be in those lower socioeconomic pools. Otherwise you should admit that white people are just more greedy because they create more ponzi schemes than black people. A black person is an equal citizen to everyone else, and it&#39;s unfortunate that a black person with good intentions will be initially perceived as more of a threat than a white person with bad intentions. </p>

<p>Honestly, they went <em>so</em> damn far with it that I&#39;m leaning towards their intentions being more satirical than anything else. </p>

<p>Call me naive for this, but I think if more shows would try to push the envelopes like that in (what seemed to me anyway) a <em>heavily</em> tongue-in-cheek manner, maybe people could get used to it and stop getting so fucking insane over anything racially-based. </p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not trying to shill or be a &#39;concern troll&#39; (Im not even completely sure exactly what that means tbh), these are my honest thoughts after watching it.</p>

<p>For once, they finally strike back at us. Look at the characterizations of black people in the large majority of Hollywood shit; urban thugs, rappers, etc..</p>

<p>One line I particularly liked early on (1st episode maybe?) was when Black Dude said to White Dude (I cant remember their names now, my bad) &quot;I almost should hit you for <em>thinking</em> I&#39;d hit you&quot;, after white guy professed to &quot;understand how they felt&quot; about the blackface party.</p>

<p>I dunno what to say, maybe I&#39;m just the weird one, but I just feel like people are reading too much into this and missing the point. A huge point of the show was mocking how her damn radio show went too far.</p>

<p>Anyway, agree to disagree and all that, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It tries so hard to stroke anger out of the viewer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the show covers different views on serious topics. The security guard almost shooting Reggie, for instance; that&#39;s upsetting, but it really happens, so there&#39;s no reason for them not to show it. In a perfect world, race wouldn&#39;t be a thing, but race is something that does affect events, as I said in my original answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh, sure, all races are the same as living, breathing, thinking humans (despite a few things that affect only our personal health, and not others, such as more melanin in darker skin). So, in a perfect society, race isn&#39;t really...&quot;a thing,&quot; per se, because it&#39;s not something that we should care about.
But, it&#39;s not &quot;dumb&quot; to consider race to be a thing, and start a discussion on it. Because, despite there being no science behind it, it&#39;s something that has an impact on the world. Race is why we had slavery, why we have the KKK, why we&#39;ve BLM(Regardless of your opinion on BLM, it is a movement started because of race-relations).</p>

<p>And to say it doesn&#39;t exist is like saying money has no value.
Yeah, money has no value, except for the value that we place on it in our society, so it&#39;s technically a true statement in that regard. But money has an effect on things in our society, so to say, &quot;Example of a dumb human: people who think money has value,&quot; is pretty, well, one-sided. Because it&#39;s not dumb to care about/acknowledge/believe in something that has an effect on our society, despite how objectively real it is or not.
\=================================</p>

<p>The black characters in the show are so hostile to white people, and for no reason sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, the Black characters were rude toward Gabe, and...Reggie and that guy started an argument at the party. That&#39;s about all I remember from them being directly &quot;hostile&quot; toward any White people in the show; but please correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Also, the show never said it was okay; it was very clear that it was wrong for them to alienate Gabe so often (He ultimately ends up breaking up with Sam, over the Reggie thing; and Reggie was a complete jerk about it, likely at least partly because of race). And the fight at the party never gets an official commentary over who was right or wrong; it gets interrupted by the whole Reggie situation; it&#39;s likely just  a plot device. But I refer, again, to my original answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...] the show does not condone [their disdain toward White Gabe], it gives commentary on it. [The message of the show] is not painted as a &quot;Black people good, White people bad&quot; issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>\=================================</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this shows response to this issue is literally fighting white people about it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Err, also, as I stated in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68iowi/can_we_talk_about_how_bad_netflixs_dear_white/dgzhjrh/">my other comment</a> (Which you may have actually downvoted without giving much of a reason, I dunno), the show isn&#39;t saying we should be hostile to White people. The show actually shows -- through Gabe -- that we should not alienate White people just because they are White; that&#39;s just as racist as the reverse happening.</p>

<p>From my original response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Gabe is honestly one of the most important parts of the show. Because he&#39;s not just the token &quot;ignorant White boy.&quot; He represents how a lot of White people feel about today&#39;s discussion on racism in America. In &quot;his&quot; episode, in one of the first scenes, it talks about how he feels that it&#39;s unfair that he has a big &quot;racist&quot; label on him, just for being a White male. And how he feels pressured into agreeing with Sam all the time, just so that he&#39;s not called a racist, even though he&#39;s legitimately not a racist. He wants to tell Sam, and the other girl, that she didn&#39;t fail the test because she&#39;s Black, but because she simply didn&#39;t do as well on the test; but he just has to sit, and agree with them.
We see that Gabe is not a bad guy -- he&#39;s actually a really nice, cool guy -- but he&#39;s unfairly thrown into that category of &quot;bad,&quot; just because of his race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, it&#39;d be cool if you&#39;d respond to this with an actual rebuttal if you&#39;re going to downvote it. ^.^</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally almost every incident you listed was almost every time someone black talked to someone white (when it was important). Almost every antagonist ( the paschiet writter, the donator to the college, the president) was white and shown to be racist or ignorant to the point that the black characters would scoff at them, talk to someone about how shitty they are or something petty. EVEN GABE, the one that tried to help them the whole time, was half met with friction and sometimes accepted and even when he was accepted they talked about how he was white and joked or implied that he doesn&#39;t know shit about what they are doing (shown in Gabes episode)</p>

mr. &quot;I&#39;m with the majority of white folk!&quot; <em>cough</em> sheeple much.. <em>cough</em></p>

<p>Did you even watch the trailer?? In the first minute Sam is already being called live on the radio by a listener who calls the title &quot;Dear White People&quot; unnecessarily offensive, she thinks he MUST be white and, against her expectations, he tells her he is of color.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to elaborate on why this tells you that the show is baiting you with it&#39;s title. But it literaly takes 30 seconds to watch and should take another 30 seconds of brainpower to figure that out. </p>

<p>If your seriously looking for a reason to watch; watch this show because it confronts you and messes around with your emotions about the current state of racism, giving you different interesting and realistic perspectives. All of that in a nice short format.</p>

<p>And bro, nobody is telling you to watch the show. If your appetite demands something more easy to consume, Lost might be more up your alley, I hear it&#39;s one of those fantastic shows out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the fact that I have a different perspective than you does not by definition mean that I would have no ability to read between the lines.</p>

<p>The fact that you seem to respond so emotionally to this makes me question if in your heart you truly believe there is value to the point I made, but that&#39;s for you to know, not me.</p>

<p>I agree that the show portrays that they cause more issues than solutions, but I also find that the show portrays it as both a noble and necessary goal.</p>

<p>The show invites us to identify with samantha white and feel sorry for her as she exposes racism to an exaggerated degree. We&#39;re taken along in her life and with many closeups are invited to empathize with her anger and pain.</p>

<p>And the source of that anger and pain? Injust racial treatment by established white structures (even though in reality those very &quot;white&quot; structures are in reality currently more jewish than white if you look into it).</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s also the mentioning of current events where one side of the story is mentioned, but not the other. Artistic license, sure, but if you&#39;re going to set a story in say, communist china and you portray the struggle of mao without mentioning the deaths, or you&#39;d make a story about ahmed the clock maker and you don&#39;t mention that he continually disobeyed teachers and refused to talk even to police until they arrested him, then you&#39;re producing propaganda by only showing one side of a story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took the lack of telling the other side of the story as telling all there is to tell...</p>

<p>The white people in the show are hardly racist.. There is one racist party, one racist cop and a racist couple that is powerplaying the university... Those are the examples of constitutional racism.</p>

<p>On the other hand we see a Pastiche leader who would actually like to work together with Sam, a friend of Reggie who is not allowed to sing along with a song without bad intent and Gabe who is going out of his way to be a good dude cause he likes a girl...</p>

<p>I think the show is very conscious about how they are portaying all characters involved and is hardly making Sam&#39;s cause look noble. Maybe from her perspective but imo it came across as her having good intentions but misguided. Which she seems to recognise in the final chapter as she loses Gabe and her rally was crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(I hope not to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but...) </p>

<p>Please, watch the freaking show before complaining about it. x) The title is made to be &quot;problematic.&quot; The show honestly isn&#39;t what you think it&#39;s about. Many people say, &quot;If it were &#39;Dear Black People,&#39; we&#39;d see a ton of controversy!&quot; </p>

<p>Well, firstly, we already see a lot of controversy with the White people title. So hopefully those people are happy that so many people are upset over a title, without even watching the show.</p>

<p>Secondly, if a show was called &quot;Dear Black People,&quot; just for the sake of being provocative, I -- a Black person -- would still watch the show before voicing much of an opinion on it...because you shouldn&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover. </p>

<p>The purpose of the title is to spark a reaction. When I saw that title, I thought, &quot;That&#39;s a pretty bold title. I have to watch that, to see what they&#39;re talking about, exactly, with that title.&quot; And, as someone who <em>has actually watched the show,</em> I can confirm that the title isn&#39;t an accurate depiction of the whole show. It&#39;s the name of Sam&#39;s (one of the character&#39;s) radio show. People in the show actually call the title of the radioshow, and radioshow itself, racist. (People who have actually listened to the radio show, of course. ;P)</p>

<p>And...the title is also likely made that way to weed out people who, like you, develop an opinion on the show without watching it. Because those people will likely say things like,&quot;I didn&#39;t even watch the show, but the title alone shows me that this show is racist!&quot; They, without realizing it, remove any validity from their argument, so it&#39;s easier to ignore those people, and debate with those who have actually seen the show.</p>

<p>The show honestly doesn&#39;t have one &quot;agenda,&quot; or message. It has many characters, all of which have flaws, all of which have opinions on race. You will likely agree with some of those characters, disagree with others, but other than a few obviously racist things that were in the show, the show doesn&#39;t give a clear-cut answer on who&#39;s &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; on the issues presented. It moreso shows how these answers are <em>not</em> so clear-cut. One of the main antagonists is a Black character, in fact.</p>

<p>And, I&#39;ve been ranting about Gabe in this comment section for ages, but he&#39;s an important part of the show; he&#39;s a White character, and no, he&#39;s not a racist. I guess you are not going to watch the show, so I&#39;ll just paste an excerpt from my other answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In reality, the show actually shows a variation of beliefs and viewpoints, all based around the idea of racial tensions. For instance, in the first episode, we see that Sam is trying to hide the fact that she&#39;s dating a White guy, from her friends, simply because he&#39;s White. She gets mad at him when he simply acknowledges their relationship on social media, she lets him be alienated by her friends, and when he gets upset at their racism toward him, she tries to turn the tables by saying something like, &quot;Oh, you didn&#39;t feel part of the group for five minutes. That&#39;s how I feel everyday on this campus!&quot;</p>

<p>And at that point, there were probably many people agreeing with Sam that &quot;that White boy should just suck it up, because &#39;privilege&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p>But then, Gabe actually fires back with something along the lines of, &quot;Yeah, society sucks! But I&#39;d never let my friends alienate you like that.&quot; And that&#39;s an important social commentary, on the double-standard that we have for racism.</p>

<p>In fact, Gabe is honestly one of the most important parts of the show. Because he&#39;s not just the token &quot;ignorant White boy.&quot; He represents how a lot of White people feel about today&#39;s discussion on racism in America. In &quot;his&quot; episode, in one of the first scenes, it talks about how he feels that it&#39;s unfair that he has a big &quot;racist&quot; label on him, just for being a White male. And how he feels pressured into agreeing with Sam all the time, just so that he&#39;s not called a racist, even though he&#39;s legitimately not a racist. He wants to tell Sam, and the other girl, that she didn&#39;t fail the test because she&#39;s Black, but because she simply didn&#39;t do as well on the test; but he just has to sit, and agree with them.</p>

<p>We see that Gabe is not a bad guy -- he&#39;s actually a really nice, cool guy -- but he&#39;s unfairly thrown into that category of &quot;bad,&quot; just because of his race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows different experiences and issues, in order to maybe change some people&#39;s opinions, regardless of their race. </p>

<p>lol woah thre m8. I&#39;m not going to...expletive off because you typed so. x) Let&#39;s try and stay civil, instead of degenerating into baseless insults like that. :) Let&#39;s try that, friend. n_n</p>

<p>Anyway, as someone else typed, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>...this is a natural reaction, and one that goes very deep. Humans, and animals ftm, are hyper-specialized to detect patterns, and if all your interactions with people who look a particular way are negative, you will inevitably generalize. From personal experience, the only way to counteract that is by having positive experiences with people who look that certain way... no amount of lecturing or training can substitute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to which I responded with basically this: <em>That is why</em> one of the best way to help stop racism should be to show other people&#39;s experiences/views about it...so that maybe some people&#39;s opinions can be changed, and understanding can be met. Instead of saying, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be racist because it&#39;s bad,&quot; (And don&#39;t get me wrong, it is bad to be racist; but a racist won&#39;t really listen to you if you just tell them this) it says, &quot;You should not be racist/exclusive/arrogant, as your opinion, and experience, is not the only right one.&quot; </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t try to perpetuate a race-war (Although it surely will, with some people; but those are generally the people who want a race-war anyway); it tries to spark <em>understanding</em> between different people with different views, experiences and backgrounds.</p>

<p>Hopefully all that made some sense, and I worded everything correctly...as I sometimes realize I haven&#39;t explained things well enough. x)  <sup>But</sup> <sup>I</sup> <sup>don&#39;t</sup> <sup>really</sup> <sup>know</sup> <sup>why</sup> <sup>I&#39;m</sup> <sup>typing</sup> <sup>about</sup> <sup>that.</sup> T_T</p>

<p>But, the part of your response I&#39;m most interested in is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, if you refuse to watch the show... <strong>why are you going to tell me what it&#39;s about</strong>? x) I honestly have more legitimacy when debating the issue, than you do, and it doesn&#39;t actually make much sense for me to respond to you with a legitimate answer. And that&#39;s not a baseless insult; that&#39;s true, because I know more about the issue than you do. You&#39;re, therefore, just arguing about things you don&#39;t even understand. The show is made up of, what, ten thirty minute episodes. x) It&#39;s only five hours, and it&#39;s a show you can watch at any time. x) And if you&#39;d just watch it, we could respectfully disagree on the show, if neither of us convinced the other. But because your uninformed opinion fits the majority in this thread, you really have no conviction to. Actually, <strong>the OP of this thread</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68iowi/can_we_talk_about_how_bad_netflixs_dear_white/dgzjzv3/?context=3">actually agrees with me</a>, and types:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you have to watch all of it before you can give a criticism of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The show doesn&#39;t just take one message, and constantly force that on you; it does quite the opposite. It shows many diverse opinions and experiences; People are just mad at the title, and that it revolves around a mostly Black cast. But I&#39;ll state it again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has many characters, all of which have flaws, all of which have opinions on race. You will likely agree with some of those characters, disagree with others, but other than a few obviously racist things that were in the show, the show doesn&#39;t give a clear-cut answer on who&#39;s &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; on the issues presented. It moreso shows how this issue is <em>not</em> so clear-cut. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you really don&#39;t want to watch the show, don&#39;t watch it. But it&#39;s really...not your place, exactly -- or a smart move -- to tell those who have watched the show...what the show is about...and then to expect your opinion to be respected. x) </p>

<p>Okay, firstly, the people <em>I</em> &quot;need&quot;? lolok because im black i need &#39;complacent white allies&#39; to tell me I&#39;m right all the time? x) If that&#39;s what you think of all Black people, it&#39;s no wonder you won&#39;t watch the show, my dude. n_n </p>

<p>But, friend, should I just call anyone who defends an injustice toward a certain race a &quot;complacent &lt;whatever race&gt; ally&quot;? x) Look, if it&#39;s going to alienate people who just fake that they dislike racism, and are those &quot;complacent X allies,&quot; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal if those people are &quot;alienated,&quot; as they&#39;re just faking it anyway... x) However, the show doesn&#39;t strive to alienate anyone, honestly. It just wants you to question your own beliefs and opinions, just as I did when I watched the show. x) And guess what, my dude: after watching the show, I don&#39;t hate White people!!!! :O The show actually shows that Black people can be just as &quot;bad&quot; as White people, or anyone, really.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like you&#39;re just putting any White person who believes that racism exists, in an overgeneralized category there. o.o Having a different viewpoint from you doesn&#39;t make someone a &quot;complacent White ally.&quot; The show actually touches on the topic of people who actually are the &quot;complacent White ally&quot; type, which I&#39;ve already mentioned.</p>

<p>Sure, and I respect Morgan Freeman for that, but DWP isn&#39;t fighting against that. It&#39;s acknowledging race relations, yes, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s starting a &quot;race war.&quot; Race relations are a thing that exist, x), and, as that is a serious topic, it should be addressed. You, again, haven&#39;t seen the show, so you wouldn&#39;t know that, of course. x) So I&#39;m just going to let you know, again: DWP is trying to spark <em>understanding,</em> not these &quot;race-wars&quot; you keep going on about. </p>

<p>Again, not watching something because you don&#39;t like the title...is, well, your decision. It&#39;s not a decision I think is wise. The title is, in fact, what made me watch the show in the first place. Because, I thought, &quot;&#39;Dear White People&#39;? This sounds like the show is going to support dissing White people for everything.&quot; But I didn&#39;t go on Reddit, and type about my strong opinion on the show, as <em>I know I didn&#39;t have a valid opinion at the time, as the show hadn&#39;t even come out, so I couldn&#39;t have watched it.</em> As I typed before (More effectively worded this time, though ^^&#39;):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I deliberately made sure watch the show as soon as I saw that it was on Netflix (so I binge-watched it a day after it came out), so that I had NO outside opinion, or bias, on the show. And from that, I didn&#39;t get a specific anti-White agenda from it, as some people say it has. After finishing the whole show, I didn&#39;t even think most other people would think that it had that agenda. o.o There are antagonist White characters, sure, but pretty much the main antagonist, is Black. The show is pretty neutral, in the sense that it rarely ever says, &quot;This is right, this is wrong,&quot; thought it does depict some events that are very obviously wrong, and racist. But the show is neutral, in the sense that it doesn&#39;t just blame White people for racism. It shows that racism is a thing, and depicts certain events regarding the issue; it doesn&#39;t say that one specific group is responsible for racism, or that one specific group is bad. Sam and Reggie (The two more extreme characters) say things like that, but the show doesn&#39;t constantly validate their opinions. The whole cast of characters (even, and especially, the Black characters) have different opinions and views on race and racism, as you&#39;ll see.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll finish my response to that with another earlier one of my countless answers on this thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another perfectly valid [approach to the issue of race] is trying to show different perspectives on the issue, like the show does. x) Look, if we could just snap our fingers and have everyone &quot;act as if it doesn&#39;t exist,&quot; that&#39;d be great, in the sense that it would destroy racism...but it&#39;s not that simple. x) That&#39;s not practical. If we want to do that, we&#39;d have to destroy tons of books, delete tons of media, stop talking about certain parts of history, stop telling certain jokes (such as those of Dave Chapelle), etc.</p>

<p>Once someone experiences racism, they realize race does, in fact, exist as a thing in our society. It&#39;s like a &quot;red pill&quot;; it can be hard to just &quot;forget race exists,&quot; because that person has experienced discrimination for it, firsthand, because there will still be racism. And you can&#39;t really blame them for not forgetting.</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;d be great if we didn&#39;t let something as insignificant as race affect us so negatively, just because of skin. Like, I doubt you consciously think about the race of your friends, or family, or some random person you run into...we&#39;re &quot;colorblind&quot; in our most casual and friendly interaction, fortunately. But we can&#39;t just erase race from our society so easily, unless we were blind and deaf. And just &quot;not talking about it&quot; wouldn&#39;t necessarily erase racists -- who won&#39;t stop talking about it anyway -- it&#39;d just make it impossible for us to call them out on it, allowing them to continue to be racist. You can&#39;t even try to get everyone to stop using the word &quot;race,&quot; without acknowledging it yourself.</p>

<p>I think one of the messages of the show is that race/racism now does, unfortunately, exist...but we should not let it divide us as races. Her show name, &quot;Dear White People,&quot; is very generalized, toward all White people. Which is a bad example for how we should honestly be about such an issue. And I&#39;m willing to claim that it is satire, especially because of the one caller who called in, calling out the show. He even said that his race isn&#39;t important, when she asked him his race; and when she started ranting to him about &quot;his &#39;White privilege,&#39;&quot; for simply calling out the show&#39;s name for being racist, he let her know that he was, in fact Black.</p>

<p>Basically, one of the big problems of race is that people will blame whole ethnicities for a few individuals&#39; actions. And that&#39;s never okay, obviously. I&#39;m not going to try to exclude someone White from joining in a conversation about it, just because of the fact that they are White. That doesn&#39;t mean that we shouldn&#39;t have a discussion about racism; it means that we shouldn&#39;t generalize, as that is racism in and of itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not wrong for the show to start a discussion about an issue. x)</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s where you kind of...drift off, my dude. x) You can&#39;t call the show &quot;racist garbage&quot; if you haven&#39;t watched it. Because you don&#39;t know what the show&#39;s about. Even if you think you know what it&#39;s about, because of your opinion on the creators, you just don&#39;t, because you haven&#39;t watched the show. So sure, give your opinions on the creators, if you know enough about them, and have an <em>informed</em> opinion. But you <em>don&#39;t</em> have an informed opinion on the show. </p>

<p>So while I can&#39;t ban you from giving your <strong>baseless</strong> opinion, I can let you know: You should actually see a show before giving your opinion on it. n_n There&#39;s no dancing around that, like you&#39;ve been trying to do, it seems. x) Your opinion simply has no validity, as your opinion on the show doesn&#39;t matter at all, as you <em>haven&#39;t watched the show.</em> x) And this isn&#39;t me making up rules; it&#39;s just an unspoken rule as to how basic constructive argument works.</p>

<p>Okay, I&#39;ve just re-looked into it, and the guy you&#39;re referring to (Jack Moore) doesn&#39;t even seem to be the main writer of the show.  -.- The <em>writer/director of the SHOW AND MOVIE</em> is Justin Simien.  I think you&#39;re just reading articles against the show??? The guy you&#39;re referring to didn&#39;t even jump onto the thing until the show.

<p>Read through all your posts about the show and I&#39;ve been convinced to give it a chance, I wish the kneejerk reaction wasn&#39;t so severe, but I guess that&#39;s somewhat to be expected with a show that&#39;s clearly trying to create controversy. I highlighted this edit because you make a good point, Walt Disney was an anti-semite, a ton of people enjoy his cartoons despite this, or without ever knowing this. If one has to go digging deep into things someone has said just to dislike things they created, they should reconsider their views lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually never knew about the Walt Disney thing. Or,rather, I guess I remember hearing it a few times, but I guess I never remembered it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I, for one,commend you for watching the show before giving an opinion on it. :) Like, even if we end up disagreeing on the show, it&#39;s an informed disagreement, which can result in constructive debate, if debate arises. A lot of the people in this thread seem to just be part a sort of an uninformed &quot;circlejerk&quot; of people who just don&#39;t like the idea of being confronted about their own views.</p>

<p>Based on my personal experience with the show, I think that a lot of people who&#39;ve watched it only think the show is racist because they&#39;ve gone into the show already upset at it (Waiting for them to &quot;slip up&quot;), and with a <em>strong</em> bias. Also, people expect all the Black characters to voice the opinion of the show? I find that to be a stupid expectation, as not all characters in a show, movie, book, will have popular opinions, or be perfect. And also, the Black characters often disagree on things, so to think that they&#39;re all voicing the show&#39;s message every time they speak, makes no sense at all, as that would make them having different opinions super counter-productive. A lot of people are just cherry-picking the more extreme characters&#39; opinions, and then acting like they represent the show...resulting in a lot of strawman arguments circulating around the show.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my opinion, though; I don&#39;t want to spoil any of it for you (Although, my posts contained some spoilers; apologies x)), but there were some parts that were really powerful to me, and made me feel; and the show made me rethink some of my own opinions, actually.</p>

<p>While I believe that the show can be -- and is meant to be -- interpreted in many ways, I believe you&#39;re looking at it in a way it&#39;s not supposed to be looked at. It seems like you&#39;re looking at it from a very literal view; but I believe it&#39;s supposed to be taken more...metaphorically than that. :P</p>

<p>For instance, with the Reggie thing, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s saying, &quot;If there were a White guy and a Black guy literally standing next to each other, doing the same thing, the cop would ignore the White guy, and become aggressive with the Black guy.&quot; I think it&#39;s more-so a <em>representation</em> of the idea of police generally seeing/treating Black people as more of a threat than White people, and often reacting via unnecessary and excessive force. Like in the case of Trayvon Martin. </p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s saying that that would literally happen if a Black and White guy were right next to each other; it&#39;s more-so representing the idea of different police reaction to Black and White people in America (I think), instead of a literal depiction</p>

<p>Essentially, I think the show is more-so representation than literal. :)</p>

<p>Well, I apologize, but this doesn&#39;t make sense to me; could you maybe elaborate on this? ^^&#39; </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused because you type that it sometimes makes you think, &quot;Wow, this could be a problem they face.&quot; But then you feel that the show is preaching too much, and so you lose any care you had for the issues you previously agreed with?

No other ethnic group or race is being asked to sacrifice their future at the alter of globalism in the modern world.  Whites are less than 8% of the worlds population and declining rapidly, but for some reason we must sacrafice our homelands in Europe and North America.

    <div class="md"><p>No. I understand the point. </p>

<p>&quot;Dear White People&quot; is bullshit. The movie was bullshit, and I only imagine that the show is worse. I wont watch it. </p>

<p>The one thing that <strong>no one</strong> ever makes a comment on? These are a bunch of whiny kids who are in <strong>COLLEGE</strong> making some bullshit statement. Want to talk about privilege? The movie makes absolutely no comment on the fact that all of these students are in an extreme place of privilege by being placed in some upper-class higher learning establishment that the majority of Americans, regardless of race, would not have the opportunity to attend. </p>

<p>When we talk about intersectionality, a word most SJWs love to use, this movie (again, not commenting on the show), completely disregards the issue of class. And, in my opinion, that makes it an utter failure. As a member of the audience, am I really supposed to care or empathize with a bunch of young kids have landed themselves in a prestigious university? Absolutely not. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You are absolutely correct. But my question is this... Why would anyone <em>want</em> to move there? As a white dude who was born in America, I have no desire to go to those places. I certainly don&#39;t want to move there. </p>

<p>Is it wrong that the western world is expected to conform? Well, in a way, yes and no. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with diversity. If we are examining bureaucratic pressures and &quot;forcing&quot; diversity, then things like Brown v. Board of Education was a forced political move to integrate school systems. Was that wrong? Absolutely not. I do not believe in segregation and I believe that everyone should have equal access to education. </p>

<p>Where an &quot;expectation to conform&quot; becomes dangerous is when it becomes harmful to the citizenry of a sovereign nation. Accepting thousands of immigrants into a county who come from war-torn nations and do not uphold the same set of western values is dangerous. If a large population wants to practice Islam, that is fine by me. Where that stops being okay is when outdated Islamic practices like genital mutilation, murdering homosexuals, or raping women are not left in the outdated societal constructs they were supposedly &quot;fleeing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Dear White People&quot; is an obvious attempt to highlight the problems with institutionalized racism and it is using propaganda to do so. I can see that. It is trying to provoke anger. I can see that as well. Where I get caught up, again, is the unchecked issue of class that is not addressed. </p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m not sure why I was downvoted. I mean, Native populations in the US were victims of genocide and had their lands stolen from them. That isn&#39;t an opinion...    </p>

<p>This is a simple question. It divides people in too camps. The black people who want to fix the system by using the system are ridiculed by the black people who want to fix the system by destroying it. The rebellious black people view those who want to fix the system are &quot;too white&quot; and it makes it seem like every white person is some idiot or some devil. Even the white people who want to help are viewed as &quot;trying too hard&quot; </p>

<p>The characters joke a few times about the fact that  &quot;all we do is complain&quot; which eventually turns into a protest at the end of the series. They are fighting against the police force, the police force they feel like are trying to oppress the black kids. Idk if you live with a black family but this basically how they feel. &quot;If we don&#39;t stop the police then they are going to kill us all&quot;</p>

<p>Shareholders don&#39;t have control over operational decisions. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not an activist fund either... he isn&#39;t lobbying for changes on the BoD (which might &#39;trickle down&#39; to programming). </p>

<p>Tech stocks are notorious for restricting shareholder rights. Netflix shareholders don&#39;t have proxy access, can only vote on 1/3 of the board, and has rejected 15 separate requests (since 2011) that were approved by a majority of shareholders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is a little confused it seems. I finished it tonight with the gf and we both liked it. Very abrupt and it mimics all the social aspects of high school a teenager may go through. The characters had a broad spectrum of shit happen to them as a result of their actions. They all face so much with their struggle to face what they had done. It played out pretty good too. You are hating them one second and then can sympathize at other times. Not with Bryce, he&#39;s a creeper and a rapist. But you can level with some of them. I really hated Courtney, she really pissed me off. But thats what any good story line can do to you. I really felt the show played out well. Was awesome to see it end on the counselor, I was thinking it was him or the parents. They were bouncing you around a bit before the reveal. If they do a second season I&#39;d check it out for sure. Not sure if people are going to get shot up, if more will take their life or if Clay can pull himself together. Then the lawsuit..... the parents are going to listen to the tapes... so many different story lines and they seem to fit seamlessly. OP is off on this one, pretty good show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pretty smart of them to leave everyone vulnerable like that. Now we need to tie the loose ends. I felt the show was a great way to force it&#39;s viewer into the moral conundrum at hand. Although, the content is not intended for high schoolers, I bet a good majority of high schoolers will see it.  It is probably a good thing. You really are facing the adversities these kids go through and you are left to ponder what your own actions would be if put in that situation. I could only see this bringing awareness to the simple concept that every action has a reaction. Kids may get a healthy dose of the blunt reality that is peer pressure. Maybe some will learn the warning signs and mannerisms of someone in need of help. All in all a great show. Best of luck getting through it all!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering you saw a show named &quot;Dear White People&quot;, clicked on it, and watched it in it&#39;s entirety and then proceed to shit on every aspect of 13 Reasons Why...I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m going to have to say you have horrible taste.  </p>

<p>13 Reasons was phenomenal.  Having originally read the novel back in the day, I felt like the pacing of the show was perfect.  They brought the emotionally intensity and plenty of detail to life.  There wasn&#39;t any filler, it all was to show what Hannah went through.  Which leads me to my next point: it was the realest portrayal of suicide of I&#39;ve ever seen.  Fuck every middle aged sheltered bitch writing blogs and articles about it &quot;making light of suicide.&quot;  It may have seemed trivial to people who haven&#39;t been in that &quot;outcast&quot; role or to people who never struggled socially or dealt with bullying or depression..but it goes to show that even seemingly insignificant events can have profound effects on someones psyche.  It was beautiful and raw and I loved every minute of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can appreciate that concern. However I think they handled to topic overall responsibly, considering the context (TV teen drama). I don&#39;t think the really romanticized suicide much. Probably less so than most stories on the topic. Hell, Romeo and Juliet by <em>far</em> romanticizes suicide more.</p>

<p>I also think it&#39;s a good topic to be broached with teens. Teen suicide is a fairly a pretty taboo topic, and certainly not discussed at a level that most teens will actually pay attention to. Because whether you want to admit it or not, their friends they see every day at school and gossip with are probably more likely to be exposed to the potential warning signs for suicide, even before the parents. So it&#39;s important for them to be exposed to what the warning signs are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionists believe they are the superior race. Cultural Marxism is a school of thought formulated specifically by a group in pre-WWII Germany called the Frankfurt School. They seek to impose these ideals on a global front whereby all divisions between people – genetic, ethnic, cultural, spiritual, have been wiped away. Leaving a homogenous population with no shared heritage, culture, no common ground or history. Nothing which a population would traditionally unite and act upon. No common ground upon which to build resistance.</p>

<p>Europe represents an excellent example. Today, thousands of economic migrants are streaming into Europe daily. This also has the added advantage of orchestrating a perceived war between Christianity and Islam. </p>

<p>The goal of a war on whites, and all others is to remove all social cohesion and any ability to stand against Zionists. Our society has been perverted on multiple fronts. Sexuality and the moral values of western culture have been assaulted through pornography, another industry dominated by them, social media and hookup culture have all been orchestrated to erode the nuclear family and all other values in which a strong society can build</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My God, you people are clueless aren&#39;t you? Have you ever read any text from the Frankfurt School? Why are you conspiracy people so ignorant? If you actually read The Dialectic of Enlightenment and all major works from Adorno, Hockheimer and all the philosophers of the Frankfurt school you&#39;d know they lay down the foundation of what you dimwits call Conspiracy Theory.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt School philosophers mainly criticize mass media and a cultural industry that is used to fabricate a status quo to manipulate the working class into perpetual submission. That&#39;s the CORE fundamentals of their critical theory.</p>

<p>Are you people that ignorant that you actually believe in &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot;, a buzzword invented by politicians in the 90s, to criticize marxist academics? Have you read a line of the Marx&#39;s work? I doubt it. Because if you had, you&#39;d realize it basically criticizes bankers and the financial institutions as the root of all evil.</p>

<p>Sounds familiar? Well, that&#39;s what conspiracy theory is all about. You people are philosophically marxists and don&#39;t even know it. If you actually were educated and instead of taking buzzwords at face value you actually read the texts you call evil (like Christians idiots looking for a devil) you&#39;d realize that the core thought of a cabal of bankers dominating the earth and doing what they want for their own benefits is the BASIS of marxist thought.</p>

<p>I shake my head at the stupidity of you Americans and your brainwashed ways of reading the world. I laugh at you people using 1984 and Brave New World to &quot;denounce Maxism&quot; when the books were written by Marxists criticising the Soviet Union for what they believed was not a socialist society but rather a state controlled capitalist endeavour. I pitty you and your uneducated understanding of the world. Conspiracy theory couldn&#39;t be more marxist if it tried. </p>

<p>Please stop being fools and read the damn books you criticize first. </p>

<p>How do you possibly have an opinion about a show you haven&#39;t seen?</p>

<p>I feel like 90% of people in this thread are just basing their opinions off of the title. </p>

<p>Hint: the show is actually pretty nuanced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are stories without sympathetic characters (like alan gregory) or shows with only deeply flawed characters (mostly like game of thrones), or where perspective constantly shifts (war episode of aeon flux), but stories where there is no character you&#39;re meant to identify with are rare as hell.</p>

<p>It seems to me clear that we&#39;re meant to identify with the biracial girl. We see a lot of close-ups and are treated with her emotion as to the injustice of it all. It beckons the viewer to share in the rage of the injustice.</p>

<p>And viewers that take up the call to arms will find themselves acting pretty much like justice warriors, or dare I say, social justice warriors.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the message of the entire show crystal clear as Lionel explains he&#39;s so pissed off because he released the tape as a part of his article to create mutual understanding and nuance and they only use it to rationalise their flawed reasoning; blaming Gabe for the act of a bigot police officer?</p>

<p>I mean they&#39;re already spreading false information about trayvon/cop brutality.

I wouldn&#39;t mind so much if it wasn&#39;t advertised so much and it&#39;s on top of my own netflix and other people&#39;s netflix, but if you keep pushing it in my face, I&#39;m going to engage and if necessary, criticize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t watch it, but in my college I always see books like &quot;White America&#39;s Hatred,&quot; being promoted everywhere. I never read those either and I just ignore it all. What ever it is, I&#39;m not interested because I don&#39;t like wasting time on things I know I won&#39;t learn anything new.</p>

<p>I grew up and live in a very textbook liberal area, where I would be called a racist in Middle School for saying that my favorite color is black (no, seriously) or get told that my ancestors were slave owners. My ancestors were all Polish, so they have nothing to do with what went on this country and I would get kind of frustrated, but I just laugh at it now. Most of those kids stay in the same city, while I got the chance to go to many different countries, learn new languages, speak to different people and learn new perspectives.</p>

<p>I learn many new things from keeping an open mind, while my closed minded classmates stay on the same level. All this only made me feel bad for them and for humanity. And I&#39;m not referring to only blacks or other races. I took a Political Science class (which I also regret) and most the classmates who speak all the time are white liberals who copy off everything that the TV says.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no right winged nationalist. I actually hate patriotism, I don&#39;t respect homophobia or anything like that, and I always saw myself quite liberal until that whole party became cancer.</p>

<p>When does it do this? I&#39;m only half way through but it barley even shows any white people. It has maybe one white dude you could call a central character and it does a good job showing how black people could be just as shitty to him for being white as any white person could be to them.</p>

<p>Sure one of the central points is the black face party but that&#39;s not even really an issue the show discusses, it just uses it to frame the story and explore each of the characters faults. The show actually does a great job of avoiding blaming white people for everything if yo ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, lets assume you believe in the theory of evolution. From this, we introduce the concept of divergent evolution, where one population starts in the same locale, then for various reasons (usually migratory), the population gets divided. Two populations now living in different locales will develop different genetic advantages over time. Such differentiation of a species can lead to a different subspecies or a different race.</p>

<p>This is how humans evolved. Human races roughly correspond to 7 geographic regions: Africa, Middle East, Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Oceania, Americas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the subject matter is what it is - fiction.  I think if you try to compare it too much to reality, it makes it seem as if they&#39;re pushing an agenda.  Other shows have done the same.  But if you try to get past that and just watch the show for the story and the acting, I think it&#39;s quite good.  </p>

<p>Case in point, there&#39;s scene where Sam and her old roommate meet another black girl w/ a small lapdog with her.  She looks like, think one of the wives from Edward Scissorhands, but she&#39;s black.  And talks just like those 50s era housewives.  It was ridiculous how well she did it.</p>

<p>And then the scene to end the 5th episode was intense.  Call it racist scripting, but damn it was gripping.  Plus it doesn&#39;t hurt that the soundtrack usually has a good one or two, oh and Logan Benning.</p>

You can say you don&#39;t care about someone&#39;s race now, but that doesn&#39;t hold true for others and doesn&#39;t hold true for our history. As someone who grew up in a predominantly white, right-wing town, and currently works in a racism-filled profession (real estate), I can say with confidence that it&#39;s not reverse-racism, BLM, or George Soros that are behind these issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This show is not race war propaganda lol.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s such an easy cop-out to dismiss the show and it&#39;s message. And exactly what the show is trying to expose and confront you with. </p>

<p>People rationalise their prejudice based on a titel so easily, it&#39;s crazy. Read some IMDB reviews, hilarious. If the show makes you angry you should take a step back and objectively look at your own reaction.</p>

<p>Obviously, some of the main characters and their messages are pretty racist. But the show itself is not at all about propagating black racism.</p>

<p>The message I got from the show; yes, constitutional racism and white privelage is real and unfair. Black people are far from united in the way to handle this (showing you cant judge a group by some individuals), none of them are perfect just like you or me. And just like some white folk, they can be racist too.</p>

<p>In contrary to the main characters, the show seems pretty neutral and subtle to me. If I had to pick a character that really portrays the intent of the show it would be Lionel (why do u think he was the character on the cover of the original film?).</p>

<p>The only character that actually gets things done and makes steps forward, the silent journalist who brings perspective and subtlety whilst surrounded by people who just shout and without listening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally hear you on how the show is divisive--I think a lot of TV and movies right now do this by kinda hating on white people because white liberals kinda hate their whiteness at this stage in history. </p>

<p>But, I think this also means that &quot;race&quot; is just as real as any other construct, like &quot;god.&quot; Maybe the medieval Catholic god wasn&#39;t ever &quot;real,&quot; but he sure as shit got a lot of people killed and completely changed pretty much every stage of history and culture when &quot;he&quot; was present. You&#39;re sort of like a racial atheist, and I think that&#39;s cool, but I also think we&#39;ve got to keep talking about &quot;race,&quot; if only to criticize it. Saying it doesn&#39;t exist isn&#39;t specific enough to solve any specific problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I think it was meant to put into perspective an already divided culture (a theme riffed on in the show quite a bit ) and if you think it was meant to divide people then I think before you watched it you had already chosen a side. It all fits into an us and them narrative...they can&#39;t see the clear propaganda and we fealt marganilized by the themes.  The fact of the matter is that black and white are not the same. Cultures are different. Denying that growing up in white suburbia and black ghettos is different is the problem(not that every white person lives in suburbia and every black person lives in a ghetto but the cultures each associates with do). Celebrate difference. You cant homogenize a society with so many different walks of life. And just because a TV show doesn&#39;t speak to your viewpoints on the matter doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s propaganda. It means there&#39;s a part of the puzzle that hasn&#39;t fit in yet. The fact of the matter is that netflix decided these are marketable themes and they are right. In a nation that went from its first black president after a history of rocky race relations to a man that has a history of racist business practices, I think a lot of black people justifiably feel marganilized by our society and if a TV show makes just a few feel empowered then so be it. But I&#39;m just a white guy from the suburbs </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: &quot;Race war propaganda that panders to Black people&quot; is a strong, and inaccurate phrase.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING: SPOILERS (If you care to watch the show)</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This show makes white people out to be, literally evil devils.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(&quot;<strong>literally</strong> evil devils&quot; lolok)  I don&#39;t see the show ever do this, honestly. I mean, everyone has their interpretation of the show, but honestly, I think people are clinging way too much to the idea that the show has a clear, black-and-white (clever, huh?) message <em>all the time.</em> And so they immediately love it or attack it for the message that &quot;White people are bad,&quot; or that &quot;Black people are superior.&quot;</p>

<p>In reality, the show actually shows a variation of beliefs and viewpoints, all based around the idea of racial tensions. For instance, in the first episode, we see that Sam is trying to hide the fact that she&#39;s dating a White guy, from her friends, simply because he&#39;s White. She gets mad at him when he simply acknowledges their relationship on social media, she lets him be alienated by her friends, and when he gets upset at their racism toward him, she tries to turn the tables by saying something like, &quot;Oh, you didn&#39;t feel part of the group for five minutes. That&#39;s how I feel everyday on this campus!&quot;</p>

<p>And at that point, there were probably many people agreeing with Sam that &quot;that White boy should just suck it up, because &#39;privilege&#39;!&quot; </p>

<p>But then, Gabe actually fires back with something along the lines of, &quot;Yeah, society sucks! But I&#39;d never let my friends alienate you like that.&quot; And that&#39;s an important social commentary, on the double-standard that we have for racism. </p>

<p>In fact, Gabe is honestly one of the most important parts of the show. Because he&#39;s not just the token &quot;ignorant White boy.&quot; He represents how a lot of White people feel about today&#39;s discussion on racism in America. In &quot;his&quot; episode, in one of the first scenes, it talks about how he feels that it&#39;s unfair that he has a big &quot;racist&quot; label on him, just for being a White male. And how he feels pressured into agreeing with Sam all the time, just so that he&#39;s not called a racist, even though he&#39;s legitimately not a racist. He wants to tell Sam, and the other girl, that she didn&#39;t fail the test because she&#39;s Black, but because she simply didn&#39;t do as well on the test; but he just has to sit, and agree with them.</p>

<p>We see that Gabe is not a bad guy -- he&#39;s actually a really nice, cool guy -- but he&#39;s unfairly thrown into that category of &quot;bad,&quot; just because of his race. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The black characters in the show are so hostile to white people, and for no reason sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And the show tells you, &quot;The Black characters in the show are sometimes hostile to White people for no reason.&quot; It&#39;s not painted as a &quot;Black people good, White people bad&quot; issue.</p>

<p>As for the White characters who were perceived as apathetic jerks, in the show, I believe they represented how people don&#39;t always understand others&#39; problems. I mean, the one guy who kept basically saying that the blackface party shouldn&#39;t matter, because free-speech, seemed to be the biggest example of that. I mean, yeah, it&#39;s great that we&#39;ve free-speech, but that doesn&#39;t mean that anything you do/say is necessarily good, or productive. Like, we see that Sam and her friends actually are facing real problems, and he just brushes it off as whining. He doesn&#39;t represent every, or even most, White people; he&#39;s a character who is placed in the show to prove a point.</p>

<p>We also have events like the blackface party, yes. But that&#39;s not something that&#39;s there to say, &quot;White people are evil.&quot; It&#39;s a part of the story that&#39;s meant to spark a reason to talk about race. I mean, it&#39;s honestly not a bad plot device, in my opinion. If they would have just started talking about race, without something like that to spark it, people would be complaining even more about how &quot;preachy&quot; it is.</p>

<p>Also, the main antagonist (If we would pinpoint one) is a Black guy (The Dean). He&#39;s the one trying to selfishly silence the school&#39;s race issue. And we see the other Black girl (Coco, I believe?) conspire with him to make sure that no questions that could threaten the school&#39;s  reputation, are asked, at that event  (I know, I&#39;m so specific T_T &quot;that event&quot;). And Dean doesn&#39;t realize the gravity of the problem until his own son is almost unnecessarily shot by a campus guard.</p>

<p>Also, it shows how even Black people are being pitted against each other because of this flawed idea of &quot;Black vs White.&quot; It does this best, in my opinion, through Reggie&#39;s app, to mark people as &quot;woke&quot; or not. And we, the audience, can see that&#39;s a bad idea, a recipe for disaster. But we see that unravel later, when we see that Troy is marked as a racist, simply because he did something they didn&#39;t agree with. &quot;Blacker-than-thou&quot; ideology, as Coco said. </p>

<p>Just because a show is somewhat based around a group of Black students&#39; experiences, that a lot of Black people can probably relate to, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s &quot;race war propaganda that panders to Black people.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example of a dumb human: people who still think race is a real concept.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, sure, all races are the same as living, breathing, thinking humans (despite a few things that affect only our personal health, and not others, such as more melanin in darker skin). So, in a perfect society, race isn&#39;t really...&quot;a thing,&quot; per se, because it&#39;s not something that we should care about.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s not &quot;dumb&quot; to consider race to be a thing, and start a discussion on it. Because, despite there being no science behind it, it&#39;s something that has an impact on the world. Race is why we had slavery, why we have the KKK, why we&#39;ve BLM. And to say it doesn&#39;t exist is like saying money has no value. </p>

<p>Yeah, money has no value, except for the value that we place on it in our society, so it&#39;s technically a true statement in  <em>that</em> regard. But money has an effect on things in our society, so to say, &quot;Example of a dumb human: people who think money has value,&quot; is pretty, well, one-sided. Because it&#39;s not dumb to care about/acknowledge/believe in something that has an effect on our society, despite how <em>objectively</em> real it is or not.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As a Black guy, I could go to my nearest KKK meeting, or BLM gathering, to prove the &quot;value&quot; of race. Those are not as common as gas stations, obviously...and the responses would be different between the two, of course, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not something that exists in our society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a perfectly valid one of which being is &quot;it doesn&#39;t exist and we should act accordingly&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another perfectly valid one is trying to show different perspectives on the issue, like the show does. x) Look, if we could just snap our fingers and have everyone &quot;act as if it doesn&#39;t exist,&quot; that&#39;d be great, in the sense that it would destroy racism...but it&#39;s not that simple. x) That&#39;s not practical. If we want to do that, we&#39;d have to destroy tons of books, delete tons of media, stop talking about certain parts of history, stop telling certain jokes (such as those of Dave Chapelle), etc. </p>

<p>Because once someone experiences racism, they realize race does, in fact, exist as a thing in our society. It&#39;s like a &quot;red pill&quot;; it can be hard to just &quot;forget race exists,&quot; because that person has experienced discrimination for it, firsthand, because there will still be racism. And you can&#39;t really blame them for not forgetting.</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;d be great if we didn&#39;t let something as insignificant as race affect us so negatively, just because of skin. Like, I doubt you consciously think about the race of your friends, or family, or some random person you run into...we&#39;re &quot;colorblind&quot; in our most casual and friendly interaction, fortunately. But we can&#39;t just erase race from our society so easily, unless we were blind and deaf. And just &quot;not talking about it&quot; wouldn&#39;t necessarily erase racists -- who won&#39;t stop talking about it anyway -- it&#39;d just make it impossible for us to call them out on it, allowing them to continue to be racist. You can&#39;t even try to get everyone to stop using the word &quot;race,&quot; without acknowledging it yourself.</p>

<p>I think one of the messages of the show is that race/racism now does, unfortunately, exist...but we should not let it divide us as races. Her show name, &quot;Dear White People,&quot; is very generalized, toward all White people. Which is a bad example for how we should honestly be about such an issue. And I&#39;m willing to claim that it is satire, especially because of the one caller who called in, calling out the show. He even said that his race isn&#39;t important, when she asked him his race; and when she started ranting to him about &quot;his &#39;White privilege,&#39;&quot; for simply calling out the show&#39;s name for being racist, he let her know that he was, in fact Black.</p>

<p>Basically, one of the big problems of race is that people will blame whole ethnicities for a few individuals&#39; actions. And that&#39;s never okay, obviously. I&#39;m not going to try to exclude someone White from joining in a conversation about it, just because of the fact that they are White. That doesn&#39;t mean that we shouldn&#39;t have a discussion about racism; it means that we shouldn&#39;t generalize, as that is racism in and of itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not wrong for the show to start a discussion about an issue. x)</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid this is a natural reaction, and one that goes very deep. Humans, and animals ftm, are hyper-specialized to detect patterns, and if all your interactions with people who look a particular way are negative, you will inevitably generalize. From personal experience, the only way to counteract that is by having positive experiences with people who look that certain way... no amount of lecturing or training can substitute. (For the same reasons, I do not believe true racism can be taught. Maybe folks talk the talk and parrot the shit they heard their parents say, but it&#39;s the same as a kid being &quot;religious&quot; because they memorized verses in Sunday school and take whatever tenants they are taught as read.)</p>

<p>My problem is that most people who talk about race don&#39;t seem to be taking that tact, and as such I find myself wishing they would shut up. </p>

<p>Anyway, based on what I&#39;ve seen in these threads I may give the show a shot.</p>

<p>Yeah, we can agree on this, definitely. It&#39;s why it does socially exist, in the first place.</p>

<p>Well, the thing is, we shouldn&#39;t just &quot;shut up&quot; about racism just because we won&#39;t be able to completely abolish it. And we <em>definitely</em> shouldn&#39;t stop talking about it just because you &quot;wish&quot; you didn&#39;t have to hear about it; race affects the world, my dude...regardless of if you want to hear about it or not. o.o Your idea of training people to stop talking about race is basically &quot;training and lecturing&quot; people, as you, yourself, realize won&#39;t work. Racism is obviously not a good thing, so we should work to stop it, regardless. In fact, the show&#39;s action is probably one of the best actions to take, to fight racism: To show many different experiences, views, and opinions, on race issues. So that we&#39;re forced to step out of our own bubbles for a second. People just look at the title and realize the show&#39;s story revolves mainly around Black students, and their lives. Then they get so upset, and automatically think it&#39;s &quot;SJW LIBERAL TRASH XDXDLOL&quot; and describe it as (in the words of <a href="/u/truuuuDSfr01">/u/truuuuDSfr01</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>race war propaganda that panders to black people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s not. It doesn&#39;t paint the Black students as &quot;always the good guys.&quot; They, just like anyone, have their own flaws, and unproductive opinions. But the show doesn&#39;t glorify that; it just depicts it as a thing that exists. A lot of the time, there&#39;s more debate about race <em>amongst</em> the Black students. It shows a lot of different opinions, actually. </p>

<p>What the show strives to do is provide <em>understanding.</em> It dares to show you a different viewpoint from how you think (Whether you are Black, or White), to maybe change your opinion on a few things. Many people dislike the show simply because it&#39;s based around Black students, and the name is &quot;Dear White People.&quot; If the show were actually <em>against</em> White people, yeah, it&#39;d be a problem. But it&#39;s not actually about how &quot;White people are bad and Black people are good&quot;; it simply follows a mostly Black cast, and the story progresses through their experiences. There are examples of some characters holding the &quot;everything is racist&quot; view, but the characters actually criticize this, instead of the show supporting it. And yes, there are going to be times when the White people are racist, and the Black characters are upset about it. I don&#39;t see why people are mad at that, because it&#39;s not saying that all White people are racist; it shows that racism is a thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, based on what I&#39;ve seen in these threads I may give the show a shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look. Please, if you&#39;re going to have a discussion about the show, <strong>watch it before you join in on the discussions regarding the show.</strong> Even if you have seen the movie. So many people cancel their Netflix subscriptions because of this show, and they don&#39;t even watch it. It&#39;s honestly kind of funny how stupid people can be. In fact, I&#39;m confident that at least one third of the people responding to this thread, hating on the show, haven&#39;t even seen the show. I really do recommend you watch the show. If you do, though, you should try not come into it with a strong opinion on the show; I stress that, because if you do, you&#39;ll likely see it through the lens of that preconceived, uninformed bias, obviously. </p>

<p>I deliberately made sure watch the show <em>as soon</em> as I saw that it was on Netflix (so I binge-watched it a day after it came out), so that I had <em>no</em> outside opinion on the show. And from that, I didn&#39;t get a specific anti-White agenda from it, as some people say it has. After finishing the whole show, I didn&#39;t even think most other people would think that it had that agenda. o.o There are antagonist White characters, sure, but pretty much the <em>main</em> antagonist, is Black. The show is pretty neutral, in the sense that it rarely ever says, &quot;This is right, this is wrong,&quot; thought it does depict some events that are very obviously wrong, and racist. But the show is neutral, in the sense that it doesn&#39;t just blame White people for racism. It shows that racism is a thing, it doesn&#39;t say that one specific group is responsible for it. Sam and Reggie (The two more extreme characters) say things like that, but the show doesn&#39;t validate their opinion. The whole cast of characters have different opinions and views on race and racism, as you&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>The show is basically saying, &quot;Here are some unfortunate real-world experiences regarding race, and here is how this character feels about it, here&#39;s what that character does about it, here&#39;s how this character processes it.&quot; It doesn&#39;t lecture you, or &quot;train&quot; you, like you propose we do by training people to stop talking about race, just because you &quot;wish they would shut up,&quot; just so that you didn&#39;t have to listen to others&#39; unfortunate experiences. It just shows you experiences so that it can maybe change some people&#39;s points of view. :)</p>

<p>If the show is bad, then nobody is watching. Therefore, the whole &quot;divide&quot; conspiracy falls flat.</p>

<p>I&#39;m black and black people are not monolithic.  You assume that a majority of blacks are watching this show and that VERY far from reality. Again,  killing your whole sky is falling &quot;divide &quot; nonsense. </p>

<p>More blacks that I know are still watching Power, Empire and those terrible Love and Hip Hop shows, so don&#39;t worry white people,  none of these shows are helping the so called &quot;divide&quot; lol. </p>

<p>Relax</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. That is just not true. There are genetic difference between races. There are genetic diseases that predominate one race or another. Beyond this there are cultural differences between races, as well. These cultural differences could be eliminated, in my opinion, if people are willing to question their cultural heritage. The problem is that culture is very often tied into our religious and spiritual beliefs and questioning religion is frowned upon.</p>

<p>Now, I have not seen this show yet, so I cannot comment on it. However, I do not like anything that sets us apart from one another, but it is an effective tool for controlling the population.</p>

<p>Wow wow wow there cowboy. I never said anything about hating one another based on the color of their skin. Just because we desire to eliminate racism does not negate the fact that cultural and genetic differences occur between the various races (or subspecies) of homosapiens.

<p>Race is a lie. </p>

<p>We could devide human beings into a small number of groups called &#39;&#39;races,&#39;&#39; in such a way that the members of these groups shared certain fundamental, heritable, physical, moral, intellectual, and cultural characteristics with one another that they did not share with member of any other race. Alas, no such groups exist. </p>

<p>Indeed, grouping for biological purposes, your classification will almost certainly contain as much genetic variation as there is in the whole species.</p>

<p>The most we can classify as a &#39;&#39;race&#39;&#39; is a group of partially reproductively isolated people. No large social group in America is a race.</p>

<p>This show is meant to divide. If not for the sometimes poor writing, I believe this show is worst than 13 reasons why. This is race war propaganda that panders to black people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying the same thing about Key and Peele for years- it&#39;s aimed at millenials and belittling of black culture in a way that makes black culture look stupid.  Blackish is similar.  They both attempt to appeal to the struggle of straddling black and white cultures, but in the end they are derogatory to both.  They&#39;re critical without being constructive or thoughtful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honey, as stated in the show, bringing attention to an issue isn&#39;t the promotion of said issue. I&#39;m also half black/white (raised by my white mother and her white family) and this show (as compared to the movie) is FABULOUS. The characters the flawed but the issues they bring up and their experiences are very relatable. YES! We all just want to live in a happy little bubble where every colour in the rainbow is equal and we all can hold hands but that isn&#39;t the point; we live in the real world and in the real world racism happens. As a commie myself, I abhore violence but I also accept that to topple the capitalist regime, violence must also be used (not unlike using a poison to develop a cure). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Gay, straight, Muslim, we are all dumb humans regardless. Example of a dumb human: people who still think race is a real concept&quot;</p>

<p>It is true, there are people who still believe that race is still a real concept-- despite it having no real biological basis-- and they are not limited to the people who created these series. Racist ideas are still pervasive, and you&#39;ll find them peddled by people on the highest rungs of society. Why? It is one thing to change laws and render racism illegal. It&#39;s another thing to purge the collective psyche of false discriminatory ideas. There are 50 year olds alive today who as children witnessed black people being lynched in the States. That sort of racist conditioning does not simply disappear. It perpetuates itself through generations, just as class does (especially in North America where there is less social mobility). So the whites who controlled the system in the past, many of whom had racist notions, have most likely conferred their power and ideas onto their offspring. Which is not to say that the cycle of racist thinking can&#39;t be broken, but only that once this conditioning is done, it is very hard to undo because people are attached to their foundations. </p>

<p>I see it like this: there is Reality and then there is &quot;reality&quot;. The former is objective, true and universal. The latter is what humans invent for themselves, and exists only in particular contexts. Race isn&#39;t an objective reality, but it acquires attributes of &quot;realness&quot; as people&#39;s lives are influenced by it--like when they are denied housing, employment or education because they belong to a certain group. Does this mean that the people controlling these institutions  are racist robots? No. But it goes back to my original point that racist ideas are self-perpetuating, and still exist in the collective psyche.</p>

<p>So shows like this don&#39;t make race any more salient than it already is. Race isn&#39;t real, but it has real consequences for people. I view race in the same way that I view the concept of beauty. There is no universal law that demarcates &quot;prettiness&quot; and &quot;ugliness&quot;, and yet people in our society are treated differently based on how they look-- which often does impact their life. And it&#39;s hard to just go around saying &quot;beauty isn&#39;t an objective reality&quot; because most people seem to subconsciously believe it is, and people who are deemed &quot;ugly&quot; are still usually treated worse. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s better to combat these toxic ideas head on than pretending that they don&#39;t exist (even if they have been forged into existence). There are better and worse ways of combatting; and I agree that only shitting on white people isn&#39;t very productive. But it must be addressed if it is to be erased. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s true, humans are piles of shit who make existence harder than it needs to be-- but unless you can totally transcend socially constructed notions such as race, or move to an isolated desert island where there is no human association, you are bound by these ideas and the will affect your life. And that&#39;s just reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the whole show, and I couldn&#39;t help but think that these African Americans who have been admitted into some fictional Harvard/Yale can do nothing but whine about their own insecurities
&quot;how dare you throw a black face party!&quot;
Which is what they&#39;d rather do than to be grateful for the opportunity that they have going to this elite school. </p>

<p>The show&#39;s Asian character particularly repulses me - she&#39;s just there to throw in some pointless taglines that show that the American left thinks of individuals as nothing more than labels. &quot;I&#39;m your catch-all Asian friend!&quot; And they just want to pay obeisance to their litany of diversity.</p>

<p>I really did like parts of this show - the characters and plots were interesting once you get over the shock factor. But you can&#39;t help but feel that this is the activism of the iPhone generation and that the entire show is more of a commercial for Apple products than it is for a completely indefinable eradication of &quot;the new jim crow&quot; that admitted all these black students to an elite university that has a black dean who is the father of one of the main characters.</p>

<p>The whole show is just a way for Netflix to try to cash in on the outrage of the past two years and Black Lives Matter by making a show that seems to address these issues - but ultimately is no different than the OC or Gossip Girl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there&#39;s a whole universe of fantastic shows out there. I&#39;m really supposed to watch this because, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the writers don&#39;t really hate you, it will all make sense when you finish it.&quot; </p>

<p>I mean come on... at least put some of the good laughs/poignant moments in the trailer. I didn&#39;t see anything that made me want to give this show a shot and I&#39;m sure a majority of white folks are gonna feel similarly. </p>
