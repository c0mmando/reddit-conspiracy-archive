    <div class="md"><p>No planes have been hijacked, so does that mean the TSA is doing it&#39;s job?</p>

<p>As for polio, yes there is flaccid paralysis still around today. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaccid_paralysis">Flaccid paralysis are the symptoms that lead to the clinical diagnosis of polio.</a> The primary means by which polio was eliminated was with clean water and proper sanitation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_of_poverty">polio is a &quot;disease of poverty&quot;</a>, which means it&#39;s eliminated as poverty is eliminated.</p>

<p>As for smallpox, what you don&#39;t account for is the role that quarantine played with eliminating the disease. While the vaccine did play it&#39;s part, not everywhere received the vaccine, so in those locations quarantining people was how it was stopped. That&#39;s the same mechanism at play with Ebola today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That does not safety of the vaccine. Chemo eliminates the cancer but it also can cause more harm then good. Safety and efficacy are equally important. There are no studies that prove safety but thousand fi adverse reactions and no studies to follow up.

<p>Dr. Paul Offit</p>

<p>Vaccine profiteer Paul Offit admits to fabricating lies about vaccine safety advocates. Offit, who also collects royalties from vaccines, is one of the most frequently quoted vaccine propagandists by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>In a published correction to a July 25, 2008, report that aired on CBS Evening News entitled &quot;How Independent Are Vaccine Defenders?&quot;, the Orange County Register had this to say about Offit&#39;s failure to speak honestly about his financial ties with the vaccine industry:</p>

<p>According to the CBS News&#39; documentation recently reviewed by the OC Register, the network requested (but Offit did not disclose) the entire profile of his professional financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies including: The amount of compensation he&#39;d received from which companies in speaking fees; and pharmaceutical consulting relationships and fees.</p>

<p>In 2008, the program “Every Child by Two” and Dr. Paul Offit received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from Pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines. They claim this has no influence on their vaccine “safety” stance, but this has been exposed otherwise by reliable journalists. (1) There is missing information on just how much Offit profited from the sale of his invention of a Rotavirus vaccine (that’s never even been proven to work), but estimates are between $30 and $55 million of the 150 million dollar deal that was struck. (2)</p>

If we&#39;re saying that 1 in 100 have autism, that means that 1 in 200 would have severe symptoms.

<p>Before the 20th century autism was perhaps 1 in 10,000. While labeling socially awkward people as autistic would indeed increase this rate, it wouldn&#39;t bring it to the levels we&#39;re seeing today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure that is a possibility, but correlation isn&#39;t causation. It&#39;s interesting that the paper itself suggested that one possibility is that the parents had psychological problems and therefore self-selected to have children later in life. This is not to discount your study, I just think the possibilities of what cause it hasn&#39;t been narrowed, it&#39;s just hopefully something that might eventually give a clue for where to look.</p>

<p>let me ask you something, pretend for a second that vaccines are one day shown to be the cause of the autism epidemic, what punishment or accountability do you think would be appropriate? I know you&#39;ll say that this will never occur, but humor me for a second, I&#39;d like to know what you think would be fair.</p>

<p>My guess is that you don&#39;t think anyone should be punished and that it was all an honest mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find its best to look to historical examples to see how those were treated.  </p>

<p>Asbestos was placed in drywall as it was a flame retardant and good insulator.  Turns out it causes cancer when inhaled.  </p>

<p>Who did we blame for asbestos?  The carpenters who installed it, the firms that manufactured it, or the governments who made its use part of the building codes?  </p>

<p>Manufacturers were held liable in the end.  Personally, I&#39;m undecided as to who I hold personally responsible for the whole asbestos problem.  Ultimately I think the strongest case would be against those who made it part of the building code.  Thus with vaccines, if in a wild scenario they proved harmful, the strongest case would be against the CDC or whoever prescribes their use to the profession.  </p>

Figuring out who is vulnerable to adverse reactions is important and with that information therapies can be customized. No one wants to eliminate them we just want safe formulas.

    <div class="md"><p>inam not anti vacine I am anti injecting all children with arsenic and mecury vaccines. These ingredients are not necessary in fact they are preservatives to increase the shelf life of the vaccine. That way the doctor and the pharma company can turn a higher profit. A one size fits all approach in medicine does not work. Instead a vaccines schedule should take into account a child&#39;s health and history. Some people have weaker immune systems, some have genetic disposition. Donctors and insurance want to run a factory practice. The more patients they see an hour the more money they make. If you have children I hope you believe they deserve a doctor and a treatment plan that takes the entire health and family history into account. There might very well be children who have come down with autism and asthma because a physician simply wanted to see more patients per hour. </p>

There are lots of things that should be talked about in regards to autism/adhd.  Diet/life style etc. There are epigenetic studies that show links between infant stress and ASD.

    <div class="md"><p>Please show me the ingredient list then we will need independent studies proving safety. You won&#39;t find it: Vaccine ingredient lists are not available. </p>

<p>Mercury is not the only ingredient of concern, arsenic is another. Heavy metals and toxic substances are used as preservatives.  I have no problem with vaccines. I have a problem with the unnecessary preservatives and toxins used in conjunction with the viral agent itself. Safety means an agent will not cause adverse reaction ( side effect) It will not harm the patient. Chemo is not safe but effective. With chemo the benefit outweighs the risk. Cancer is worse than the side effects. Vaccines may be effective but based on anecdotal evidence they are not proven safe. Do you understand? Studies need to conducted. I don&#39;t take anyone&#39;s opinion not even a doctor. Doctors get bribes in the form of  speaker fees for pharma companies. To prescribe drugs and procedures. Pharma companies and docs are indicted all time for violations of anti kickback laws and unnecessary procedures.  Patients are commodities to a doctor to command fees from insurance companies and speaker fee from pharma. Wake up and educate yourself. Learn to read a vaccine insert. </p>
