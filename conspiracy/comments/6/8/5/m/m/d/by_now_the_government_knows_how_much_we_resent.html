        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is arrogance at its finest folks. If it was me, I would seriously consider fixing this hot mess before the people end up crucifying me on my own front lawn because that WILL happen eventually if the elite continue on their course for planetary conquest. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how people like John McCain, James Comey, the head of the CIA, or Hillary Clinton are able to walk in public and act like everything is perfectly rosy when it&#39;s not. It&#39;s the complete opposite. People see these rulers as the lowest form of scumbag imaginable and they continue to parade themselves in public as a goodie 2 shoes genius who&#39;s life work is to be a servant to the people when in fact, they are the complete opposite. These people equate to a vile poison and spread misery, corruption, and suffering strictly to enrich and entertain themselves as small Gods. </p>

<p>These people should be cursed and spit on every time they are seen in public. That will send a nice message that the people will not tolerate another instance of this savagery. And if they are too thick skulled to listen to us, we will get louder and louder until they learn the hard lesson many tyrants of the past have learned: You can&#39;t go against the will of the people and expect to survive. </p>

<p>When gangsters start reaping what they sow, they often realize that it was all a stupid idea and flip inside of their own mind but outwardly they tend to act neutral. </p>

<p>We need to shake things up a lot more than this. We are the consequence that will crush this cabal. We need to show our disdain in public and in front of cameras 24/7. We can shake this country to its core if we just speak out in places where we are heard. We need to badger people like James Comey endlessly everywhere we go. There is always some good that can be done even if it&#39;s redpilling a cousin at a BBQ. </p>

<p>they dont care because the govt knows that nothing changes, most of the people out there are still happy enough or do not give a damn enough about what is going on as long as they get what they are enjoying.</p>

<p>people know they are ruled by scum, but they dont care enough because these scum give them what they need and protect what they give a damn about. they dont get everything on earth but they get enough to not do anything about it or risk losing them.</p>

<p>coz guess what, people are not goodie 2 shoes themselves. its not that people are not awake or they dont know whats going on. they know shit is going on coz there always is , people just dont care lol</p>

They like it better when you&#39;re there on the ground
And up &#39;til now I&#39;ve never made a sound
Hey, hey</p>

But they sure know how to beat the hell out of one
Sometimes I think they do it just for the fun
Hey, hey</p>

<p>But no, I&#39;m not leaving, even though I&#39;m bleeding
Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I&#39;m gonna take it
Until I win</p>

<p>&#39;Cause I&#39;m a comeback, I&#39;m a comeback kid
Don&#39;t know why bad things happened, but they did
I don&#39;t think I deserve the hurt I get, but I&#39;m made for it
It&#39;s not the end, no, it&#39;s not the end
I&#39;m a comeback kid
Down for a minute, I&#39;ll get up again
Looks like I&#39;m breaking, but it&#39;s just a bend; it&#39;s not over yet
&#39;Cause in the end
I&#39;m a comeback, I&#39;m a comeback kid</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna finish what I started now
You interrupted me with all your doubts
How dare you forget where I started out
Oh oh, oh oh</p>

Even though this nightmare makes me wish I was dreaming
Even though I hate it, I&#39;m gonna take it
Until I win</p>

&#39;Cause in the end
I&#39;m a comeback, I&#39;m a comeback kid, uh-huh</p>

<p>I believe in what I am, I believe in what I was
I believe in losing you, I&#39;ve never been given so much
I believe it&#39;s been a year, the worst one I&#39;ve ever lived
I believe I&#39;m better now than I have ever been
I believe that ever since everything went south
I believed in every word that ever came out of my mouth
I believe you missed me, but you don&#39;t have to miss me, &#39;cause
I&#39;m not leaving again</p>

<p>&#39;Cause I&#39;m a comeback, I&#39;m a comeback kid
Down for a minute, I&#39;ll get up again
Looks like I&#39;m breaking, but it&#39;s just a bend; it&#39;s not over yet

Yeah, I&#39;m a comeback, I&#39;m a comeback kid
I&#39;m not leaving, I&#39;m not leaving
Not leaving again, I&#39;m not leaving
Not leaving again, I&#39;m not leaving</p>

I ain&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead</p>

<p>Well, the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#39;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>

<p>So much to do, so much to see
So what&#39;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t go
You&#39;ll never shine if you don&#39;t glow</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Hey, now, you&#39;re an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you&#39;re a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool place and they say it gets colder
You&#39;re bundled up now wait &#39;til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture</p>

<p>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water&#39;s getting warm so you might as well swim
My world&#39;s on fire. How about yours?
That&#39;s the way I like it and I&#39;ll never get bored.</p>

<p>[Chorus 2x]</p>

<p>Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change</p>

<p>Well, the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#39;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>

<p>So much to do, so much to see
So what&#39;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t go
You&#39;ll never shine if you don&#39;t glow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as people have their personal need met, nobody is going to revolt. 
Because a revolt could mean that you could very much lose the ease of life you are enjoying right now.
Only those with nothing to lose will go against their governers.</p>

<p>And that is why we have mobile phones, stupid mindless singing or talent shows. A sort of good life [compared to the rest of the world], with education etc.</p>

<p>In civilised countries, it&#39;s almost a trade off. You can do whatever you like and I will turn a blind eye, as long as I have it easy.</p>

<p>Or maybe the other way round: Let us do what we want and your lives stay easy.</p>

<p>Take your pick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain&#39;t the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an &quot;L&quot; on her forehead</p>

<p>Well, the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#39;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>

<p>So much to do, so much to see
So what&#39;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t go
You&#39;ll never shine if you don&#39;t glow</p>

<p>[Chorus:]
Hey, now, you&#39;re an All Star, get your game on, go play
Hey, now, you&#39;re a Rock Star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cool place and they say it gets colder
You&#39;re bundled up now wait &#39;til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture</p>

<p>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water&#39;s getting warm so you might as well swim
My world&#39;s on fire. How about yours?
That&#39;s the way I like it and I&#39;ll never get bored.</p>

<p>[Chorus 2x]</p>

<p>Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change</p>

<p>Well, the years start coming and they don&#39;t stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn&#39;t make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb</p>

<p>So much to do, so much to see
So what&#39;s wrong with taking the back streets?
You&#39;ll never know if you don&#39;t go
You&#39;ll never shine if you don&#39;t glow.</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
