<p>Would you hang this up for everyone to see? This is an adult in a diaper or multiple panties meant to look like a child. The left hand is small and depicts a child&#39;s hand, while the right is of an adults grabbing the stomach of the adult dressed to depict a baby. </p>

<hr/>

<p>This piece is part of Anna Gaskell&#39;s collection, Hide. The description of the series, provided by the Duke Street exhibition, which ran from February 5th to March 6th, 1999, according to the website of UK art gallery, White Cube, connotes incest and pedophilia as the series&#39; primary inspiration.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Anna Gaskell’s exhibition was inspired by the Brothers Grimm story, The Magic Donkey, a macabre tale about a girl who crafts a costume from animal hides in order to escape the advances of her father. It should be noted that the tale of &quot;Donkey Skin&quot; is a variant of the traditional Brothers Grimm tale. Both versions of the story involve a king father&#39;s interest in marrying his princess daughter. </p>

<p>WashingtonPost invited to Podesta&#39;s home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not always. Folks attending a house tour in the Lake Barcroft neighborhood in Falls Church earlier this year got an eyeful when they walked into a bedroom at the Podesta residence hung with multiple color pictures by Katy Grannan, a photographer known for documentary-style pictures of naked teenagers in their parents&#39; suburban homes.</p>

<p><strong>Lets look at how humanatrian the Podesta Group is...</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/07/14/19930/rape-murder-famine-and-21-million-k-street-pr">https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/07/14/19930/rape-murder-famine-and-21-million-k-street-pr</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A U.N. report on human rights, accountability and reconciliation in South Sudan, released in March, offered a contrasting assessment. * “Despite repeated commitments to end the violence, protect civilians and punish perpetrators, to date, there is no evidence or available public information of any genuine efforts by the government to investigate, prosecute and punish violations and abuses, some of them amounting to international crimes,” the report states. For its part, Podesta discouraged sanctions in press materials as something that “will undoubtedly lead to [the] collapse of [a] fragile peace agreement, resulting in potential loss of lives and suffering for the people of South Sudan.”But the humanitarian expert said South Sudan’s lobbying efforts included statements that were “just blatantly, patently false” in portraying the nation.“This is the first time ever, since I’ve done this job,” said the expert, “… that I’ve had to lobby against a professional lobbying firm [Podesta Group] which is trying to undermine peace, and human rights and humanitarian efforts.”</p>

<p><strong>Relationship to #Pizzagate</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Connection to the Washington Post
The Podesta Group and the Washington Post also had key &quot;revolving door&quot; hires from one another. Perhaps most significantly, Tony Podesta was employed by the Washington Post, while running the Podesta Group. For more information, see the page in this wiki for the Washington Post.</p>

<p>Let us not forget the Washington Post scrubbed the Tony Podesta article after Pizzagate as well as the Norway pedophile bust.</p>

<p>Additional Relevant Facts
2015 Effort to Disprove All Articles on Sex Trafficking
The Washington Post made a concerted effort in 2015 to disprove all articles which may induce concern regarding the growing sex trafficking industry in the United States.[1] In total, the Washington Post attempted to disprove five articles regarding sex trafficking, with some of the articles focused on disproving statistics on child sex trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biased Washington Post Articles on the Pizzagate Investigation
The Washington Post has written several biased articles on the Pizzagate investigation. The reason for that bias can be seen below by whom they are connected to.</p>

<p>The first Pizzagate article by the Washington Post was biased simply by attempting to artificially claim the full scope of the investigation was whether restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, had a child sex dungeon on its premises.[2] The Post also knowingly made false claims in the article such as this one: &quot;This part is false: pictures purporting to show that symbols, such as butterflies and spirals, in signs at Comet and other shops were statements about pedophilia&quot; This is a reference to the symbols that, according to a 2007 FBI bulletin, the FBI recognizes as being in use by pedophiles.[3] Those symbols appear in materials by Comet Ping Pong and nearby establishments, as well as in materials by Comet Ping Pong musicians. For more on those symbols in the uses described, see Besta Pizza, Terasol Bistro and Amanda Kleinman.</p>

<p>The second Washington Post article on Pizzagate, regarding Ben Swann&#39;s investigate report from January 18th, 2017,[4] cherrypicks facts that Swann brings up in an attempt to discredit him. The Post article even admits to refusing to discuss certain facts in Swann&#39;s report, such as the Podesta&#39;s close friendship with admitted pedophile, Dennis Hastert, or that Tony Podesta collects art of nude teenagers by Katy Grannan.[5]</p>

<p>The Washington Post also wrote a biased article on the circumstances surrounding the death of human trafficking investigator, Monica Petersen.[6] For more information on the bias within the Washington Post article, visit the Monica Petersen page.</p>

<p>The origins of Spirit Cooking can (allegedly) be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley, and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”.</p>

<p>Performance &quot;art&quot;--rpse of one of Jeffrey Dahmer&#39;s victims.</p>

<p>Info on Louise Bourgeois: <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Louise_Bourgeois#Role_in_Pizzagate.23Arch_of_Hysteria">http://pizzagate.wiki/Louise_Bourgeois#Role_in_Pizzagate.23Arch_of_Hysteria</a></p>

<p>Here is an article showing how it is related to an Aleister Crowley illustration and text: <a href="http://tracytwyman.com/dahmer-pose-statue-in-tony-podestas-house-matches-illustration-from-aleister-crowley-text/">http://tracytwyman.com/dahmer-pose-statue-in-tony-podestas-house-matches-illustration-from-aleister-crowley-text/</a></p>

<p>So, not just cannibals but Satanists too.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another take on the arched figure in Tony Podesta&#39;s house (warning NSFW): <a href="http://www.gelitin.net/projects/arc-de-triomphe/">http://www.gelitin.net/projects/arc-de-triomphe/</a></p>

<p>and this, by the same &quot;artists&quot;: <a href="http://www.gelitin.net/projects/frieze/">http://www.gelitin.net/projects/frieze/</a></p>

<p>Now this group, which changed their name from &quot;Gelatin&quot; (term for explosives: <a href="http://www.dictionaryofconstruction.com/definition/gelatin-blasting.html">http://www.dictionaryofconstruction.com/definition/gelatin-blasting.html</a> ) to &quot;Gelitin&quot; has such depraved art that it even includes &quot;performance art&quot; coprophilia. They brag about this and more on their official website: <a href="http://www.gelitin.net/projects">http://www.gelitin.net/projects</a></p>

<p>This is their work entitled &quot;Innocents with dirty feet&quot; (make of that title what you will): <a href="http://www.gelitin.net/projects/innocents/">http://www.gelitin.net/projects/innocents/</a></p>

<p>They are noteworthy for their masterpiece called &quot;The B thing&quot;, originally published for $35 which is now a $2,000 book on their &quot;project&quot; in the WTC before September 11, 2001. They occupied the non-residential towers for years.</p>

<p>Here is an excellent video tying the whole thing together: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxU_xAakxRQYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxU_xAakxRQYouTube</a></p>

<p>Performance &quot;art&quot;--an excuse for pornography.</p>
