        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I just wanted to say thanks to all of you who are researching tirelessly to find links and prove our government and corporations are not in our best interest and holding us as a race back (some would say its an all out war).</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard for me not to get angry and lose my cool when reading half of these posts, not because of the poster but because of the injustices that happen. It&#39;s like what can we do against basically a tidal wave of force? We can&#39;t win by using the same tactics--that much is obvious. </p>

<p>I know it sounds cheezy but I think we have to fight with love. In a world of mass delusion and subterfuge where our rights are intentionally taken away, when the cards are stacked heavily against us we have a few options. We can fight back with all the rage and anger, and probably get nowhere. I don&#39;t fully discount that method though because mass mobilization is usually rooted in anger and disbelief. </p>

<p>But since each of us are a small piece of the pie I&#39;ve been trying to just be patient with others and take a step back. Go slower, disconnect a little more. When our time comes (and it will) we&#39;ll be ready. Like the game of subterfuge they play against us, we can play it back by not playing at all. By not absorbing all the hearesy and the continual bombardment of information and facebook/instagram photos, it slows us done and lets us think. Then were at least a little bit free.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to everyone here. I appreciate your work. Keep on keepin on </p>
