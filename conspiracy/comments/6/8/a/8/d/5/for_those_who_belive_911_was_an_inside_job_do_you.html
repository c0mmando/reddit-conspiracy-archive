    <div class="md"><p>to be honest i think that trump can be easily tricked into sending us to war and his followers would be all for it ... so not much a need for a false flag ... at that time before 9/11 i think people were more worried about the economy and other things no one wanted any part of a war  ... now its seems like anger and race and nationalism have come to the forefront  a toxic mix created by the media   that will undoubtedly send us bombing the shit out of someone </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmmm i suscribed to this theory somewhat before this election  when i heard about the supposed obama imitating a chicago actor and the actor told people obama was groomed since he was younger for the presidency .. but this election sure seemed to not be planned at all  just two extremely powerful people schemin against eachother  Trump won and i think he is clearly the lesser of the two evils ... clinton seems like a demon cloaked in a old saggy vagina costume </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an inside job but I don&#39;t think they told Bush about it lol. Why would they need to? The president doesn&#39;t control much. Surely after the attacks he would want to go to war like the rest of America did.</p>

<p>Unless he is faking it then he is one of the dumbest motherfuckers ever.  When they told him the country had been attacked in that classroom I think he knew it was a false flag attack but his reaction was more of a &quot;fuckkkk did we really do that?&quot;</p>
