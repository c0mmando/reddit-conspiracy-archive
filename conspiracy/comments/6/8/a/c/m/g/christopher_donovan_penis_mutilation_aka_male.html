      <p>
       Like millions of non-Jewish men in America, I am circumcised.  Until my wife became pregnant with a boy, it was never anything I reflected upon too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s all I’ve ever known, and mostly all I’ve ever seen in the American locker room.  When I inquired of my parents about my own circumcision, I was told that it was just “what everyone did” at the hospital.  I was whisked away for the procedure with nary a discussion.  They also didn’t give it much thought, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       But reflect on that for a second:  a bizarre ritual in which sharp instruments slice up the most intensely personal part of the male body, right after birth, and for which is there is almost no legitimate medical explanation.  That’s just what “everyone does”?  How does that insanity come to be?
      </p>
      <p>
       When female circumcision (or “mutilation” — note the difference in terminology) is discussed, it’s treated as a brutally sexist and barbaric practice — an incomprehensible horror designed to oppress women.  But male genital mutilation — which is really what it is — is barely mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       For our son, the decision was easy:  no circumcision.  Informing my decision was 1) the increasing medical evidence that circumcision’s supposed benefits are outweighed by its drawbacks, and 2) my suspicion that “universal circumcision” is a Jewish attempt to normalize their practice and render them indistinguishable from the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       My boy was born whole, and he’ll stay whole.  Other fathers’ justifications of “he should look like me” struck me as absurd.  Our people have to start clawing their way back to some identity, and we might as well start now.  Should any question arise, I’m happy to explain that his penis was not clipped because that’s a ritual primarily of the Jews, and he’s not Jewish.  That might be a nice starting point for any number of discussions and thinking on his part.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other reasons to keep our boys whole, I come to find out.  One correspondent tells me than in researching this topic, he discovered that an erect circumcised penis is necessarily somewhat shorter — unlike the “full capacity” uncircumcised penis, it’s got less skin to expand and fill with blood.  Many sources report that there are crucial nerve endings in the cut-off portion of the penis, so that sexual pleasure is reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       That squares with the minimal research I’ve done — mostly confined to the Internet — which has rabbis acknowledging that pouring a little cold water on the male libido is indeed one good result of circumcision.  Maimonides is said to have mentioned this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically, according to Jews, circumcision was strictly a rite — and a very important one, at that — that did not rest on any medical justification.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, it appears that circumcision may have originated as some sort of substitute for actual human sacrifice.  The ancient Egyptians may have started it, and other non-Jewish peoples appear to have practiced it, but in the ancient world, it became a distinguishing rite of the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Europe and Britain of recent history, it appears that circumcision was practiced almost exclusively by Jews.  I recall that in the Holocaust movie “Europa Europa“, the Jewish protagonist, a young boy, escapes into the fold of the Nazis because of his “Aryan” good looks, and tries to complete the picture by stretching his own foreskin stub down enough to make him look uncircumcised.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it’s obvious that in Europe in World War II, a Jew was indelibly and unmistakably distinguished from non-Jews by the practice of circumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
       A question that burns for me is:  were Jews responsible for persuading so many American gentiles to peform this bizarre ritual, primarily as a way to “normalize” the practice and remove the stigma?  Perhaps they thought that if everyone were circumcised, the young protagonist of “Europa Europa” would never have faced the difficulties he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The topic cries out for research.  I would love to know how circumcision spread from an ethnically particular practice — one that, in the words of Sir Richard Burton, was “held in horror” by Christendom — to something that “everyone does”.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is plenty to Google up about circumcision, with several sites taking a strong anti-circumcision stand, and a few Jewish sites defending it.  But none of these sites address the issue of whether Jews sought to persuade white American non-Jews to be circumcised.
      </p>
      <p>
       There does seem to be some evidence that fascination with germs and cleanliness motivated gentiles, independently of Jewish influence, to practice circumcision.  But if it’s even partly true that Jews encouraged “universal circumcision” so as to disguise their practice as ethnically unique, white non-Jews should be embarrassed.  It would mean that they allowed a stereotypically tricky group of Jews to convince them to perform this ritual on their boys without ever questioning or thinking about it.  So flaccid (if you will) was the white sense of racial strength and solidarity — and their sense of skepticism at Jewish claims — that they quite literally got their dicks nicked.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might almost call it a “mass ethnic rape” of non-Jewish males by Jews.  That many millions of males subjected to that physical trauma at birth — and denied that extra measure of sexual satisfaction — just so that Jewish males could “hide out in the open”?  Staggering to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Jews can talk “the goyim” into doing that, what can’t they talk them into?  Persuading them to fight their wars in the Middle East seems like child’s play by comparison.  Persuading them to stop reproducing, to divorce at the drop of a hat, to give up their power slots, their property, their very lives?  No problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know for sure that Jews persuaded the rest of us to become circumcised in order to disguise themselves in the open.  But the bare evidence available does seem to fit the theory, and as with so many thing Jewish, the incredible dearth of research and information on the topic makes me yet more suspicious — especially given that it seems to be the very sort of thing that curious academics tuck into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we afraid to tackle the issue because of offending Jewish sensibilities?  Do men avoid the topic because they don’t like to admit that they’ve had a part of their penises cut off, and never had any say in the matter?  I think all of this may be going on, but the larger lesson could be that goyim, in their ethnic competition with Jews, find themselves badly outmatched when it comes to the power of persuasion.

       Well... Ill say this. Out of all my past flings and lady friends. Zero complaints. Like quite the opposite /: I heard my senior year of highschool "thank fucking god you're cut"

       And I dont remember the actual procedure so it's whatever to me.

       Yeah because they have been taught that. 
In Europe it's the opposite. I personally would rather not sleep with someone who has had a part of his penis removed. The scar looks ugly and the dry glans combined with the complete lack of lubrication and gliding action makes it uncomfortable.

       Doesn't female genital mutilation involving removing the clitorus so they can't receive pleasure?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the jews believs this is their tradition I almost feel like they wouldn't want others doing in..just my opinion though.

       Yes - I think female genital mutilation is different.  The reasons behind it are to ensure she is a virgin at marriage and remains faithful - the not receiving pleasure part is the main reason it is done.  The impetus behind male circumcision was for hygienic reasons.

       Hospitals sell foreskins for medical research. If the medical system males a buck off of it you can be sure they will never advocate people saving money.

       So therefore babies should have a part of their healthy genitals removed because of what you think. That's interesting.....

       I think scars on the genitals is ugly. If adults want to get altered then go ahead.

       Every single person can freely decide whether or not they want to circumcise their child or their own dick. The problem I have with this post is that it's too fucking long-winded about the Jews coercing people, at some undisclosed point in time, to snip dick skin as if it's inherently evil and horrible and a manifestation of the " " "JEW AGENDA" " ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Complications with the foreskin are NOT rare. It's case by case, there's no ultimate truth, and the aesthetic and health benefits are subjective. I understand that OP and others feel that it's wrong to "mutilate" a baby and I don't necessarily disagree with that. But my dick is circumcised and I orgasm all the same. When getting blown or having intercourse, there is no damaging lack of sensitivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, like another poster said, the vast majority of Arabic/Middle Eastern peoples practice circumcision. Fuck those Jews more specifically tho, brah.

       But they can't freely decide if their parents did it to them when they were a kid. That's the problem.

       Nowhere near as common as a lot of people would have us believe. Speaking as someone who had to have a procedure at the age of 33
       <strong>
        because
       </strong>
       of a circumcision inflicted upon me as an infant, I'd prefer it if I had a problem with my normal, whole, "god-given", standard-issue penis than having a problem that is the direct result of a procedure I didn't need and despise. But that's me.

       Being "blown" is mildly pleasant for me. Nothing more. As for intercourse, when there's a condom involved, it might as well be some other guy's dick. I seldom bother these days.

       Very poor use of the word atavism. You tried. A for effort 👍 but for future use, you sound like an over sensitive fuckwit when you use and adjective as a noun.

       Just because worse is  done to a small percentage of females doesn't somehow make it ok to chop off part of a man's penis!  And it's done to basically all male people residing in a so called first world country.  If we weren't meant to be born with a foreskin we wouldn't be.  Somehow it's thought to be "barbaric” to mutilate a female, but not a male?  How!? People are so blind to how brainwashed they really are...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not religious, but if I were, I'd think God would be highly insulted that we'd find the need to alter his creation... The religious nuts are totally insane.  So is the medical industry.  They profit off the "surgery" and then again, by selling the foreskins to makeup companies and for stem cell research and such.  It's total lunacy.

       Doesn't an exposed penis head become desensitized after being exposed for a length of time, as well as reducing the natural ability to self-lubricate?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a female I don't think it would be justified to take away this part of male sexuality in order to meet what is strictly an aesthetic preference for most people. I would certainly not have my own child circumcised nor expect my partner to be.

       Ehh? This is way too blamey. There's no reason to think historical circumcision propaganda was as political as you think or at least in the way you think it was political. The issue is really much more complex than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a relatively small group of circumcision propagandists convinced almost the entire US and some other countries (Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand) to cut male infants' genitals, and obviously some of those circumcision propagandists were Jewish, and Jewish people would have generally supported that propaganda for the obvious reasons like the penile superiority aspect. But one particularly salient fact you are ignoring in your history is that the Jews were persecuted because of certain bloodlibel rumors about them forcing circumcision on others, so they had very good reason to be anxious to prevent negative rumors about it and also to encourage others to perceive it positively as they did instead of as mutilating or hypersexualizing or any other negative ideas about it that people had ever had.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a book about the issue by a medical doctor and Jewish scholar who came to consider circumcision unethical after learning more about it.

       For the inevitable people who will come in and say "but it is different because reasons X,Y, and Z":
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many different forms of FGM, not all FGM is complete clitoris removal and infibulation. Some forms of FGM are very comparable to male circumcision like removing the clitoral hood or inner labia, some forms of FGM are way less destructive than male circumcision like a "ritual pinprick"; all of which are still illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all FGM is done behind bush in Africa with a rusty razor blade or broken glass like a lot people seem to think. In Malaysia and Indonesia, female circumcision is done in hospitals by trained doctors.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention">
        John Harvey Kellogg
       </a>
       (yes the cereal guy) in the late 1890s, he popularized it as a way to stop young boys from masturbating, which was considered unhealthy at the time and the cause of everything from insanity to paralysis. He also recommended burning the clitoris off of young masturbating girls, but luckily that never caught on.
