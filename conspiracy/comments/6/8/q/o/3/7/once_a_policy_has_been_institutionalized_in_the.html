       The founding fathers intentionally tried to make it as hard as possible for the federal government to get anything done unless most everyone agreed. They were concerned about tyrants of course, but they also wanted to ensure cooperation among the states.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as hard as it is to get meaningful change passed at the federal level, it seems infinitely more difficult to undo that change, even if nearly everyone agrees looking back the change was a bad move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has a check and a balance and are themselves a check and balance to someone else. But once a policy is federalized, that means it benefits at least the enforcer who would otherwise be out of a job, and getting them to agree to fire themselves is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took a civil war to remove the institution of slavery from this nation. There was just too much money in it. There is also too much money in abortion, Obamacare, the drug war, and all those other shitty things that nearly everyone hates but no one can get rid of. It will take a civil war to remove those as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to demoralize anyone, quite the opposite. If you're committed to removing something it will take an actual war to do it.

       You make a decent point, but, historically there was not that much profit in slavery, hence the Civil War. The North declared economic warfare on the South. If Slavery was a profitable as you say, and is said, then this wouldn't of happened. The South could've steam rolled the North.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of people who flew the Confederate flag did not have slaves, nor would they of joined up, to protect the practice of their ruling elites. It was life and death, for them. It goes much deeper, and this history is currently being erased with the destruction of historical statues and history in the schools.

       Why do should I pay for other people's shit, forcefully? Also, why would I want to pay for the death of children? So many people are against war and death, yet the clinic down the street provides it on the daily, and people call that "women's rights". One side has the moral ground, the other does not.

       A liberal arts degree requires, math, science, foreign language and art, history, literature and expertise in our own language, English. You must choose a major and your major must include advanced classes, double majors are common. Courses like economics have been added to those to choose for a major.
      </p>

       I have never understood why conservatives hate liberal arts degrees they are  multi-disciplinary and not easy.

       That's because you are not "liberal". You are authoritarian and extremely bias. I've been here for a very long time, and I know the words you write. I challenge you. You still play this stupid two party paradigm of authoritarians. I have my opinions, but at the end of the day, I could care less what you do. As long as you are not hurting others. If you do, that's where my 50 cal comes in.... Live and let live... Don't fuck with your neighbors or force me to do shit, and I will not do that, either...

       Second, stop projecting so hard lmfao. I don't wish anyone dead, and I don't hate people with different political identities. Unless you're a doomsday cultist, you know, like you are, we as citizens all working toward a better world, so I cannot hate. I can only be disappointed that the right and left are equally blind to how politicians screw them over, and I do my best to help win that fight, instead of just hoping everyone dies like you do.

       You mistake my confidence about who I am and what I believe as authoritarian.  I actually consider it to be immoral to try to change what someone else believes.
