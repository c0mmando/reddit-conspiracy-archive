       So I was watching the video of the 13 year old kid talking about Cern and all that jazz, and also some videos about Cern's use of Shiva, and I had a scary thought... what if Cern has unknowingly (or knowingly) tested the quantum suicide theory, and our original universe was destroyed and phased into another reality wash, rinse, repeat. Now I already know I'm gonna get a lot of hate, downvotes and r/shittyconspiracy blah blah blah for this post so bring it. This is just a thought, and personally I haven't decided what side of the fence I'm on with the Mandella Effect even though it's kinda creepy. I'm just curious if anyone else has had this thought?

       Thank you - I had watched this a couple days ago wanted to be sure it was that video.

       The past few long months or more, I've certainly sensed or perceived that people and earth have made some drastic shifts.

       That CERN opened up a portal - highly probable. That there has been a marked increase in open depravity - IMHO, yes. That the

       Here is what cern is doing: farming antimatter. 
Hence there now being 11+ haldron colliders. Pretty obvious 1 or 2 would have been needed to test the big bang theory and black hole production etc.

       Imo he is misreable and he should be placed in protective custody until his parents go on a rehab program to discover the differences between effective and non effective parenting strategies; and acceptable tolerances in child rearing. The kid is acting out in a dangerous manner and he will likely take his own life in a spout of depression to 'move. On' to the next dimension...

       The human brain is a recorder. We assess information and absorb it in this stage of development. The theory of the multiverse is only a theory and a widely argued one at that.

      <p>
       The kid recites information he was told and the adult in the video coerces specific channels of information each tine the childs mind is sidetracked. This is a long term system of abuse on the child.

       This is the work of a rather smart adult male encouraging and influencing a young child to see 'differences' in two realitys that are one in the same. Information is stored in matter. So if our universe 'ended' the matter does not transition. It dies too.

       Noting also cern is only a haldron collider. They are soecifically farming antimatter with the devices. As there are 13 of them by my last count. You only need 1 if the basis of reasoning was to simply 'test the big bang' via atomic bombardments of atom on atom near light speed collisions.

       Its the discovery and collection of exotic and rare elements which keeps the government interested in their building more and more (larger) colliders.

       Note also antimatter engines were designed years ago and our aspirations for long diatance space travel are humanity's next truly unknown frontier.

       Are you out to lunch? Do you think Einstein was inventing his (flawed) theories when he was a kid? No, he was an old man who had time to make it through academia. Theories invented before academia are absolutely useless as anyone who goes through that drivel will soon realize there is far more overhead conforming to the community than deriving original work, hence anything created before entering the community would not be aware of how to write a paper that actually means anything or can convince anyone of a single thing.

       It sounds like you understand FAR less about infinities than this 13-year old. Do you even know who George Cantor is? Comparing infinities to each other is a long-studied mathematical practice and you think... it doesn't exist?

      <p>
       Einstein was a mathmatical genius using his skillset to explore the very algebra expressions utilized to discover patents. He already mastered basic mathematical expressions at an early age. So he was far more capable if expressing his work then you give him credit for.

       You undersell actual work ethic to promote a  child who has no grasp on basic calculus- So its obvious your either being intentually naive and sadistic or simply are just that.

       I am well aware about the practical use of infinity. (as well as the symbol for its use); Ive just never seen it regurgitated by a minor thats suffering from child abuse live on youtube.

       Forcing concepts upon a young mind is absolutely considered gross manipulation of the pupil.

       It becomes a crime when the child is promoted to a dangerous level which is to be considered (or not) by a judge and jury.

       I don't see this ending well for the parents when the child fails to produce any content on his own; in revelation to the items he is addressing.

       Einstein was not an obvious genius from an early age, he got good marks generally but was not producing
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       approaching meaningful work until he was 21 at least. This kid still has 8 years to go before he is where Einstein was just starting. His 4 famous papers came when he was 26, so this kid is just half the age Einstein was.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Was he a bad student? He started school at 6½ and, according to an Albert Einstein Archives biography, his early teachers did not find him especially talented even though  he got high marks. He hated the strict protocols  followed by teachers and rote learning demanded of students, which explains his disdain for school, which he carried with him when, at age 9½, he entered the Luitpold Gymnasium, a competitive school. He liked some subjects better than others but progressed through school, again earning high marks. By age 11, he was reading college physics books, and at 13 he decided that Kant was his favorite author after reading the “Critique of Pure Reason.” He was clearly brilliant to anybody paying attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Did he flunk math? He did fine in math, but he did flunk the entrance exam to the Zurich Polytechnic when he first took it — when he was about 1 1/2 years away from graduating high school, at age 16, and hadn’t had a lot of French, the language in which the exam was given. He did fine on the math section but failed the language, botany and zoology sections, according to history.com. A 1984 New York Times story says that the essay Einstein wrote for this exam was “full of errors” but pointed to his later interests.

       , not infinity. There are many varying grades of infinity, which is what you seem to be failing to grasp. Not all infinities are equal and they can be compared by their ordinality and cardinality. I hope you are familiar with set theory at least? Also, when writing infinity, the squiggle could be seen as an obvious shortcut to a whole figure-8, I do the same with my own writing (simplify symbols/greek letters).

       Lmfao, relativity had been floating around since 1895, it just wasn't clearly defined. He did all his work on the backs of Poincare, Lorentz, Planck, and Hilbert, among others. His 1905 paper had no citations, but was clearly built off of Poincare's 1902 La science et l'hypothèse.

       The father barely understands the Mandela effect, how do you think he understands how the weight of an electron would be tied to what universe formation we are in right now? Do you think he understands that tuning meta-parameters is equivalent to switching universes in a higher dimension? Do you think he understands the flatness problem and how this is relevant to our self-regulating universe? The father doesn't even understand his comparison of infinities, let alone what the kid is really trying to explain.

       These parents don't understand a damn thing their kid is saying, hence they go "Geeze maybe someone on the Internet would know about this" and post it on Youtube, and instead your magical theory is they invented all these theories, planted them in his mind and made him repeat them, and somehow play dumb about the whole thing?

       Dude, go argue with the damn kid then!!! Many-worlds interpretation CLEARLY implies quantum suicide. Nobody would ever know if they successfully committed quantum suicide, the conscious you experiencing this would only know the successful timeline, but would never comprehend the one where you died.

       I'm not saying you're an idiot, I'm saying the kid is clearly above-average intelligence for a 13-year old and that his delivery suggests that he has a somewhat solid understanding of the material. So go ahead, disprove what he said in the video.

       Are you really supporting obvious child abuse?

       It would be different if the kid reached the age of majority. Or even minority. Yet to actively expose a young pre adult member of our society to topics of suicide and willfully play along; (going as far as to monopolize it) is dangerous. Parents have civic obligations to report troubled children.

Keeping a child 'on track' to making 'dangerous assumptions' is called criminal coercement.

       I fully understand the lines and concepts of the 'mandella effect'. Yet its more easily said as differences in communications and lost wisdom via talking heads.

      <p>
       Add in intentional misinformation and imbellishment and there you have two seperate realitys sharing the same experiences. I.e. jan sees a car heading at her at a high rate of speed. Jon is the driver. They both explain the circumstances of the reality they witness from their own personal viewpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet this is the same reality-

      <p>
       Hence information is stored in your brains matter. 
It is not impervious to being destroyed when the information is lost. This is why the barrier of life and death seperates humans from our field of existence-

       Note we have 13 colliders now. Not much a conspiracy to assume that they have an ulterior use when they publically announce finding rare particles within their underground matrix's. 
Again 1 or 2 would be expected. When you see double digits it makes you have to makes one question their true intent..

       Vacuum chambers still contain significant amounts of matter, and the antimatter would collide with the walls and annihilate

       It really depends on the chamber design.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have nitroglycerin by example and use processes to make the material mobile. So I see no complication in the worlds leading scientific bodies coming to a relevant solution. We already create antimatter fragments. They don't seem to destroy the colliders thenselves.
      </p>

       So there seems to be a logic fallocy within your own admission. Being the world as it is.

      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein was a mathmatical genius using his skillset to explore the very algebra expressions utilized to discover patents. He already mastered basic mathematical expressions at an early age. So he was far more capable if expressing his work then you give him credit for.

       You undersell actual work ethic to promote a  child who has no grasp on basic calculus- So its obvious your either being intentually naive and sadistic or simply are just that.

       I am well aware about the practical use of infinity. (as well as the symbol for its use); Ive just never seen it regurgitated by a minor thats suffering from child abuse live on youtube.

       You have no explaination for your actions. This is called 'damage control' or 'brain damage'. Citing physicists as though your aware makes me feel you personally nurture this childs development. Its appauling-

       I know einstein was a genius because its proven that his theories were his own.

       There is no telling how severely affected he will become as his 'genius' is picked apart revealing a sad mislead child whose parents filled his head with wild ideas and delusions of grandeur-

       They would but we haven't come up with a good way to test it yet. Everything we know of is a part of the simulation how would we test that it is just a simulation. If you come up with a good idea you could win a nobel there :D
