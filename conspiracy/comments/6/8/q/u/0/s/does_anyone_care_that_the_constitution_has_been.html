      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are other ways to trace the bacteria's source. The anthrax sent to Senator Daschle's office was weaponized -- that is, it had been pulverized by the method that Bill Patrick pioneered almost forty years ago. (Twenty-eight of the forty people in the area where the letter was opened tested positive for anthrax exposure.) The fact that it was weaponized means that the powder contained not only anthrax spores but the anti-caking material that allows the spores to float free. Identifying that material --which has been described as a fine, brownish particulate -- could help to pinpoint the source.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early analyses suggested that Iraq could be the source of the anthrax. Bill Patrick says that when he was in Iraq as a member of the United Nations Special Commission charged with dismantling Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction programs, he saw batches of a substance called bentonite -- a readily available material, brownish in color, that can be used to separate the anthrax spores into powdery particles. "It's not the material that we added to our weaponized agent, because we added a much better material," Patrick says. "But it will prevent, to a certain degree, sticking of the spores."
       </p>
       <p>
        By last week, though, the head of the U.S. Army lab had ruled out bentonite as an ingredient in the anthrax letters. This seemed to rule out Iraq, even as the Czech government confirmed that the presumed lead hijacker in the September 11th attacks, Mohamed Atta, had met with an Iraqi spy in Prague last April.
       </p>
       <p>
        In announcing the discovery that an anti-cling agent had been added to the anthrax sent through the mail, intelligence officials declared that only three nations in the world had the capacity to weaponize anthrax in that manner: the United States, the former Soviet Union, and Iraq. According to the Washington Post, an unnamed government official also said that
        <strong>
         "the totality of the evidence in hand suggests that it is unlikely that the spores were originally produced in the former Soviet Union or Iraq."

       Interesting, you might want to check out the posts of a certain "Anon5" about weapons on 4chan too.

       OFC the anthrax was from the USA. Also an interesting fact GW Bush did "kind of not actually" -
       <em>
        lie
       </em>
       - (that is
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       lightly formulated and with a grain of salt the size of the mount everest)
about Iraqi WMDs, they DID have anthrax, that was "supplied" by the USA for the Iran-Iraq war (back when Saddams regieme was still pro-US).

       I don't remember his name or all the details, but the guy they tried to pin this on that worked at some military facility here in the US fought back and actually won (was ultimately presumed innocent). By that point though he had lost pretty much everything though. After that, we never heard about the anthrax attacks again.

       I've tried to raise this point, that Martial Law's Congressionally-mandated ninety-day waiting period is obviated by the Federal SOE, which was extended by both w.bush and "Filp" Obama.

       CoG was established at least as now known through some declassified documentation by the Carter administration through FEMA.  This was as we are told a reaction to the lack of nuclear war planning by D.C. through out the Cold War.

       Continuity of Government operations were then taken over during the Reagan administration by Oliver North.  YouTube has the famed discussion between Inouye and North preserved for posterity.  Interested Redditors can also view the older Bill Moyers' program 'Shadow Government' for a peek back.

       As you said Peter Dale Scott has several excellent books on the subject and how they relate to 9-11.  I feel he falls a bit short in asking some deeper questions as to why it has been renewed every year by every president since then.

       Fact of the matter is that the United States is still in the state of emergency that has existed since World War II and we never 
fully demobilized from a war footing.

       Sincerely some of this was needed war planning and contingencies for preparation internally and externally for problems that could have arose with the Soviet Union.  However it appears as if our civil liberties, most importantly privacy rights are constantly being eroded with no cause given other than 'keeping us safe' with the renew of CoG activities.

       Nixon killed the war on poverty before it got started, the law was left  in place but Nixon used an E.O. and handed out the money in block grants for the cities and states to use  to enrich the developers who did all those "urban renewal" projects that ripped up their neighborhoods and turned them into money losing failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       That 30 year long talking point about the failed poverty program was all lies for dummies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happened is they locked up millions of African Aamerican men which somehow caused increased poverty (/s) and the urban renewal projects destroyed their home bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       All enhanced by all that cocaine the CIA delivered to their neighborhoods in the 80s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original goal of DEA was lock up hippie war protesters  and African Americans his white middle class voters whined about their children being locked up so only the poor white youths went to prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think I approve of DEA.

       It bothers me. It's beyond hopeless to change though so get fixed to prevent bringing any more slaves into this horror show and live frugally. Plant a veggie garden and try to make friends with other resourceful and trustworthy people and fucking grieve for what could have been... That's what I'm doing at least

       Probably planned way ahead of 9/11, they made sure to be ready to 'sneak' this in while everyone was too busy with the situation and its aftermath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially this privatizes the entire country, allowing critical parts of the government to act however they want.. make up their new system and pretend it's the real one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitution, at least for its age, was probably one of if not the most well though out foundations of a nation and would have given the masses the juridical tools and weapons to stop these globalist elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially they got rid of the biggest threat to them, and made sure almost nobody noticed that it went away. They do of course need to keep the charade going to keep the masses from understanding that all of their most basic rights are gone and that normal people are just going along with a made-up system.
      </p>
      <p>
       In essence I think it can be compared to the monetary system; it only works if people keep believing in it and keep reinforcing it. If they keep acting like they are in power rather than the masses (which are the ones the constitution gives power to), and people go along with that, they will actually have the power.

       The original Constitution was axed in 1871 if you didnt already know. As of 1871 the US Government became a corporation with the President as it's CEO.
The creation of the F.R.B. and the withdrawal from the gold standard also made reference to the original Constitution fruitless. 
It is safe to say that the US government as it appears in 2017 bears no relationship to the Constitution of 1787.

       Believe me, we cared a lot. We were spending money that we really didn't have to try to get Ron Paul into office two elections in a row.  Then we realized that the voice of the people did not fucking matter and became disgusted, jaded and somewhat hopeless. We just said, "Let the shit show begin" when Trump was elected.

       Wow.

       If that isn't the hot mess express, I don't know what the hell is. Honestly, if the current reality was a movie or book, not only would no one believe it, people would say that even for a fantasy genre, it is so far past realistic that they couldn't possibly get into the story.

       If anyone gets super interested or anyone popping into the top of the thread do some research on 'REX 84' or the article 'Garden Plot and the New Action Army' by Ron Ridenhour.

       Actual declassified documents for Garden Plot found here:

       Sincerely some of this was needed war planning and contingencies for preparation internally and externally for problems that could have arose with the Soviet Union.  However it appears as if our civil liberties, most importantly privacy rights are constantly being eroded with no cause given other than 'keeping us safe' with the renew of CoG activities.
