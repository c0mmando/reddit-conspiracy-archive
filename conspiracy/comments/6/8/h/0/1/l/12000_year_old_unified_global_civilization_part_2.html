        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Preface: Ancient human history remains a mystery to us. In my study of ancient cultures I have noticed a great many similarities in the architectural style, symbolism, and religious myths of many distinct civilizations. This has led me to question the origins of human civilization and I now pose the hypothesis that there was indeed an exceedingly advanced, unified, global civilization and culture that flourished before a cataclysmic series of meteor impacts approximately 12,000 years ago. Many of this culture&#39;s traditions and influences are present in the civilizations that began just after our most recent agricultural revolution.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/66xxvy/12000_year_old_unified_global_civilization_part_1/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/66xxvy/12000_year_old_unified_global_civilization_part_1/</a></p>

<p>Welcome everyone, welcome. For those of you returning, welcome back. </p>

<p>In this second installment, I will be tidying up my previous installment on the similarities in architectural methods and styles, as well as beginning my assessment of the similarities in symbolism.</p>

<p>Before we get started on symbolism, I would like to present a more thorough, ever growing set of photo albums documenting architectural similarities. As many of you have brought to my attention, my photo albums in the previous installment were sloppy and subject to error and for that, I apologize. Due to the resolution of many of the photos, I have not zoomed in or cropped the area of interest in each one. The feature designated by each album&#39;s title may not be immediately apparent, but I assure you they are there. Here are the revised photo albums, as well as a few others:</p>

<p>Megalithic Stones: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/jALxs">http://imgur.com/a/jALxs</a> </p>

<p>Polygonal Masonry: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/w0FH0">http://imgur.com/a/w0FH0</a></p>

<p>Trapezoidal Doorways/Windows: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PZWsK">http://imgur.com/a/PZWsK</a></p>

<p>Metal Links/Clamps: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/6A9so">http://imgur.com/a/6A9so</a></p>

<p>I am adding more photos by the day. These albums will continue growing as this series of posts progresses.</p>

<p>Now, onto some new stuff. </p>

<p>Rock-cut architecture is a style of architecture where instead of quarrying stone, transporting it, and moving it into place to build a structure, the structure is simply cut into the bedrock by carving, sculpting, and excavating the stone. What is most interesting is that this method can kill two birds with one stone. While making a rock-cut structure, the excavated stone can be repurposed for megalithic and non-megalithic masonry. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/eGivS">http://imgur.com/a/eGivS</a></p>

<p>One of the recurring themes we can observe at many of these megalithic and rock-cut sites is the presence of a culture with a far less sophisticated and advanced knowledge of stone working and architecture in general. In many cases where we see highly advanced stone cuts, megalithic stones, and extreme precision, we also see the presence of a far less sophisticated and advanced culture. In most instances, we see that these later cultures used clay and mud bricks, mortar, and smaller, weaker stones to build around these awe inspiring works of architecture. My hypothesis here is that in the millennia after the Younger Dryas cataclysm, when civilizations began to arise again, people settled around these great structures because they were aware of their cultural and historical significance. Just as they do today, these sites and their energy attract people towards them. This is why pharaohs, kings, and leaders of all sorts wanted to be buried within them. This is why they held such great importance in religious ritualism. They are remnants of our forgotten past. In any case, at these sites we see masterful work incorporated into later, cruder work. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WYMVs">http://imgur.com/a/WYMVs</a></p>

<p>What is symbolism? The idea of semiotics is that there is a signifier and a signified. We only know what is signified by a given signifier because our culture has attached meaning to it. For instance, the swastika is only recognized by its current connotation to maybe 4 or 5 generations at most, and only in certain parts of the world. If we were to show the swastika to someone 100, 200, 500, or 1000 years ago, it would have an entirely different meaning. In this same vein, many of the signifiers that we see recurring in glyphs, carvings, and reliefs must have held incredible importance and symbolic meaning to those who took the time to make them, not to mention that they were placed on such important structures. Again, in any case, we see the same symbols all over the world. They must have meant something to those who made them. </p>

<p>The Sphinx, Chimera, or Shapeshifter appears in nearly every culture. I only have compiled a few a few photos, but it is no secret that countless cultures and religions depict powerful figures as part human, part animal. Egyptian, Vedic, Mayan, Christian, Greek, Incan, and all matter of Pagans. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8zOnz">http://imgur.com/a/8zOnz</a></p>

<p>This next symbol is something I like to call the Chakra Hands. In many instances where humans are depicted in positions of power we seen them placing their hands or holding objects over their chest (heart chakra), abdomen (solar plexus chakra), and naval/genitals (sacral chakra). <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1XlEk">http://imgur.com/a/1XlEk</a></p>

<p>I believe these next three symbols work in part with one another because we often see them together. The &quot;H,&quot; the &quot;+,&quot; and the zig zag. Each of these symbols display the layered, depth of field style present in the Dimensional Doors and Windows. </p>

<p>H: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/i83uI">http://imgur.com/a/i83uI</a></p>

<p>+: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/6l3VO">http://imgur.com/a/6l3VO</a> </p>

<p>Zig Zag: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gXB06">http://imgur.com/a/gXB06</a></p>

<p>The last symbol I will be discussing in this installment is the stone knob or &quot;anvil&quot; symbol. Not only do we see the stone knob appearing in architecture but we see it in glyphs, reliefs, and carvings as well. A simple cube, cylinder, or trapezoidal prism with a protrusion on one side. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/T0KXr">http://imgur.com/a/T0KXr</a></p>

<p>Now I realize that some of you, if not most of you, will find the architectural aspect of the pre-Younger Dryas civilization much more compelling and convincing than the symbolic aspect. I understand that and I cannot blame you. This is potentially 12,000+ year old symbolism we are talking about and it is undoubtedly vague and esoteric. All that I ask is that you suspend disbelief on the matter until I have finished making my case. Please bare with me as I try to consolidate the evidence and information in an easily digestible manner over these next few weeks. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to accuse me of trolling. I actually believe this.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to call me crazy. I know.</p>

<p>I will try to respond to as many of your comments as possible. I look forward to discussing this with all of you.</p>

<p>If you enjoy these posts, please share them.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! They will all be discussed in later installments. Innumerable Greek philosophers wrote about this time before 12,000 BC extensively. I am currently laying the groundwork for much more revelatory information. This story has been told ceaselessly throughout time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you are illuminating the similarities better than I can, I must say that none of this is new to me.  Graham Hancock has practically devoted his life to this work, and he was the first to introduce me to the concept of advanced ancient human history.   Are you incorporating mysticism, or the idea of a collective consciousness into your ideas?  Akashic records and such?  I&#39;ve read a bit about esoteric knowledge and it seems like certain people are more &quot;in tune&quot; or can learn to be so, and as a consequence, are tapping into a keg of ancient subconsious knowledge.  Is that where you&#39;re headed with this?  I&#39;m not at all bashing the idea; I find it intriguing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, yes, that is exactly where we are headed with this. It is one of the central conclusion that all conspiracies lead to. We have been deliberately shut out from our own conscious abilities by those who rule over us. </p>

<p>And I too was first introduced to these ideas by Graham Hancock. I hope that man will be remembered as a prophet. He has given us so much knowledge. Definitely one of my greatest inspirations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are your thoughts on the Pyramids possibly being ancient power plants? &quot;The Pyramid Code&quot; on Netflix presents a very compelling argument which I think is much, much more logical than the argument put forth by traditional Egyptologists. Also, please don&#39;t think you&#39;re crazy, your argument in this post isn&#39;t that far out there. I personally believe that human history is incredibly more complex and interesting than what mainstream historians say. If TPTB ever allow more exploration and research into Antarctica, I think we&#39;ll get a much more complete picture of our history. Hopefully that happens in our lifetime. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I implore you to stop watching netflix and any mainstream sources. The &quot;alternative&quot; views they offer are often intentionally wrong and misleading to make us think they are considering all possibilities. Anything seemingly alternative or conspiracy related is there by design. It&#39;s the TPTB attempting to pander to us. </p>

<p>That being said, the Great Pyramid at Giza was most certainly a power plant but for amplifying consciousness and conscious and natural energies. I will be discussing this in further detail in future installments. This unified culture had many methods for reaching a heightened state of mind and many stone structures were instrumental in this process.</p>

<p>And yes, I believe Antarctica is an intrinsic piece to this puzzle. I recommend you look at the timeline of modern Antarctic exploration. It is no coincidence that the &quot;western&quot; governments and militaries took full control of the expeditions once explorers started making progress further inland. I believe that there are structures in Antarctica with similar functions to those in Egypt. Some people around here suggest that Antarctica is a psy-op to mislead us, but I have found no reason to believe that. Look into Admiral Byrd&#39;s flight logs and journals if you haven&#39;t already. Very compelling information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely looked into Admiral Byrd and his comments on the place. I&#39;ll look into his flight logs and journals soon, I&#39;m sure those will be filled with interesting information.</p>

<p>With regards to Netflix, I agree with you a bit. A whole lot of stuff on there is complete and utter bullshit, and I&#39;m guessing parts of the Pyramid Code follow that same track. That being said, like literally everything you read on the internet it&#39;s good to take it with a grain of salt. I think plenty of the information presented in that series is accurate and not intentionally faked to mislead us, there is always something to take away.</p>

<p>My Aunt is very involved with sound therapy and it sounds (no pun intended) like the Pyramids worked in a similar way, raising the vibrational frequency of the area around them. Combined with other similar structures throughout the world, the entire planet could have been working on an advanced spiritual plane. Imagine that...today we are so consumed with material culture and frivolous things that most of us have lost the abilities we once had. </p>

<p>Rereading my comment, I definitely wrote with a pointed tone. I didn&#39;t mean to be so terse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no sweat! I&#39;ve been increasingly interested in humankind&#39;s ancient past, not the one that they tell you about in history class. It is honestly the most compelling and interesting subject to me in my life right now, most other subjects pale in comparison. I don&#39;t see that changing over the course of my life. Knowledge is really all I crave.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought that with the appropriate resources, using a map of where the coasts lay 100,000 years or more ago, it would be very interesting to dive in locations where civilizations may have once existed.</p>

<p>The subject of Antarctica has really only entered my mind and awareness over this year, I&#39;m sure many of us have been aware of it long before that. It&#39;s not a very fun task sifting through all the BS that&#39;s out there about the continent and what is going on down there, do you have any tips for researching that subject? Also, I cannot wait to hear what your thoughts are on Atlantis. Part of me wants to believe that it has been found on/under the frozen continent, and that&#39;s the cause for all the secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I think alike, my friend. </p>

<p>As far as Antarctica goes, I recommend researching the timeline of modern expeditions and exploration. There are countless points that will make you scratch your head and think &quot;something is going on that they aren&#39;t telling us and don&#39;t want us know...something big.&quot; The military&#39;s involvement in Antarctica from around ~1900 to ~1950 is really compelling considering what is hypothesized to be there. Also, check out H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness.&quot; He wrote a lot of odd &quot;fiction&quot; about Antarctica around the same times as a lot of the military expeditions and referenced them and Admiral Byrd quite often. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta02.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta02.htm</a> </p>

<p>Definitely skim through this and control+F some Atlantean/&quot;lost&quot; civilization terms. There&#39;s tons of great stuff. I believe Atlantis was the Atlantic ocean counterpart to the continent of Lemuria/Mu in the Pacific. Also, poke around in Vedic mythology and other creation and flood &quot;myths.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Map_of_Lemuria.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Map_of_Lemuria.jpg</a></p>

<p>Check out this map. It shows the land that would have been above water before the Younger Dryas cataclysm and subsequent flooding. There are definitely pieces of the civilization that have been since submerged, waiting to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Human sacrifice played apart after the Younger Dryas cataclysm occurred and the later civilizations tried to recreate the Pyramid&#39;s function. This is why ritual sacrifice took place in nearly every culture post Younger Dryas. Our collective conscious energy receded after the cataclysm due to &quot;other&quot; forces. We will be discussing this in future installments. Not only was there great devastation to our physical plane, but to our conscious plane as well.</p>

<p>Consciousness is a collective energy that is one of the principle binding forces in the Universe. When a physical vessel such as a humanoid life form, knows how to manipulate its consciousness and move it outside of the physical dimension, it can in turn manipulate that which is within the physical dimension. The great structures can focus conscious energy like a magnifying glass focuses the sun&#39;s energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I implore you to stop watching netflix and any mainstream sources. The &quot;alternative&quot; views they offer are often intentionally wrong and misleading to make us think they are considering all possibilities. Anything seemingly alternative or conspiracy related is there by design. It&#39;s the TPTB attempting to pander to us. </p>

<p>That being said, the Great Pyramid at Giza was most certainly a power plant but for amplifying consciousness and conscious and natural energies. I will be discussing this in further detail in future installments. This unified culture had many methods for reaching a heightened state of mind and many stone structures were instrumental in this process.</p>

<p>And yes, I believe Antarctica is an intrinsic piece to this puzzle. I recommend you look at the timeline of modern Antarctic exploration. It is no coincidence that the &quot;western&quot; governments and militaries took full control of the expeditions once explorers started making progress further inland. I believe that there are structures in Antarctica with similar functions to those in Egypt. Some people around here suggest that Antarctica is a psy-op to mislead us, but I have found no reason to believe that. Look into Admiral Byrd&#39;s flight logs and journals if you haven&#39;t already. Very compelling information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen more and more info about the unified world theory lately.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it in &#39;normal places&#39; not just here, which is why it&#39;s starting to stick out to me. </p>

<p>A lot of my mainstream friends have even brought it up while we were just hanging out at house parties. Apparently they have been seeing those image collages being passed around twitter and are starting to entertain the idea themselves.</p>

<p>If I put on my tinfoil hat for a moment, I would almost think they are putting this into mainstream thought on purpose. </p>

<p>My conspiracy helmet says that they could use this as a very important tool to push their One World Order agenda. Thank about it, it would be revolutionary to hear that earth was once a &#39;unified utopia&#39; of everyone under the same rule.</p>

<p>Of course this could backfire on them very easily. If they push this, they are going to have to have answers to some very dividing questions:<br/>
Who was in charge?<br/>
and who is responsible for it&#39;s downfall?
Both questions that could have a lot of people turn on one group                                                                                                   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have experienced the same thing. I believe TPTB are vaguely promoting some of these ideas in an effort to employ a &quot;Bluebeam&quot; type scenario, where they present the world with some revelatory discovery or state of emergency to corral us. </p>

<p>I believe all the World War 3 propaganda is being made in the same effort. They want to create some unifying purpose so great that we come together all while looking to them as our saviors and salvation. </p>

<p>In either event, the veiled positivity of unification will be an effort to create a single world government with them at the helm.</p>

<p>Absolutely. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/67dk0d/project_blue_beam_is_getting_green_lighted/"> More urgent than ever before</a> that people realize what&#39;s up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some of you might have seen my recent post about Donald Trump and Alex Jones being deeply involved with the cult of scientology or that suppressed history getting out is considered an existential threat to the old world order.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the relationship between Elon Musk and Amber Heard received a lot of attention. That&#39;s relevant to the above posts for a number of reasons. One, Amber Heard is a scientologist as well.</p>

<p>Not widely known but also significant is that scientology has built landing strips and rocket pads in the New Mexico desert complete with a cathedral to aliens. They claim we were seeded on Earth by aliens from Planet Xenu.</p>

<p>Today, it was announced that Trump wants to accelerate a &#39;mission to Mars&#39; to within the next 4 years. Obviously that implies an awful lot of rocket launches to build the Mars spaceship in orbit in preparation for such a journey.</p>

<p>Of course that is not their true intention. The preprogramming went into high gear over the weekend, with notorious CIA disinformation agent Alex Jones claiming that we are seeded by aliens from another planet. With a pretext in hand to put a lot of rockets into near Earth orbit, the stage is set to assemble the required equipment to stage a fake alien invasion / landing, perhaps under the pretense of &quot;greeting&quot; us because we have matured to an interplanetary species or as a hostile force.</p>

<p>And yes, this was a unified culture in every sense. Few in number and incredibly connected with one another.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not being negative here but can I ask the significance of the stone knobs gallery and the trapezoidal stone gallery at the start of your post. To me, as an engineer, both of these features are totally understandable in abnormal day to day concept. Trapezoidal stones are typical of lazy craftsmen or people pushing for a deadline that allows quality control to be bypassed, or, for interlocking mechanisms to increase strength. Although the last ons is not apparent in the pictures shared by you. </p>

<p>Knobs are both extruded, intruded, products of erosion or just plain absent in your gallery ( see the Giza pics). Intruded or extruded knobs can serve non structural purposes.  Hard to see underlying causes in both these cases. Not saying that there aren&#39;t  other forces at work, but just that these aren&#39;t that&#39;s big a deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory I find most convincing is that they were part of a shadow calendar like Kukulkan, The Great Pyramid, or Stonehenge. Some people think they were simply for decoration, though I doubt it due to the seemingly random placement. Some are more patterned, others are sporadic. </p>

<p>And I suggest you look more closely at the photos of Giza and the Osirion at Abydos (I mentioned that I did not zoom in on the points of interest due to the resolution of the photos). There are most certainly stone knobs present on structures in Egypt. I believe that many of the knobs we see are less pronounced than those in the Andes due to different types of weathering and erosion. The structures in the Andes are far more secluded and therefor protected from the elements. </p>

They were perhaps used to realign the stones in the same way modern braces realign teeth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The events marked on the knob calendars were perhaps dates of certain astronomical and astrological alignments, solstices, and equinoxes. These alignments only present ordered or recurring increments over long periods of time. </p>

<p>For example, it is speculated that the Great Sphinx was originally a statue of a Lion built in accordance with the constellation Leo&#39;s rising on the eastern horizon 12,500 years ago. Perhaps the knobs on many of these ancient structures served a similar purpose marking other such events. All of these cultures held astronomy and astrology in high regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I think alike, my friend. </p>

<p>As far as Antarctica goes, I recommend researching the timeline of modern expeditions and exploration. There are countless points that will make you scratch your head and think &quot;something is going on that they aren&#39;t telling us and don&#39;t want us know...something big.&quot; The military&#39;s involvement in Antarctica from around ~1900 to ~1950 is really compelling considering what is hypothesized to be there. Also, check out H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness.&quot; He wrote a lot of odd &quot;fiction&quot; about Antarctica around the same times as a lot of the military expeditions and referenced them and Admiral Byrd quite often. </p>

<p>Definitely skim through this and control+F some Atlantean/&quot;lost&quot; civilization terms. There&#39;s tons of great stuff. I believe Atlantis was the Atlantic ocean counterpart to the continent of Lemuria/Mu in the Pacific. Also, poke around in Vedic mythology and other creation and flood &quot;myths.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Map_of_Lemuria.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Map_of_Lemuria.jpg</a></p>

<p>Check out this map. It shows the land that would have been above water before the Younger Dryas cataclysm and subsequent flooding. There are definitely pieces of the civilization that have been since submerged, waiting to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much, d8. I will add it to my list, though I am still working on some of the stuff you recommended me on my last installment, as well as your entire post history. There&#39;s just so much to learn, at times it can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>And yes, I think I will post there as well. Such a great sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What causes this amnesia tho? 
How do we simply forget how to design and build these great monolthis? If I did something so impressive, I would be looking for people to show, &quot;Hey Greeks check out my gargantuan triangular prison, nice Acropolis, NOT!&quot; </p>

<p>I know its merely speculation, but do you think its possible we lost more than engineering and construction abilities? Such as our understanding of nature or the spiritual realms?</p>
