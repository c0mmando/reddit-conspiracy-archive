       Anti-free trade, workers rights, free speech rights etc have been abandoned and rejected by the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders tried to bring back these topics into the American left-wing. But the establishment crushed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "left-wing" establishment in America now champion identity and illegal immigrants. They support big business and trade deals that don't help workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is their such a big propaganda machine against basic left-wing ideas, like fair trade, unions etc. These aren't even extreme positions.  Some of them even helped Trump get elected (rejection of corporate written trade deals like the TPP).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is strong support for many of these ideas that would be politically leftist. If you recall the Occupy movement, there was a large amount of peaceful people demanding things like financial regulations to protect workers from wall street speculation. Better funding for education etc. However, this movement is dead. The new face of the left are paid and masked protesters who are violent, and don't care about achieving any practical or realistic policies. With the DNC so blatantly rigging the primary process, and the possibility of Sanders being controlled opposition; one must ask who is trying to control and destroy any sort of reasonable left-wing policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundations funding groups around the country, it is possible that TPTB are trying to divide and control the lower class. Right-wing policies are safe for TPTB because wealth and power are distributed in a pyramid. Left-wing policies ultimately reduce inequality making the masses easier to control. For example in a country with socialized medicine, and individual and quit their job and start their own business without fear of losing their health care. In America, you either will lose your health insurance, or be forced to pay a corporation large amounts of money for zero care. This is one of many examples of how American policy allows control over the masses, by increasing inequality and making the population risk adverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current Democrat party is not a left-wing party. It is a bookend on the policy spectrum to control what is and is not acceptable. It is the gatekeeper on "leftist-thought" that has been approved by TPTB. Remember that GOP and Dems are two sides of the same coin. Media helps establish the current boundaries of acceptable thought. For example, Sander's policies where always criticized for being to expense (same with Trump's wall), but no one cares about the cost of anything else. When in reality, these policies are not wanted by TPTB, so they are attacked.

       Did the left turn? Or were they herded? That is the point I am making. The ideas expressed by Occupy are dangerous. How could Soros and company use wealth to destabilize and control if there are strong laws regulating market speculation.

       No they didn't. Libertarians are slowly wiping out the neocons. Traditional conservatism is, for the most part, dead. It was the middle that swung the last election in those key states, not some uprising of a far right that no one relates with.

       That is simple not true. I'm not talking about a couple year trend, I'm talking about a decades long trend. The certain faction in the GOP have moved very far to the right when the Democrats moved to become a center right corporatist party in the 1990's under Bill Clinton's leadership. The part shut down the government in 2013. I don't think that would have happened 10 or 20 years previously.

       It's fairly interesting to watch. The left's rejection of worker's issues (especially immigration's effects on the work force and globalization) has caused a large backlash and growing support in right-wing populism.

       I'm rather glad that Trump was the one to ride the wave to victory. You could have had a far more sinister figure win in the current political climate.

       That's technical impossible. People have forgot/never learned what left,right,center wing assembly means.
It's about the seating in the room. 
Liberal parties sit left, moderates in the center of the room and conservative parties on the right. 
It stems from the french revolutionary democracy and traces further back to greek and roman council/senate.

       You make it sound as if leftism is a virtue. It isn't. It's destructive of American values and prosperity.

       There are several benefits to Leftist policies. But none of them are currently being fought for, except some environmental protections, but those shouldn't be on the political spectrum. Labour rights need to be defended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently the "left" are attacking American values, but historically the left has championed things like free speech, allowing people to peacefully assemble etc. Generally speaking the establishment only cares about American values when it suits themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is who benefits from this "prosperity". And why would leftist policies destroy it? High levels of income inequality will cause problems for the consumer capitalist system the US depends on. Which will hurt long term economic growth. There are a spectrum of policies; this isn't a binary choice between anarcho-capitalism and a state controlled command economy. You can implement leftist policies and have a liberalized free market economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, most industries in the do not operate in a free market environment, so pretending they do and writing policies that reflect the false reality is foolish. Most right-wing policies allow those with large amounts of capital to exploit labour and abuse their power; to the point were they can damage society. Likewise, extreme left-win policies damage the society. However, the US propaganda model promotes a binary model between extremes; the crony capitalist policies are implemented.

       Neoliberalism and Neoconservativism are the same thing with different wedge issues designed to appeal to different demographics (neolibs go for the SJW/"scientism"/identity cultists; neocons for the (dying) Moral "Majority"/Culture of Fear adherents).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately the free-thinking movement continues to wake up and see both sides for what they truly are: a boot stamping on a human face - forever.

       Left and right are simply a show, a show to keep you distracted from the fact that all of politics is just another big show to give us the illusion of choice. Using the last presidential election as an example, If all you have to choose from is two people that no one wants to be elected what choice do you have? Our candidates are chosen for us and we get to choose "the lesser of two evils" our system is corrupt at its core. The sooner we all realize the truth about this the sooner we can move forward.
