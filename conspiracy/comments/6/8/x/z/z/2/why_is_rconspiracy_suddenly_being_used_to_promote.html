<p>While I do not really care to censor people, and I am not suggesting that we do, I do however think it is necessary to point out the kind of hateful rhetoric this person is promoting. </p>

<p>Does anyone else have a problem with it? Without censoring, how does one deal with this problem? Just continue to deal with it by downvoting?</p>

<p>When I think of this issue, I think of how Bill Cooper dealt with promoting his Christian beliefs. He did not tell everyone they were going to hell, he did not sit and judge people. This person, however, is constantly telling people they are going to hell and they are constantly judging people. Worse, they are justifying it by using the age old tactic of manipulating the scriptures to justify <em>their</em> attacks against people they do not like.</p>

<p>First they tried to frame us as a pro-trump conservative fuck fest, but we battled them off and sold our ground.</p>

<p>I&#39;m getting the feeling they&#39;re trying to make this place to appear either to be a &quot;Jesus-freak&quot; type bible thumping conspiracy hub, (which is certainly not the case, lol...)</p>

<p>Did you see that post about defeating the &quot;gay agenda&quot; earlier? Lol...this is blatant provocateur work.</p>

<p>Not to mention the influx of Jewish hate we&#39;ve been seeing this past week. Not to mention the relentless anti-Pizzagate shills that parade here. I&#39;d say this is evidence that r/conspiracy is actually a much more important information battleground than we could have conceived...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with Bill Cooper? He dealt with the religious angle of these conspiracies really well, I think. He is honestly the one who helped me find my faith again. His research, looking at a lot of the work he cites myself, it helped me to understand the origins of Christianity and what it means to be a true Christian.</p>

<p>This other guy we&#39;re talking about, he clearly is using religion to deal with his own personal issues, whatever they are. Or, maybe he is a CTR shill. I, however, doubt that. I really think he is just an ignorant and scared human who has found something that gives him meaning and helps his life make sense.</p>

<p>But yeah, I have noticed a lot of insanity as of late on this thread. I honestly do not think it relates to people trying to shill this thread. I really believe people are genuinely ignorant enough to believe the Earth is flat, that the Jews are responsible for it, and that they&#39;re turning everyone into homosexuals.</p>

<p>Those posts usually end up in a blaze of divisive comments and a hostile after effect,  and it leads me to believe they&#39;re orchestrated and planned to have that outcome..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, of all the videos I&#39;ve seen on the topic (and I&#39;ve watched a lot), <strong>this</strong> is the best.  Perhaps it&#39;s the high quality, lack of an agenda and objective reporting of the subject.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m still not seeing it.  I feel like it&#39;s similar to the magic eye pictures of the 90&#39;s.  A ton of people are seeing it, but even after reading and watching for hours, I&#39;m still not.  The art/&quot;spirit cooking&quot; I simply see as provocative art.  The way they talk/joke about the kids I simply see as parents/people with a quirky sense of humor.  The pizza references I simply see as pizza references.</p>

<p>I get how it all together can form a weird picture - I&#39;m not missing that part, I just think it makes for a weird picture, that there isn&#39;t any evidence of anything more than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m keeping an open mind and feel I could be convinced with proper evidence, so there&#39;s that.  But how and what does one investigate when no children have come forward, no parents have come forward, no concerned aunts/uncles/grandparents have come forward.  </p>

<p>I mean, that would mean <em>entire families</em> are in on the conspiracy, and that&#39;s a really hard pill for me to swallow as well.  No rogue concerned aunt/uncle/grandparent of any of the children shown? </p>

<p>I can see where you are coming from. I believe, to an extent, that pizzagate/pedogate is a real thing. </p>

<p>While this isn&#39;t directly related, but have you researched The Franklin Coverups? Crazy things similar to pgate have happened in the past. I&#39;ll leave a few links if you want to get it out, but I understand if you don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Franklin Coverups are compelling as well.  Please be clear, I don&#39;t <em>at all</em> deny that there are &quot;elite pedo&quot; rings out there.  Bryan Singer and Jeffrey Epstein are both clear evidence of that.</p>

<p>The Johnny Gosch case is a bit messier (although still very compelling), and in many ways similar to pizzagate.  You have a lot of weirdness, but no real evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s actually not what happened... The Pharisees and the Sadducees conspired with the Romans to kill Jesus because he threatened their power by introducing ideas of individual consciousness and the individual&#39;s relationship with the Creator. If you could go out and pray to God, what the Hell did you need a temple for? So, the Jewish leadership convinced the Roman&#39;s that Jesus was a threat and they had the Roman&#39;s kill him. Later, Roman&#39;s co-opted the Christian movement and used it to their political advantage, amalgamating Christianity with the mystery schools. </p>

<p>But I get your point. And I don&#39;t really have an issue with religion being promoted here, or religious conspiracy theories being promoted here. There is a big difference between that and some jackass telling gay people and anyone who disagrees with him is going to hell. </p>

<p>Jesus was super mystical mystery school based too though. Deny thyself, ego death, Love, awakening, Oneness, Holy Spirit Indwelling, old self vs renewed God self, if thine eye be single, etc.</p>

<p>He was dropping mad gems but he was literally preaching to idiots, a bunch of OT brainwashed 700-some-odd-rules and animal sacrifices to a blood thirsty god and still not guaranteed heaven/salvation/what-have-you, mostly uneducated and super hardened hearts.</p>

<p>If he taught mystery school stuff, it would have been to the Disciples or those close to him. We find some super deep stuff in Gospel of Thomas, the oldest of the actual existing NT scriptures, but the &#39;Church&#39; counsels decided against including it. Now if you peep Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is talking about some nonduality, zen, Oneness type ish in there and they are called the secret teachings as well.</p>

<p>Imagine if an Enlightened Master came to 1st century Judaism based Israel with all the Jewish Heirarchy in place, and tried to teach them Zen/Enlightenment. It&#39;d be entirely above their heads. </p>

<p>Why are you trying to negate my beliefs by insinuating that I have an agenda?  If I do have an agenda, it is to expose the truth.  Not convert anyone to what I believe.  You seem to have a problem with one user and are trying to use that problem to smear all of us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear when I say &quot;Christian&quot; I am referring to &quot;Christians&quot; and not Christians. So, you shouldn&#39;t have to worry, right?</p>
