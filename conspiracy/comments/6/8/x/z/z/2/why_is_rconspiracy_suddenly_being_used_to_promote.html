       I think we all know which redditor I am talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do not really care to censor people, and I am not suggesting that we do, I do however think it is necessary to point out the kind of hateful rhetoric this person is promoting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else have a problem with it? Without censoring, how does one deal with this problem? Just continue to deal with it by downvoting?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think of this issue, I think of how Bill Cooper dealt with promoting his Christian beliefs. He did not tell everyone they were going to hell, he did not sit and judge people. This person, however, is constantly telling people they are going to hell and they are constantly judging people. Worse, they are justifying it by using the age old tactic of manipulating the scriptures to justify
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       attacks against people they do not like.

       It's probably another element to the new "image tarnishing" that the CTR is up to..

       First they tried to frame us as a pro-trump conservative fuck fest, but we battled them off and sold our ground.

       Not to mention the influx of Jewish hate we've been seeing this past week. Not to mention the relentless anti-Pizzagate shills that parade here. I'd say this is evidence that r/conspiracy is actually a much more important information battleground than we could have conceived...

       Are you familiar with Bill Cooper? He dealt with the religious angle of these conspiracies really well, I think. He is honestly the one who helped me find my faith again. His research, looking at a lot of the work he cites myself, it helped me to understand the origins of Christianity and what it means to be a true Christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       This other guy we're talking about, he clearly is using religion to deal with his own personal issues, whatever they are. Or, maybe he is a CTR shill. I, however, doubt that. I really think he is just an ignorant and scared human who has found something that gives him meaning and helps his life make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I have noticed a lot of insanity as of late on this thread. I honestly do not think it relates to people trying to shill this thread. I really believe people are genuinely ignorant enough to believe the Earth is flat, that the Jews are responsible for it, and that they're turning everyone into homosexuals.

       Possible, but I just have a really hard time believing that they wouldn't just find their own sub-circles and discussion forums to talk about that stuff. The majority of us here don't endorse those ideals, I think it's safe to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those posts usually end up in a blaze of divisive comments and a hostile after effect,  and it leads me to believe they're orchestrated and planned to have that outcome..

       For what it's worth, of all the videos I've seen on the topic (and I've watched a lot),
       <strong>
        this
       </strong>
       is the best.  Perhaps it's the high quality, lack of an agenda and objective reporting of the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I'm still not seeing it.  I feel like it's similar to the magic eye pictures of the 90's.  A ton of people are seeing it, but even after reading and watching for hours, I'm still not.  The art/"spirit cooking" I simply see as provocative art.  The way they talk/joke about the kids I simply see as parents/people with a quirky sense of humor.  The pizza references I simply see as pizza references.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get how it all together can form a weird picture - I'm not missing that part, I just think it makes for a weird picture, that there isn't any evidence of anything more than that.

       I'm keeping an open mind and feel I could be convinced with proper evidence, so there's that.  But how and what does one investigate when no children have come forward, no parents have come forward, no concerned aunts/uncles/grandparents have come forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, that would mean
       <em>
        entire families

       are in on the conspiracy, and that's a really hard pill for me to swallow as well.  No rogue concerned aunt/uncle/grandparent of any of the children shown?

       They keep saying pizza means children, but replace "children" with "cocaine" in every single instance where it is clear it's being used as a code word. Playing "dominos on pizza", what makes more sense: playing dominos on children or while ripped on drugs? I have read and watched it all and it never adds up to anything.

       I can see where you are coming from. I believe, to an extent, that pizzagate/pedogate is a real thing.

      <p>
       While this isn't directly related, but have you researched The Franklin Coverups? Crazy things similar to pgate have happened in the past. I'll leave a few links if you want to get it out, but I understand if you don't.

       PodCast - Last Podcast on the Left did 3 episodes about Satanism in the Government/The Satanic Government. LPOTL isn't for everyone though. Its goofy most of the time, but often brutal. I personally love it.

       Yes, the Franklin Coverups are compelling as well.  Please be clear, I don't
       <em>

       deny that there are "elite pedo" rings out there.  Bryan Singer and Jeffrey Epstein are both clear evidence of that.

       The Johnny Gosch case is a bit messier (although still very compelling), and in many ways similar to pizzagate.  You have a lot of weirdness, but no real evidence.

       Very true as well. I was simply pointing out that weirder things have happened, which you know of haha. You are right though, the evidence is in fact circumstantial and there is no smoking gun despite how weird it all is.

       If you stop and think about it... Christianity is a conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews and Romans conspired to kill the "son of god" in order to maintain their "satanic" worldview. Likewise, Jesus (a Jew) conspired with other Jews to overthrow the "unholy" Roman Empire and cleanse mankind of its sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a 2000 year old conspiracy theory that 1 billion people believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no surprise a lot of them also believe in more mundane conspiracy theories.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's actually not what happened... The Pharisees and the Sadducees conspired with the Romans to kill Jesus because he threatened their power by introducing ideas of individual consciousness and the individual's relationship with the Creator. If you could go out and pray to God, what the Hell did you need a temple for? So, the Jewish leadership convinced the Roman's that Jesus was a threat and they had the Roman's kill him. Later, Roman's co-opted the Christian movement and used it to their political advantage, amalgamating Christianity with the mystery schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I get your point. And I don't really have an issue with religion being promoted here, or religious conspiracy theories being promoted here. There is a big difference between that and some jackass telling gay people and anyone who disagrees with him is going to hell.

       Jesus was super mystical mystery school based too though. Deny thyself, ego death, Love, awakening, Oneness, Holy Spirit Indwelling, old self vs renewed God self, if thine eye be single, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was dropping mad gems but he was literally preaching to idiots, a bunch of OT brainwashed 700-some-odd-rules and animal sacrifices to a blood thirsty god and still not guaranteed heaven/salvation/what-have-you, mostly uneducated and super hardened hearts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he taught mystery school stuff, it would have been to the Disciples or those close to him. We find some super deep stuff in Gospel of Thomas, the oldest of the actual existing NT scriptures, but the 'Church' counsels decided against including it. Now if you peep Gospel of Thomas, Jesus is talking about some nonduality, zen, Oneness type ish in there and they are called the secret teachings as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if an Enlightened Master came to 1st century Judaism based Israel with all the Jewish Heirarchy in place, and tried to teach them Zen/Enlightenment. It'd be entirely above their heads.

       The real question is;
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you making a thread just to call out some scripture churning fundies?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that deep cuh.

       lol yea it's really annoying, I just mainly troll him and tell him what a joke his stupid religion is. How anyone can believe in a religion in 2017 despite the overwhelming evidence that it's a joke, clearly shows they either are mentally ill or deficient.

       Don't worry about it. A lot of conspiracies connect to Biblical prophecy, so it is natural that there would be connections.
