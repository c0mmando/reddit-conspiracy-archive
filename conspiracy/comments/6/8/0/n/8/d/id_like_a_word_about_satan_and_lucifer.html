        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi all. I rarely hold forth like this, and in an effort to make it brief, I will leave many argument holes and unanswered questions – because the entire point I want to make is this:</p>

<p>Those who cite Satan or Lucifer as the god/demigod of their belief system are borrowing excuses for evil in the same way that Christians, Muslims and (modern, non-Talmudic) Jews use an opposing god to justify their beliefs and actions, many of which are also evil, but more covertly and in the guise of &quot;morality.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, don&#39;t think that people practicing ritual sexual abuse, killing children, worshipping Baal/Molech, etc., Statanism, etc. have some deep, dark, secret-society-based, magical powers or special favors from &quot;spiritual entities.&quot; They&#39;re just fucking jackasses who have inherited beliefs and practices through bloodlines, just like most of us inherited our own monotheistic &quot;good&quot; religious beliefs through our parents.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s my thesis statement. Read on if you want, but just offering my understandings of Satan and Lucifer.</p>

<p>I believe we were genetically engineered by an alien race and seeded here, originally as an experiment, but during our genesis, our creators discovered that they were created in the same way. Before, they thought they were being original.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s call them The Elohim (Genesis 1:26), roughly translated as &quot;those from the sky&quot; and Eloha being the singular.</p>

<p>LUCIFER is who we now call the Eloha who was in charge of the Semitic race on earth (one of seven original races created by seven different scientific teams). He&#39;s the guy responsible for thinking that Earthlings should be enlightened and know as much as the people on the home planet. The home planet disagreed, wanting to maintain a role of being &quot;as gods&quot; to humans. Satan went rogue and told the people why they were there and that they were capable of immortality. He&#39;s the snake in the garden. On top of it all, he and his team were fucking our women, so Yahweh and the rest of the home planet said, &quot;You love them so much, you can just stay there.&quot; This was Lucifer&#39;s exile, and the Old Testament is largely an account of the humans&#39; interactions with them (&quot;burnt offerings&quot; = &quot;meat extra crispy please, because I&#39;m not from here and want to kill all that nasty Earth bacteria we created&quot;).</p>

<p>Related: The Semitic race was &quot;gods chosen people&quot; because they were the most genetically sound; they were smart; they were inventive; they were peaceful. Basically, of the seven races created, they won the prize. Just like the legend of Jacob and Esau, their birthright was stolen by members of one of the races who really liked to fuck shit up (Babylon to Central Europe to Jerusalem and Brooklyn. You know who I&#39;m talking about).</p>

<p>SATAN is a higher-up on the home planet, one of the 12 rulers of it, Yahweh being another (and the oldest, so I understand). Satan got to a point with the human experimentation on Earth that he took a stand and opposed further &quot;creation&quot; – after the third time they nuked what they had done (prehistoric and &quot;transitional&quot; humans ((there&#39;s no missing link because each &quot;stage&quot; had an abrupt end and new beginning)) dinosaurs, etc.). So, with the last incarnation of humanity, Satan has been a dissenter, lobbying for the destruction of all life on earth... wait for it... because he feels that this level of suffering and ignorance is IMMORAL. Universally immoral. The tales we hear of him &quot;tempting&quot; both mortals and Jesus Christ is to prove to Yahweh and the rest of them that humans are not genetically sound or intelligent enough to evolve to the level of the Elohim. Yahweh and the rest of the leadership believe that our design can evolve into a planetary consciousness, and they don&#39;t want to stop us. </p>

<p>Evidently, The Elohim have created life on three other planets, but we were their first.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but if you take the idea that we were created by carbon-based beings, and this was their first stab, it explains fucking everything.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all. Thanks for reading, and I hope that you simply come away with the knowledge that Satanists, Luciferians and anyone else who harms humanity and its habitat are just borrowing legendary representatives and twisting who they are for the sake of an agenda – just like the born-again fundamentalist Christians I grew up with. They&#39;re just fucking idiots with no special power or knowledge, but they would love you to think otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post...
I have been having similar, but not quite identical thoughts in this regard. I believe that a god might be the manifestation of a will (or a collection of wills). The &quot;old gods&quot; are simply the ones that have been kept alive with the longest lines of tradition. The creation of new traditions might be the same as the creation of new gods. Just as the Eloha was not Eloha, but Elohim... the only thing that matters among gods is which one ends up on top in the long run. Creation is not necessarily a thing of the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have to disagree. This is firstly a spiritual war and they do know that and they do believe in their powers. You may dismiss it all but i&#39;ve been close enough to negative spiritual powers that i could not be convinced there is no truth to the existence of such. </p>

<p>If this aspect is dismissed, in the end you will not see the bottom of that rabbit hole and what they do remains protected in the dark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>gods. lol. ive said this before. what kind of ego do you have to hold, to strait faced, tell another entity you are a god. the impingement of free will comes into play. if you dont excersize your free will another entity will be happy to choose for you. at that point your free will is diminished. </p>

<p>these entities are your other/selves in time. </p>

<p>yknow. in unserstanding self. 
look at others as, other/self. </p>

<p>free will, perspective and context are critical at this stage when you consider</p>

<p>whom/what do you serve?  self or other/self. or do you serve something different. money, fear, entitlement, ego, add whatever to the list. </p>

<p>these are 3, 4, 5 density concerns.</p>

<p>choose to serve Creation. choose to Create. choose to be a Creator.  </p>

<p>Or better yet. Excersize your free will and participate by Creating better, Creating more, and Creating at every opportunity. </p>

<p>or side up and make your choice. or have it made for you.  </p>

<p>again. refresh me. which god takes away free will?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that Yahweh didn&#39;t think too much of free will. As the story goes, he created a paradise for us that contained no struggle, no suffering and no death, but hence lacked any and all incentive to evolve beyond that paradise of ignorance.</p>

<p>If the Ra material (The Law of One, the Hidden Hand dialogues) is to be believed, it was Lucifer (a group-soul of higher density/dimensional beings) was sent to earth to convince Yahweh to give us a chance to evolve in the karmic cycles by giving us a catalyst to do so.</p>

<p>So what we were given was a bright spark of curiosity and a sudden increase of hardship, forcing us to find our own ways and to continuously choose between serving ourselves or serving the whole of creation. Naturally, only the second approach will eventually lead back up the ladder of ascension, but we have to be shown and realize the things we are not so that we can choose to be our best selves. That is why the Luciferian group complex or higher dimensional soul collective has to be the bad cop in this game of life, to allow us to choose the good path with conviction.</p>

<p>So, if any or all of the above is correct, both Lucifer and Yahweh are neither good nor evil in itself, but wanted to achieve different goals in this game. Yahweh wished us to be good due to ignorance, worship and obedience, while Lucifer wants us to be good out of our own wisdom and free will. This also wouldn&#39;t absolve the Lucifer soul complex of its evil deeds in our dimension, as they would have to pay the price for it in the next karmic cycle. A prize they agreed to pay for our ascension.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I don&#39;t know if any of that is true, but it&#39;s a version of our story that resonates, so I&#39;ll entertain it for as long as it does so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah someome looking at Lucifer, the Bringer of Light, in a non-christian way! Fucking Christians seem to be rampant on these boards doing their petty proselytizing. </p>

<p>While OP does not include sources. Look up the etymology to the words of these religious texts and you might find most organized religions have obfuscated the intent of the rhetoric and used it to their advantage to fool the ignorant. Well not might, you will find that.</p>

<p>Anyone else sigh and laugh when you see every ignoramus talking about the satanic occult elites? Maybe Lucifarian is more apt? Or how about the label they actually go by, Khazarian Mafia?</p>

<p>But yeah generally from an extremely Christian and/or Puritan perpsective are the actions of the occult elite &quot;SATANIC&quot; but when you literally understand what those words mean you comw to realize Oh i guess they are NOT satanists. Huh LaVey or maybe spiritual Satanists could chime in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</p>

<p>Compare Job and Psalm of Asaph:</p>

<p>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. He had seven sons and three daughters, and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.  His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.  One day the angels came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. The Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”  Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.&quot;  Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”  “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied.  “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”  The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”  Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p>Elohim stands in the divine assembly; there with the elohim, he judges: &quot;How long will you go on judging unfairly, favoring wicked?  Give justice to the weak and fatherless! Uphold the rights of the wretched and poor! Rescue the destitute and needy; deliver them from the power of the wicked!” They don’t know, they don’t understand, they wander about in darkness; meanwhile, all the foundations of the earth are being undermined.  &quot;My decree is: ‘You are elohim, sons of the Most High all of you.  Nevertheless, you will die like mortals; like any prince, you will fall.’” Rise up, Elohim, and judge the earth; for all the nations are yours.</p>

<p>Brothers and sisters, be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings.  And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.  To him be the power for ever and ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing that op said was original in any way. I will just say this, the ideas posed from op are new age philosophy by blavatsky and others like minded people who use the deceptions of the fallen one to lie and change, borrow and steal ideas to fit their agenda. If you do anything, please research, debunk and critique &quot;the truth&quot;. The world is an old place, and full of groups who know more than we do, and in knowing they influence the masses with lies. More than 10 years I have looked under many rocks and read many books about a multitude of things. Madam blavatsky, jordan maxwell, michael tsarion, manly p hall, albert pike and so on all had agendas to take the truth away from god and jesus christ. If you oppose what I said then go research it, do not be close minded to the truth of god and jesus christ. Remember trust no man, no flesh, but the words of jesus christ. Men lie, flesh lie. God does not lie. Jesus does not lie. Enough of this new age lie. Stay strong and test the spirits, do not trust them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Study Gnosticism.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about extra-terrestrials and inter-dimensionals.</p>

<p>The god of Abrahamic religions are ET who advanced neanderthals and cro-mag DNA to modern human form by splicing in their own. There were upwards of 22 races who participated.</p>

<p>The Cabal are not just meanies who like to hurt people. They are both controlled by the non-physical archons, and transmit energy to them through trauma and blood ritual. Lucifer is the coordinator of the Archons, and exists in the plasma field around the earth.
Satan is a title that has been given several times. Satan is irrelevant to the discussion because there is no satan. There are only Archons, and negative ET groups like Draco Reptilian. </p>

<p>There is a war going on right NOW and the light forces are winning.</p>

<p>Lucifer, Yaldaboath, Yahweh are the same being... Enki and Enlil (Sirian-Orions and original geneticists) are the mesopotomian gods associated with the Old Testament of the Bible. All spiritual understandings were co-opted by Lucifer into religion.</p>

<p>Love and ONENESS (taught be Jesus) is the natural state of all divine beings, which we are. The illusion, THE MATRIX, is the false-belief that we have no control. We are slaves of negative entities who have invaded our society thousands of years ago. The Church teaches division and fear - just like the MSM and people like Soros are trying to brainwash us with. They want us divided and in fear - this is the essence of &#39;anti-christ&#39; consciousness and serves the Archons.</p>

<p>The Cabal, world leaders, believe in religion more than anyone. They are playing both sides of it, and they know it&#39;s true. Magic is real. We live in a multi-dimensional reality and the basic of understanding this world is getting a handle on that.</p>

<p>There is the seen and there is the unseen. Our senses detect a spectrum of what is &#39;real&#39;, and different people have different levels of detection. We are experiencing a shift in awareness globally, which is why we are becoming more privy to all of these things. </p>

<p>Open Contact with positive star races is coming soon. We have to take the first step by confronting the problem of Luciferianism/Satanism in our societies, under its many disguises.</p>

<p>Even when we have been created by an alian race, who has created this alian race?</p>

<p>However, I have no idea where most of what you posted is coming from and I&#39;m pretty familiar with this material, or so I think. </p>

<p>Evidently, The Elohim have created life on three other planets, but we were their first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you typed has to do with theology... Also prop is anything used to promote an agenda. The one here being to turn people away from spirituality which is funny because half the shit mentioned such as a planetary consciousness all have their origins in religion.</p>

<p>Very few people go for atheism and the ones who usually do &quot;have something to prove&quot;. IE a scientist who thinks he&#39;s too intelligent to believe in such hocus pocus.  This is coming from someone too who used to hold atheism dear. </p>

<p>I think if you and I hung out over whiskey we&#39;d use different words to find the same conclusions. I also believe that science and spirituality will be the same study within 100 years, if we last that long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like both together; keeps them in check, and I can&#39;t imagine anyone needing opiates with that combo.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a line I love from an old 80s movie with Peter O&#39;Toole and Vincent Spano, where the former plays a genetics professor, and the latter is his grad student. They&#39;re sitting on a rooftop looking at the stars, and O&#39;Toole&#39;s character says, &quot;One day, Boris, man will peer into his microscope and find himself staring straight into the eye of God. [perfect pause] ... and the first one to blink will loose his testicles.&quot;</p>

<p>There are certainly signs of intelligent design everywhere. This book is the best explanation of the Old Testament that I&#39;ve found (and our situation in general). Most/all of what I wrote originally is from that and passed on to me from others in this movement. See what you think.</p>
