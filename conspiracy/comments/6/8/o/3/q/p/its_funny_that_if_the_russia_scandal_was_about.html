<p>The uranium deal wasn&#39;t even her decision to make. Even if you believed that she did it, you can&#39;t come up with any reason why she would want to do that.

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you can&#39;t even find a reason she&#39;d do it besides &quot;she&#39;s a traitor&quot; like she&#39;s an evil villain. We know she didn&#39;t sell things for influence because she released 30 years of tax returns during the campaign. Something Trump promised he&#39;d do and still hadn&#39;t done. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious that your main gripe is selling presidential influence for profit, because that&#39;s literally exactly what trump is doing now. He hasn&#39;t divested from his businesses like every other president, and like he once again promised he would. Why else do you think he left Saudi Arabia off the list of countries with his travel ban, the country who&#39;s citizens mainly planned 9-11. Because he&#39;s currently running hotels in the country and itd hurt his business. It&#39;s the same reason he invited the Philippines&#39; murderous dictator to the white house, because he wants his hotel to do well there and has to work with the government. Trump literally prioritized making money from his old business to serving the American people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one thinks having good relations with Russia is bad, that is obvious propaganda being spread by conservative outlets.</p>

<p>What people think is bad, is capitulating to a tyrannical authoritarian leader who has shown clearly, time and again, that he does not have our best interests at heart.</p>

<p>In other words, we can&#39;t trust Putin. It&#39;d be great to be friends with russia, but since we can&#39;t trust their pseudo-dictator, where does that leave us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo Russia tried to hurt Hillary and boost Trump in the election, because they believe Trump is less &quot;qualified&quot;. But that doesn&#39;t mean Trump is working for Russia and in all likelihood Russia made a great mistake in their calculations on this because Trump is literally insane.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the scorecard shall we:
Trump bombs an airbase in Syria.
Trump decides to keep sanctions on Russia til Crimea is returned. 
Trump deploys missile defense system in South Korea.</p>

<p>All of these are greatly upsetting Putin. In fact I&#39;ve never seen Putin look this upset in a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that Putin isn&#39;t calling Donnie up at midnight giving him instructions on how to unravel america. But like you say, they definitely wanted him to win for a few reasons:</p>

<p>1) he&#39;s less competent and has less experience, so russia can get away with shit that normal presidents would call out. </p>

<p>2) Russia knows that Clinton would keep coming after them for Crimea. They knew Trump was running as a non-interventionalist and wouldn&#39;t care about crimea. </p>

<p>3) at the RNC, the Trump team altered the GOP platform to get rid of sanctions on russia for invading crimea. </p>

<p>4) Putin in general hates the West, and wants to prove to his own people that democracy <strong>doesn&#39;t work</strong> no better way of proving that by helping a divisive president win, and then pointing to america when shit goes wrong and saying, &quot;see Russia, democracy is nothing but an unorganized headache</p>

<p>I mean, it was coordinated with Putin and planes were using it hours later. Not a good example. </p>

<p>Definitely a good move, but regardless those would require Europe to agree. </p>

<p>That agreement was done under Obama. And at this point Trump couldn&#39;t back out without major scrutiny after the NK actions. </p>

<p>&quot;We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.&quot; The effort, Manafort wrote, &quot;will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.&quot;</p>

<p>America is not at war with Russia, and has not been for almost 30 years.  If Trump wants a relationship with Russia, then that to me is a good thing.  Certainly better than the war the deep state has been trying to start.  The only reason this is an issue is that CTR and Shareblue made it one.</p>

<p>Also, Hillary has at least as many ties to Russia as Trump.  Why do you guys never bring that up?  That said, if Trump is actually doing something illegal then lock him up.  But the whole Red Scare 2.0 thing pisses me off.  I lived through the cold war the first time around;  it was bullshit then, and it&#39;s bullshit now.  Russia is not the enemy unless America makes them the enemy.</p>

<p>2) You seem to be pretty confident that Russia is a great place that just wants to be pals with America. I&#39;m curious, when you hear news about Russia invading sovereign nations, or trying to persecute and exterminate gay citizens, or Putin ordering nuclear-capable aircrafts to buzz right over US Navy ships as a form of intimidation, does that ever affect your opinion, or is that just fake news?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference between when America and Russia get involved with other nations: America doesn&#39;t invade countries for conquest. Russia took Crimea because it was a strategic location. How would you feel if your neighbor just showed up with a bunch of guns and said hey your house is mine now. America doesn&#39;t try to acquire new territories when it goes to other countries. The US never tried to annex Iraq and turn it into the 51st state. Although that is what Russia is doing with Crimea. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, Russia doesn&#39;t want war with America. It wants to do grab power in it&#39;s region and hope the US doesn&#39;t stand up and stop them. Which is part of the reason why they want Trump in the White House. He&#39;s a non-intervenionalist. At the RNC, trump altered the GOP platform to get rid of sanctions on Russia for invading Crimea. Putin saw that and was like, &#39;hell yeah, now we can annex poor countries that can&#39;t defend themselves and the US won&#39;t try to stop us&#39;</p>

<p>Perhaps you missed Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan?  Not to mention every other war America has fought since WW2? I mean, they don&#39;t technically take those countries over, but they do install puppet governments, send in American corps to plunder the natural resources and rebuild the infrastructure America bombed, and maintain an indefinite military presence, so I consider those countries conquered in fact if not in name.  It&#39;s actually kind of clever;  America gets all the resources, the people of the country pay America to rebuild for them, and none of the people become American citizens or (more importantly) gain the rights of American citizens.</p>

<p>I would rather have Russia as the main world power than America.  America is an empire in decline:  corrupt, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference between when America and Russia get involved with other nations: America doesn&#39;t invade countries for conquest. Russia took Crimea because it was a strategic location. How would you feel if your neighbor just showed up with a bunch of guns and said hey your house is mine now. America doesn&#39;t try to acquire new territories when it goes to other countries. The US never tried to annex Iraq and turn it into the 51st state. Although that is what Russia is doing with Crimea. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, Russia doesn&#39;t want war with America. It wants to do grab power in it&#39;s region and hope the US doesn&#39;t stand up and stop them. Which is part of the reason why they want Trump in the White House. He&#39;s a non-intervenionalist. At the RNC, trump altered the GOP platform to get rid of sanctions on Russia for invading Crimea. Putin saw that and was like, &#39;hell yeah, now we can annex poor countries that can&#39;t defend themselves and the US won&#39;t try to stop us&#39;</p>
