    <div class="md"><p>it was design to withstand the impact from a jetliner. this means the building was able to stay standing when a jetliner crashed into it. what it was not able to do was withstand such massive fires and stay standing so. these are two different situations. the twin towers survived the initial impact. but the design features that where meant to help fight the fires and help it prevent it from falling failed, such as the protective coating on the steel beams. you seem to be poorly educated on how the buildings were built and the basic properties of physics. You should read into 9/11 more and learn how the towers actually fell since you don&#39;t seem to understand.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are suffering from cognitive dissonance. You are also looking for any chance to dismiss a conspiracy as well. Instead of looking at the possibilities of what occurred, you choose to explain away the falsehoods. I have spent too much time gathering all the angles to what occurred that day, and I can tell you that if you really knew much about fires, you would also know that the black clouds coming from the building are indicators of a firing running out of oxygen and the heat created from that would be significantly less than the point to weaken steel to the point of a total, vertical, and immediate collapse. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not even including building 7, which according to all reports and those by NIST, is mostly unexplainable. Forget the twin towers, how exactly could a building that was built like a tank, somehow managed to just collapse down onto itself, no plane hit it, and the damage to the building was all superficial from the falling of the twin towers. </p>

<p>Black smoke= oxygen starved fire: Nope. Not at all. Completely false, in fact it&#39;s opposite is true. Thick black smoke (not clouds) is a PRIME AND DEFINITE indication of an intensely burning fire. But you obviously know much more about fires and how to read smoke, I mean clouds, so correction on this subject is appreciated. </p>

<p>The color of smoke is one of the characteristics we, and by we I mean myself and the other people that you don&#39;t believe are firefighters, use when &quot;reading smoke&quot; but it can&#39;t be used by itself and only by itself to draw any sort of conclusion on the state of the fire or where it will go to next. </p>

<p>Prime example:  burn tires, oil, or a memory foam mattress in an open field. Jet black smoke yet there&#39;s no shortage in the abundance of oxygen for the fire to consume. </p>

<p>Color, along with density, velocity, and volume must be used TOGETHER to draw any sort of conclusion as to what your fire is doing. Reading smoke isn&#39;t an exact science and more of an art. In fact, the key figure in our understanding of it, Dave Dobson, titles his work as &quot;the art of reading smoke&quot;. If you have any doubt as to what I&#39;m saying is accurate please look the art of reading smoke for a better explanation. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vwKQXsXJDX4">https://youtu.be/vwKQXsXJDX4</a></p>

<p>In that video you see lots of the black smoke we&#39;re discussing. You may also notice the velocity which it&#39;s being pumped out of the building and also the high density. Smoke, at its most basic, is fuel. Its unburnt fuel, gases, and hydrocarbons put off by the fire itself. That video is a perfect example of what we call &quot;black fire&quot;. What happens in a fire (in a compartment) is that as a small fire is burning the temperature of the room (and everything in it) begins to increase rapidly. Objects begin to offgas and release fuel into the air. As those gases reach a temperature close to their autoignition temp, you are looking at a flashover situation. </p>

<p>Color: in pictures or 9/11 you&#39;ll see smoke in different shades ranging from white to grey to black (sometimes brown but that&#39;s an entire different and more complicated subject) due to mixing of moisture (white) and carbons/hydrocarbons (black). As the materials heat up, the smoke leaving the material eventually becomes all black, regardless of the material type. Therefore, the blacker the smoke, the hotter the smoke. Black smoke that&#39;s high velocity and very thin (low density) indicates a well-ventilated fire while high velocity and high density black smoke is a very hot, very free burning fire consuming all fuel and oxygen it can with nothing preventing further spread. The thick black smoke is due to extremely high temperatures in the building and the smoke itself can reach nearly 1000*f</p>

<p>Velocity: the smoke is being literally pumped out of the building because it is heat pushed. The smoke directly off of a fire is always turbulent and as it drifts further from the heat source, it becomes cooler and takes on a more laminate flow. Laminar smoke coming from a structure is a good indicator that the structure can and is still absorbing much of the heat, while turbulent smoke flow is indicator the structure can not absorb any more heat and flashover is imminent. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, on the face of it that wtc7 is a trickier, but completely logical, one to explain but it still carries over what I said about wtc1 and 2. </p>

<p>But before I continue, I&#39;m reading the NIST report right now and I haven&#39;t seen anything that coincides with your statement that </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;...building 7, which according to all reports and those by NIST, is mostly unexplainable...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you elaborate on that?  It&#39;s a pretty cut and dry explanation as to what happened and I don&#39;t see any sort of mystery to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did NIST ever reveal the calculations used for the simulations they created for the collapse of building 7? If I recall correctly, when asked to release the simulations to be recreated for peer review, it was denied for matters of &quot;national security.&quot; Doesn&#39;t make much sense that the 9/11 commission would be open to explaining the collapses of the twin towers in great detail, yet won&#39;t go into detail on the factors in play behind the falling of a tower that wasn&#39;t hit by an airplane, and collapsed entirely on its own blueprint. </p>

<p>Hypothetically, if the building was damaged by the side, during the collapse of the twin towers, we would have seen a partial collapse like we did on the surrounding buildings. Just a few floors with light structural damage, which in turn was more damage sustained than building 7 all together. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t make any logical sense that the building could collapse as it did with the way it was built and reinforced by just fire alone. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a building that burned for hours that was far older than building 7 and sustained larger fires, but didn&#39;t collapse entirely into its own footprint. There was a partial collapse as I mentioned earlier. </p>

<p>From your standpoint, how is thus possible? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I clicked it, I had a feeling it&#39;d be the Windsor. You bring a really good case on why some buildings fall and some don&#39;t. There&#39;s quite a few bits of info that are usually glossed over and I may be forgetting a few but here&#39;s what I remember:</p>

<p>The Windsor was, at the time of the fire, going through an extensive refurbishing. This greatly reduced what is called the &quot;fire load&quot; per floor. In layman&#39;s terms, the fire load is pretty much whatever is in a room/ floor that can burn. The less stuff that can burn, the lower the fire load. </p>

<p>Firefighters fought the Windsor fire for I think an entire day, like over or close to 24 hours. While 7wtc&#39;s fire was left unsuppressed as the focus was on 1wtc and 2wtc and the inevitable collapse shortly after.  This separates the buildings&#39; situations considerably. This allowed, due to the way 7wtc was constructed, a critical support girder expanded enough to unseat itself. This caused around 5 floors to collapse around a critical support column. This stressed the column till it failed, exacerbating the failure of columns near it, causing the penthouse to fall, then the interior collapses and takes the building facade with it. It&#39;s important to remember that buildings are built very well but they are still similar to a house of cards. One structural member&#39;s failure may not bring it all down but it can stress other members to the point of failure. That&#39;s pretty much what happened for 7wtc in a nutshell. </p>

<p>In the three collapses, you can make a very simplistic explanation as to how the buildings failed. All three had a fire induced failure the truss floor systems. I can pull book after book here in the firehouse where the dangers of &quot;truss&quot; type systems are repeated. What happened on 9/11 is that while it&#39;s correct to say the fire may not have been hot enough to melt the steel beams, they <em>were</em> hot enough to severely weaken the steel floor truss. What happens when they&#39;re weakened is they begin to sag. Imagine a steel beam suspended by concrete blocks which are bolted to the beam on each end. Add a heavy load throughout the beam. Now, I don&#39;t think we disagree that fire can and will weaken the beam, as the steel softens, it will sag in the middle (as its only supported on the ends). The forces on the concrete go from a downward push to an inward pull. The pulling inward on structural components not meant for that kind of load started the structural failures. This led to a progressive collapse of the structure. </p>

<p>Sorry for going in reverse I needed to turn on our old windows ME computers to get into the NIST shit we have here. I&#39;m not entirely sure what you&#39;re talking about  when you say &quot;the calculations&quot; used for the simulations. I&#39;m not being a smart ass but I really would like to give you a proper answer and I don&#39;t want to assume incorrectly. </p>

<p>I hope I&#39;m on the right track in thinking you&#39;re talking about the ANSYS and LS-DYNA models. The computer simulations are all available for peer review at anytime. That&#39;s sort of what NIST does. If a firefighter is killed in the line of duty, they&#39;ll come in and work with a department, do studies, do test, etc. and then publish a report of what happened, how it happened, why it happened, and what could be done to prevent it from happening again. Having that information given to as many people as possible is sort of their whole job. It&#39;s practically shoved down our throats here. In due diligence I looked up some search results for NIST not handing over info on 9/11 and I&#39;m not getting anything other than conspiracy theory or at least 9/11 truther based sources. Genuinely interested in knowing more about it as it&#39;s almost humorous to me imagining NIST actually not wanting to give info. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I just don&#39;t think I understand what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>It should be noted, I&#39;m not sure if it was just a mistake or if you were unaware, the 9/11 commission and the 9/11 commission report and the NIST investigation and subsequent report are not related and not connected by anything other than their subject matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get your point about the strength of steel and it melting to weaken it&#39;s integrity. It does not explain the total collapse and failure of all the support beams at once and for the building to fall perfectly into its own blueprint. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, what?</p>

<p>What are you talking about? Yeah. Fire can bring down a building. Why is that shocking to you? Yeah, it&#39;s concerning. That&#39;s why there are so many protections put into place to suppress fires. That&#39;s why people are given the responsibility to try and put the fire out. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;re being an asshole about it and trying to doubt that I&#39;m a firefighter because I&#39;m versed in building construction and building codes. Where the fuck do you think the building codes come from? The standard for building codes in this country, IBC, is predominantly focused <em>fire prevention</em>. Imagine that. Building codes are created to prevent fires because everyone seems to be aware that... gasp, fire can take down a building. Holy shit. Imagine that. The 9/11 conspiracy started all the way back in the early 20th century when a group of organizations (specifically...oh shit! THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION AGENCY!) decided to write building codes. Why would a person with a job who spends countless hours in classrooms dealing with... building construction... and who works for the very department that is the authority having jurisdiction on... guess what.... BUILDING CODES... know anything about building construction, fire behavior, and building codes? Idk. Maybe you can watch a Fucking YouTube video and become an expert on the topic. I was hoping to have an actual conversation and was completely open to whatever you had to say but you&#39;re just being a dick for no reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, never claimed I taught. I even said I&#39;m not a great teacher but sure, we have classes. We have continuing education classes that we have to attend. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lgOAtj4.jpg">Image</a> here&#39;s a copy of our class schedule but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll think that&#39;s obviously made up or whatever. </p>

<p>Multiple examples of modern, stew reinforced high rise buildings falling from fire alone? Sure. Here you go:</p>

<p>Plasco Building in Tehran
Faculty of architecture in the Netherlands (?) 
Kader toy factory in Thailand 
McCormick palace 
5Wtc</p>

<p>But, as you some one of your vast knowledge on the topic surely knows, you can&#39;t compare those 4 fires to each other much less to the wtc fires as they were of totally different building construction, fire load, fire intensity, and fire suppression attempts. </p>

<p>High rise buildings with steel construction that burned without collapse:</p>

<p>First interstate bank in I can&#39;t remember 
One meridian in philly </p>

<p>But I&#39;ll take your Windsor as the example to compare. </p>

<p>Ways they are similar:
They were tall
They had steel construction 
They had a fire. </p>

<p>(Spoiler alert: any building over a very minimal height will have steel construction)</p>

<p>Ways they are different:
Every thing else. </p>

<p>Fun fact: the Windsor was under construction to install fire suppression and protection that was being produced do to the recent studies of high rise fires, specifically.... the wtc buildings. </p>

<p>So we agree that a building with only fire as a culprit can suffer a partial collapse? One with firefighters actively fighting the fire from a very early stage?  We agree that a fire alone can destroy a part of a building even with fire crews fighting against it? Cool. </p>

<p>So, since the proof is already laid out to you, tell me how 2 buildings that were hit with commercial airliners, and a building with multiple floors fully engulfed and no attempt to suppress the fires, and all three going wouldn&#39;t suffer a collapse? </p>

<p>Because it never happened before?
1. uhhh yeah, it happened in your own example. A partial collapse even when being fought against is acceptable but a full collapse when no actions are being taken is suddenly out of the realm of possibility?
2: nothing on the scale of 9/11 had happened before either. The buildings actually performed well and no study ever said, and NIST actually made a point to clarify, that none of the buildings collapsed due to being impacted by planes or debris. There was no pancake effect collapse and all 3 collapsed...</p>

<p>Due to fire...</p>

<p>But I mean, I&#39;m obviously made up so everyone knows you&#39;re right on this because you are able to regurgitate the most basic conspiracy theory bullet points. </p>

<p>Dude, stop repeating bullshit you hear in your echo chamber. 9/11 wasn&#39;t the first time steel structures collapsed from fire alone. A little due diligence would have helped you realize how wrong of a statement it is. But you&#39;re not interested in finding things out on your  own. You don&#39;t want to know more on and be able to defend your stance with logic, reason, or fact. You just want to live with your confirmation bias. Have fun with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great example of the pot calling the kettle black. You know that there is something odd about that day, and being someone who knows much about the field in which there is lots of controversy in this country, it would only make sense to enter a mindset of cognitive dissonance. You are holding two contradictory beliefs in your mind. </p>

<p>One is the understanding of fire and steel integrity as a whole and the other is the side of you that follows and believes in some conspiracies, and the scheming that goes into them, but chooses that the possibility of leveling 3 high rises on a single day is improbable. The likelihood that there was an organized event in one way or another can only be proven by a concrete list of events. Building 7, in that fashion, is the smoking gun. It doesn&#39;t fit with the narrative of everything else. </p>

<p>Want to understand why I think this way? Because it&#39;s in their best interests to keep you believing in this fiction, and defending it to this point. Noam Chomsky put out a great old documentary called &quot;Manufactured Consent.&quot; It dives into how the media can control public opinion. I came to the conclusion something was up when the media and political pundits knew what was going on within minutes and who did it within hours. </p>

<p>So many coincidences are alarming as well, miracles don&#39;t occur, and randomness and chance are what dictate reality. Lots of people made money and many people got away with massive crimes. </p>

<p>Here: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did the events of 911 happen on 911? Was this a &quot;date specific&quot; event?</p>

<ol>
<li>Yes, the event was specific to 9/11/2001.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>911 happened on 911 because on 9/12/2001 two hundred and forty billion dollars in fraudulent securities became due and payable by the US treasury and paying those securities would have exposed the necessary links in 100s of massive, global international money laundering schemes and 100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison based on 100s of current and ongoing investigations at that time. Evidence of money laundering, arms sales, drug sales, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and many more crimes were destroyed forever.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>100s of elected and non-elected officials would have gone to prison?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. The FBI, the CIA, the SEC, Customs, the Secret Service, IRS, the Office Of Naval Intelligence, banking regulators and global intelligence organizations as well as a number of other government agencies were tracking the money laundering activities related to gold market manipulation and global international money laundering. The &quot;Eldorado Task Force&quot; was a group of 55 intergovernmental agencies devoted to investigating international money laundering. These investigations all began after 1989 and were tracking years of fraudulent but very sophisticated money laundering schemes. ALL investigations were immediately halted on 9/12/2001 because not only was ALL of the evidence destroyed but 100s of the government and non-government investigators were also killed.</p></li>
<li><p>Did anything unusual happen on 9/12/2001?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. For the first time in US history the Federal Reserve cleared 240 billion dollars in securities ANONYMOUSLY thanks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission invoked its emergency powers under SEC Act Section 12(k) and eased regulatory restrictions for the clearance of international securities on 9/11/2001. Think about that. The Federal Reserve allowed an anonymous individual or individuals to be paid 240 billion dollars in US denominated funds without revealing their names, location or legal status. As a result of the events of 911 George Bush, the SEC and the Federal Reserve approved the dispensing of &quot;Securities Clearance&quot; laws, for less then 15 days, a presidential approved breach of National Security, for the first time in history.</p></li>
<li><p>Why did George Bush and the Federal Reserve do this?</p></li>
<li><p>In 1989 a scheme was devised to end the Cold War and destroy the Soviet Union. The plan included crashing the currency and thus the economy, buying up the Soviet infrastructure at pennies on the dollar and leaving the Soviet Union a shell of its former self. The plan worked. In order to promote a sophisticated plan to crash the economy of the Soviet Union a massive amount of money was needed and the Federal Reserve, the SEC and with the blessings of George Bush, approved the counterfeiting of 240 billion dollars in bearer bonds, commonly referred to as Brady Bonds. This scheme was covered fully under &quot;National Security.&quot; There were 4 parts to this &quot;National Security&quot; scheme:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. Theft of the Soviet Treasury</p>

<p>b. Currency Destabilization of the Ruble</p>

<p>c. Funding the KGB Generals 1991 coup against Gorbachev</p>

<p>d. Takeover of key Soviet energy and defense industries by Western powers</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What exactly did they do once the bonds were floated?</p></li>
<li><p>Using various global intelligence assets, foreign banks and large international corporations with off-shore accounts, like Enron, but many others, they destroyed the Russian Ruble causing its value to plunge. They then bought oil, gas, steel and commodities exporters, major technological institutions and water, electric and agricultural firms within the Soviet Union. By buying up the infrastrusture (energy and defense) and then selling off the assets the economic viability of the Soviet Union was destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>What were the 3 primary reasons for 911?</p></li>
<li><p>The first and foremost reason for the events of 911 was to conceal the identities of the 100s of intelligence assets, international bankers, elected officials and international players involved in the demise of the Soviet Union and to prevent the exposure of a &quot;National Security&quot; event, the destruction of the Soviet Union. The 2nd reason behind the events of 911 was to end for all time the ongoing investigations by numerous government and non-government organizations into these money laundering and gold market manipulations. The 3rd reason behind 911 was to provide the cover to allow for vilification of Islam and for blame to be placed on Islamic Fundamentalists allowing for public opinion to support extended wars to acquire global petroleum and mining resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Were the several planes targeting specific locations?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Each plane on 911 had specific targets all of which were hit with great precision. There were 3 major securities brokers in the Twin Towers, Cantor Fitzgerald (largest in US), Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 11 hit the North Tower right below the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald destroying all records of securities transactions. Cantor Fitzgerald was the primary target. Flight 175 hit the South Tower below the offices of Eurobrokers and while this all took place massive explosions were reported in the North Tower under FBI offices on the 23rd floor and under Garbon Intercapital on the 25th floor again destroying any and all securities records. Flight 77 hit the Pentagon targeting the Office Of Naval Intelligence where investigators were working on illegal international financial schemes based out of the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald, Eurobrokers and Garbon Intercapital. Flight 77 not only destroyed all records related to these investigations but it also killed 39 of the 40 Naval Intelligence Investigators. The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania missed its target, building 7. All certificates for US bonds and other securities were completly destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this was a murder are there clues if we examine the fatalities?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes. Forty-One percent of the fatalities in the Twin Towers came from the two corporations that managed US government securities, Cantor Fitzgerald and Eurobrokers. Thirty-One percent of the fatalities at the Pentagon were from the Naval Command Center that housed the office of Naval Intelligence where 39 of 40 investigators were killed.</p></li>
<li><p>How is this cover-up maintained?</p></li>
<li><p>The event was a &quot;National Security&quot; event. Anyone connected whether media or elected officials are given the excuse that &quot;National Security&quot; is and was at stake and that&#39;s all that needs to be said. 911 hides the purposeful destruction of the Soviet Economy, massive crimes attached to that, and the need for a massive crime to cover up these massive crimes.</p></li>
<li><p>Who was involved?</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m going to list the major players in no specific order. Please remember, the events of 911 were designed to cover up illegal global international financial activity by many people, both elected and non-elected, whose privileged lives were about to go up in smoke, whose pampered lifestyles would have, if not for 911, been reduced to a life in prison. In essence, 911 was a National Security event designed to cover other National Security events, or, depending upon your perspective, a massive crime to cover even more massive crimes.</p></li>

<p>These people referred to themselves as the &quot;Vulcans.&quot; The covert operations conducted by the Vulcans involved - at a minimum - securities fraud, money laundering and violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In a number of cases murder and false imprisonment (see Leo Wanta) seemed to be the mainstay of efforts to prevent any remorseful participants from going public with their stories. While accomplishing the objective - bringing about the demise of the Soviet Union - the scheme also seems to have lined the pockets of the individuals that executed the policies at US</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh true. You&#39;re right. The media does control public opinion. Kind of like this lovely piece of copypasta you&#39;re using. How much of it have you personally researched? How much are you just regurgitating out? Obviously all of it because it&#39;s the exact copy pasta that&#39;s been passed around for years. You really showed me. You really proved what a smart guy you are. You changed my mind completely. It was all smoke and mirrors and the government is responsible. You&#39;re completely right. I don&#39;t always believe what I&#39;m told. I thought actually learning about a topic before defending it would be a smart thing to do thank you for helping me see what a sheeple I really am. Can you please point me to the nearest independent thinking website where I can get more copy pasta to use as evidence, I want the good stuff that wouldn&#39;t be obviously proven false from a small amount of due diligence. I want to just repeat the same
Things over and over without any sort of way to defend them until the idiots of the world realize how great I am for having such seecrit infoz. I want to be cool like you and totally above shit like common sense. Please, tell me what I need to believe. Let me be an independent person like you and the people you trust explicitly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, I think you&#39;re right. Honestly I do. After taking more time to research it just seems like it was a perfect storm for the administration. Just in the same way FDR was aware of the Japanese going to Pearl Harbor and let it happen, so we could get involved. I suppose it&#39;s the same thing. We wanted an excuse, and got the perfect storm. </p>

<p>Makes sense though, people were frightened that day so for some to claim to conspiracies is understandable, but nothing is really able to sustain that damage and be fine without collapsing. </p>

<p>I say this in the most genuine way, you made your point and I now understand more about it. I suppose I fell victim to the old saying, &quot;knowing enough to think you&#39;re right, but not enough to know you&#39;re wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not versed enough on the subject to claim what I did, and if thousands of engineers and architects say it&#39;s possible to fall, I won&#39;t disagree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the sidebar list of conspiracies all have hard documentation, and are widely accepted to be true. While we can <em>disprove</em> certain elements of the 9/11 story, we don&#39;t have hard documentation to <strong>actively prove</strong> it was a result of collusion at the highest levels of the U.S. government.</p>

<p>I firmly believe 9/11 was an inside job, by the way. All the evidence suggests it. But--considering how most people behave when confronted with the idea of high-level conspiracies--I think it&#39;s best to ensure the &quot;list of confirmed conspiracies&quot; consists exclusively of collusions we can document with hard evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plausible technical reasons why the planes that allegedly hit the twin towers could not have performed those aerial maneuvers without breaking apart from the G forces. Many professional pilots have tried to perform those maneuvers at those speeds in a simulator and failed. The only one that succeeded had to slow to near landing speed, which is not what the videos show.</p>
