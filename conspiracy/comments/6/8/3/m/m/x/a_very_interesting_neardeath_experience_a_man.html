       I found an amazing OBE story yesterday that I thought most people here would be interested in.
       <a href="http://www.trickedbythelight.com/tbtl/nde-transcript.html">
        Here's a link
       </a>
       to what is the transcript of an almost 3 hour interview. Of course, it's quite a long read so I'll try to highlight some of the main ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of the interview sounds like a typical near death experience. The man has a car accident, he dies, and then his life flashes before his eyes where he sees highlights of his life and the love he experienced/shared in this world. He's then in a realm of complete darkness before seeing the light that leads him back to "heaven." It's here that he experiences the true light and love of the real God/creator/source. He finds out that he has more to learn and experience about love so he's ultimately sent back to Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where things get interesting. His soul is flying through the cosmos on its way back to his body, and he quickly approaches Earth. However, before he's allowed to enter Earth's atmosphere, he's stopped by the Demiurge. He describes this being as the "god" and creator of this world (separate from the higher source he experienced in heaven), and it is essentially in charge of what happens here. The Demiurge claims that any souls entering Earth must first agree to a contract, and then it goes on to describe certain aspects of the reality here in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Demiurge isn't exactly Satan, as it's not 100% dark or evil, but it does sound like the "fallen angel" that many of us are familiar with from religious texts. This being created this world as a sort of experiment where darkness is allowed to exist, presumably in order to experience things that can't be experienced in the perfect higher realms. However, for this experiment to work, a fine equilibrium needs to be maintained with a ratio of 2/3 light to 1/3 darkness. If the equilibrium is upset, then more light or dark beings/influences are added to the world. I got the impression that what we consider the Illuminati/TPTB/the cabal/etc. are consciously aware of this fact, and their task is to ensure the 1/3 level of darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then the Demiurge tells this person that the experiment is doomed to fail, and he showed the man what will happen. The equilibrium will at some point become irrevocably upset, and the Earth will plunge into a short period of extreme darkness. Groups of the elite will retreat to their underground bases in order to escape the destruction and the wrath of their evil deeds, but their plans will ultimately fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is during this time of darkness and tribulation that the light is allowed to come flooding back into this world. Under the Demiurge, the Earth was in a sort of spell to help ensure the equilibrium could be maintained, but this essentially disappears when shit hits the fan and large masses begin to awaken. Those who survive the darkness and embrace the light will go on to create a world akin to heaven on earth. There will be no more money, suffering, disease, shitty jobs, etc. Instead it will be a world where we're allowed to create and pursue our passions before ultimately returning to Source.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more fine details in the story that are worth reading, so check it out if you have the time. But hopefully I've covered the major points for all of you here. I found this story deeply moving as it matches up with many of my personal beliefs, and I'd love to know what you all think about it.

       He says that you wouldn't be allowed to enter Earth without agreeing to the contract, but I'm not exactly sure where he would've gone if he didn't agree. However, he claims that the Demiurge tries to entice you in order to agree. It explained to him how our lives are a giant web of possibilities, and the decisions that we make at keys points in our lives determine the paths that we take. The Demiurge showed the man basically the ideal life that he could live, which was very appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also states that when you're coming from the pure light, you basically lose your ability to comprehend the suffering that exists on Earth. I guess these two factors combined make us more susceptible to agreeing. But this also connects to why the experiment will fail. More and more entities will refuse to agree to the contract and reincarnate here, which will lead to the equilibrium being upset. He explains it better, but hopefully I got the gist of it. Excellent question and thanks for reading!

       what if this was a test and he failed? From what I know of the demigurge and the higher god
       <del>
        Lucifer

       , the former does not have your best interest in mind and the latter wouldn't even see you if you weren't ready for it.

       Good points. I don't really have an answer to that, and it's not addressed in the interview. The only relevant part of the interview to this is when he meets the Source. Something like a guardian angel, a ball of light, takes him to the Source, and he tells him to lower his eyes because if he looks directly at the Source, it will kill him

       Yeah, there's a lot here that I could dissect too. The "death" seemed to be in reference to his light body, not physical, and even this is too simplistic. He does a lot more in the interview to explain how everything, even individual molecules or atoms, have an "essence" or something like that. Perhaps the death that he was referring to meant that his collective soul body would be destroyed down into its individual parts. I really don't know, and the interview doesn't offer much to answer these questions

       I'll also say that I got frustrated with the interviewer numerous times. There were several occasions where the guest was about to say something interesting, but then the interviewer interrupts him and they get sidetracked and never come back to the original idea

       Yeah, I've read that before and was actually thinking about it while reading this. Although if I remember correctly, their individual actions had to be 90% evil or something before the harvest, which isn't the same as the balance of light and dark on the Earth as a whole. But maybe I'm not remembering correctly

       I'm sure you're right, it's just funny to me how people love 666 references.   Ironically,  one of the eariest bible fragments found indicated that the number of the Beast is 616.

       Sounds great. I have a theory about these things though. If you believe in something after life you see it as your body is coming bafk to life like a dream. I got shot 20 years ago an died twice on the way to the hospital. I saw nothing and did not even knoa it happened until a few days later. I had no idea I was dead once let alone 2 times. From that I gathered it is all in your head.

       That's interesting, thanks for sharing your personal account, although I'm sorry you had to go through something like that. I don't know what the statistics are on people who experience OBEs, but I would assume it's not everyone. However, I would need to research the topic more in order to give a more insightful answer. I do agree, though, that our thoughts/experiences/beliefs likely have a strong influence on these events.

       Did your experience impact your thoughts on life from a spiritual perspective?

       Military remote viewer Joe McMoneagle went to the Monroe Institute and was asked to view the origins of the Earth. Basically, he saw something very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       He saw a demiurge who created the world. It was a sort of Petri dish to generate an energy that Robert Monroe calls "Loosh". Loosh occurs naturally in small pockets of the universe, and tons of different entities and races seem to like it like a drug. The particular demiurge who created the Earth was trying to harvest Loosh synthetically. He noted that it would be generated when his simple creations experienced pain or stress. That was with single-celled organisms. The yield was small, so he amped up the production by creating more complex creatures like plants. It was still a modest crop. So he decided to make moving plants, so that they could consume each other. Thus he formed insects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, by slow stages he created more and more complex creatures because he noticed that, with their higher consciousness-level, more Loosh would be generated when they experienced terror, fear aggressive, hyper-sexuality, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       McMoneagle describes the moment when primitive proto-humans observed the demiurge. They dropped to their knees to worship it with tears in their eyes. The demiurge was taken aback. (Evidently, it never thought of itself as a god. Nor did it solicit this reaction. In fact, it was quite puzzled by it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, this concept of entities harvesting energy from us comes up again in a book by Nick Redfern called "Final Events". It's non-fiction and has real CIA documents. There's a group within the CIA, called the Collins Elite, who tracks this stuff. It's terrifying because these hard-boiled, no-nonsense CIA spooks believe that we're not the planet's top species. That in fact we're being harvested for an energy we produce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like McMoneagle, they say that the energy is amped up when we succumb to aggression, fear, perverted sexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       They said that our society is being gamed, manipulated. Humans are being flooded with subliminal programming to act out in these ways . . . to embrace grievance, riots, transgenderism, etc. Because it all produced Loosh.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny how the military remote viewers, the CIA, the Gnostics and the guy who had this Near Death experience all seem to be seeing something very similar.

       Man, what a cool write-up. Thanks for compiling all of that. I know of McMoneagle, Schumann Resonance, loosh, etc., but I never knew that McMoneagle remote viewed that. I'll need to do some digging. Again, thanks for taking the time to write that

       Yeah, it was in one of McMoneagle's books. Not

       but the one after it. (The name of the title escapes me.)

       McMoneagle spent a lot of time at the Monroe Institute, and his wife eventually ran it for a while after Monroe died.
