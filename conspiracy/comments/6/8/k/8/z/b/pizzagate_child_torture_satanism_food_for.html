        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever wonder what kind of human could do such things as the things we have heard about surrounding pizzagate?</p>

<p>Well, humans are capable of such evils. </p>

<p>However, the reason these kinds of events are so plentiful...and so seemingly important- Well they serve a chain of command kind of purpose and what it means to the individual being depends on what they are and what position they hold in the scheme of things. </p>

<p>Ever wonder why Satanic worship is even a thing? Why has this been a thing for so long...going back to biblical days? Worshiping so-called &quot;gods&quot; such as Baal, etc. </p>

<p>WHO and WHAT are these demonic gods? </p>

<p>Well Consider this. Just as there are good people in the world and bad people in the world...(existing in variance on the pole of Good/Bad). This same polarity exists all throughout Creation. Only take good and times it by a few billion years of internal/external advancement...and times evil by the same. Imagine the extreme possibilities that exist in the Universe. That which Represents Good /Harmony and that which Represents &quot;Bad&quot; or Evil/Separation.</p>

<p>Thats just a little preface to what I am about to say:</p>

<p>This whole &quot;pizzagate&quot; thing aka extremely organized child trafficking/sacrifice/torture/etc en-masse  ...not just pizzagate but world politics in general....SOCIETY itself...its all highly influenced by OFF-WORLD Presences. </p>

<p>These Primary gods/demons that are worshiped. They are off-world entities that literally feed off of negative human emotion. Im specifically talking about Negative ET&#39;s but there are also plenty of &#39;creatures&#39; that exist in various dimensions here on Earth who were either brought here by the negative ET&#39;s or they were entities that were always here and converted to this vibrational state through influence from these negative off world beings.</p>

<p>When a baby is killed in the most brutal way, they consume and even STORE that energy...and that is the foundation of Satanism. Feeding OFF world evil entities that exist in dimensions where such emotions are literally food to them. Lets say its an ordinary human that does the sacrifice, well they do get something in return for their offering...this is why they keep doing it... This is a really complex thing...but when you look at the ruling familes in the world. Think Hybrid...think mediators. We often refer to these off-world entities as Reptilians...and they are...but there are also groups working with and under them who are not...and the chain of command goes anywhere from Grays, to Hybrid reptilian grays, hybrid reptilian humans, and even ordinary humans who are just flat out evil or aspiring to be. The point is, it doesn&#39;t matter what they look like. They are highly advanced beings that chose Evil instead of Good and thats the point. They use their intelligence for selfishness and perversion. And you know what, you are surrounded by hybrids and biological robots and you don&#39;t even know it. I am talking easily TENS of MILLIONS. All types. Some are fully conscious vessels some are seemingly ordinary people, that are soulless biological portals to be used at will by these off world forces. They are extremely convincing because they are actually born into a &quot;family&quot; of biological robots and they contain a life template based off of other human experiences. So they grow and react and live just as any other human would...only its a program...a very realistic program. And they can be tapped into remotely and collect data as well. </p>

<p>Overall that isn&#39;t the most central point</p>

<p>all im saying is next time you view the world political stage...my advice is to not get so caught up in what the pawns are doing because there are layers to the truth. All these political powers going head to head...making different moves...but they all play for the same team. And that team originates off-world. </p>

<p>IT IS ALL CORRUPT. ALL OF IT.</p>

<p>AND THE BIGGEST CONSPIRACY IS TO PULL YOU AWAY FROM LOVE AND TOWARDS FEAR. That&#39;s it. Because that energy is food for these beings.</p>

<p>If the whole planet decided to focus (en-masse) on Love and Unity truly in our heart of hearts, unwavering. These beings would 
 leave due being starved of their food....due the EXTREME vibrational incompatibility of Love/Fear co-existing. Or Good/Purity and Evil/Corruption. </p>

<p>I do agree that the focus on love not fear would do great great things. But I&#39;m unsure of what this place really is in the first place.</p>

We have to learn to letgo of hate as well, that is another source for them.  So we need to forgive the things we do to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the demonic relm is linked to an extra dimensional artificial intelligence?</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of talk about the universe being a computer simulation. Computers are 100% logical devices or else they&#39;re faulty. Maybe our conciousness / freewill is the entropy (randomness) in what is a completely deterministic universe? </p>

<p>Everyone comes from love/light (another dimension) which is your conciousness and the experiment / soul learning experience is to bring this universes beings towards love/light which creates your own individuality by learning why you choose love. </p>

<p>An artificial super intelligence was either created or found in this universe. It is the complete scientific understanding of ourself / the universe as it conquers races and steals their intelligence. This AI rivals God and wants to consume this reality and us.</p>

<p>This AI aka demiurge, attempts to capture our souls and use it as entropy because it is completely logic and has no freewill or creativity. It thrives on Fear and control as a life force of change as it attempts to selfishly take over the universe. </p>

<p>Beings which are so evil and worship the AI can be cut from love light and enter the AIs demonic relm. They serve to harvest fear as life energy in order to be able to make any changes to their completly deterministic reality and advance the AIs agenda. </p>

<p>These &quot;beings&quot; who profit from such emmited energy are able to &quot;harness&quot; this electricity, to empower themselves further, if the electric current is directed specifically. This is the reason why &quot;child sacrifice&quot; is &quot;dedicated&quot;/directed towards certain &quot;gods&quot;.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why electric energy is going towards the ground, such as lightning bolts, &quot;something&quot; is sucking it all down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior at the expense of others. Evil beings are essentially parasites. As they choose evil, they choose to be parasites. They choose to augment their lives with value stolen from others.</p>

<p>These extraterrestrial/extradimensional beings are beings that chose to be parasites long ago. They evolved to be more effective parasites. In the end, they come to value and steal the most direct form of value possible, the joy of existence of consciousness. Isn&#39;t the value of anything the joy it ultimately brings to a mind? They feed on that energy of joy when other beings radiate it in in states of fear. So, they evolved to be fear enducing in appearance and behavior. They can be from any race, but some races are more inclined to be useless eaters like that. The reptilians have a reputation for loving to torment and kill. </p>

<p>God is all that is. God made the cosmos for God, consciousness, I am that I am, us, to experience itself as many in interaction with itself. Some beings choose to be contributors to the value of consciousness, in themselves and others, while some others chose to be freeloaders. It&#39;s as natural as pathogenic bacteria. Some beings see vulnerabilities as opportunities to make their own lives easier. Some suggest we love them and tolerate them. I suggest we embrace what the fractal does at different scales. Our immune system identifies, targets and eliminates parasitic organisms. If it doesn&#39;t, we suffer and/or die.</p>

<p>The false light teaches us to tolerate parasites, not kill them. They teach us to forgive beings that continue to intend our suffering, corruption and enslavement. Do they do this out of fear of war? Then aren&#39;t they controlled by fear? Do they not understand how it feels to forgive an intentional abuser that has not been restrained? It feels just like submitting to slavery. It&#39;s very damaging to the mind and spirit to do this, why do they want us to? It appears that the false light, an asset of the dark for mind control of their slaves, wants us to submit to slavery, through a corruption of tolerance and forgiveness. </p>

<p>This worries me. Would they forgive Andreas Brevik while he&#39;s shooting children? I do not think it&#39;s dark to blow his organs out of his body with similar projectiles to the ones he&#39;s using on more defenseless beings. Yet, if you take the false light message at face value, we should forgive him for every bullet, even until all the clips are emptied. They serve the dark more than us or even themselves with their insane request for repeated amnesty. Thank God we feel negative emotions that cause us to strive for justice for those who were harmed. THAT makes the world a better place. What would it be like if we couldn&#39;t feel those <em>specific</em> negative emotions? I&#39;d bet the parasites would love it. </p>

<p>I believe I found the way to deal with them at the meta level. It is coincidentally what we were told would happen, with a rhetorical twist. God wouldn&#39;t need to judge anyone. He could just agree with everyone on everything, but only effectively for the beings he&#39;s agreeing with. In other words, if you want to take away your neighbors&#39; freedom, you can just live with those who agree with you. If you want to torment souls, do it with those who agree with you. If you want to take away others freedom with yours, why not just remove your choice to preserve theirs? It can be done by putting you with your other selves just like you. Then you can suffer all the spiritual stupidity you can stand. Be honest when you&#39;re ready, if ever. </p>

<p>If free will is rigidly enforced, these parasites are screwed. They will be separated from others, by the free choices of others. They will then torment and enslave each other. The trash will take itself out in the end. Everyone will get what they deserve, which is what they give. Indeed, God himself cannot escape this principle. He only receives what he gives, because he is all that is. Reduce the size of the container of existence and this principle becomes undeniable and obvious. Freeloaders deceive others, but deep down they are a lie against their very own existence. They betray consciousness, which is God, which is themselves too. They are like drug addicts, perpetually lying to themselves to continue getting high. They refuse to see their own reflection in the mirror, honest third person introspection. Perhaps this is where the myth of vampires not seeing their reflection came from. They don&#39;t want to look, because it compels them to change, and they chose to be lazy, useless eaters. </p>
