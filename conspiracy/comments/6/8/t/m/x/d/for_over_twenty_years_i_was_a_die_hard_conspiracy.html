       That's what they want you to do.  Been especially hard as a Bernie supporter who refused to vote for either of the two evils.

       I'd recommend redirecting that energy towards something else. I agree, researching can take a lot out of you.
      </p>

       Obviously don't know anything about you as a person but I'd suggest spending some time with others and 'creating'. Can be very beneficial.

       Actually I'm working on a new album for music and a new documentary project unrelated to these topics. Yeah, it's just a matter of redirecting energy and stepping back. I love the truth movement, hence why I know that if I've reached this point a regrouping of mind and soul is needed.

       Maybe choose a subject to research that doesn't have terribly deep or dark implications for a while. I'm taking a break from PG for a bit for similar reasons. You can't help anyone if you are in too much of a funk.

       This is a topic I've been meaning to write up but apparently big foot DNA has been found, taken (from a live photographed big foot) run for DNA testing and came back as positive match for some human DNA

       Pretty interesting at the time as no news outlets covered it at all.

       I can't communicate the terms effectively and you know what I am getting at. I will be sure to use "proper" scientific lingo when I do the write up so it does not offend people like yourself that can't grasp the general notion I am trying to get across.

       Also you failed to learn respect. You can speak three languages but have not even touched on the respect or humble part of social conversation. Looks like you have some education to attend to friend.

       I'm fairly certain google, or its parent company alphabet, is not a learning institution, nor does it offer tutoring services. Furthermore, this person acknowledged that they'd used improper terminology and that they'd do better in future yet you persist. This seems to indicate you cannot recognize small victories, compromise, or civility. Not recognizing civility is further shown when no thanks was proffered and you say you're welcome. This is generally considered to be rude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not attacking you, merely explaining why others are. If you'd like to change interactions in the future this comment is here as a resource for education, which you seem to be an advocate of in some way.

       Wow you're even more of a tool than I thought. If you don't realize that Google is probably the last place at this point you should be getting an unbiased uncensored information (or as you said education) from, you should probably shut the fuck up and quit calling people out on little shit (in the grand scheme  of things) especially when everybody else knew what they were trying to say anyways. This is what OP is saying. This course of research is so fucking toxic that it's hard to give a fuck anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The resistance can't even get along much less come together or figure anything out. Okay so maybe the person was wrong. Do you forget that that is another human being on the other side? Should we really talk to each other in this subreddit like that when we are probably the only ones that as a group are even REMOTELY on the same page for the most part?
      </p>

       No, let's just keep being dicks to each other while the elite fucking destroy our entire existence. That makes alot of sense.

       I recently got interested in Bigfoot after purposefully avoiding it for a long time thinking it was ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is WAY more information out there than I had ever thought possible. Personally, after about 3-4 months of pretty vigilant research, I am convinced they exist. Also fear free blast researching it.

       The crazy thing is, pretty much all of these conspiracy and supposed fringe subjects have more evidence and research done on them by orders of magnitude. I would go out on a limb and even say that probably 50% of supposed conspiracy theories have so much evidence that if it was any other socially acceptable subject, and you put it into a court of law, it would be proven and accepted as fact time and time again.

       Well said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you check out though,  there must be a short list of key sources you have come to respect in one way or another,  even if they are not perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       People unify against the establishment differently than the establishment "unifies" to keep its grip.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters,  here is a list I keep of some of the people whom I still respect.    Sorry,  I don't respect Noam Chomskey enough to put him on this list:
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen F. Cohen, Jon Cole, David Chandler, Daniele Ganser, Sharyl Attkisson, Mark Crispin Miller, Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, F. William Engdahl ,Paul Craig Roberts, Francis Richard Conolly, Peter Dale Scott, Pepe Escobar, Andrew J. Bacevich, John Judge (1948-2014), John Pilger, Mark Blyth, Niall Ferguson, Bill Moyers,  Stephen Kinzer, Robert Parry and Mike Lofgren.   Not saying these folks are right on everything,  but I still want to know where they are heading on issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sibel Edmonds, Corbett Report, even Jimmy Dore (who landed a gob of spit on AJ's face) have their own channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still listen to Julian Assange,  but not to Sam Harris.    Another one with some insight is Slavoj Zizek.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump got folks like Mike Rivera exposed for poor judgement.    There are generations of people who will feel like they wasted their lives,  but who each carried a bit of the flame forward.    But now,  opportunities have been squandered,  credibility destroyed.   It will take a new beginning from here,  mostly by new people,  I am afraid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen F. Cohen, Jon Cole, David Chandler, Daniele Ganser, Sharyl Attkisson, Mark Crispin Miller, Kevin Ryan, David Ray Griffin, F. William Engdahl ,Paul Craig Roberts, Francis Richard Conolly, Peter Dale Scott, Pepe Escobar, Andrew J. Bacevich, John Judge (1948-2014), John Pilger, Mark Blyth, Niall Ferguson, Bill Moyers,  Stephen Kinzer, Robert Parry and Mike Lofgren.
and dozens more. 
If you want someone who has their own "channel" try Sibel Edmonds, Corbett Report, even Jimmy Dore (who landed a gob of spit on AJ's face).

       There's a lot of good voices and a lot of good sources out there, but even under the best intentions, none of them are perfect. Listen to them all with an open mind but with a grain of salt, and know the narrative(s) can change at any moment. Wisdom is key.

       Mike was really pitching Trump hard,  very partisan,  until Trump attacked that Syrian air strip and neighboring village.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,  last I checked,  Rivera was having to admit Trump was a disappointment to him.

       a few litmus tests for people,  some of which are going to end me listening to them at all.    Some people cross that line,  and for me,  Mike crossed that line.    It would take a lot for me to reconsider.

       First heard about M.R. from the Vince Foster case etc which was excellent stuff!
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, I gave Mike R. broadcast a really long
       <em>
        run for the money
       </em>
       and listened to him far longer than he deserved my two hours of attention 5 x's per week (Ron's commercial free work is excellent!) but in all honesty he started out with
       <em>
        Any body but Hillary
       </em>
       . And indeed fell in line with his blather of wanting a spot in the WH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it was a couple months ago and he got really shitty with a caller concerning Hollywood and Pizzagate; that of all things was my breaking point.

       Agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to also admit,  the DNC and even Bernie really pissed me off,  to the point I refuse to be called a liberal or even a progressive,  or left.    I am so done with the identity politics,  what a damn scam.   So,  it was easy for me to have some sympathy for MR,  except that he even went off half cocked against Jill when she raised that money to help expose the corrupt election system after Trump won.   It was not pro Hillary what Jill was doing as far as I can see,   and Jill even offered Bernie to take the front ticket for the Green Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left really fucked themselves,  and Trump was not loved by the right.    But MR fell into a trap,  a pit.    He became blindly partisan.   I don't forgive that easily.

       Over my many long years I've listened to so many voices and or yammering idiots that can be used by any number of groups. Back in the day I was a huge political junky and a news hound because I saw my peers not paying attention.

       When everyone was voting for Reagan I was headed the other direction. Pretty sure I've melded into an Anarchist by definition - knowing that the Libertarians hoisted up a freaky joke intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did agree with Jill Stein on many planks and then she spent obscene amounts of money to fight the obvious. Our Courts are a joke - I understand her passion but again, it is Vote Reform (where I strongly agree with MR!) that has to be done. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well before Bernie got roughed up by the Arkansas Mafia I was looking into the shennanigans of his wife but really, Bernie was IMHO always a Token Politician to be used when he was needed.

       I am called a young whippersnapper all the time,  by people in their 90's and 80's,  but  I was already 27 in '81 when the heavy metal era took off in earnest,   so I am likely a bit older than you are.

       Politically I was turned off by living in DC when JFK was shot,  when Kent State happened,   when Nixon won in 68.    Living through Carter,  Reagan and everything since has been an insult to any thinking person.    These days,  I catch up on old radicals like Mark Twain,  brush up on the failure of the left during the depression,  the way the labor movement was corrupted and bought off.

       Of the various experiments in nation building, the certain examples where social welfare, life expectancy, education, medicine, quality of life progressed, over many decades, do in fact exist.
Where private property has been worshiped above all, where there were no checks on corporate power, where inequality increased and the middle class were shrinking,  would it be fair to call that real capitalism, or real democracy? One thing that Venezuela and the present USA share in common is that the game is rigged.

       Dr. Ron Paul made sense before he was overthrown by his son. Seems we can agree this country is in a mess and going to Mars is a damned sick joke.

       Dr. Ron Paul would have been better than anyone else we have had in recent decades,   but I think George Carlin or was that Bill Hicks, was being more realistic:   showing of the Dallas JFK film to anyone who made it to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.    Deep State agendas and top donors have had the reins.    Somewhere else,  away from the center of empire,  they will be experimenting with a political community that is in service to what the best of civilization has to offer,  which is a lot.    It is a commonwealth that has been squandered.    What needs to be choked is the corruption,  which amounts to treason.

       Bill Hicks did a great standup about the JFK assassination introduction to newly elected Presidents. George Carlin - Frank Zappa too!

      <p>
       There's a Canadian that presents how the courts are all tied to the Crown etc. and he's funny as hell while slinging truth! Robert Menard - he talks about the corruption of the courts, law in a funny but sobering manner. In a round about way he clues us in to the insanity of how and why the meaning of the word "is" becomes so important. 
There's a time stamp on this, as it does begin with a religious bent  (I replace with
       <em>
        spiritual
       </em>
       ) but overall this is my aspiration of anarchy:

       Seems futile to think we'll ever fix or correct the corruption. We follow the law out of moral compass (in most cases...) and would never imagine murdering one and getting away with it scott-free. Our
       <em>
        elected leaders
       </em>
       rape, rob and pillage with no consequences.
Disheartening and exhausting.

       This is key.   Obviously there have been examples where a good dentist had improved peoples lives,  or where the public enjoyed a nice city park that was clean and did not cost a ridiculous amount to maintain,  or where a school house delivered a decent schooling at a fair cost by conscientious teacher who was deservedly respected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The modern examples of inefficiencies and waste (stage 2) have been accumulating for so many decades now that memories of anything else are now very distant and inconceivable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tendency for affluent institutions to become bloated and corrupt (stage 2) is indeed unstoppable,  but their eventual collapse is equally assured.     The case studies of collapse and the subsequent effects (stage 3),  or more hopefully,   the early stage real quality that happens in lean times (stage 1) by sincere people are two other extremes that fill in the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The application of rule of law or its absence are also reflected in the three stages noted and the most remarkable aspect I can identify is that the rulers and their ministers have no intention or ability to fix anything,  but merely to live well and kick the can down the road.    Anyone who would have the ability or intention to fix anything would be intentionally excluded,  driven out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes,  that can be disheartening or exhausting,  but what happens is that decent people are found to be elsewhere,  and developing special coping skills from outside.    Often in the black market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideals are not realistic to be applied.   Idealism or ideology is a tool used to motivate masses of people,  but it is only effective within a small window of particular circumstances that are more determined by the seasons.     This season will pass,  and a new season is already in the budding phase.    But like I said,  yesterdays empires are not going to lead the seasonal variations.    And the bigger the egos,  the louder the complaints and gnashing of teeth will be,  often by those who are the least competent to adapt.

       I wasn't thinking of Aaron but I like how you think.    Too much of what should be the public domain has been converted into private property.    The privatized sector is just the tip of the iceburg,  because corruption has bought out the whole government so the only non corrupt sector is within the black market.   If you hire someone who is "playing by the book",   they have effectively become a part of the rigged system,  distorted by corrupt policies,  and there is effectively a barrier to entry into this system.    Try to become an honest roofer or an honest mechanic.   You can't.   To go by the book,  to pass the barriers to entry,   you have to rip off you customers and your workers and play games with your taxes or you won't survive.   You most likely also have to leverage yourself silly and lie on loan documents and engage in other deceptive practices in your advertising etc.  just to remain "competitive".    Such "entrepreneurs" usually feel someone precarious and exposed due to the fact that any real scrutiny would not be welcome.    They often join with and network with others who have political favor,  weasel their way into the inner circle in an attempt to "buy protection" from those they think can help cover them.    That is partly why elections are becoming ever more bitter,   because the in party is likely to use the IRS,  FBI,  etc.  against those in the out party,  and heads roll within the top levels of this mafia.   So,  even though the elite has all this power,   they never have enough to satisfy this sense of paranoia.   Anyone who wants to be a politician is immediately suspect for even being willing to deal with the stench of all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stench of all this has permeated down to almost every level of the "official" economy and the "legitimate" establishment.   Its becoming a crime to try to stay on the fence and not be assimilated into the official lies.    To question authority,  to doubt the official truth,  is already to be in the black market.

       My father realized he couldn't fight TPTB, the prejudices of everyday man and he spent a great deal of time going over/through much of what he was
       <em>
        raised under
       </em>
       - but really in the end - he just wanted to be left alone to raise his kids, run his business etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised between two very diverse homes and in that, I feel I was very
       <em>
        fortunate
       </em>
       . Honestly, I got the stronger distrust of all things government, religion, moral compass and work ethic etc. from my father.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing, experiencing hypocrisy, bigotry up close in my mothers house. She saw my brother in his Navy Uniform and gushed with pride. I grieved. My dad (we kids...) sacrificed a lot to keep him out of the Draft of Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing men and women that wield great power and then do nothing when
       <em>
        corruption
       </em>
       is rampant, is galling, reprehensible and imho treasonous.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day I cannot look at Rand Paul with anything but disgust! I was grieved that Dr. Ron Paul didn't tell his kid and Rinse Pubics to  take a flying leap. Oh hell! how people do not want to see how that
       <em>
        machine
       </em>
       is oiled, tuned, tweaked and subverted!
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm very fortunate to live in reasonably small town that has/had some strong, well meaning people. Ten and twelve years ago Meth was everywhere! Nermal people could see the decay plowing the town under! People took it upon themselves to organize
       <em>
        clean ups
       </em>
       of distressed properties ergo lives too. Honestly, genuine help was offered and given without
       <em>
        citations of threats
       </em>
       nor was
       <em>
        forced removal of persons or children
       </em>
       unless there were abuse or neglect*. It was amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last go round the people got lazy and complacent - they
       <em>
        Elected
       </em>
       an outsider! This guy, Mayor doesn't even live in the city (he ran on old name status...) but his cronies (that chaffed at all us do-gooders) are running amok. It
       <strong>
        turns the screw
       </strong>
       that fast!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm exhausted but I'll fight to my last breath and on my feet, I hope!

       Noam Chomsky does an excellent job of cataloguing certain history,  and for that he is a great repeater of facts that anyone could gather from the same readily available public sources.    Noam is not indispensable as a brilliant chronicler of this history of empire,   there are plenty more.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the reverence for Noam has been a problem when Noam has been so vocal against 9/11 truth or even JFK truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noam isn't even a clearing house for whistleblowers like Assange is.   Reverence to him is what pisses me off,  just like reverence to Sam Harris pisses me off.    They get more attention than warranted and fail key litmus tests for people I trust.    Same with Amy Goodman.   Will listen to them all as 2nd or 3rd tier information,   but will also pay special attention to what they won't say,  or who they are afraid of pissing off.

       Chomsky probably didn't make it on his list, because he prefers Zizek. You can see them both diss eachother on YouTube because of differences over Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.

       Thanks for the work you have done. I too can't do this sort of research because it is psychologically too hard on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My recommendation is to start working on projects that create change.  Bitcoin, for instance, takes power away from the establishment and shakes up economies. That's a good thing.

       I think it's still got ways to get worse before it gets better, and that's what scares me, that it'll get so bad that I'll turn into the same demons humanity's trying to rid itself of, and I've already become a jaded prick. By the time things get better, I won't be able to see it, I'll just see more traps and lures. I'll throw this sin out there, I've been praying for the Korean War to blow up into a nuclear exchange the past few days, even with the knowledge it'll kill uncountable numbers of people, including myself if it takes the global economy with it. I've let myself become such an extreme misanthrope that I've been praying for humanity to get the humiliation of a lifetime, with the knowledge and acceptance that my own sins will be just as prominently displayed as everyone else's when judgement comes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let this sin of mine be known. Digging into conspiracies, however limited and lazy I've been with my research, has convinced me that humanity at it's very core naturally deceives itself and others, most likely brought all this bullshit on itself, would rather blame aliens or gods or the weather and planets rather than itself, and that going anywhere in this life just isn't worth it, and that I'm better off shutting myself out from everyone, because absolutely fucking everything is corrupted, and I don't have the moral strength or integrity or stability to handle getting pelted with shit in every single direction. Life itself just doesn't feel worth the struggle anymore, no matter how great the reward I'm "promised", and that' assuming God, or whatever's pretending to be the creator of the universe, will just throw me in eternal literal clouds and pearly gates, and literally nothing else because that's what eternal life is, just bland eternal worship drones that only a zealous lunatic would accept. Just a mockery of devoting my life to Jesus Christ even though I've come to realize religion is bullshit even though I've kept my Christian beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I die, God will have a lot to answer to me for letting this world become the way it is, and why I was put on this dysfunctional rock bathed in constant propaganda and deception and vicious nature to begin with either.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Most if not all have a chance of being fake. Why? Because we weren't there when it happened so truly the only person that knows the truth is the "whistle blower" same goes for everything that happens in this world.

       I am not new to conspiracies (though new to this sub as far as posting. My Uncle told me about it long ago and I have read it a long time) and what I see, not just here, is that so many seem to have taken sides (politically) and that has become more important than actual research and facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is our president now, and the government pretty much remains the same. Coverups, etc that have been there years are still there - it doesn't matter the president (presidents and congress change a lot) because most in the government stay between administrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some want their focus to be on hillary (to attack dems/liberals), others directly on trump/republicans (and no, I don't like them but am a registered independent like most in my family). Taking of sides can color discussions and distract people from looking for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this we get flat earthers flooding the new queue and looking for attention. Between mainly political posts (for which my uncle was banned from here, he posted something negative about trump last year - literally the reason he was banned) and BS posts from trolls/etc things have gotten off track.

       May I suggest a different research topic? I have an incredibly interesting question that I've been trying to answer for years. Here it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said, conspiracy theorists very often have contradicting views of events. At most one of these conflicting views is true; the rest are wrong. My question regards to those who believe incorrect details about reality. The question is, why? How does that happen? What makes people not only hold wrong views about reality, but also advocate for them, and name-call others for expressing doubt?

       Randall Carlson has inspired me to learn more about geology. I recommend devoting some time in pursuit of something more grounded (pun intended) but also still relevant to being a truth-seeker. There's loads out there in our ancient history that we just have no information on, and it feels purposefully suppressed. The information overload we've been getting in the last few years
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       overwhelming, depressing, agitating, all of it, so it's good to step back and look at something you know for
       <em>
        sure
       </em>
       is true, rather than racking your brain trying to decipher bullshit from reality.

       People aren't necessarily worried about truth anymore.  It's all about appearances or image or fitness.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't want to believe they are deluding themselves when it comes to truth but it's actually quite common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?  Because the world is complex, language is limited and often we're just too busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we all develop ways to filter, categorize and process data streams yet all of these ways can blind us to some truth or falsehood yet we will remain blissfully unaware because we have faith in our information processing routines.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've seen it literally THOUSANDS of times.  Someone is making a very good point but there is nuance and context required to understand it.  But then along comes someone with a silly soundbite that discredits the person or the point, but the soundbite is actually not correct, and all of a sudden all support for the truth evaporates sometimes instantaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm starting to think perception is truth and therefore uncovering truth isn't nearly as important and building proper perceptions.

       I don't mean to discredit all of the above or insult the notion of conspiracy theory. This has just been my experience.

       Divide and conquer is their tactic, yes. You have to approach

       knowing this. Helps you see through it and focus on normal interaction.

       Having said that, of course take a break. In fact take a break from real people, too. Get out of the city for a couple days.

        if I don't take a long break, I'm afraid I'll become a jaded prick who feels humanity is getting what they deserve.

       Ah.  I see.  Well…there’s your problem right there.  I mean I'd say humanity has a lot of redeeming qualities, but what happens is really up to us and our own doing.  If we’re fucked, it’s because we’re allowing ourselves to be fucked.  I know it’s not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       simple, but…well, sometimes it kind of is.

        I have days where a part of me regrets it, wondering if ultimately did it change anything, or did I waste thousands of hours over decades?

       Wait a minute…

      <p>
       did you LEARN while doing your research?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if you did, then it WAS worth it, man.  Come on.  Fuck everyone else.  Your research educates YOU.  Don’t come here and say you’re discouraged because the rest of the world is going to shit and the information you try to impart is shat on.  That’s the world we live in.  This place sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re not here for others, however.  You’re here for YOU.  You’re here to educate YOURSELF.  Help others - sure.  Absolutely.  Help everyone you can.  However, the moment you base your worth or your tiredness or whatever on how
       <em>
        others
       </em>
       are doing…well, that’s the moment you fuck up.  That’s the moment you end up…well…like you presently are.  Dried up, spent, wasted out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that.  Again, educate YOURSELF.  If your goal is to make sure that you know as much as you can, then no time you spend here or anywhere searching for the truth is ever, EVER wasted.

       Don't quit now. 2016 was a turning point. A significant portion of the population got woke to those who are waging economic war against us. I truly believe that a revolution is afoot. Folks are like babies being born, screaming and crying as they're being yanked out of the warm darkness and into the light. Don't let it wear you down, Brother. The world needs you.

       The Satanic Psychopaths that control this planet are very close to the Microchip Implant and Brain/Computer Interface of the public. The entire Human Race is heading towards Eternal Subjugation. We need to go full steam on waking up the public. I personally find numerous periods of Deep Meditation and Visualization cleanse and refuel the Mind and Body...

       And they're all sick fuck satanists, and they've used their power to create money to buy up nearly everything of value, and now they seem to control everything except the people themselves, and they kinda do that through mass media and controlling the makers of culture, the sources of information, who do you think makes the textbooks that the US schools teach in all grades?  The small number of families and their satellites control the world, and they're psychopaths and sociopaths!
