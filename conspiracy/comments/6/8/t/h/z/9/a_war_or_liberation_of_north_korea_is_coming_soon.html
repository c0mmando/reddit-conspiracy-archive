    <div class="md"><p>First, Crushing NK is not an easy matter. They had decades to prepare and entrench. Second, why would China agree to have NK crushed and then have US bases along its border?

Talk all the time about destroying the United States.  If those reports about all the concentration camps are also true you&#39;ve got like 4 good reasons right there. To me it really doesn&#39;t even seem like a conspiracy, this country has pretty much not aged/matured since the Korean War, and done nothing but make bad decisions on the international stage.

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Russian vilification has been overkill and Americans see it. Trump may have turned on them recently, but for a long enough time he was &quot;this is bullshit,&quot; and that lingers (because it is bullshit).</p>

<p>Iran--people are totally sick of Middle East meddling and there&#39;s really been nothing to pin on Iran.</p>

<p>No. Korea, though....that guy&#39;s been painted as a nut--Putin may be defined as evil, but he&#39;s no loose cannon--and pretty much all of us can agree on that. Hell, even I can and I don&#39;t want us taking him out. </p>

<p>Also think people see No. Korea as easier to defeat than Russia and/or Iran. And the relentless drumbeat of totalitarian cult of personality police state/prison state makes them the worst-looking nation on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that matters, what matters is the ability to:<br/>
1. First start a war with the country. Which gives the U.S. more reason to pump out more money.<br/>
2. Set up a new government using the C.I.A. and install certain controllable puppets.<br/>
3. Set up banks at the same time as gov&#39;t.<br/>
4. The rest of everything falls in place after that.<br/>
By that I mean, however the people in charge want to control their population, will use the gov&#39;t to set that up.  Which will no doubt develop country, but at the same time, allow the banks to start holding large amounts of debt over that country, and then its ensnared into the system the rest of the system the majority of the world is in.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Popularity ois a big one - people dislike Trump, and enjoy (the start of) a war. Kim is easy to point to as a bad guy. Probably less of a drawn out war, more of a decapitation strike. If it all goes well, it&#39;s an feather in his cap, like Osama was. If it all goes badly though, that&#39;s a whole different kettle of fish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rare earth metals will be like the next oil when oil becomes impractical. China has most of the world&#39;s rare earth metals, which is unfortunate us especially. What if the whole motivation for this is all is to create a unified Korea with the south in charge so they can mine rare earth metals and sell it to us, decreasing the power the Chinese will gain when green energy is more economical and the world is collapsing due to oil shortages.</p>
