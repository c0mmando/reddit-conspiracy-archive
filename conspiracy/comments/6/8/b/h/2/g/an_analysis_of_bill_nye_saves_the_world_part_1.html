       Most of us remember Bill Nye from our childhood, as we excitedly yelled “Bill, Bill, Bill” when we watched
       <em>
        Bill Nye the Science Guy
       </em>
       , mostly on the days teachers needed a break or did not feel like teaching. Eerily enough, he has reemerged as a nostalgic figure that many seem to “worship” in the scientific community. This profound admiration and worship of mainstream "scientists" like Bill Nye, Neil Degrasse Tyson, and Stephen Hawking is troubling. Their celebrity status is manipulative and powerful, and I believe helping our society move toward
       <em>
        scientism
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        excessive belief in the power of scientific knowledge and techniques.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are now worshipping “scientists” as they would high priests in past societies. By the way, I am not anti-science; however, I am extremely skeptical of scientists who are bought, paid for, and pushed by mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this new show boldly and disturbingly called "Bill Nye Saves the World", Bill Nye looks expectedly old, but his eyes are dark. He has extremely specific hand gestures and movements, which seem odd to me. I know for many this may be far-fetched, but it reminds me of “magick” movements. Even if you think the magick thing is ridiculous, remember the power of gestures. Prominent leaders, for example, talk with their hands:

        https://www.forbes.com/2010/09/21/body-language-hands-gestures-forbes-woman-leadership-communication.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, I am going to examine the first two episodes of
       <em>
        Bill Nye Saves the World
       </em>
       . This is for the people who really cannot stand to sit through every episode, or who may not have time to analyze or evaluate the episodes. I tried to watch more than two episodes today, but it started to get difficult. I honestly felt exhausted by the end of the second episode, and that was because the agenda was so clear, obvious, and saddening. Had it been the 16-year-old version of me, I definitely would have taken a liking to this show. Now, I know better.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Episode 1
       </strong>
       "Earth is a Hot Mess"
      </p>
      <p>
       The big push of this episode is climate change and global warming. By the way, I have no solid opinion on the validity of either (the information is so conflicting), but this episode is strongly pushing the narrative that the world is in a treacherous state due to global warming. Bill Nye starts this episode and interestingly explains it is for “adult kids.” Does anybody remember the "child people" in Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.mssresearch.org/?q=Siddhartha">
        http://www.mssresearch.org/?q=Siddhartha
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, he goes into a simple explanation of greenhouse gases and global warming. The show is cut into “entertaining” segments for the viewers to stay engaged. He interviews a woman about the MOSE project, the name a biblical reference to Moses parting the seas. This project is $5.5 billion euros, and it is a complicated system of locks used for high tides and displacement of water. Here is more information on the MOSE project:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSE_Project">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSE_Project
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill then “needs a minute” and goes on a rant about his credentials and his beliefs about climate change. He rants about climate change deniers, and says that their thoughts on scientific uncertainty are invalid. He then appeals to viewers’ emotions and talks about his parents and World War II. Then he has a “distinguished panel” to discuss global warming and their ideas for solutions. They have another experiment about acidity in the ocean, and he goes into another “preaching episode”, and then Zach Braff walks in as a celebrity endorsement and false authority on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Analysis:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This episode literally felt like I was watching a preacher in a church. Bill Nye provided enough entertainment to keep the general audience engaged. There was a constant push that Bill Nye had authority on the topic, since he was (is?) an engineer and he has had New York Times best-selling books. There were fun little experiments, but there were not counter-arguments. Bill Nye mentioned skeptics, but he never addressed their concerns. Even 8th graders are taught how to address counter-arguments. Moreover, he went on many rants, and he continually sought to get the audience excited and chant certain phrases about global warming. To me, the final act of desperation was bringing Zach Braff out, who has no real authority on the subject. This episode had a definite narrative and agenda, and whatever your thoughts on global warming, it is clear what they want you to believe. In my opinion, this episode was made simple enough, and engaging enough, to draw a simple-minded audience in, and it worked. It was unfortunately highly entertaining, and highly scientific concepts were ridiculously simplified. As a teacher (endorsed in science by the way), I would say most of the scientific concepts were presented at a 6th-8th grade level.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Episode 2
       </strong>
       “Tune Your Quack-O-Meter”
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a reference to black magic right at the beginning (and several times throughout the episode), which is strange to me. Here are some main points from the show, since there was A LOT going on. I had to use bullet points for this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Magnets do not work in healing. Bill Nye states, “It is not magic…It is…,” and the audience chants “science!”
      </p>
      <p>
       • He talks about the placebo effect. This shows how “simple” this show is, since I assume most of us learned about the placebo effect in middle school.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Bill needs another minute, and he says that regulations are not arbitrary or not about “The Man.” Alternative medicine does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       • There is a reference to Edgar Cayce. Edgar Cayce once stated, “Sound is the medicine of the future.” They are completely dismissing and mocking this statement, and go into a ridiculous “sound segment.” This is pretty painful to watch – I fast-forwarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       • It is important to note that Edgar Cayce had extremely specific recommendations about health, some of which were revolutionary. I have read many of his works, if anybody is interested! One of my favorites quotes about Edgar Cayce is,
      </p>
      <p>
       *"Great numbers of children will be born who understand electronics and atomic power as well as other forms of energy. They will grow into scientists and engineers of a new age which has the power to destroy civilization unless we learn to live by spiritual laws.” *
      </p>
      <p>
       What a fascinating prediction...
      </p>
      <p>
       • He interviews the lady from the sound segment, and she says it “freaks her out” that people get off their medications for alternative forms of therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
       • There is another distinguished panel to discuss the placebo effect. They constantly mock one of the guys defending some alternative therapy. He says, “Just because we do not understand something does not mean it does not work.” They cut him off continually and make him look ridiculous. He does seem to bring up some valid points on alternative medicine, but they continually cut him off.
      </p>
      <p>
       • An Indian writer from the show comes on to talk about how he hates alternative medicine and sound therapy. He continually "disses" beliefs and traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism . He continually mentions and mocks white people, as well. He reprimands Indian people for “lying” to white people about alternative medicine and practices. Note: It is interesting here that he only references the physical yoga, not knowing that is only one aspect of yoga in spiritual practices. This Indian guy is used to mock Indian beliefs and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       • The episode ends with more experiments on how alternative medicine does not work, and let’s remember, it’s not magic, it’s science!
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Analysis:
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This episode was basically a continuous mockery of anything “alternative” and not endorsed by science. I found it very interesting they brought up Edgar Cayce. Here is some more information on sound therapy, though I have not done much research:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.edgarcaycenyc.org/ancient-sounds-modern-healing-new-insights-from-new-masters">
        https://www.edgarcaycenyc.org/ancient-sounds-modern-healing-new-insights-from-new-masters
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://qz.com/595315/turns-out-sound-healing-can-be-actually-well-healing/">
        https://qz.com/595315/turns-out-sound-healing-can-be-actually-well-healing/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of the episode is that if you even consider alternative medicine, you must be a complete fool. The episode emphasizes that no alternative medicine could work and alternative medicine has never worked, and it is completely based on the placebo effect. “Science” is here to protect us, and we must listen to science.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Conclusion
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just Part 1 of my written series on this show.  If you liked my post and commentary, I will do the next two episodes. 
This show is complete propaganda and brainwashing, and there is a clear agenda. It is important to distinguish between science and scientism. I think this website (
       <a href="https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism">
        https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism
       </a>
       ) explains the contrast clearly:
      </p>
      <p>
       “So if science is distinct from scientism, what is it? Science is an activity that seeks to explore the natural world using well-established, clearly-delineated methods. Given the complexity of the universe, from the very big to very small, from inorganic to organic, there is a vast array of scientific disciplines, each with its own specific techniques. The number of different specializations is constantly increasing, leading to more questions and areas of exploration than ever before. Science expands our understanding, rather than limiting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientism, on the other hand, is a speculative worldview about the ultimate reality of the universe and its meaning. Despite the fact that there are millions of species on our planet, scientism focuses an inordinate amount of its attention on human behavior and beliefs. Rather than working within carefully constructed boundaries and methodologies established by researchers, it broadly generalizes entire fields of academic expertise and dismisses many of them as inferior. With scientism, you will regularly hear explanations that rely on words like “merely”, “only”, “simply”, or “nothing more than”. Scientism restricts human inquiry.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In this episode, Bill Nye endorses his view as the right and correct view – it broadly generalizes entire fields of science like climate change, global warming, and alternative medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another troubling aspect of this show is his appeal to our youth. In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley states, “One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The other day, I was teaching a lesson on “critical thinking” with my students. I asked them to write down the last time they actually thought – not regurgitated information, not wrote down notes, not watched tv. They deeply struggled, and one student profoundly exclaimed, “I realize I rarely think!”
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes along with a book we are reading by Ayn Rand called Anthem. In this society, the “ego” and “I” are banned. They are a society of equality, “we", and “trust.” My students have no problem criticizing the thoughtlessness and brainwashing of that society, but I asked them if we are really that different or that far away from a robotic, brainwashed world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am deeply troubled by this television show. I actually feel unsettled after watching it. I would love to hear anymore commentary, thoughts, and discussion as always!

       Edgar Cayce is a great source of information for the open-minded. He himself was a religious man who's views about what was possible had to become permeable. No one can claim to have all of the answers, which is why Bill Nye's routine is so absurd and blatantly propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more than political, it's transhumanist... it's deeply anti-moral in a totally non-religious way. It's a subversion which relates to the normalization of pedophilia and other unspeakable acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rigid thinking like Bill Nye is preaching as religion which keeps the mind in a small box like religion does. I would call what he is doing incredibly fascist. Just like Antifa, the irony is lost on them about what they actually are.

       I had an unpleasant encounter with a random at a restaurant bar the other night but it got me thinking. Obviously Christianity, the quondam religion of civilized western culture, is on its way out. But I do think it was fundamental in unifying us (western culture) for a common goal and purpose even if it did reinforce social stratification to a degree. I don't think we would have achieved all the technological, economic, philosophical, and social progress that we all (especially liberals) hold so dear without it. But now the liberals are trying to phase it out. That much has been obvious to me for years. But I've been wondering what will replace it. Last night I realized what it will be and I felt so foolish because it's been so obvious.
"Science." With quotes. The guy last night was telling me he loved science because it is irrefutable fact and it is peer reviewed so it is undeniably true. I said, "if it is irrefutable fact by virtue of being science, then why must it be peer reviewed? Also why do scientist sometimes disagree?" He said that neither I nor him are qualified to question the findings of scientists. It reminded me of the religious authorities that were political pawns in the past 2 millennia (Christianity) and a couple more millennia (pre-abrahamic) religions that the general populace believed at face value and followed blindly. (Some maybe most) Liberals think they are being the free thinkers when they are really the first to jump aboard the new religion with no basis in fact or practicality. At least religions were practical. The commoners just follow the celebrities.

       It is crazy how people do not understand logical fallacies. False authority and celebrity endorsement are used so much. People honestly believe Leonardo Dicaprio is an authority on science?

       Christianity may seem on its way out, but it will make a revival. TPTB of the New World 0rder are attempting to unite the world under a singular religion, and its not science. Its Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity is the only religion really allowed to be mocked so openly. The effort spent to remove Christ from every corner by TPTB speaks volumes of their fear of Jesus and the power of God &amp; Christianity.

       People question how we managed to get in such bad shape as a people of the most powerful country on Earth. Its actually much more simple than it would appear as the real ingredient required was time.

       Christianity provides a moral, spiritual, and ritualistic platform to build a loving family, a church, a network of friends, and a support group that can be relied on when storms hit us both physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

       In the 60s, divorce became a little easier due to multiple waves of feminism, homosexuality, and adultery. As the 70s and 80s rolled around, divorce had become a booming business and the stigma associated with being divorced had less of an impact.

       Today, we live in a world of insta-sex via online dating sites and a culture of do whatever you want, sin is not illegal and its promoted as a way of life, protecting the actions of those that are defiling their marriages with laws and court-forced financially crippling mandates making marriage so unattractive that men are starting to see that its not worth it.

       Regardless, theres plenty of examples and reasons, but you get the picture.

       Without solid foundations like families, church, and societal networks of like-minded friends, we were able to be divided into so many subgroubs that we cant stand together as a country.

       I dont get it either. If they hate Christianity so much, how can they stand up for Islam, especially when they love to claim that its similar except that it isn't and its brutal to the very minority groups taking up for them.

       I think it is even more sinister.  Albert Pike was a Luciferian and a Mason.  It appears they are raising Islam for WWIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Albert Pikes' Vision of World War III:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the 'agentur' of the 'Illuminati' between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view.
      </p>
      <h1>
       This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.
      </h1>
      <p>
       Basically Satan's plan to attempt to destroy Israel and Christianity; which if God didn't intervene, no one would survive. “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened."
      </p>
      <p>
       They will unify a government and a religion around a satanically-indwelt human known as the Antichrist.  So are they grooming one in the wings now, to make their own prophecy come true? Or is it really prophecy from God; you should deeply ponder this.  Your soul might depend on it.

       I also believe that the antichrist is already in play and soon to be revealed, although scripture mentions that the Antichrist isn't revealed until half way into Tribulations.

       This is the narrative that I'm getting most tired of. That
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       of us are to blame for exacerbated climate change (even the term "climate change" is misleading as the climate has never been stable and has always gone through cycles of change), yet no one is allowed to point out that the majority of people don't have a say in industrial practices and methods. And it is these very industries that are shitting all over the environment in the name of profit. It is industry that builds shoddy products, promotes redundant packaging, pollutes their waste, and butchers the environment for raw materials. And the majority of us have *
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       say in those practices, but according to the narrative we are the ones to blame for the "climate crisis".

       Thank you for taking the time to watch and provide a synopsis for this show. I tried watching it but the canned laughter made me walk away from it. Though it was fairly apparent from the title that there was an agenda being pushed. I will be interested in any other posts you choose to make on this series as I too am curious about the bias being sold in it. Again, thank you for taking the time! :)

       It is so fascinating that everything that is wrong with the world is blamed on the average civilian, yet we have little to no control of nearly any of the problems caused by disgusting and giant corporations.

       Those last two paragraphs are amazing. I wish I was noble enough to redpill the new generation of students, but the job itself looks draining. How do you get around the indoctrination curriculum? Or do you do these snippets of "wake the fuck up and think students!"

       Thank you! I am really lucky that I seriously have a fantastic group of students and parents. I work in hard area, but they are great.

       Honestly I never really try to push my beliefs or anything on them. Luckily I a mainly teach English, and it is not as controversial. This year I am teaching GATE, and the curriculum says they should be questioning things....interesting how dumbed dowm the general ed. Curriculum is.

       I could write another post on some strangeness in the distinction between gifted and regular ed. I was labeled "gifted" when I was a student as well.

       I never tell them my political beliefs, even if they ask. I really, really try to have them form their own opinions.

       My 8th graders this year are definitely conspiracy theorists! One student did a presentation on the mandela effect, and they have brought up mkultra. Maybe I was meant to be their teacher this year...

       I have NEVER brought up those things to them.

       I mention it because many of his lectures cover subjects and concepts that are just not being taught to young people. I think his talk on gooey prickles and prickly goo is definitely one that should be listened to by young people because it makes one consider their own general views and thought processes. This in turn promotes empathy without attaching a moral stance to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see science as no longer even trying to temper itself with philosophy anymore, which seems to exacerbate the idea of science as an authority or institution. English courses seem the best place to introduce philosophy, so I was curious if you were familiar with Watts as I would recommend (hopefully without being too pushy) you introduce your students to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't go the education route (the debt mill just wasn't enticing enough), so I only recently discovered Watts.

       There is a treasure trove of recordings of his lectures on youtube, but I'm not sure exactly which talk I would recommend over another. I think it would depend on the specific curriculum being taught at the time. Let me dig a bit and I'll see if I can't find one that relates to the Nye show. ;)

       Hard to go wrong w Alan Watts; one of my absolute favorite thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are (were?) some apps available for iPhone that collected all of his best lectures but there is a huge collection on YouTube. You can pretty much start anywhere. The one caveat is to avoid Alan WATT who, while interesting at times, is a completely different person w a very different and much more pessimistic worldview. His book "The Book" is also very much worth reading and would be great for gifted students (although I don't know if anyone would balk at his clear spirituality in an educational setting, sad as that fear may be).

       Very strong post. Materialism is a subject that should get more exposure here.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The ideology of scientific materialism became dominant in academia during the 20th century. So dominant that a majority of scientists started to believe that it was based on established empirical evidence, and represented the only rational view of the world. Scientific methods based upon materialistic philosophy have been highly successful in not only increasing our understanding of nature but also in bringing greater control and freedom through advances in technology. However, the nearly absolute dominance of materialism in the academic world has seriously constricted the sciences and hampered the development of the scientific study of mind and spirituality. Faith in this ideology, as an exclusive explanatory framework for reality, has compelled scientists to neglect the subjective dimension of human experience. This has led to a severely distorted and impoverished understanding of ourselves and our place in nature."

       Also, it sounds like you are the kind of teacher that truly makes a difference. I had one or two like you and it totally changed the course of my life to be encouraged to actually think rather than simply parrot information without questioning it.

       Thank You! Great job on breaking down their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been considering doing a similar service about popular television shows. Since Jan 2016, almost every TV Series on air started heavily pushing an agenda far beyond the obvious programming we usually notice and let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like each production house received a subpoena to immediately alter the scripts, sub plots, and casting in order to meet the level of propaganda required for Killary and Obozo to mind fuck every person watching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its only gotten worse since Jan 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       If enough people provide positive feedback about your efforts, I will join the ranks and do the same with some of the primetime shows.

       Whenever Bill Nye presents himself as an authority on climate change I cringe.  It's almost as if he's presented as some kind of expert in order to muddy the waters.  All he talks about is "consensus" but is unable to talk about the actual scientific proof behind global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says the "science is clear" but is then unable to go into details, it's incredibly suspicious that he never talks about the difference between sequestered and unsequestered sources of CO2 or that we can measure our impact through comparisons of carbon isotopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as though he's intentionally trying to obfuscate the issue for people who are unable to to their own research so they can still claim that the issue is so "conflicting" when it absolutely isn't.  His inability to actually demonstrate what he's talking about makes me think that he's actually in the pockets of big oil.

       I actually really enjoyed the first episode, despite feeling talked down to, thinking I just might not be the intended audience. However in the second episode when they continually shut down the alternative medicine advocate I couldn't watch another minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       In science, things should be
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       false, (or as close as possible), before disregarding them entirely. Yes, I'd argue there's a lot of proof that many alternative medicines do not work, but that doesn't mean some methods don't. Considering the length to which they talked about placebos, which are a fairly simple concept, I'm surprised they didn't even listen to anything the guy said. If they're going to shut him down so quickly, at least explain to the audience WHY.

       Yes, good points! I mean there are definitely some entertaining aspects of the show. Also, they could at least have attempted to provide counter arguments, and then dismissed them. That would have made the show seem less biased.
