         This article explores the issues and concludes that sensory dysfunction and systemic failure, manifested as autism, is the inevitable consequence arising from subtle DNA alteration and consequently from the overuse of vaccines.

         In phase I, it was observed that there was a significantly increased risk ratio for the incidence of ASD reported following the Thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccine in comparison to the Thimerosal-free DTaP vaccine. In phase II, it was observed that cases diagnosed with an ASD were significantly more likely than controls to receive increased organic-Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine administered within the first, second, and sixth month of life.

         The increase in exposure to Al adjuvants significantly correlates with the increase in ASD prevalence in the United States observed over the last two decades; and a significant correlation exists between the amounts of Al administered to preschool children and the current prevalence of ASD in seven Western countries, particularly at 3-4 months of age. The application of the Hill's criteria to these data indicates that the correlation between Al in vaccines and ASD may be causal.

         Between 12 and 24 mo of age, these previously normally developing children suffered mercury toxic encephalopathies that manifested with clinical symptoms consistent with regressive ASDs. Evidence for mercury intoxication should be considered in the differential diagnosis as contributing to some regressive ASDs.

         Therefore, autism is the result of genetic defects and/or inflammation of the brain. The inflammation could be caused by a defective placenta, immature blood-brain barrier, the immune response of the mother to infection while pregnant, a premature birth, encephalitis in the child after birth, or a toxic environment.

         A review of medical literature and US government data suggests that: (i) many cases of idiopathic autism are induced by early mercury exposure from thimerosal; (ii) this type of autism represents an unrecognized mercurial syndrome; and (iii) genetic and non-genetic factors establish a predisposition whereby thimerosal's adverse effects occur only in some children.

         Children with ASDs were significantly more likely to have Rh-negative mothers than controls. Each ASD patient's mother was determined to have been administered a TCR during her pregnancy.
The results provide insights into the potential role prenatal mercury exposure may play in some children with ASDs.

         Hair mercury levels in the autistic group were 0.47 ppm versus 3.63 ppm in controls, a significant difference. The mothers in the autistic group had significantly higher levels of mercury exposure through Rho D immunoglobulin injections and amalgam fillings than control mothers. Within the autistic group, hair mercury levels varied significantly across mildly, moderately, and severely autistic children, with mean group levels of 0.79, 0.46, and 0.21 ppm, respectively.

         A careful review of ASD cases discloses a number of events that adhere to an immunoexcitotoxic mechanism. This mechanism explains the link between excessive vaccination, use of aluminum and ethylmercury as vaccine adjuvants, food allergies, gut dysbiosis, and abnormal formation of the developing brain.

       The trick with the whole vaccine thing is that not all syringes are "loaded", therefore you can still get "good" samples that don't check out if somebody would ever claim that the whole formular is causing autism. It's essentially russian roulette for a random chance of mental disease.

       I don't think I'm making the same argument as him, but to shift his point slightly, not all batches of vaccines are created equal. Some batches have more and some have less antigen and chemicals in them. All drugs are made like this, which is why they are stamped with batch numbers on their packaging. If a problem occurs then just the batch can be withdrawn from the shelves.

       There is a claim that one "hot" batch of vaccines was showing a cluster of problems one time and since then the batches were broken apart and spread out among a larger geographic region. This way the low level of damage from these "hot" batches don't rise to the level that they get noticed as much. I wouldn't doubt that the drug companies do this with regular medicines as well.
