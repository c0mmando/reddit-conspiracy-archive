        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We need to look in to the old SLC Daycare Cover up. I attempted to post this to reddit as a text post and keywords were causing the post to error. (all users cited are reddit users, unless otherwise stated)</p>

<p>Years ago, A person on reddit posted about a daycare that they lived nearby, and never once saw anyone coming in or out in the 5 years they lived next to the place. Multiple locals report looking through windows seeing nothing and posted stuff claiming that they had also noticed weird stuff about the building.</p>

<p>Once people started digging things begin to get kind of strange. The original post was deleted but a screencap was apparently grabbed. (Huge image - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.png)PNG">http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.png)PNG</a>)</p>

<p>They have consolidated a lot of the posts regarding the location to bring all of the findings together here... (Now deleted)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2tvah1/slc_creepy_daycare_saga/">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2tvah1/slc_creepy_daycare_saga/</a></p>

<p>4chan also investigated with pictures inside/outside of building</p>

<p><a href="https://4archive.org/board/b/thread/601828704">https://4archive.org/board/b/thread/601828704</a></p>

<p>As the original thread from r/SaltLakeCity has now been nuked most of these comments can only now be seen on the screencap that <a href="/u/nudemanonbike">/u/nudemanonbike</a> saved. It can be seen here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.pngPNG">http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.pngPNG</a></p>

<p>Please don&#39;t harass the owners or advocate harassment as that will get this thread removed.</p>

<p>The first few hours</p>

<p>u/discogodfather6922 (local flair) posts a thread to <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">/r/SaltLakeCity</a> asking &quot;What&#39;s the deal with this place? Lived across the street from it for 5 years, never seen a kid there.&quot;</p>

<p>u/DeformedReality, u/filluppp and u/DigitalGarden all recognize the place and have wondered about it or have thought of it as creepy.</p>

<p>u/Maikudono says, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen anyone there&quot;</p>

<p>u/username_id says, &quot;We live nearby and my kids call it the &#39;scary house&#39;. In the 10 years I have lived in this neighborhood I have never seen anyone come in or out of that place. Totally creepy.&quot;</p>

<p>u/gthing says, &quot;Also live nearby. Noticed some odd looking equipment in the back covered very securely by a camo tarp the other day. It was not haphazardly secured, either. I noticed specifically that it looked like a boy scout had done it or something. I thought it looked odd next to the sad looking playground equipment and was surprised because the place seemed shut down.&quot;</p>

<p>The Warning</p>

<p>u/DeathShip says, &quot;I am going to advise you guys to stop looking into this place&quot;</p>

<p>u/801throwaway (new account) digs through posting history of user DeathShip to find in past posts DeathShip has claimed to be: &quot;Linguist for the air force, been stationed at area 51 and occasionally hangs out in conspiracy subs, questionably discharged.&quot;</p>

<p>u/DeathShip responds that he speaks 8 languages, &quot;Hindi Urdu Punjabi Bengali Nepali Balochi German and English&quot;</p>

<p>The Former Client</p>

<p>u/lumpychick (new account) says that her kids attended from 2001 to 2006/2007 and it was a positive experience. A new owner bought the place in 2006 and &quot;They were horrible, neglectful and borderline abusive&quot;. She also says these new owners were the ones to first paint it the current color.</p>

<p>u/lumpychick follows up with a link to the public complaints against the center. Shows normal complaints up until 2011, nothing since.</p>

<p>u/Effyup finds another site with two newer incidents one in 2013 and one in 2014.</p>

<p>The Upkeep</p>

<p>u/gthing links to streetview and notes that the swamp cooler was running. Image is dated July 2014.</p>

<p>Also note that the paint is faded and graffiti has been painted over. If you compare to the image that started this whole thing the paint new and fresh. This would indicate that the building is being maintained. Also that the banner with the phone number was removed at some point and put back up after the paint job.</p>

<p>The Webiste</p>

<p>u/LessThanDan found their website during the 2014 investigation, but it&#39;s currently down and domain doesn&#39;t resolve anymore.</p>

<p>u/tanasbourne and someone else (can&#39;t find the post) link to similar website for another day care in VA</p>

<p>Someone (can&#39;t find the post, possibly deleted before screencap) looks up whois info on site. Reports that it belongs to a city employee. Within hours whois info is scrubbed.</p>

<p>The Lettercarrier</p>

<p>u/PaulDuane says, &quot;I used to be a letter carrier in that neighborhood. It was full of kids every time I went there. The only strange thing is, no matter what time of day I showed up with their mail, it always seemed to be nap time.&quot;</p>

<p>The Break-in</p>

<p>u/yspeenbean says, &quot;I just talked to my friend who lived right be there for about a year and said one night they jimmied their way in out of curiosity and in the main room was mostly just a chair facing a TV displaying a live video of the other room in the building.&quot; He also adds, &quot;The laundromat across the street constantly has cops there for drug busts.&quot;</p>

<p>A voat comment claims it was busted for trafficking..</p>

<p>All users cited are reddit users unless stated otherwise, just in case you want to look at their profiles. I intentionally didn&#39;t link users, in fear of triggering another mass nuke of the thread. I attempted to do a text post on reddit and it was IMMEDIATELY deleted by bots. I also attempted to do a pastebin to archive, but before I could archive it the pastebin was autoremoved. Automation is covering up this post... This is huge. This may be the big break or connection someone needs. Its 3am sorry for any bad grammar, spelling, ECT ECT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to sum up it looks kind of creepy and nothing else. No one has alleged abuse, there is an allegation from a voat tard it was busted for human trafficking, any evidence of this? Beyond an anonymous person said so? Someone claims, again not a person with a name, that there is room with a chair and tv with closed circuit tv watching children. </p>

<p>How is this not invite to harass the owners? You say pizzagate right in the subject line.  </p>
