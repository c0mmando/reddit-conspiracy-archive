       This has been something I have researched for sometime now. I believe a lot of religious text has some basis in reality and I believe these texts, when taken symbolically becomes a lot clearer and starts to make some sort of sense. Here is what Ive gleaned from my research and why a lot of people in power were destined to be in the position they are. This to me makes sense. It is the only thing I can think of that explains war, famine, the ever present hatred amongst humanity. We've all felt it. The underlying feeling of malevolence and evil throughout the world and is felt more so now than ever. Everyone who has some interest in religion is aware of the attempt by the devil to take power from god. The devil became jealous of gods power and recruited a third of the population of heaven (angels) to usurp god and to have the same level of power as god has. The devil and his army declared war on god and his army and eventually lost. The devil was exiled to hell but what of his army?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not at home right now so I can't state word for word what the bible says about this but it basically says that the devils army was cast down from heaven to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe humanity are the angels cast out of heaven and down to the earth for our part in the devils attempt to take power from god
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to the ever present hatred throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say that if each human being had memory of this then it would defeat the purpose of why we were sent to earth in the first place but I do believe there remains some remnant of memory of what we all did and at some subconscious level we blame each other for the predicament we found ourselves in. I think our memories were wiped so we would have no memory of what occurred but we remember somewhat at a deeper level hence the hatred, wars etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe that during this war, there existed a hierarchy. For example, in an army there would be various levels of command. I think the same happened during the war against gods army. The devils army also had various levels of command. I think the people in power in the world now also had such power before in the war and at a deeper level still feel that yearning for power and to command.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the beginning the bible (Genesis), I believe that this documents the war and exile of angels from heaven to the earth but is describe symbolically. For example - the Apple representative of the knowledge of gods power which the angels and the devil attempted to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the bible saying that no-one is born without sin. Well, this could be literally true as a new born child may contain the soul of an exiled angel who has been sent to earth to the error of his/her ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll expand on this later but it's an interesting premise as it's the only thing that explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I posting this here? Well. The people here may be open enough to consider this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it a conspiracy? It isn't really but it does go some way to explain why some people are pre-destined for power and seem intent on dominance and destruction because deep down they remember their place in the war against god and still desire that power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Ive noticed how defensive and angry people get when the subject of god is even brought up. Doesn't this make you think that deep down, there is a hatred and anger towards god that we were put in this situation?

       There is no "God". You, and any other person on this planet, are required to offer concrete proof (and no, waving the Bible around is not proof) that this "God" exists...a meeting face to face would do nicely. Also, all religions are in existence for two reasons. 1) to control the population 2) to explain complex subjects to dumb people. The "Bible" (and Koran and all other religious book) was written by human beings a few thousand years ago or so. While an interesting read, it is not true. Religion is handy the the Rulers convenience and dangerous for the people.

       I'm not saying religion is correct. I also believe religion is man made but I do believe it has basis in fact and has been used my mankind for its own selfish purposes but take away all that. Seriously...stand back and put aside all thoughts about how humans have warped religion for its own purposes and look at it from a very basic viewpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think religions are wrong and not one religion has ever stated this point of view...not one...

       No, it's not. It is a story book, in part, an astrological diary, in part and a morality guide. "God" has nothing to do with anything other than to give the dumb population something distract them with.

       The burden of proof is on those, like you, who say he does exist. You have to prove he/she is here. I don't need to prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to play "Devil's Advocate" answer a few questions if you will. If "God" did indeed give us the "Ten Commandments", one of which is "Thou shall not kill", then why have
       <em>
        Christians
       </em>
       been
       <em>
        killing
       </em>
       people for the entire time the Bible has been in existence, and therefore breaking their own commandment? Also, if "God" is so powerful and omnipotent then why can't he/she stop all the killing?

       I think God is pretty much letting evil run its course in order to balance out the books between heaven and earth. People who choose to follow this course will see the consequences of their actions (I.e rebellion) and realise that there is never a reason to rebel again.

       The burden of proof doesn't exist with anyone. I only put forward a viewpoint. I have no interest in proving this. People believe different things and it's impossible to prove whether what I said is true or not.

       How do you reconcile your theory with non-western religion? Why do you assume Christianity in your theory? Hinduism in general is older, and particularly vedanta consists of provable theses (thru study and meditation) that  don't exhibit any elements of your theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you could consider 'original sin' as karmic weights but it doesn't really fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is, assuming Christianity as correct is an assumption, and one that requires far more proof, versus the empirical,  experiential religion that promotes unity (where the universe itself is this unity)
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just have problems with the ethnocentrism of your argument, as well as the lack of ability to experience and know the truth that would result

       I'm certainly not saying Christianity is correct. I don't think any religion has it correct. True. Im using Christian terminology but my theory can be applied to any religious beliefs. If you look at my theory, you'll see is doesn't reflect Christian beliefs either.

       But it does. Under the philosophy I linked, there is no separation of matter, only tbe illusion of such. We are all aspects of god, there are no devils, no angels. Only god. So there could be no war, no underlying malevolence, only benevolence misinterpreted and twisted by human beings (which doesnt figure in to your war theory). Given an all-encompassing unity, there could be no battle, no fallen angels, no memory of loss before the original lot of human beings

       Having only just read the Books of Enoch a week or so ago...there's a point where an Angel was punished for 'giving
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       written language' so - if we take Sanskrit as the oldest known written language, did the Hindu then have more power over all written history?

       Interesting post. I'm curious to see what Biblical references you can cite to support this.
