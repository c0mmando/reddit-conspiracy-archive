<p>How best to do that? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Determine all the intellectual groups that comprise the public - this is called vector quantization: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trEDVj9M6Ng">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trEDVj9M6Ng</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>create content in the news and social media that will consume each group (SJWs, alt-right, vaccines, abortion, NWO, NK, MkUltra, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>let them focus on that while you continue to steal all their resources (think Halliburton).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is just a hypothesis, I can&#39;t prove it, but what do you think? From any normal point of view, the rich and powerful have already won -- that&#39;s what being rich and powerful means. They should be just focusing on either maintaining power or expanding it. How would WWIII help with that? It would not. But what would help is getting people like us worried about WWIII instead of being worried about the M3 and M4 money supply.</p>

<p>On this sub it seems we mostly talk about <em>what they are trying to do</em> instead of <em>what they are currently doing</em>.</p>

<p>Edit: This seems like a quality post to me. I&#39;m going to assume the downvotes are part of the corporate brigading unless someone can make a cogent argument as to why this deserves downvotes.</p>

<p>Really? When did he start? Was he like and agent from birth, or did he get recruited after being a Beatle? Is there some substantive change in his behavior and words you can see after he became an agent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak to whether he was MI6/CIA, but am reasonably familiar with the system of doubletalk and symbolism used by the Jesuits, as well as that of the Babylonian order for which they front.  Babylonian franchises such as the Jesuits &#39;stack&#39; their code, so use both sets of code simultaneously.  Beatles lyrics and imagery are rife with the stuff, and the probability of this happening by pure coincidence - let alone the massive hype promoting them within the mainstream media - is pretty unlikely.</p>

<p>Historically, we know that when the Protestant Reformation began punting the Jesuit order out of nearly every nation on the planet, they got into music and theater and crept right back in via troupes of performers.  This enabled them to present as non-Jesuits when spreading their covert organizational codes.  A patient strategy of that and bribery enabled them to propagate in ways that were largely invisible to the general public and most of the Protestants, who didn&#39;t &#39;speak the language&#39;.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t studied Lennon personally.  &#39;Imagine&#39;, just to pick an example mentioned here, is a reference to &#39;Saint&#39; Ignatius Loyola&#39;s &#39;imagination&#39;-based contemplative techniques, wherein practitioners are assigned specific guided meditation exercises (which present still yet more organizing code) and directed to focus on and visualize them intensely, attempting to experience internally the tableau using each of their senses.</p>

<p>To the typical Babylonian occultist, this is of course a directed exercise of Will as part of a magical rite.  As I&#39;d said, these two levels of code &#39;stack&#39; and are used simultaneously as part of a tiered organizational system.  A cryptocracy if you will, in which the comparative neophytes simply lack the means to decode the covert layers of coordinated communication used by their &#39;superiors&#39;.  This appears to have been the original covert meaning of the &#39;Tower of Babel&#39;, in which the elites organized at the higher levels of the tower where they couldn&#39;t be eavesdropped on by the commoners, developed elaborate and subtle agendas to manipulate the peasants, kept proprietary scientific and technological information to themselves and used it to eventually profess a &#39;divine&#39; and &#39;godly&#39; status to a credulous and thoroughly duped public.  Vestiges of this model still persist today, when we refer to superiors as &#39;higher-ups&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read that the Jesuits engineered the Hippie movement - as well as the invention and promotion of some of the major recreational pharmaceuticals which came along with it - as efforts to knock our adherence to foundational American values off-balance, and make the search for spirituality predominantly regarded as a subjective, feelings-and-opinion based approach where once we were predominantly based in Scripture.  Because once you can get religion and spirituality recontextualized as a necessarily subjective thing, you can get a whole cacophony of opinions going and essentially that&#39;s your <em>&#39;divide and conquer&#39;</em>.  You have to break resistance apart into disorganized factions which can be set against each other and manipulated, as a precursor to bring in a different standardized religious value system once everyone&#39;s gotten tired of all the conflict.</p>

<p>There&#39;s evidence that this is what they&#39;re doing with Islam.  Developed in 610 AD as half of the Babylonians&#39; apparent response to the resurgence of legit Christianity in the Middle East, it appears to have been a new Babylonian franchise specifically developed to wipe out and pave over the legit Christians that proliferated in the wake of Jesus and His disciples.  The other half of the response was that the brutal, conquest-oriented, expansionistic Roman Empire with global ambitions decided to repackage itself as Catholicism, even keeping the symbol of the cross they&#39;d used on Jesus and before that as the standard warning kept outside its cities in the thousands as a stern warning to potential dissidents, quietly cautioning them, <em>&#39;This is why you don&#39;t mess with Rome.&#39;</em>  When you want to really disrupt something you undergo a namechange and present as being that thing, so Rome presented as being a Christian church - <strong><em>the only</em></strong> legitimate Christian church, to hear them tell it.  But they&#39;d have had a tough time presenting as an ostensibly Christian church <em>and</em> simultaneously decimating the legit Christians in the Middle East militarily without a heck of a lot of PR blowback, so another franchise was needed.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCmSBfVXEmA">both Catholicism and Islam share the same Babylonian occult symbolism</a> once you pry away their superficially distinct veneers.  Two different franchises of the same thing.</p>

<p>The objective now seems to be to rub its faux-Christian franchise against its Islamic franchise vigorously, with the People in the middle, until the result is uncomfortable enough that the prevalent socially-acceptable thinking is that it&#39;s better to break them both down and adopt a &#39;unified&#39; synthesis religion.  At the moment they&#39;re calling it &#39;Chrislam&#39;.  If that happens, the Protestants whom the Jesuits were established to counter will be in the distinct minority and prevalent Christianity as a concept will have evaporated around them, leaving them in the distinct, unheard and vulnerably rather visible minority.</p>

<p>Incidentally, and while I&#39;d take much of it with healthy skepticism, I just found <a href="https://tabublog.com/2015/12/26/the-manufactured-invention-of-the-beatles-stones-grateful-dead-and-the-birth-of-rock-n-roll-by-the-tavistock-institute-a-jesuit-corporation/">this article</a> which appears to have done some research into the affiliations of the NWO with the Beatles, among others.  When it mentions the CIA, it does help to keep in mind that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH1DpAk1kkA&amp;amp;t=27m8s">both the CIA and the FBI were founded by members of the Vatican&#39;s Knights of Malta</a>, which seems unlikely to have relinquished control of it in the meantime.</p>

&#39;&#39;Lennon&#39;s snubbing had been stuck in Rundgren&#39;s crawl as he went home and began to work out his thoughts on a new song called “Rock and Roll Pussy”.  The song included the lyrics &quot;Get up and see Revolution on TV...will you get your nails dirty or are you only just a rock and roll pussy?&quot;...  A short time later Rundgren was interviewed by Melody Maker magazine and it was revealed that his finger pointing in &quot;Rock and Roll Pussy&quot; was aimed specifically at the phoniness of Lennon&#39;s limousine liberalism.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out Ethereum. A more useful cryptocurrency that enables smart contracts. I don&#39;t know it very well myself, but it&#39;s an interesting proposition. One that would definitely be a problem for TPTB</p>

<p>In essence all the nodes running the network are one big virtual computer. This way you can start providing decentralized services such as escrow and taxi services.</p>

<p>Escrow: you can have some contract that is a computer script. When both sides of the trade are good the &quot;smart contract&quot; will process or when some arbitrage decides it&#39;s fair. Cut out the middle man.</p>

<p>Taxi: when cars are autonomous and know when to get repairs they will be able to be their own entity. This means that the car can be its own taxi and it can do all of its transactions without anyone even knowing it&#39;s a car. It could do it over the internet all with &quot;ether&quot; which is the name of the currency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re about half right (and this IS a quality post, thank you).</p>

<p>They seem to have gained rule over most of the world, that battle seems to have been won, but they haven&#39;t got CONTROL over every element, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re still shooting for. Still a lot of free thinkers. </p>

<p>The person who wrote they want a global citizenry of mental sheep, that&#39;s what they&#39;re shooting for. </p>

<p>I do agree that focusing on what&#39;s been done over what&#39;s being done and what&#39;s going to be done, is a mistake. As one old conspiracist told me, &quot;You&#39;ll never change what&#39;s already been pulled off. But you can stop them from pulling off the next one.&quot; </p>

<p>A lot of them are fucked anyway, I think. Lots of inbreeding, arrogance, bubble-life. The ones at the very top will press on, but I&#39;ve got a feeling many who&#39;ve not made the capstone are going to take a nasty fall. </p>

Turns out that the characters never really change because even when one is murdered or otherwise dies, they didn&#39;t really or it was their twin and turns out that you can actually miss 10yrs of episodes and still be able to pick up the story when you jump back in.
World War III ain&#39;t going to happen they are just keeping us hyped &amp; distracted and in fact since the Easter break after the whole Syria thing, spiced up by a little bit of saver rattling with North Korea as well things have been a little quiet so I guess we should expect some cliffhangers again soon before we all switch off from boredom....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ultimately, isn&#39;t awakening (not political &#39;woke&#39; awakening; but the more intimate awakening when consciousness becomes conscious that it is conscious, rather than believing it is &#39;you&#39;) the goal, despite which intellectual category you find yourself in?</p>

<p>No matter how much we study what&#39;s going on out in the world, we will never find the ultimate truth. That truth lies within and is the answer to everything. I really think it&#39;s time we start spreading awareness about the hidden truth behind what we are (consciousness/awareness/self-aware manifestation of the universe), rather than spending so much energy trying to crack the unsolvable case outside of the self. They seem to have already won that game. </p>

<p>Once we start awakening to the truth within (enlightenment), the world will change miraculously and with ease. But it&#39;s the hardest thing to do because we live in an era in which we cherish the ego, as our entire lives have been founded through the illusory motive of having a self that tells us what to do next. We&#39;re addicted to it. We&#39;re addicted to our thoughts. But it&#39;s time to let go of every fathomable attachment so that the truth can <em>finally</em> set us free.</p>

<p>&#39;Seek ye first the kingdom of God.&#39; Study thyself and recognize that the &#39;you&#39; that you have <em>thought</em> you were since birth is, in fact, not you at all. Find that truth. This should be where we turn our attention, now. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t say everything else is a distraction, since exposing the current corruption could be gateway for &#39;newcomers&#39; and possibly have them entertain new, and other themes, leading to further existential questioning. </p>

<p>However with all this information (and possible disinformation) it seems finding the truth within is quite important in order to see the bigger picture. </p>

<p>What consciousness is might be the root to a lot of what we&#39;re seeing in regard to mind suppression programs, and the implications of what our minds can actually do an accomplish, when not being manipulated emotionally, could be the mother of all conspiracies, imo.</p>
