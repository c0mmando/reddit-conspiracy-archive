Not only because we aren&#39;t allowed to say that the holocaust was fake, but because this whole serie was removed from youtube twice.</p>

While I&#39;m willing to believe that Hitler wasn&#39;t the worst person to exist on this planet, and that the Holocaust wasn&#39;t just jews (my great grandmother had to escape Romania to avoid being sent to a concentration camp and isn&#39;t jewish) to say that millions of people weren&#39;t killed in these camps is just flat out wrong.</p>

<p>Sure, many countries had camps that they sent people to, but only a couple actively exterminated the inhabitants of these camps. </p>

<p>While I don&#39;t agree with it, the Soviets were not a signatory of the Geneva convention on the treatment of prisoners and so neither the Germans or the Soviets had any legal bases for treating the other side &quot;nicely&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a lot of research too. I don&#39;t by any means think Hitler was a great guy but I don&#39;t see him as the evil genocidal maniac he is portrayed as because the truth is always more complicated. It is more than probable that the numbers of deaths (jews and non jews a like) was hugely overestimated as there is no possible way 15-20 million bodies could be cremated in less than two years (not enough crematoriums) Also the allies killed nearly all of the survivors by sending them back to the shambles of their hometowns in the middle of winter with no prospects of food or shelter. If they didn&#39;t die on the train, they died after they were dropped off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a reasonable position! Lol. All I&#39;d say is all the bodies didn&#39;t have to be cremated as its just as easy to dig a big whole and toss the bodies in, but I would agree the number is likely an over estimation</p>

<p>I dunno, this strikes a chord as being something bad: &quot;in a speech to the leaders of German armed forces on August 22, 1939 Hitler ordered: “Kill without pity or mercy all men, women or children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space (Lebensraum) we need. The destruction of Poland is our primary task. The aim is… annihilation of living forces.” &quot;</p>

<p>No, truth is truth. I may see Germans in a more favorable light, because at that time they were less of a threat than the Soviets (who actually tried to genocide us Poles). Ask any Polish person and they will tell you the same thing. </p>

If you were playing Devil&#39;s Advocate you would&#39;ve said so in the first place.  Instead you tried to backtrack and say that you weren&#39;t even German, implying it you didn&#39;t create the thread, now you&#39;re trying to tie together another excuse.</p>

<p>Keep trying, maybe if you keep trying you&#39;ll finally pull together a plausible reason for why you post Hitler victory speeches while saying that you&#39;re proud of what the Germans did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of us don&#39;t question why the Germans targeted jews in WW2. 
In my country they teach that Hitler was refused in an art-school by jews and that&#39;s probably why he wanted to &#39;&#39;destroy&#39;&#39; them. This is like the worst argument you can give, yet everyone believes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch TGSNT and then do your own research. Anyone seriously into this subject matter will devour any material he comes across. I watched TGSNT fairly late into my obsessive researching, and it matched everything I had come to conclude prior. There&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s so long, that&#39;s because it explains many peculiarities and complexities of history that most (especially mainstream) documentaries don&#39;t dare or wouldn&#39;t have the time to cover. This whole chapter of history is tremendously complex and takes time to unravel. </p>
