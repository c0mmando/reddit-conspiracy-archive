       So, I've watched all the episodes of the documentery about the ''true'' story of Hitler, and it really convinced me. 
Not only because we aren't allowed to say that the holocaust was fake, but because this whole serie was removed from youtube twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else watched it? What are your opinions?

       I've watched them.  While I'm willing to believe that Hitler wasn't the worst person to exist on this planet, and that the Holocaust wasn't just jews (my great grandmother had to escape Romania to avoid being sent to a concentration camp and isn't jewish) to say that millions of people weren't killed in these camps is just flat out wrong.

       Everyone had those camps. Most german soldiers were prisoned in SU camps and never released fafter WW2.

      <p>
       There are a lot of theories about how the germans didn't gass people
      </p>

       They have lied about the number of people killed anyways, the number has officially been reduced too.

       There is a huge difference between soldiers and old woman and children and you're comparing Hitler regime to Stalins? C'mon now. That's not helping you make your point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, many countries had camps that they sent people to, but only a couple actively exterminated the inhabitants of these camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't agree with it, the Soviets were not a signatory of the Geneva convention on the treatment of prisoners and so neither the Germans or the Soviets had any legal bases for treating the other side "nicely".

       I've done a lot of research too. I don't by any means think Hitler was a great guy but I don't see him as the evil genocidal maniac he is portrayed as because the truth is always more complicated. It is more than probable that the numbers of deaths (jews and non jews a like) was hugely overestimated as there is no possible way 15-20 million bodies could be cremated in less than two years (not enough crematoriums) Also the allies killed nearly all of the survivors by sending them back to the shambles of their hometowns in the middle of winter with no prospects of food or shelter. If they didn't die on the train, they died after they were dropped off.

       This is a reasonable position! Lol. All I'd say is all the bodies didn't have to be cremated as its just as easy to dig a big whole and toss the bodies in, but I would agree the number is likely an over estimation

       It is true that we have been lied to and misled about WWII, but I'd be careful not to trade one form of propaganda for another. Hitler very well could've been a conduit for the Holy Roman Empire. WWII happened for a reason and consequently so does Israel.

       I dunno, this strikes a chord as being something bad: "in a speech to the leaders of German armed forces on August 22, 1939 Hitler ordered: “Kill without pity or mercy all men, women or children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we obtain the living space (Lebensraum) we need. The destruction of Poland is our primary task. The aim is… annihilation of living forces.” "

       Poles (I am one) we're doing this very thing to Ethnic Germans (I am part one) in that Area. It belong to them prior to WWI. Bad idea, see modern day Iraq.

       No, truth is truth. I may see Germans in a more favorable light, because at that time they were less of a threat than the Soviets (who actually tried to genocide us Poles). Ask any Polish person and they will tell you the same thing.

       So every time you say that you're proud to be German while linking Hitler victory speeches you can just say you were playing Devil's Advocate?  Seems like an easy-cop out.

       Funny how when you were initially called out on it, you cowered away and said "

       Nah, you outright lied after you got called on it, saying "

      </p>
      <p>
       Keep trying, maybe if you keep trying you'll finally pull together a plausible reason for why you post Hitler victory speeches while saying that you're proud of what the Germans did.

       We had a conversation before where the
       <a href="/u/putin_loves_cats">
        /u/putin_loves_cats
       </a>
       denied being German after it was pointed out that they started a thread saying they were proud to be German because the Germans had the balls to do what they did in WWII.  So my information comes from that exchange, which was only a few days ago.

       Most of us don't question why the Germans targeted jews in WW2. 
In my country they teach that Hitler was refused in an art-school by jews and that's probably why he wanted to ''destroy'' them. This is like the worst argument you can give, yet everyone believes it.

       If you can be convinced of something like that simply by watching one video than you are dangerously stupid and not able to think critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you make any attempt to verify anything the video said? Have you looked at counter arguments? If not then you need to wake the fuck up and stop going through life as a sub human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe what you are told by anyone. Confirm and debunk everything. The stuff you can't disprove is the interesting stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should never be convinced by a single video.

       Watch TGSNT and then do your own research. Anyone seriously into this subject matter will devour any material he comes across. I watched TGSNT fairly late into my obsessive researching, and it matched everything I had come to conclude prior. There's a reason why it's so long, that's because it explains many peculiarities and complexities of history that most (especially mainstream) documentaries don't dare or wouldn't have the time to cover. This whole chapter of history is tremendously complex and takes time to unravel.

       Maybe he was Father Crespi, maybe he collected artifacts that were sacred to Christianity, donated them to the Vatican, and became a missionary in Argentina, where the rest of the Nazi's went.
