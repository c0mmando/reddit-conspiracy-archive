       I don't see that name mentioned much here. I watched the documentary a couple nights ago on Netflix and I just recently started looking into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far from what I've looked up it seems the mother and father both were in on it. There's a 99% probability the mother wrote the ransom note.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any documentaries online you would suggest? I'm curious on everyone's thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be something as simple yet twisted that Jon Benet wet the bed and the mom/dad snapped and covered each other's backs? Or is there evidence of something darker?

       I would say your suggestion is a strong possibility but the amount of scar tissue found in jon benets vagina suggests she had been sexually abused multiple times, also when they originally found she had been sodomized with the end of a broomstick, &amp; they also found evidence of prior abuse to her anal cavity as well. She could've easily died because of the bed wetting scenario and that very well could be it, but there is definitive evidence of something darker that was covered up by the parents, police, and federal investigators. We will most likely not ever know the real story....

       Thanks for the info. I never knew about her being sodomized. Do you have any links that support that? I also just saw that John Ramsey had sold his IT business to Lockheed Martin.

       If you go on YouTube, there a few videos that discuss it more in depth, also in addition to the sexual abuse, there is evidence of either systematic torture by burning her with cigarettes or possibly the use of an electronic stun. The neighbors apparently also heard brief screaming from the house the night she would have been killed, screams apparently that her parents didn't hear. You'll see a lot of stories out there contradicting each other, you have to look for consistencies &amp; based the consistency of the autopsy results when you compare different sources of information, there is pretty compelling evidence for sexual abuse/torture.

       Where are you getting this information? Please source it, as there are a lot of issues here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all - anything about being sodomized with a broomstick is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of prior abuse is not agreed upon by doctors. The evidence is that her hymen was not intact and that her orifices were reported as larger than normal during her autopsy, but this happens after death. (I'm sorry this is so creepy and graphic.) These can all be explained by normal things that do not imply sexual abuse, however.

       Believe what you want, I don't come into threads to argue with others, I'm stating what I've found and what I believe to be true. The autopsy report speaks volumes and isn't disputed among people who worked on the case. In addition, doctors can be easily persuaded to say anything if they are given proper compensation, but why would a coroner make up such awful things about a young girl who was tragically killed. &amp; to address the orifice conflict, it wasn't just enlarged, there was evidence of scar tissue as well and penetration of a foreign object in her anus. Again believe whatever you want, but I'm not gonna argue with you. I saw this thread and decided to comment with the conclusions that I have come to. I'm not opposed to changing my opinion given proper evidence to do so.

       Dude, I'm not trying to start an argument, but I don't understand why you would even reply in a discussion about this if you don't want to talk about it? You were incorrect on at least one large part of your claim - the broom handle, to begin with - and I'm not attacking you by saying so.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've "found and what (you) believe to be true" are -
 at least partly -
       <em>
        incorrect
       </em>
       , with absolutely no evidence for what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't about opinion, it's about fact and evidence. If you want to argue there is potentially evidence that supports the idea of sexual abuse, that's one thing, but to start with a just bullshit claim and then get angry and defensive when someone asks you to source is another thing.

       No ones angry here, maybe you are idk, but it's a discussions thread, I came &amp; stated what I thought to be true &amp; the information I've come across that I believe and I also stated I'm open to be proved wrong. Where's your evidence to support your claims? Why don't you go argue on another thread? I see your comment history shows that you have taken a strong interest with arguing with people who believe pizzagate to be true, I'm not looking to sit here &amp; be a keyboard warrior, I simply stated what I found &amp; what my opinion was. I already provided 1 link supporting my opinion, I don't have the time to go through &amp; find the exact piece of info to support my claims, it's out there &amp; if you have done any research on the subject yourself, you wouldn't be so adamant on painting me as a dishonest individual. I don't have time to argue semantics with you over this, move along shill.

       I'm a shill because I want to talk about facts? Idgi. You're truly living in a post-fact society if you think your opinion is as important as actual true, sourceable facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find a link that says your broomstick thing is fake because there's no way I can prove a random negative. I also can't find a link that disproves that JonBenet's great-aunt was a vampire hunter, but that doesn't mean it's true, it means
       <em>
        why would there be a link about such a random untrue fact
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly not into arguing and I'm not angry, just kind of baffled, so I'm done. But until you can point out a link about the broomstick thing, I'd certainly suggest to others to take all your claims with a huge amount of salt.

       There were issues with toilet habits for both JonBenet and her brother. That could be signs of sexual abuse, but could also be signs of acting out for other reasons or merely a form of laziness (as her mother and the maid apparently believed). Either way, I think it's clear that not everything was right in that family (although having a mother being deathly ill could also be the cause of some of the issues).
      </p>
      <p>
       James Kolar, former lead investigator on the case and author of "Foreign Faction", discusses how Burke, JonBenet's older brother, also reportedly "played" with his feces, including placing some in a chocolate container of JonBenet's. This points to a really deep mental health issue (be it longterm or in reaction to something going on).

       I don't think Patsy was in on it, but John was, and I think the death was an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that she was torchered, raped and accidentally killed at the Fleet White Christmas party. Several witnesses at the Ramsey party have said that JonBenet was really excited about getting to see another Santa Claus at a different party later that night. I think that is where she was killed. The Ramseys said they carried her in from the car after that party because she was sleeping. I think she was dead then, and John and Fleet placed her in the basement.

       I think you hit the nail on the head. Her sick parents pimped her out. Other sexual abuse cases have surfaced that detail lifelong ritual abuse. Not everyone survives it. People, the public, simply dont have an adequate frame of reference from which to draw accurate conclusions. If we stitch together the pieces, we can draw a connection between the sex rituals people like Angelina Jolie admittedly participated in and the existence of similar collectives all over the world. Is it really an impossible jump to add child abuse to the depravity of these sadistic people; People who hedge one another in safety with money and power to protect their secrecy? The little girl was found dead in her parents basement... while they were home... in the middle of the night... and her parents were exonerated by law enforcement... Uh, complicity much?

       I do think Patsy was just stupid and naive, though. I truly think that she thought parading JonBenet around like that was just innocent and cute. She didn't know about the deal her husband John (of Lockheed Martin) had made with Fleet White (of  Fleet Oil) had made for JonBenet as entertainment at the White's private Chistmas party.

       Ok but thats incredibly short sighted considering the presence of anal and vaginal scarring. In addition, you dont just whore a child out at a party where they will experience asphyxiation and rough sex. Thats grooming and that my friend is a lifestyle. Her parents were involved.

       Completely drugged up, eh? Are you a doctor? A psychiatrist, perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       MANY symptoms of "drug" use/abuse and even addiction are identical to the symptoms of many mental health disorders; it is almost impossible to accurately recognize the differences between the 2, ESPECIALLY using only a few impersonal moments from (likely heavily edited) TV interviews as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not Patty was involved in her daughters' death(FTR, I believe she was) she would be experiencing a massive amount of stress which can trigger said symptoms in even the most seemingly stable folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I love about these type of comments is that they tend to come from people with little to no experience with drugs, beyond what they read in the newspaper or see on CNN(that is, a bunch of BS propaganda).

       The key that she wasn't killed at home is the pineapple that was found in her stomach. There wasn't and hadn't been any pineapple at the house. Also, the sudden huge rift between the Ramsey's and the White's and Fleets extremely defensive actions with the press. I think he was afraid that Patsy was going to flip so he purposely alienated and distanced John.

       There was a bowl of pineapple and milk (which sounds disgusting but was apparently JonBenet's favorite snack) found on the kitchen table.

       I recently read Dave McGowan's chapter ("Boulder") on the JonBenet Ramsey case. Definitely agree with you that it's the best treatment of the case I've found so far. While I believe the evidence points convincingly to the Ramseys being involved, none of the theorized motives (especially the ones about Burke killing her) for the family have made much sense to me. For it to fit, I feel like there had to have been others (quite likely a ring of elite pedophiles) involved.

       Dave McGowan was a genius, the greatest investigative journalist of the past 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       JonBenet Ramsey was almost certainly killed by a wealthy and perverse pedophile cult. Her parents were part of it. You could tell as she came unglued and the way the feds shut down the locals, this was some high level coverup shit.

       Great post in general OP, to get all of these links posted!  And I 110% agree about the Netflix doc. I was really really disappointed by it. I learned some new / interesting things but the majority was just the actors giving their opinions and life stories... very little re-enactment.

       I'm really interested in unsolved crimes and this one is a famous one, obviously. I've read a lot about the crime and the only thing that makes sense to me is that her brother did it. I don't know why else her parents would behave the way they did, plus it's the only way the evidence all makes sense.
      </p>

       It's also the view of the detective who was in charge of the case for several years.

       You have read up on this and your conclusion is the brother did it? That seems off to me....If he did it why wouldn't the parents of just admitted it instead of going through all the bullshit?

       To me it seems like the only thing that makes sense. One of Mr. Ramsey's older children (from another woman) had just been killed not long before. Now suddenly he and Mrs. Ramsey were faced with another child taken from them, this time his youngest. I can believe they did everything they could to protect their son, who was only little himself and surely did not mean to kill his sister, no matter what happened that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was one of the parents, I think they would have turned on each other at some point. But I can see them pulling together and doing all they could to protect their (now) youngest, Mrs. Ramsey's only child left.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also explains a lot of the weirder things about the case and the investigation, including Burke (the brother)'s voice being heard on the 911 tape, despite the Ramsey's claiming he was in bed asleep at that time, the way the Ramseys acted regarding their son during the investigation, and it explains the conclusion the grand jury came to, which was to file charges against both Ramsey parents not for murdering their child, but for failing to protect her and allowing her to be in a situation where she could be killed AND for helping cover up the crime.

       i've recently learned that a lot of child abuse is done by parents pimping their kids out for promotions and shit like that. And it's a common place phenomenon in positions that pay 6 or more figures  because the pedos deliver on their promises to the parents.

       You're so fixated on the broomstick that you forgot that you're arguing semantics at this point, it doesn't matter if it's a broomstick or even a toothbrush, you're blatantly dismissing the fact that her orifices showed sign of sexual abuse. This will be the last time I comment because I truely have no desire to argue semantics with someone. One piece of info that I had seen mentioned a broomstick, like I said I could be wrong. Prove me wrong &amp; just quit telling me I am. I haven't seen you post a single link. Good day to you.

       Father and mother are sociopaths. You can see it in their dead eyes. Their son raped and killed his little sister, who was being pain-conditioned like an animal in a circus to compete in tiny tot beauty pagents. The parents, who had also been abusing the poor kid, covered up their son's crime.

       My theory: there was some kind of accident caused by her brother (hit too hard in the wrong place) so Patsy wrote the note etc to cover it up.

       Completely drugged up, eh? Are you a doctor? A psychiatrist, perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       MANY symptoms of "drug" use/abuse and even addiction are identical to the symptoms of many mental health disorders; it is almost impossible to accurately recognize the differences between the 2, ESPECIALLY using only a few impersonal moments from (likely heavily edited) TV interviews as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not Patty was involved in her daughters' death(FTR, I believe she was) she would be experiencing a massive amount of stress which can trigger said symptoms in even the most seemingly stable folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I love about these type of comments is that they tend to come from people with little to no experience with drugs, beyond what they read in the newspaper or see on CNN(that is, a bunch of BS propaganda).
