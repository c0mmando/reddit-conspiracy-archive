<p>So far from what I&#39;ve looked up it seems the mother and father both were in on it. There&#39;s a 99% probability the mother wrote the ransom note. </p>

<p>Is there any documentaries online you would suggest? I&#39;m curious on everyone&#39;s thoughts on this. </p>

<p>Could it be something as simple yet twisted that Jon Benet wet the bed and the mom/dad snapped and covered each other&#39;s backs? Or is there evidence of something darker? </p>

The neighbors apparently also heard brief screaming from the house the night she would have been killed, screams apparently that her parents didn&#39;t hear. You&#39;ll see a lot of stories out there contradicting each other, you have to look for consistencies &amp; based the consistency of the autopsy results when you compare different sources of information, there is pretty compelling evidence for sexual abuse/torture. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Where are you getting this information? Please source it, as there are a lot of issues here.</p>

<p>First of all - anything about being sodomized with a broomstick is wrong. </p>

<p>The question of prior abuse is not agreed upon by doctors. The evidence is that her hymen was not intact and that her orifices were reported as larger than normal during her autopsy, but this happens after death. (I&#39;m sorry this is so creepy and graphic.) These can all be explained by normal things that do not imply sexual abuse, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe what you want, I don&#39;t come into threads to argue with others, I&#39;m stating what I&#39;ve found and what I believe to be true. The autopsy report speaks volumes and isn&#39;t disputed among people who worked on the case. In addition, doctors can be easily persuaded to say anything if they are given proper compensation, but why would a coroner make up such awful things about a young girl who was tragically killed. &amp; to address the orifice conflict, it wasn&#39;t just enlarged, there was evidence of scar tissue as well and penetration of a foreign object in her anus. Again believe whatever you want, but I&#39;m not gonna argue with you. I saw this thread and decided to comment with the conclusions that I have come to. I&#39;m not opposed to changing my opinion given proper evidence to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m not trying to start an argument, but I don&#39;t understand why you would even reply in a discussion about this if you don&#39;t want to talk about it? You were incorrect on at least one large part of your claim - the broom handle, to begin with - and I&#39;m not attacking you by saying so.</p>

<p>What you&#39;ve &quot;found and what (you) believe to be true&quot; are -
 at least partly - <em>incorrect</em>, with absolutely no evidence for what you&#39;re saying. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about opinion, it&#39;s about fact and evidence. If you want to argue there is potentially evidence that supports the idea of sexual abuse, that&#39;s one thing, but to start with a just bullshit claim and then get angry and defensive when someone asks you to source is another thing.</p>

I already provided 1 link supporting my opinion, I don&#39;t have the time to go through &amp; find the exact piece of info to support my claims, it&#39;s out there &amp; if you have done any research on the subject yourself, you wouldn&#39;t be so adamant on painting me as a dishonest individual.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a shill because I want to talk about facts? Idgi. You&#39;re truly living in a post-fact society if you think your opinion is as important as actual true, sourceable facts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find a link that says your broomstick thing is fake because there&#39;s no way I can prove a random negative. I also can&#39;t find a link that disproves that JonBenet&#39;s great-aunt was a vampire hunter, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, it means <em>why would there be a link about such a random untrue fact</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not into arguing and I&#39;m not angry, just kind of baffled, so I&#39;m done. But until you can point out a link about the broomstick thing, I&#39;d certainly suggest to others to take all your claims with a huge amount of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were issues with toilet habits for both JonBenet and her brother. That could be signs of sexual abuse, but could also be signs of acting out for other reasons or merely a form of laziness (as her mother and the maid apparently believed). Either way, I think it&#39;s clear that not everything was right in that family (although having a mother being deathly ill could also be the cause of some of the issues).</p>

<p>James Kolar, former lead investigator on the case and author of &quot;Foreign Faction&quot;, discusses how Burke, JonBenet&#39;s older brother, also reportedly &quot;played&quot; with his feces, including placing some in a chocolate container of JonBenet&#39;s. This points to a really deep mental health issue (be it longterm or in reaction to something going on).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Patsy was in on it, but John was, and I think the death was an accident.</p>

<p>I believe that she was torchered, raped and accidentally killed at the Fleet White Christmas party. Several witnesses at the Ramsey party have said that JonBenet was really excited about getting to see another Santa Claus at a different party later that night. I think that is where she was killed. The Ramseys said they carried her in from the car after that party because she was sleeping. I think she was dead then, and John and Fleet placed her in the basement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you hit the nail on the head. Her sick parents pimped her out. Other sexual abuse cases have surfaced that detail lifelong ritual abuse. Not everyone survives it. People, the public, simply dont have an adequate frame of reference from which to draw accurate conclusions. If we stitch together the pieces, we can draw a connection between the sex rituals people like Angelina Jolie admittedly participated in and the existence of similar collectives all over the world. Is it really an impossible jump to add child abuse to the depravity of these sadistic people; People who hedge one another in safety with money and power to protect their secrecy? The little girl was found dead in her parents basement... while they were home... in the middle of the night... and her parents were exonerated by law enforcement... Uh, complicity much?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely drugged up, eh? Are you a doctor? A psychiatrist, perhaps? </p>

<p>MANY symptoms of &quot;drug&quot; use/abuse and even addiction are identical to the symptoms of many mental health disorders; it is almost impossible to accurately recognize the differences between the 2, ESPECIALLY using only a few impersonal moments from (likely heavily edited) TV interviews as evidence. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not Patty was involved in her daughters&#39; death(FTR, I believe she was) she would be experiencing a massive amount of stress which can trigger said symptoms in even the most seemingly stable folks. </p>

<p>There was a bowl of pineapple and milk (which sounds disgusting but was apparently JonBenet&#39;s favorite snack) found on the kitchen table. </p>

<p>I realize Bustle isn&#39;t a particularly impressive source, but this article has some more quick details about the pineapple stuff: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/181956-why-is-pineapple-important-to-the-jonbenet-ramsey-case-it-comes-up-often">https://www.bustle.com/articles/181956-why-is-pineapple-important-to-the-jonbenet-ramsey-case-it-comes-up-often</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently read Dave McGowan&#39;s chapter (&quot;Boulder&quot;) on the JonBenet Ramsey case. Definitely agree with you that it&#39;s the best treatment of the case I&#39;ve found so far. While I believe the evidence points convincingly to the Ramseys being involved, none of the theorized motives (especially the ones about Burke killing her) for the family have made much sense to me. For it to fit, I feel like there had to have been others (quite likely a ring of elite pedophiles) involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave McGowan was a genius, the greatest investigative journalist of the past 20 years. </p>

<p>JonBenet Ramsey was almost certainly killed by a wealthy and perverse pedophile cult. Her parents were part of it. You could tell as she came unglued and the way the feds shut down the locals, this was some high level coverup shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me it seems like the only thing that makes sense. One of Mr. Ramsey&#39;s older children (from another woman) had just been killed not long before. Now suddenly he and Mrs. Ramsey were faced with another child taken from them, this time his youngest. I can believe they did everything they could to protect their son, who was only little himself and surely did not mean to kill his sister, no matter what happened that night.</p>

<p>If it was one of the parents, I think they would have turned on each other at some point. But I can see them pulling together and doing all they could to protect their (now) youngest, Mrs. Ramsey&#39;s only child left.</p>

<p>It also explains a lot of the weirder things about the case and the investigation, including Burke (the brother)&#39;s voice being heard on the 911 tape, despite the Ramsey&#39;s claiming he was in bed asleep at that time, the way the Ramseys acted regarding their son during the investigation, and it explains the conclusion the grand jury came to, which was to file charges against both Ramsey parents not for murdering their child, but for failing to protect her and allowing her to be in a situation where she could be killed AND for helping cover up the crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Father and mother are sociopaths. You can see it in their dead eyes. Their son raped and killed his little sister, who was being pain-conditioned like an animal in a circus to compete in tiny tot beauty pagents. The parents, who had also been abusing the poor kid, covered up their son&#39;s crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely drugged up, eh? Are you a doctor? A psychiatrist, perhaps? </p>

<p>MANY symptoms of &quot;drug&quot; use/abuse and even addiction are identical to the symptoms of many mental health disorders; it is almost impossible to accurately recognize the differences between the 2, ESPECIALLY using only a few impersonal moments from (likely heavily edited) TV interviews as evidence. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not Patty was involved in her daughters&#39; death(FTR, I believe she was) she would be experiencing a massive amount of stress which can trigger said symptoms in even the most seemingly stable folks. </p>

<p>What I love about these type of comments is that they tend to come from people with little to no experience with drugs, beyond what they read in the newspaper or see on CNN(that is, a bunch of BS propaganda). </p>
