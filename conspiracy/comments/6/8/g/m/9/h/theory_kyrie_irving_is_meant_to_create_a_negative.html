<p>That absolutely does not prove a globe.  This is exactly the optical perspective that would happen on a flat plane.  If anything <a href="https://youtu.be/l3FX1YjyRnY">it proves a flat plane</a> and not a globe, there is no indication of any curvature in the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, so someone took the exact same video and relabeled it. While there is a point to be made about not trusting what someone else creates, I actually own a drone and can replicate this experiment for myself.</p>

<p>OK, so lets talk about the moon. The flat earth model says that the moon is small and not very far away. If this is correct, then we should be able to use a laser range finder to bounce off the moon when it&#39;s directly overhead to see that it&#39;s only a few dozen miles away.</p>

<p>Like I said before, the experiment results are to be expected on a flat plane.  As you go higher you should be able to see the sun again from that vantage point,  that is the law of perspective.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes the moon is smaller and closer than is commonly accepted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are assuming that the moon is a solid terraforming body like earth.  There is evidence that it is actually a translucent body (stars have been seen through the dark side of the moon) and it seems to give off its own light (not reflected sunlight).  I&#39;m not sure where you came up with &quot;a few dozen miles&quot; as I&#39;m not positive how far away it is, but it is defiantly not 240,000 miles away. </p>

<p>I can give you more info if you are interested.  Do you also think that NASA landed on the moon?  How deep does you trust go for NASA?  I&#39;m genuinely curious since you seem to be open to other conspiracies that also have truth to them.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see it equally from both points, then something is altering or blocking the light. It has nothing to do with perspective. Perspective could make it appear to be moving downward, but not be completely blocked from view.</p>

<p>Just as easily tested. Shine a laser on it and see what happens.</p>

<p>Since I&#39;m an anarchist, I believe that the government actively lies to us about most things. So I believe that we have the technology to goto the moon, but that we can&#39;t make it through the radiation belts. Next year when Elon Musk goes to the moon, we&#39;ll know the answer right away. If he cancels the last minute, then we&#39;ll know it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>If the moon is so close to us as you believe, then what is stopping amateur rocketeers from traveling there? </p>

<p>Again, so you will admit that NASA lied about the &quot;biggest accomplishment in human history&quot; But you trust their images (that they supposedly took during their trip to the moon and from the moon) to be your reality??  Are you starting to so the contradiction? </p>

<p>Omg.. Elon Musk is no different than NASA.  Space X is just as fake as NASA.  Do you really believe those rocket landings that just look like footage that  is being played in reverse?  Also the camera footage always seems to cut out right at the landing time, lol  Space x..  </p>

<p>How close do I believe the moon is, did I make a claim?  It is not so close that it can be reached by amateur rockets.  Remember billionaire Richard Branson said that he would have low earth orbit public space travel over 10 years ago but he has failed, he can&#39;t do it even with billions at his disposal.  </p>

<p>NASA and the idea of space as we were taught in school is a hoax.</p>

<p>While I think it was possible to cover up the Manhattan project and the moon landings in the 40s and 60s, I don&#39;t think it is possible quite in the same way today. Kids today have grown up believing the lies, so as engineers in these programs today, I don&#39;t think they will sit still to learn that everything they believed was a lie. When people wake up, they don&#39;t capitulate to the status quo hardly ever.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t either though. There have been people that have tested the distance to the moon (not just NASA either). They could be lying, but the burden of proof is on you to prove this.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t get taken to a back room and told everything is a lie.  Most of the people at NASA are probably completely ignorant to the facts.  You must not understand how the military works and compartmentalization works.  Everyone just does there specific task and the left hand doesn&#39;t know what the right hand is doing.  Not that many people would even need to be in on it, only a few at the top. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sun has been measured using sextants and theodolites to be approx 32 miles wide and about 3000 miles away.  Notice the <a href="https://youtu.be/pnzUgKZ8m2k?t=3m25s">hot spot directly under the sun</a> this would not be possible if the sun was really 93 million miles away.  I can zoom in to the moon extremely close with my Nikon P900 camera.  To me it does not appear to be 258,000 miles away.  Do you really think that the sun is 93 million miles away and the moon is 250,000 miles and they just both happen to appear the exact same size in the sky?  What a crazy coincidence. </p>

<p>It reflects sunlight, which is what creates moonlight. I know you said that it is translucent and creates it&#39;s own light, but I have never heard this claimed before, let alone seen any evidence to even suggest this. To even suggest this would require an explanation for everything less than a full moon. So while I don&#39;t mind entertaining the idea, I feel like this is some sort of joke you&#39;re playing here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you talking about the claim that there is a reflective device on the moon left by the Apollo astroNOTS?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two things here. First, the moons&#39;s surface is reflective on it&#39;s own and second, while I don&#39;t think man has landed on the moon, robotic moon rovers have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the burden be on me? I say it is not possible and you have shown no evidence to the contrary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way that the burden of proof typically works is that the person trying to convince the other has the burden. Since you&#39;re trying to convince me, then you have the burden. If you don&#39;t want to convince me, then I suppose we&#39;re done.</p>

<p>Do you really think that the sun is 93 million miles away and the moon is 250,000 miles and they just both happen to appear the exact same size in the sky? What a crazy coincidence.</p>

<p>The fact is that they are the same size, whether the earth is a globe or flat. So it&#39;s just as much a coincidence that they&#39;re the same size in your flat earth....so that would mean that the flat earth is a hoax. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convince you of anything.  You are the one that made the claims.  Your first claim was flat earth is false.  Your other claim was it is possible to reflect a laser off of the moon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is fine, as you provided no evidence for your claim.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What do they have to gain by becoming a whistleblower and who would believe them?  Nobody is going to rock the boat and ruin their career whistleblowing about something that nobody will believe them about.  There are people that actually claim to be NASA whistleblowers but I have no way to prove if they are real so I don&#39;t bring them up.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Who said that they had control of everything so perfectly?  It is over the top obvious if you actually study the video of the ISS astroNots &quot;up in space&quot;.  There are tons of green screen fails and wire harness fails.  They are far from perfect but most people don&#39;t even pay attention to it, they just assume it is all real.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No it is not the same.  In the current heliocentric model everything just exploded from nothingness and the earth, sun , moon etc were all just a random coincidental accident placed in perfect positioning.  In the flat earth model we are the center and the sun moon stars revolve around us.  The sun and the moon or about the same size (as they appear) and there was obviously an intelligent creator that set our system up, not just random amazing accident like the current model suggests. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact is that they are the same size</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m saying they are roughly the same size.  The current heliocentric model says that the sun is actually over a million times bigger than the earth and millions of miles away so it only APPEARS to be the same size as the moon.  That is the crazy coincidence.  The current model says they ARE NOT the same size and it is only an illusion.  I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not an illusion, they are smaller and closer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so that would mean that the flat earth is a hoax. </p>

<p>Your logic is not making sense.  Why even chime in on the flat earth topic if you have never even researched it?    </p>

<p>Because they aren&#39;t a technological miracle. Heck we even have self-driving cars today. So robotic technology is easily within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>If you agree that robots are possible, but just don&#39;t believe they can be delivered to the moon (even a 3000 mile away moon), then I think that&#39;s a different argument. Here you&#39;d be suggesting that rocketry is impossible. If rocektry is impossible, then so are jet engines. However since I have slown in a jet airplane, then I know that jet engines and therefore rocketry is possible.</p>

<p>Well I have no interest in convincing you of anything. So this discussion is moot.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Edward Snowden did. So whistleblowers do in fact exist.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That video you&#39;re referring to was from NASA, so why do you trust that they didn&#39;t introduce the flaws that you mention? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your logic is not making sense. Why even chime in on the flat earth topic if you have never even researched it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve researched it enough to formulate the two points I gave you above (drone and laser tests). </p>

<p>You realize that god could just as easily create a round earth as flat earth. He is all powerful, meaning that it&#39;s within his power to do anything.</p>

<p>Are you a young earth creationist as well? Follow the KJV bible?</p>
