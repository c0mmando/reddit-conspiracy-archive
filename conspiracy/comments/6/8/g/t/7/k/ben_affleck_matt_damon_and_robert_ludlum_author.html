        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></p>

<p>Ben Affleck sells himself as a middle-class guy from Boston who was raised by a single mother. As it turns out, he descends from an aristocratic line and has serious connections to the intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>A PBS series called <em>Finding Your Roots</em> looked into Affleck’s genealogy. Affleck forced the producers of this show to edit out a relative of his who owned slaves. When the public found out, a major scandal ensued and PBS was forced to suspend the series. </p>

<p>I don’t really care whether or not Affleck’s distant ancestor owned slaves when doing so was legal. I care about this scandal because it suggests that Affleck is willing to cover up his family’s past. And as we’ll see, he has a lot to hide.</p>

<p><em>Finding Your Roots</em> barely mentioned Affleck’s grandmother <strong>Elizabeth Roberts Shaw</strong>. I find this incredibly odd, since Shaw is a compelling figure. Elizabeth Roberts was born in 1921 to prominent parents in New York City. She was one of a just a handful of women who attended college prior to World War II, enrolling at Smith College. </p>

<p>While at Smith, Roberts married a man from Dartmouth named <strong>O’Brien Boldt</strong>. Boldt’s best man at the wedding was a fellow Dartmouth student named <strong>Tom Braden.</strong> Tom Braden worked for the OSS (forerunner of the CIA) during World War II, and then headed the CIA’s International Organization’s Division during the 1950s. Braden became one of the most famous and impactful intelligence operatives in American history. I won’t have time to get into every thing he did here, but know that he was a senior agent in charge of the CIA’s cultural warfare project.  </p>

<p>Years later, Affleck’s grandmother mentioned in an interview how her good friend Tom Braden got her a job at the Museum of Modern Art. Affleck’s grandmother recalls: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We [Roberts and her fiancée] had a close group of friends, one of whom subsequently hired me for The Museum of Modern Art: Tom Braden, who was best man at our secret wedding and who I think was responsible for telling people and breaking the secret some years later. After he got out of the OSS, he went to work for Nelson [Rockefeller], and then Nelson put him in the Museum as secretary. (1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow! So it’s pretty clear the Museum of Modern Art was functioning as a CIA front in the post-World War II years. This fact is actually mentioned in Frances Stonor Saunders’ famous treatise The Cultural Cold War. The book describes how the CIA used hundreds of organizations as fronts for “cultural warfare” against the Soviets and leftists. Wikipedia quotes a reviewer of the book, who says it: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shows men like CIA employee Tom Braden, who headed the [cultural warfare] program, to have been unsung heroes of the Cold War, as well as masters of art in both cultural warfare and cultural appreciation. (2) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To summarize: the best man at Affleck’s grandmother’s wedding worked in the OSS and went on to run the CIA’s cultural warfare department. This guy – Tom Braden – specialized in using art, film, and so forth to spread propaganda, and he even worked alongside Affleck’s grandmother for a time. </p>

<p>Now let’s move onto Affleck’s mother, who was born to the aforementioned Elizabeth Roberts and William Boldt in New York City. Her name is <strong>Chris Ann Boldt,</strong> and she is the lady who raised Ben and Casey in Cambridge, MA. Chris was apparently a public school teacher who had to raise the kids alone, since Affleck’s father was an alcoholic who left the family early on. </p>

<p>Let’s do a little more research. Wikipedia mentions that Chris went to Harvard. If you google “Chris Ann Bolt Harvard,” the second hit is from a memoir called A Liberal Education by Abbot Gleason. This book (in part) describes how Ben Affleck’s mother was one of four Harvard undergraduates recruited in 1964 to teach summer courses at Tougaloo College in Mississippi. This was during a time of racial strife, so the Harvard students were supposed to be bridging the gap between black and white, rich and poor and so forth. </p>

<p>I bring this up because Ben’s mother was recruited by the memoir’s author – Abbott Gleason. A little research reveals that Abbott is the son of <strong>S. Everett Gleason,</strong> another top spook. Here’s Wikipedia’s write up on Gleason:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>From 1942 to 1946, he was Intelligence Chief for the Office of Strategic Services. He was Deputy Executive Secretary of the National Security Council, and on the Solarium Committee. He wrote, with William Langer, The Challenge to Isolation, for the Council of Foreign Relations. (3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again – wow. These connections go to the very top. And in both instances they have substantial connections to Affleck’s mother and grandmother. </p>

<p>You might say: “But Affleck’s mother was recruited by Abbot Gleason, not his father. Why does this matter?” Note that <strong>S. Everett Gleason</strong> worked for the OSS at the same exact time as <strong>Tom Braden.</strong> It’s likely Affleck’s grandmother knew Everett Gleason as well, and that’s why her daughter and his son ended up meeting and working together at Harvard. At any rate, Affleck’s proximity to these major intelligence figures raises red flags in every direction. </p>

<p>Now on to Ben Affleck himself. Prior to the release of <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, we are told that Affleck was a struggling actor. He did have parts in <em>Dazed and Confused</em> (1993), <em>Glory Daze</em> (1995), and <em>Chasing Amy</em> (1997), but he was nowhere near being a star. His buddy Matt Damon had even less acting experience at this point. Prior to <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, Damon’s only real roles were in <em>School Ties</em> (1992), a flop called <em>Geronimo: An American Legend</em> (1993), and <em>The Rainmaker</em> (1997), which released two months before <em>Good Will Hunting</em> and didn’t make much money. </p>

<p>We are told <em>Good Will Hunting</em> was a surprise hit that took awhile to catch on with audiences. So, isn’t it a little odd that these two no-name actors were invited to watch the premiere of the film with <strong>the freaking president!</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck#/media/File:CampDavid.jpg">This photo</a> is from January 11, 1998, which is the same day <em>Good Will Hunting</em> released to the general public. It was taken at Camp David, which is the President’s retreat center, but also a military base. </p>

<p>To be clear: at the time of this photo, <em>Good Will Hunting</em> was not a hit yet (since it had just released earlier in the day). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were not famous yet, and were supposedly struggling to get by in LA. And yet, we’re supposed to believe that Bill Clinton was so excited about this film, that he sought out Matt and Ben and invited them to Camp David so they could all watch it together. That’s just ridiculous.   </p>

<p>It’s also interesting to note that Damon’s character in <em>Good Will Hunting</em> is being recruited by the NSA. </p>

<p>Once Affleck’s film career got going, he stopped trying to hide his intelligence connections. In 2002 he starred in <em>The Sum of All Fears</em> and played – of course – a CIA analyst. During production of this film, <em>The Guardian</em> reports: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The agency was happy to bring its makers to Langley for a personal tour of headquarters, and to offer [Affleck] access to agency analysts. When filming began, [CIA liaison] Brandon was on set to advise. (4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you read that right. The CIA literally had an agent advising Affleck and others as they filmed <em>The Sum of All Fears</em>. The position is now called the “Entertainment Industry Liaison” and works as a permanent link between Hollywood and the CIA. </p>

<p>But wait – it gets better. <em>The Guardian</em> reports this same CIA liaison was often on the set of the television series <em>Alias</em>. The star of <em>Alias</em> is Jennifer Garner, who at the time was married to Ben Affleck. Garner’s character in the show is “Sydney Bristow, a double-agent for the Central Intelligence Agency posing as an operative for SD-6, a worldwide criminal and espionage organization.” (5) Of course.   </p>

<p>In 2004 Garner even filmed a recruitment video for the CIA. In their press release, the CIA also bordered on taking credit for crafting Garner’s <em>Alias</em> character. Here it is from the horse’s mouth: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Garner was excited to participate in the [recruitment] video after being asked by the Office of Public Affairs. The CIA’s Film Industry Liaison worked with the writers of <em>Alias</em> during the first season…Although the show <em>Alias</em> is fictional, the character Jennifer Garner plays embodies the integrity, patriotism, and intelligence the CIA looks for in its officers. (6)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Question: does Ben Affleck have any women in his family who aren’t directly tied to the CIA? Seriously, his grandmother, mother, and ex-wife seem to hang out exclusively with spooks. </p>

<p>Finally, Affleck recently directed and starred in <em>Argo</em>, which is a fictionalized account of the CIA’s exploits during the Iran Hostage crisis. This film is billed as Affleck’s “breakthrough moment” as a director, but given what we know now, is pretty clearly propaganda.  </p>

<p><strong>Matt Damon, the Bourne Identity, and Robert Ludlum</strong></p>

<p>Matt Damon came up bizarrely fast, and there are red flags every where. Damon’s played CIA (or NSA) related characters in <em>Good Willing Hunting</em>, four <em>Jason Bourne</em> films, <em>The Good Shepherd</em>, and <em>Syriana</em>. </p>

<p>Speaking of Jason Bourne, hold onto your seat belts for this one. The Bourne film series is based on novels by Robert Ludlum. Ludlum wrote Tom Clancy-esque novels in the 70s through the early 2000s. Many of them were bestsellers and were eventually turned into films and TV shows. These books and films made a massive amount of money and allowed Ludlum to maintain an extravagant jet-setting life for decades. </p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The world in his writings is one where global corporations, shadowy military forces and government organizations all conspired to preserve (if it was evil) or undermine (if it was law-abiding) the status quo. (7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ludlum has so many red flags around his bio it’s almost funny. First of all, his output makes no sense. He supposedly didn’t start writing until he was 44 years old, and then proceeded to pound out <strong>27</strong> books.</p>

<p>Ludlum’s father supposedly died when he was eight, yet he was able to attend prestigious private schools. He went to the same boarding school (Cheshire Academy) that J.P. Morgan attended in the early 1900s. To explain how he paid for these schools, one bio I found claimed his mother had family money. Perhaps… </p>

<p>However, according to a biography by Robert Ludlum’s nephew, “Ludlum was adopted, and spent much of his life wondering who he really was much like Jason Bourne in The Bourne Identity...” (8)</p>

<p>Why, then, do Wikipedia and other mainstream sites list Ludlum’s parents as <strong>Margaret Wadsworth</strong> and <strong>George Hartford Ludlum</strong>? Were these his real parents, or adopted? Wikipedia makes no mention of an adoption or the early death of his father. </p>

<p>To answer these questions, I decided to do some research on George Hartford Ludlum. When I Googled this name, I was surprised to find all the hits were for the similarly named <strong>George Ludlum Hartford.</strong> I couldn’t find any thing on Ludlum’s supposed father, so I decided to look into this man who had the same name (just with the middle and last names switched). </p>

<p>It turns out George Ludlum Hartford was a billionaire, who made the A&amp;P chain of grocery stores into “The world&#39;s largest retailer with annual sales of $4.5 billion in 1957.” (9) The New York Times called him one of the “20th century’s most accomplished and visionary businessmen” (10). </p>

<p>George Ludlum Hartford lived in New Jersey his whole life, spending many years in a town called Montclair. Robert Ludlum (the author) grew up in New Jersey as well, living only about 30 minutes from Montclair for decades. </p>

<p><strong>What are the chances that a guy named George Hartford Ludlum (Robert’s father) lived thirty minutes away from a man named George Ludlum Hartford (the billionaire) in suburban New Jersey?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s pretty clear that Robert Ludlum’s father (or grandfather, more likely) was George Ludlum Hartford, and they switched the middle and last names in his bio to disguise this fact. After all, Wikipedia admits George Ludlum Hartford was an extremely secretive man: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite his position as the company&#39;s chairman, he was largely unknown to the public and even in the company except among a small group of senior executives. (11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even people in this guy’s own company had never heard of him. Furthermore, he supposedly didn’t get married until his 40s and never had any children. Yeah, right. If you’re sitting on a massive family fortune (A&amp;P was founded by this guy’s father), would you just stop the family line? I don’t think so. </p>

<p>Another clue: according to the mainstream genealogy sites, Robert Ludlum’s mother was 43 years old when she gave birth to him. That’s hard to believe, especially since he was born in the 1920s, when women were having babies a lot younger. </p>

<p>I have given you a mountain of evidence that suggests the author of the Bourne Identity novels was in fact the hidden grandson of a billionaire. Considering Robert Ludlum’s extravagant lifestyle (he flew in private jets, lived on a 200 year-old estate, visited exotic locales constantly), this isn’t totally surprising. There’s no way writing fiction in the 1970s could bring in that much dough. </p>

<p>However, there’s even more here. A lot more. First off, Robert Ludlum’s nephew recently published an article where he mentions: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Three of [Robert’s] college room-mates went on to become intelligence officers, several of his best friends worked for MI6 and the CIA, and his wife Mary had ties to the Pentagon. Some suspected that Robert himself might have been a spy. (12)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. That might be a record for most red flags in one paragraph. </p>

<p>Ludlum died in 2011, supposedly from a house fire. However, the death was highly suspicious and is now being investigated as a murder. Listen to this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Robert’s younger son Jonathan, who was in the process of investigating his father’s death as well as beginning a challenge to the Ludlum Estate, disappeared two years ago and was ultimately found dead in his home. No one had heard from him for over a month. Karen Ludlum, Robert’s second wife and the only witness to the event that took his life, died last year. The cause of death was listed as “suicide.” (13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do these sound like the type of events that happen to a novelist? I don’t think so. </p>

<p>Ludlum was an obvious spook, who was probably an heir of the A&amp;P fortune. I bet most of his books were written by the Intelligence agencies, in order to make “conspiracy theories” and “fiction” tightly intertwined in people’s minds. </p>

<p>That would also explain the prolific output. Even after this guy died, the publishing company supposedly had another 5 of his books left to publish, which raised some eye brows at the time. </p>

<p><strong>Matt Damon</strong></p>

<p>Nothing about Matt Damon makes any sense. </p>

<p>Like, Affleck he is marketed as an “everyman.” Seriously, Google “Matt Damon everyman” and you will find article after article using that word to describe Damon. The reason I find the “everyman” marketing angle so amusing is that Matt Damon has always been Elite. </p>

<p>Matt Damon’s father was a stockbroker and realtor, and his mother was a University professor for many years. The parents divorced, but Matt grew up in Cambridge, MA, right down the street from Harvard University, where he enrolled in 1988.  </p>

<p>Matt Damon’s father is named Kent Telfer Damon. All we’re told is he was a stockbroker for a time – it’s incredibly difficult to find any biographical information on him. Even though stockbrokers can make a lot of money, Matt often stresses he has middle-class roots. I find this odd, so I decided to look more into Damon&#39;s past.   </p>

<p>America’s favorite “every man” Matt Damon went to Harvard. Kind of ironic, right? And he wasn’t some lonely scholarship kid, either. Damon was chosen for The Delphic, one of Harvard’s uber exclusive Finals Clubs. </p>

<p>On the surface, Damon doesn’t seem to fit the profile of a typical Harvard Finals Club member. For one, he was barely on campus during his college years. Damon skipped half of his Sophomore year to work on a made-for-TV film called <em>Rising Son</em>. He returned for one semester as a Junior, only to leave for a full year to work on the film <em>School Ties</em>. He came back for a single semester in 1992, but and then dropped out for good after landing a role in a film called <em>Geronimo: An American Legend</em>.</p>

<p>So The Delphic Club, despite being filled with jocks from “ice hockey, baseball, and captains of several major sports teams” (19) apparently decided to extend membership to a theatre kid who was rarely seen on campus. That seems odd – it’s not a natural fit at all. Sure, Damon probably had some charisma and good looks as an undergrad, but that’s not enough to get into an elite club you otherwise have no business joining. Damon must have had connections prior to enrolling at Harvard. </p>

<p>Six years after leaving school, Damon received the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for writing Good Will Hunting. Wikipedia tells us the award “was handed to [Damon] by Harvard alumnus Jack Lemmon, who had also been a member of the Delphic Club.” (20) Interesting… </p>

<p>Additionally, Damon’s Freshman year roommate was the son of a New York real estate tycoon, named Jason Furham. Furham went on to become Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors in the Obama Administration. I’m not suggesting any thing nefarious here, but it’s interesting that Damon roomed with a guy who became so prominent in the Obama administration. </p>

<p>Finally, here’s an excerpt from an interview Damon gave to the Harvard newspaper years after graduation. Referencing the class time he missed due to pursuing film roles, he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“What was happening is that I would keep coming back, and I would almost get done with the semester and then <strong>I would be yanked out.</strong> But I thought it was serving me well…” (21)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does Damon act like he has so little agency in regards to his film roles? He was “yanked out” of class, but it was OK because it “was serving him well?” Who talks like that about something they are pursuing? Damon makes it sound like he had serious connections in LA, who were telling him what to do. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Bourne Identity author Robert Ludlim are spooks related to the top families. </p>

<p>Here is something nice:
The US. Military works together with the action film makers, that involve military/warfare e.g. &quot;Top Gun&quot; , &quot;Behind enemy lines&quot;</p>

<p>Script writers are obliged to submit their script to officers, who change/censor the parts that portray the US. Military for what it really is.</p>

<p>Movie premieres are co-ordianted with the recruitment branch, to set up booths in the film-theatres, so that (especially young) people can join the military to die for the bankers cause, right after viewing the film.</p>

<p>In return the US. Military provides any publicly known equipment (no live nukes), even aircraft carriers, military bases as filming location and military personell to operate vehicles, serve as statists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my favorite examples of this sort of rabbit hole being much more sinister than just brainwashing is John Nash / A Beautiful Mind.</p>

<p>The movie <em>A Beautiful Mind</em> was directed by scientologist Ron Howard and Russell Crowe (leading actor) has spoken favorably of scientology / said he dabbled in it a bit.  That is interesting because</p>

<ul>
<li>scientology isn&#39;t really L Ron Hubbard&#39;s creation: he got a lot of help from OSS members like Charles Morgan and OTO members like Jack Parsons and Aleister Crowley, so it is an intelligence front</li>
<li>Nash worked a lot on cryptography, not just game theory and consulted with the NSA decades before it was a known thing to most</li>
<li>Nash was locked up for exposing moles / spies in the government, who deemed this &quot;delusional,&quot; yet the Venona Project files have since been declassified and vindicated him</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, this hollywood-CIA complex isn&#39;t just brainwashing people.  They are actively suppressing honest whistle blowers, tossing them into insane asylums, and spending billions of dollars to shove out propaganda to cover their tracks.  We&#39;re not talking about benign manipulation but rather active treason.</p>

<p>And very few people that I know are willing to accept the possibility of any of this to be true, because (at least for me) education never really delved too deep into anything so complex or multi-faceted- the concept of a double-agent or an intelligence agent posing as some sort of entertainment professional is really something that only seems to exist exclusively in movies/novels.  It was never anything that I recall really being discussed in any of the history books growing up; if it had, I probably would have been much more interested in history and really soaked this sort of information right up.</p>

<p>On Jan&#39;s website he has a software interface (which requires you d/l a small piece of software to use it properly) that acts like a web or &quot;brain&quot; (it&#39;s called The Brain) and displays the links between all these cretins, social planners, schemers and numpties.</p>

<p>This does seem fairly obvious. Just look at the wave of war-films after 9/11. The Kingdom, The Hurt Locker, American Sniper, and even films like Battle: Los Angeles, to get people to accept the possibility of warfare on American soil. There&#39;s probably hundreds out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the hurt locker, or even American Sniper were super pro- military. That isn&#39;t me saying i don&#39;t believe the government uses movies to get people to hyped up about military action I just don&#39;t think those two are the best examples. I think those movie toed the line/ kinda fooled the government into cooperating by featuring lead characters who were super pro war, but showing the effects of war on their psyche in a super negative light. I think black hawk down would be a better example, which was released just 4 months after 9/11. now i&#39;m not a 9/11 conspiracy theorist and i&#39;m only commenting because i&#39;m procrastinating on a paper so take that as you will. My main government conspiracies involve MLK JFK and RFK, and basically any other civil rights figure that was killed</p>

<p>Not really a conspiracy, either, as this has been open common knowledge since at least the 1940s (and before if you count films outside of Hollywood). Propaganda films are an entire <em>genre</em>. We know about them. They&#39;re acknowledged. They&#39;re a thing that gets made and it hasn&#39;t been kept a secret.</p>

<p>We can question <em>individual</em> movies, of course, which requires more evidence if we&#39;re going to make a claim about Movie X, but movies as rah rah rah propaganda has never been a secret. It&#39;s straight-up taught in film class.</p>

<p>The government largely doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> to make military propaganda films anymore, since it&#39;s proven that the public eats that shit up. They can rely on Hollywood to do it for them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like video games. Half that shit is straight up military porn. They make propaganda games like &quot;America&#39;s Army,&quot; but they mostly don&#39;t need to because the game developers do it for them on their own.</p>

<p>Very suspicious that many many famous and successful musicians had family members working for the CIA, were high ranking military, etc. etc.  It would not surprise me if some of the musicians themselves were working for the same organizations, or even part of some sort of secret organization, religon, cult, something of that nature? It does not seem too far fetched the more the light is shown upon the media, hollywood, politicians, etc.  To me part of the most amazing thing about all this, is how the hell do these people keep it all hidden so well.  Even the Son of God had a betrayer in his midst, how many more times over would the devil&#39;s ranks find betrayers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to know the real story behind Seth MacFarlane. Some guy born into a small town(Kent, CT has 3k people) manages to create a multi-million dollar animation empire. </p>

<p>His first show is cancelled after 3 seasons, then brought back years later along with another show promoting a CIA-agent father. Oh and MacFarlane was supposed to be on flight 11 but coincidentally missed it.</p>

<p>This could be his entire honest story with nothing hidden behind the curtain. Coincidences are possible. But how many people make it that far in the industry, having a show cancelled &amp; renewed, plus being tied into 9/11, all that coming from a small town of 3k people located nowhere near Hollywood? That&#39;s one person I&#39;d just like to know more about.</p>

<p>South Park is 100% American, both creators were born in Colorado. </p>

<p>I also fully believe Matt Stone &amp; Trey Parker are legitimate because they did a lot of student films as kids. They really just loved film and created a cartoon that went &quot;viral&quot;, got on the air, and grew fast. This was back when Comedy Central was a brand new network so they needed programming and South Park was their first big hit. Their story is completely different, not to mention South Park has little-to-no subliminal messaging unlike <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1w1q64/heres_my_list_of_seth_macfarlane_coincidences/">Family Guy</a></p>

There were top families who kept long genealogies and you see weird things where every fourth generation they go back to using some old name.</p>

<p>Something&#39;s going on with that.  My best guess is that these are Talmudic Jews (who believe that the chosen race are real people and metaphysically create all other people who don&#39;t have real souls).  They&#39;re tracking their connection to certain ancient family lines (David, Benjamin, Cohen), which they believe entitle them to mystical powers.</p>

<p>And if it&#39;s not a Jewish thing, then it&#39;s almost Atlantean or Persian Magi or something.  </p>

Not billions, but built up assets near 25-30 million dollars over 50 years of working hard, which will then get passed on to their children. In turn they know some wealthy people. I also know people who started careers in the arts, from a completely non art family, found sucess and now mingle in high circles with very very wealthy people.

<p>Right. This is no secret and not unusual. Scores and scores of behind-the-scenes, director&#39;s commentaries, and more have openly discussed this for decades. Most military and intelligence agencies do this, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Chances are, if a movie features realistic seeming military or intelligence action, at the very least some advisers were involved.</p>

<p>Hell, even the Transformers movies were made with loads of military cooperation. Most Michael Bay movies are, because he loves to make military equipment look sexy.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a high quality post he&#39;s got there - another highly sourced, well thought out deep investigation. And much admired by its readers. </p>

<p>So.... where is your well thought out deep investigation, Mr &quot;Ah yes, the delusional and paranoid ramblings of someone who is completely unhinged.&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly have a lot of references. But you didn&#39;t present a single piece of actual evidence when you break it all down. </p>

<p>Affleck for example. You say he is CIA. Your reasoning? He has some family members who were connected to the intelligence services, he watched Good Will Hunting at Camp David with the president and was later advised by a CIA liaison while playing a CIA agent. Oh and Jennifer Garner. </p>

<p>Not a single piece of hard evidence. I don&#39;t know how you could look at this string of disparate events(some of it almost 100 years old) and come to the conclusion that Ben Affleck is in the CIA. None of this constitutes proof of any kind. No documents, no eyewitnesses, nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>he watched Good Will Hunting at Camp David with the president</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s also important to note that OP&#39;s point here is misleading by omission, or is based on bad assumptions/info. He states, &quot;We are told Good Will Hunting was a surprise hit that took awhile to catch on with audiences. So, isn’t it a little odd that these two no-name actors were invited to watch the premiere of the film with the freaking president! ... at the time of this photo, Good Will Hunting was not a hit yet (since it had just released earlier in the day). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were not famous yet, and were supposedly struggling to get by in LA. And yet, we’re supposed to believe that Bill Clinton was so excited about this film, that he sought out Matt and Ben and invited them to Camp David so they could all watch it together. That’s just ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>That would seem unusual, yes, except for the part OP leaves out: They were invited via <em>Robin Williams</em>, the big name star who anchored the film and who also happened to be <a href="http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2014/liz-smith-a-treasure-has-been-lost">friends with Bill Clinton</a> (not my word, either, <a href="https://twitter.com/billclinton/status/499322972969369603">Bill&#39;s word</a>.</p>

<p>Kind of an important bit of context, that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and was later advised by a CIA liaison while playing a CIA agent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another item that seems like a big important thing to note, unless you know how films are made. As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, this is commonplace, openly acknowledged, and is a part of making scores and scores of movies each year. Most military and intelligence agencies have liaisons and advisers available for movies and TV. It&#39;s not a secret. It&#39;s widely advertised, known, and discussed, right up to and including having features about it as DVD extras.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has some family members who were connected to the intelligence services</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Worth noting that the connections are tenuous at best. The best man at his grandmother&#39;s wedding? <em>That&#39;s</em> a stunning connection?</p>

<p>His mom drafted to do some teaching by an author who was the son of a spook? <em>That&#39;s</em> a stunning connection?</p>

<p>This is borderline Brother-in-law of a Roommate who is Cousin to a Friend&#39;s Doctor level stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was proposed by some anon a while ago and I never forgot about it.</p>

<p>He was specifically referring to Mr. Robot, which is also a story about counter-revolution and kicking secret society and the powerful&#39;s asses.</p>

<p>The issue is that the inherent voyeuristic aspect of all films does not provide the impetus for action.  If anything we develop some sense that we&#39;ve lived through these characters; extracting this virtual reality into our own mish-mash of other false ones.</p>

<p>The net effect is the viewer is less apt to enact what he sees in these hero-type movies and shows.  </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense as it does to me.  Let me know if I need to clarify.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just want to make a note regarding the liaison on set.  This is a common thing for directors who want accuracy and authenticity in a production, or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard.  The Stargate tv show had people from the Air Force on hand to create that authenticity, as I&#39;m sure many other productions have had similar.  You want consultants or you look like an idiot to people who know what you&#39;re trying to portray.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the CIA liaison didn&#39;t influence the production for propaganda purposes, I&#39;m just pointing out having consultants on a production is a common thing.</p>

<p>While Affleck was with Jennifer Lopez, her mother Guadeloupe &#39;won&#39; 2.4 million at The Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Her father, David Lopez was a computer specialist.  He co-founded <a href="http://www.manosaccelerator.com/manos-san-jose-california-silicon-valley-latino/">Manos accelerator</a> that was bought up by Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Damon was chosen for The Delphic, one of Harvard’s uber exclusive Finals Clubs.</p>

<p>Wikipedia tells us the award “was handed to [Damon] by Harvard alumnus Jack Lemmon, who had also been a member of the Delphic Club.” (20) Interesting…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I decided to look into Matt Damon being in the Delphic Club. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Damon#Early_life">&quot;Early Life&quot; section of his Wikipedia page <em>does</em> say that he was part of the Delphic Club</a>, but when I actually click on their sources for that information, I can&#39;t actually find anything mentioning Damon&#39;s membership in this supposedly super-exclusive club. And we all know that because Wikipedia is edited by normal users like you and I, it isn&#39;t infallible. </p>

<p>One of the sources does say that Jack Lemmon (the guy who handed Damon his Oscar) and Damon were part of the same social club at Harvard, but not that it was necessarily the Delphic Club. I also can&#39;t find any credible information on the Internet saying Jack Lemmon was in this club (except his Wikipedia page, but when I actually click on the citation claiming this, the citation itself makes no mention of this). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never heard of this Delphic Club before, either. I&#39;m not much of a conspiracy theorist (this is only my second time posting in this subreddit), but do they have a history of shady shit? </p>

<p>All your other information is undoubtedly interesting, though (I never realized Affleck and Damon had such close ties to the CIA). But just because someone has family ties to the CIA doesn&#39;t mean they themselves are in cahoots with whatever nefarious shit the CIA is pulling. Hell, I had an English teacher in high school whose dad was in the CIA. My economics professor&#39;s dad was in the CIA as well, and I highly doubt these two guys were undercover CIA agents (LOL). Though it <em>is</em> pretty weird that Affleck&#39;s grandmother was friends with Tom Braden himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny to listen to Ben Affleck get all bent out of shape and be put in his place, but the net result of that episode was NOT that Sam Harris is correct, though... Sam received, and probably still does, a lot of hate for that episode.</p>

<p>In a way it makes OP&#39;s point even more sound; that episode of Bill Maher should have highlighted how wrong Ben is, and you can see it while watching it, but all it actually did was rile up hatred toward Sam and his beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree. I think it actually won Sam more followers than it did create enemies. His backing of Hillary over Trump however did lose him a significant portion of listeners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bravo!! This is truly a diamond in the rough.  All of what you explained is logical and makes absolute sense. </p>

<p>I have not cross referenced anything you have written about their pasts but I do know that most of the films made by the two actors involve the CIA, FBI and the military complex. </p>

<p>This is a great theory, I would venture to say that this isn&#39;t a conspiracy theory but a reality theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Matt Damon was a very up and coming actor before this. He was in All The Pretty Horses. That movie won him many awards and got him a lot of critical acclaim. He was also in Courage Under Fire as well. During this time Kevin Smith was becoming very popular in the cool underground scene as a new powerhouse (believe it or not at the time) in film. Ben and Matt were both in Mallrats. Kevin Smith pretty much had Miramax wrapped around their finger and that&#39;s how Good Will Hunting got made. And it was an instant hit. It was a low budget film that made enormous returns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid we&#39;d find the CIA&#39;s money laundering operatives and assets virtually anywhere where there&#39;s even a whiff of &quot;Big Money&quot; being legitimately exchanged and moved around without a whole lot of questions being asked or suspicions being raised, whether it&#39;s the movie, music, or fine art biz where there&#39;s nothing actually unusual about enormous sums of money either coming in or going out as the result of producing a single movie, song or album, or the sale of a single piece of presumably famous art or museum quality historical artifacts, rare gems or jewelry, etc etc. </p>

<p>The are also, no doubt, plenty of people who are both said to be and have all the trappings of being enormously wealthy that the CIA is in a perfect position to scrub their actual background and create a fictitious one that has every appearance of being perfectly legitimate, as well to promote, publicise, and create events that all seem to substantiate that, strictly for it&#39;s own ends and purposes.</p>

<p>In all those situations the public depends mainly on what the media tells them and in virtually every instance there is a small tight little circle and network of people that verify and authenticate those transactions who can be bought, blackmailed, or else will willingly go along with them for what they believe to be a service to their government or the nation&#39;s security in addition to similar ones in all the major media who will see to it that the story that surrounds it will be no different from any true ones of a similar nature... hiding them, as we might say, in plain sight, with n one ever the wiser. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before even reading- I agree with your thesis.  Besties George Clooney and Paul Giamatti should be on there as well.</p>

<p>But when I&#39;m reading, things like this are a bit annoying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth Roberts was born in 1921 to prominent parents in New York City. She was one of a just a handful of women who attended college prior to World War II, enrolling at Smith College. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A &quot;handful of women&quot;?  Every woman in my family at that time went to college.  Smith is one of the 7 sisters schools, which had been educating women exclusively since the 19th century.  They were sister schools to the Ivies, and were finishing schools of sort for upper class ladies who would marry men in those schools.</p>

<p>In ww2, almost everyone was serving- so men from that class would often either serve as officers or be involved in intelligence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to know the real story behind Seth MacFarlane. Some guy born into a small town(Kent, CT has 3k people) manages to create a multi-million dollar animation empire. </p>

<p>His first show is cancelled after 3 seasons, then brought back years later along with another show promoting a CIA-agent father. Oh and MacFarlane was supposed to be on flight 11 but coincidentally missed it.</p>

<p>This could be his entire honest story with nothing hidden behind the curtain. Coincidences are possible. But how many people make it that far in the industry, having a show cancelled &amp; renewed, plus being tied into 9/11, all that coming from a small town of 3k people located nowhere near Hollywood? That&#39;s one person I&#39;d just like to know more about.</p>

<p>He was specifically referring to Mr. Robot, which is also a story about counter-revolution and kicking secret society and the powerful&#39;s asses.</p>

<p>The issue is that the inherent voyeuristic aspect of all films does not provide the impetus for action.  If anything we develop some sense that we&#39;ve lived through these characters; extracting this virtual reality into our own mish-mash of other false ones.</p>

<p>The net effect is the viewer is less apt to enact what he sees in these hero-type movies and shows.  </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense as it does to me.  Let me know if I need to clarify.</p>
