    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your input. What are your views on that?<br/>
I don&#39;t see the propoganda in this, atm all I see is some sort of push to defame Bill Nye.<br/>
I&#39;m trying to work out how a state (russia/usa) would benefit from pushing this message and here&#39;s what I got so far (just thinking, no sources)<br/>
USA - Just a happier general public. Informing those that don&#39;t understand and allowing to reduce the stigma with trans/homosexuality.<br/>
RUS - Rus sponsored program to shit stir the public and cause an even bigger divide between US state and church in an aim to cause more disruption between the two parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that we were founded on the freedom of the people. Hence the constitution.<br/>
Freedom of the people obviously includes expressing yourself and being/doing what you want.             </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are going around and acting like animals and I wouldn&#39;t say that those who are homosexual/trans are lol, the majority of people just want to be happy. If that&#39;s not the point you are making I hope you can follow thru with more detail.        </p>

<p>Real power, like guns/technology? Then let&#39;s shut down the country, install curfews, execute the gays/trans. Close the borders and nuke Cuba for a laugh. /s</p>

<p>I like to think that the government/system works in parrallel. You&#39;ve got branches of the system that obviously are working on tremendous things but you&#39;ve also got that branch that works on the humanitarian needs of the people. People don&#39;t want to be feel trapped and if you&#39;re living in first world country, you hold that choice (to not feel trapped). And by that, I don&#39;t mean simply by sexuality. I mean it as, you are free to move around the country/outside of it. You can change your job/career if you wanted. The people have <em>the option</em> to control their lives.                   </p>

<p>I never said that trans/homos are animals. I was including all human beings when I said that.

<p>This would fall under the freedom of people, right? I wouldn&#39;t say <em>everyone</em> wants that but you have the opportunity in this land to do whatever. As long as you can face the consiquences of your actions (postive/negative) and/or willing to put the work in. If someone told me they are going to spend the next 5 years on reddit rather than work, well, then that&#39;s their choice and I have no right to judge them for that. And that&#39;s what freedom is (to me).               </p>

<p>Me too brother! My view on this is that other parties got involved. Such as the church. I would like to say that the fight over sexuality has been a <em>war</em> (this may be too strong of a word to use) between the state and church, and when you&#39;ve got a clash between belief of the church and freedom, well, I can honestly say I am not suprised it has taken this long!           </p>

<p>What are your views on the points I have made in this post and the previous ones I have made. Thanks for the questions by the way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the founder were caring too much about sexuality as it&#39;s not really represented in the documents. I think, for the most part, it was not touched upon for reasons, as times as does the culture of man. But, if it was important to touch upon it would have been in the document. So, I go to the no one cares what you are or who you are with? Are you a good person. Do you stand up for man? Do you stand up for Nature? so on.</p>

<p>I think the church was involved long before! The church that exists and the one Christ talks about are two different things (we&#39;re at church right now). They knew that. That&#39;s why they escaped that tyranny. It didn&#39;t matter your religion, Truth exists above all those religions. If you are true why shouldn&#39;t you be welcome in a place that exists for that? That&#39;s what this country was founded on but power corrupts. Old ways tend to creep back into society. Darkness.</p>

<p>I think people give too much power when it comes to the state an gov&#39;t. If people had more discipline they&#39;d realize flaunting it does nothing but cause negativity and fear. You&#39;re an agent of chaos.</p>

<p>Over history, there&#39;s been changes and there&#39;s been stigmas. There was a dark time with racial issues of course which I would say had more of an impact of building the states than the gays/trans. Since slaves/segrigation of the people built the country, should we bring it back? Why can&#39;t we, as a nation, as people, remove the stigmatas of things that shouldn&#39;t even be an issue. &quot;Why the <em>fuck</em> do you care about my religion/skin colour/sexuality&quot; is the message I get from those bill nye clips.        </p>

<p>Is this really so common where you are that it&#39;s a pressing issue in society?  Less than 0.5% of people are transgender, I would bet a minuscule fraction of that are 4 year-olds who are &quot;deciding their gender&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not as concerned with a tiny fraction of the population being able to freely make choices that have the potential to make them happier.  On the other hand, I&#39;m also not confronted with the issue as frequently as you seem to be.  </p>

<p>I just see somebody trying to educate people on the complexity of an issue that for a long time was considered to be very simplistic, I don&#39;t find it &quot;creepy&quot; to try and educate people about something they might not be informed about, especially if it allows certain individuals to be comfortable with who they are.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just glad that it&#39;s being considered &quot;normal&quot; for people to be happy and comfortable with who they are, seems like progress.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yet you find it &quot;creepy&quot; when people inform them about the complexities behind sexuality in order to potentially help them feel more comfortable in society?  Seems like a contradiction.</p>

<p>Because of that, I&#39;m quite content to allow people to be comfortable with themselves and be happy, the impact on my life is non-existent if somebody chooses to be happy with themselves, but you seem to have had a very different experience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<ul>
<li>First of all, maybe they aren’t harming anybody directly, but are they harming themselves? When we give a 5-year-old permission to choose their gender, perhaps they really aren’t harming the people around them (I still think they are), but how will this impact his/her life?</li>
</ul>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m not faced with this as much as you have been, you&#39;ve obviously had to somehow deal with it numerous times if you&#39;re using it as an example to criticize people for finding comfort in their lives.  I can&#39;t really related as I&#39;ve never met 4/5 year-olds who have decided their gender, and I certainly haven&#39;t met enough to see how those decisions ended up and subsequently being able to determine whether it was a good or bad decision for them.  Again, I don&#39;t work in a field where I deal with this, so as a normal observer, this is something I&#39;m likely to never come across in my life.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are countless stories about people regretting sex changes, and if gender is so fluid, should we be more careful about allowing people to make often permanent and irreversible changes in their lives?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bill Nye never suggested that people make irreversible changes to themselves.  He was saying that it&#39;s incredibly complicated and providing information that some people might not know about.</p>

<p>Moreover, could you please provide evidence for your claim that there are countless people who regret their sex changes?  According to  <a href="http://www.amsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CareOfThePatientUndergoingSRS.pdf">this study</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So approximately 1% of 0.5% of the population (~0.00005%) regret their sex changes, definitely not enough to restrict the potential happiness of other individuals.</p>

<p>Yup, can&#39;t believe those damn gays just want to get married and treated like normal people, what next?  People marrying horses?</p>

<p>In terms of agendas and motives of certain groups, I fear bigots like yourself who lie and say that people can fuck dogs if they want far more than people who are trying to educate the populace.  If you are so concerned with these agendas, then why do you spread lies in order to counter them?  If they were such a real danger, wouldn&#39;t you be able to use the truth to counteract the negative effects they supposedly have?  It degrades your supposed argument, but as we both know, it&#39;s rooted in bigotry more than it is in fact.</p>
