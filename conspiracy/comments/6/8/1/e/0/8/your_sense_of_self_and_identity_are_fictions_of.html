       Most people would rather remain sleep. They talk of awakening but dont want to awaken to the truth of their own being. This identity is easy to control through fear tactics because its like a petri dish for negative emotional and mind states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear, low self esteem, sense of lack, irritation, anxiety, boredom, frustration all grow out of this sense of being a self, a long lasting independently existing separate entity. Its thought patters in the mind and sensations in the body that create this sense of a separate self.
      </p>
      <p>
       People see the wrong and stupid in the world, but they dont see it in themselves because they are identified with being the doer of it all. Unless you can free yourself from your own minds dreamstate, how can you help humanity as a collective mind to wake out of its dream?

       while I understand what you're saying, i'd say 98% here don't,
      </p>
      <p>
       You've jumped in the deep end straight off, and as you're trying to teach people with a 10yo's understanding something at least as complex as "why people fall in love" you're going about it in the worng way imho?
      </p>
      <p>
       i.e. How
       <em>
        would you
       </em>
       explain to a 10yo what "falling in love" (lust!) is", i can assure you it isn't easy! And trying to get people to 'instantly realize' that "we''re All part of the same deal" when certain 'forces' (TPTB for one) have been teaching them the opposite for many decades?
      </p>
      <p>
       while it's a concept they're familiar with, often from 'religious teachings', like "do unto other as you would like done unto you",, it's still basically a vague concept in thier Reality's.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, even with "do unto others", they don't
       <em>
        really know how to
       </em>
       Do this! (believe it or not!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not? Becoz  they've been taught to believe in 'scarcity' most people are "looking out for themselves becoz, who else will?" mentality -- plus,
       <em>
        they don't know what they want
       </em>
       so how can they ask it of others?
      </p>
      <p>
       AND so, this world we currently live in
       <em>
        is the direct result of
       </em>
       the 'average person's thoughts' and this 'it's all about Me' attitude many people subscribe to and are  advertised and promoted by (almost) every celebrity and even more so by the likes of the Paris Hilton's School of deportment and her Kardashian fan girl protoge's!
      </p>
      <p>
       This had led to young women growing  up with a crazy sense of entitlement, like never before seen! Their 'expectations' of men have grown so disproportionate that most men will never live up to them, and eventually these women will end up childless cat women in their later years, which is
       <em>
        just perfect
       </em>
       for TPTB at this stage of their crazy game!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a direct consequence of tptb's SOP to 'divide the people to conquer them'. Divide them in
       <em>
        any and every way possible
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       which they are now doing with the 'sexes', that is, between men and women, they;re ramping up the discord in a variety of ways. It's fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, start at "human spirituality 101" friend, not level 18! Class #3!

       People have been saying this for over 50 years, it's just not borne out by the data. I know it supports some people's narrative if modern women/feminists all end up lonely spinsters cos their expectations are too high, unfortunately that's a falsifiable claim and its observably false.

       I can only speak of what has worked for me. Not really trying to explain anything just saying what is in the way of realisation of our true nature, which is the separate sense of self.

       Sorry but you can't rush enlightenment. It can only happen one person at a time and they have to manage it themselves. It's not a truth that can simply be told to anyone it has to be personally realized and experienced on their own terms.

       Sorry, but I'm only re-iterating what every sage and wise person has said about this from the very beginning of time. Out of the many, only a few ever seek the truth, and out of that few only one out of many over time, who's sole desire and intent to know that truth comes from the heart with humility and the desire to shed the ignorance and all the harm they have unwittingly done and will continue to do because of it, is ever able to recognise and know it.

       What do you mean by this? While I agree the idea we have of ourself, our "self-image", is simply descriptions of our form and function in comparison to other humans. "You" ARE not "tall" or "strong" or "introverted" or anything like that, as you would be the exact same as you are now if you were teleported to the other side of the galaxy and the rest of humanity wiped out, but none of those words would have any meaning, as they only make sense relative to other people. The image people have of themselves and the stories we tell ourselves are BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I cannot escape the fact that I EXPERIENCE! The ego is illusion, the self is real.

       The self as an entity is the illusion. If you enquire into this who, you will get to the bottom of it.

      <p>
       Can you find the I that experiences outside or inside experience? Is there even two different things, I that experiences and something that is experienced, or is it that all of this is a singular whole?

         I assume you regard Descartes as, if not a FOOL, largely mistaken in the basic premise of his Meditations?

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you identify as the experiences themselves, is that not just another idea of the self?

         I am not familiar with Decartes work but this phrase at least in how people normally understand it is backwards. Being is before thought. But the separate self seems to be created by thoughts or at least is maintained or reinforced by this perpetual thinking.

         In the bible God is often referred to as the I am. I am is the sense of being in each of us. Some would say its the light of God and we are that light.

         The amness of inside and the thingness of outside are of one substance. All experience is equally real as experience.

       I disagree. I get that we are all one, and there is a collective, I believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the individual self is important too. It's how we get innovation. It's how we grow as in the consciousness itself gets bigger to fill more vessels. It lets us observe and experience more things. Maybe it's some form of self preservation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to be the best. That's just ego shit. You don't even have to understand what's really going on. Hell I'm stroking my ego just typing this. As if I could possibly know any more or less about this than you could.

       You still have to be you though. The you that's hungry and wants to reproduce and fears predators, feels pain and experiences the universe in all its beauty.

       We are just cogs in the great machine that is life, and just because our specific configuration of cog as figured out that we are cogs doesn't mean we can stop turning. We turn because the spokes of the cog next to us is pushing on ours and vice versa.

       I guess what I'm getting at is. You can try to get closer to the truth by shedding your ego. There is nothing wrong with that, but there is nothing wrong with fueling your ego either.

       Like, say you have a line of ants walking along the sidewalk and you slam your hand down next to the ants. Some of them break rank, some of them don't. The ones who didn't break rank would have died if my hand was a predator. Thing is, the ones who did break rank, they still die, they just do more stuff first.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, we all report back to the hive eventually, we all die. I want to be one of the ants that does a lot of stuff and fucks a lot of ant bitches. I don't  think there is anything wrong with that, even if you fail at it.

       Well obviously there is no wrong. I dont like ego as a word because people say I lost my ego or such and actually the one who loses or gains an ego is the separate self.

       I am not talking of getting closer, I am talking of destrying the illusory separation so that there is only truth. Becouse this now, whatever form it takes is actually the truth.
