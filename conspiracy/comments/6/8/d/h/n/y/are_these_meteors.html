       You haven't heard people like him come around when we talk about shitty parts of the world and how they kind of suck? They always come in and spout the same statistics (longevity, health, wealth, compared to relative historical statistics) to say that the world is actually great. It's so cliche that you can call them out before they even have a chance to, which is what happened here, and why I was upvoted. Now you know for later! :)

       Well, the Black Death killed up to one-half the population of Europe within less than a decade. The survivors had no science, no way to know what hit them, no way to know if all humans would be extinct within another few years. THOSE were troubled times.

       Funny you mention that, I recently spoke with a guy who lived through the Cold War era. He said the zeitgeist then was way tamer than it is now. 
While society is started to wise up to the shady shit the governments all over the world are trying to pull we're still kept down with debt, social misery and the like, so while we're better equipped mentally to do something about it, we're simply crushed into a state of lethargy, inability and confusion by the state of things like debt, taxes and confusion brought on by media.

       Hello Friend. We Live in exciting times. What if I told you that we have proven to be able to land on asteroids. Mount a relatively small rocket at zero g. And precisely crash it to earth using the highest math skills known to man. NASA pioneering space weapons. Dragon Rockets? Osiris-REx? Uncounterable Apocalypse Alt to a Nuclear WW3. It was written.

       No use having fear. Fear only sacrifices our strength and power to those who will misuse it. All we can do is be vigilant and outspoken, for lack of fear is what brings strength. It brings power, and courage. Be vigilant, and you will know the signs. I doubt that's the case here, and even if it was, I know my religion, and my testimony. Nothing can change or alter that.

       I don't know what it is but anytime I see people talk about aliens I feel the need to share my conclusion about aliens. Alien abduction reports are identical to encounters with demons. Aliens are demons. There's a spiritual world we can't see that exists all around us and can effect us. When an alien invasion comes, it's not extra terrestrials. It's demons. It's part of the fallen angels (satans/lucifer/demons) attempt to trick mankind into submission by pretending to be aliens so we give them control thinking they are a more intelligent firm of life. If we pray to Jesus we will be protected and saved. Alienresistance.org has hundreds of testimonials of UFO reports that had previously been edited by the top UFO reporting site, muffin.com, to remove all references to Jesus and demons. Hundreds of people claimed it was an evil presence and that jesus' name made it flee.

       In summary: a government run false flag in order to sweep up the majority into supporting increased arms and military technology.  It would be utilizing advanced and undisclosed technology to fool the public with the hopes of obliterating religion and creating a new unified and controlled religion.

       Lots of random references to it all over so I don't think it's completely made up.  Keep an eye out for bullshit.  The media should be a pretty good indication on what feels real and not.

       God existing or not is a matter of your perspective so far.  My research has told me otherwise and I say that as someone that started reading and learning independently as an agnostic atheist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more I learned, the more I started seeing a coordinated effort to destroy a certain idea of God.  I also started seeing many signs in sacred math and quantum physics discoveries that led me to believe a much different theory of existence could be possible.

       I personally don't think it will matter whether or not anyone believes god is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think for quite a lot of people, religious or no, it will be hard for them to deny what they're seeing with their own two eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've read, it's possible they will use technology to project realistic looking ufos/aliens/god/angels/whatever else they'd want to project into the sky. And I don't think they'd do it if it wasn't a
       <em>
        really, really
       </em>
       good projection/hologram.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, at that point, if it all seems very realistic, it doesn't matter who believes what for the majority and it won't matter much that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       people might realize it isn't real. Potential
       <em>
        billions
       </em>
       of people will see something insane with their own eyes and
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       believe it.

        It's a Chinese rocket breaking up upon reentry and it's from half a year ago.

       Exactly, and it was exacerbated by the pressure system that was over the area with high altitude humid air. That system being replaced by a change in atmospheric conditions is what caused the deadly tornadoes in east Texas yesterday.

       I seriously doubt that these are meteorites. Meteorites would light up the sky around them more than what we see in all of the footage. This is especially true if the thing was large enough to arc arcoss the sky from Utah to Florida. It would make a loud, doppler like woosh-crack as it passes. The big key is that (assuming these are the same set of objects), if they were burning up in the earth's atmosphere (for about 30 degrees - or 1/12th of the Earth's diameter), then they would have to come down
       <em>
        somewhere
       </em>
       . This would affect the perceived altitude would have to be different from Florida to Utah, and it looks the same in both videos. Either way we assume that it flew, it would have had to come down somewhere near Washington St or Puerto Rico, which we have not heard reported yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best (but absolutely weak) guess would be satellite, aircraft, or missile wreckage skipping across the atmosphere before shooting into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       My assumption is that it would take a lot of (relatively) horizontal force to skip an object across the atmosphere in such a way. I will be interested to read other people's ideas on this. Good post, OP!

       I may be wrong but I believe this is a military program using guided lasers and focus on spot, creating a giant light in the sky. This was developed as an attempt for the navy to make their number seem greater should an invading navy come at nighttime. Its publicly disclosed technology now. Happens in San Diego a bunch,  military always says they are missle tests.

       I looked earlier into Wormwood a little bit. Came up with this I thought interesting:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ukrainian language word for "wormwood" is чорнобиль or "chornobyl", the Ukrainian name of the town of Chernobyl. 
I guess everyone knows about Chernobyl?

       Who knows. Maybe Chernobyl was chosen for the reactor to blow up because of that, as a false flag to instill fear on the populace in the future. In the words of Alex Jones, it's fourth dimensional pedophile vampires who have come to steal our children, and have planted flags in our history to allow them to assume control.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, it's nothing to get worried about. We'd know if it was project blue light, which we don't even know if it's actually real or will happen. If it's a nuclear weapon, then I guess viva le revolution. China and Russia will be in a scramble to assume control of the US's resources, and we'd have to go Red Dawn on their asses, and establish the New American Republic.

       Meteors typically enter the atmosphere at speeds in excess of 10km per second. The process of ablation evidenced on hundreds of stones give specific data to rate of melting / cooling in the composite material. Even "grazing" the atmosphere,  they would not move at speeds as slow as the Utah video. That is absolutely not a meteor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dashcam video likely depicts one disintegrating on entry. Florida has had a spike in reports over the past 3 weeks. That makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Louisiana video definitely doesn't depict a meteor, it's descent is far too slow and it doesn't exhibit any debris.  That said, it's not a "plane flying against the sun" . That's bullshit because planes tend to fly in straight line, it's this weird thing they're known for. The cloud formation trailing that object exhibits evidence of freefall wind impact,  the irrythmic shifting of the cloud shows the object is not following a "predetermined" course as the winds is clearly jostling it.

       I think I saw this driving west on I-80 last year. I saw a huge green flash, followed by a bright green fireball that exploded into smaller fireballs. I didn't see where it went because I was driving.

       It's relatively slow which is a hint that's it's something in a planned re-entry. If it were to hit the atmosphere by mistake it would be much faster.

       Live in very rural Southeast US.  Every fucking night of the year where i live as long as there are no clouds i can see meteors.  Its fucking awesome.  I recently learned in the last couple of weeks how to tell the difference between plane vs satellite.  Satellites are harder to spot but i see those pretty frequently as well.  Meteots go left right up down diagonally.  Sometimes it weirds me out that i see so much of this shit flying by our planet all the time... But at the same time its pretty sweet &amp; fun to watch.  Shit flies by all the time - most of you just live in places where you can see it happen b/c of light polution.  I watch this shit as much as i can though.  Its better than tv.  And b/c you know... I wanna see a fucking alien!!!

       i feel like i have seen almost all of the actually possible and extant instances of natural atmostpheric phenomena, and when i see this my brain understands that it is a simple phenomenon but effectively quite breathtaking
      </p>
      <p>
       its a plane contrailing hard, at that long, low angle of incident to the viewer. notice how the camera engages a high zoom, which expounds the almost explosive visualization of the contrailing. it's explosive ebcause of the sunset. notice how the sun glows colorfully on its belly. have you ever seen those small but intense whisps and bits of cloud that almost illumiate unnaturally at sunset?
