    <div class="md"><p>Well thank you. I appreciate that. I honestly believe u/mastigia would be a far better choice. Just my opinion. </p>

<p>I try to be objective in my own theories and thoughts, try to play devil&#39;s advocate for myself, and that is because of him. When I first started posting here, I was a bit cavalier, but a few interactions with him, and others, have really helped me mold my thought process as well as my researching. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we have a shit-ton of activity modding 500K users and managing IRL shit. users generally feel ok to complain about all sorts of issues - we have a ton of lurkers and trolls... we just need to spread the attention of each mod by adding more eyes to the problem.</p>

<p>this is a complex community, its not like our submitters are just posting pics of cats (sorry <a href="/u/putin_loves_cats">/u/putin_loves_cats</a>)</p>

<p>and.... our genre is yuge... so we have mods who like to focus on certain things and ignore others... so we need SMEs in whatever area51 they want to be in.</p>

<p>What problems are you referring too and how do you guys deal with said problem?  Sorry to ask, been here since it&#39;s creation and I have seen issues/brigades for years, but wasn&#39;t sure how you guys are handling it and if that&#39;s even the problems you&#39;re referring to.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question:</p>

<p>Also been here for more than 10 years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>shills trolls and assholes... this sub is rife for abuse and brigades etc... and so that actually takes up a lot of the mod teams&#39; attention</p></li>
<li><p>info genre is massive... we dont have sub /r/&#39;s - so the topic of convo is massive but all in the same bucket. so those who might be interested in /politics/ufo/government-fuck-whatever/bigfoot/aliens blah blah blah - are al in the same bucket</p></li>
<li><p>some mods are interested in a certain topic, but not in others, so they just literally ignore the things they are not into... (this leads to users complaining about their topic being ignored, as mods are ppl and the mod who like that topic might be picking kids up from school for example)</p></li>
<li><p>as the internet has been up-spiraling-awareness to corruption and bullshit going on in the world, the venn-diagram between conspiracy-politics-worldnews has been getting much more overlapped... as such, our &quot;problem space&quot; is fucking huge, which results in point 1 as stated above... the number of trolls, shills, lurkers, users is on the scale that ~12 mods cant really deal... </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am just amazed at the attention this sub has today....</p>

<p>but we aren&#39;t just &quot;here is a stupid pic&quot; -- our topics do require thought. and I love the mod team, but we do not agree on everything, we are a dysfunctional family, but still a family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I haven&#39;t been a big fan of mods in the past with regards to r/politics, worldnews, news, especially after r/reddit.com was killed.  When the mod take over happened in r/politics 5 years ago, it seemed like it was more to control the content than to actually make a even playing field as they hoped/said.  </p>

<p>Although, with age, I have come to recognize the importance of having moderators, especially like the ones we have had here in r/conspiracy.  This sub is the closes to what r/reddit.com was like with regards to sub rules.  As for the major issue, brigades &amp; trolls, is there a way to keep new accounts unable to comment/post... or even better yet, a way to determine if users are actually active/participating in the sub based on their upvote/downvotes in the sub?  I would have slapped myself 5 years ago for asking that question.  Thanks</p>
