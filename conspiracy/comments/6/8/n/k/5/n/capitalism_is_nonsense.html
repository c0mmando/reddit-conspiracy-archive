        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, I will demonstrate a problem by using the example of a chair-manufacturing company. </p>

<p>Chair companies are unnecessary. Take all the money these companies have, without their permission and invest it into technology such as 3D printers to automate all of these jobs. It might take the free will away from the chair workers, but these people&#39;s job is a detriment to society and progress. It reduces the free will of endless future generations for which our current societal systems disregard, because they are focused individuality and selfish success at the cost of everyone else. </p>

<p>The chair company inhibits the free will of the future generations by forcing them to work for making chairs, by taking their money to buy chairs, by polluting the world with toxic factories, bringing the world closer to its end. </p>

<p>Revealing this problem via social media may prompt the corrupted companies to use their money to support their own survival, suppressing the free speech and political options of those with less monetary power. These companies will invest on covering up the corruption and deceiving people that their company is necessary. These chair companies do not deserve to be rewarded for their toxic applications to society. </p>

<p>Furthermore, their jobs are unnecessary because these chairs are likely being used for desk jobs in other corporations that are unnecessary as well. Oil companies using chairs for meetings, using their oil to promote people to drive to their meetings, to drive to their chair company jobs, to drive to their paper company jobs, their phone production jobs to telemarket their paper, investing in schools to teach you how to do all this,  to waste gas, polluting the world, furthering all of the problems. Paper companies used for documentation, political companies to regulate these companies, to regulate individuals who suffer the consequences of the corrupted society (someone robs a store because they are poor or stressed out). Then funding for therapy, drugs, alcohol to help the enslaved workers cope with their lives, under the false notion that they are seeking growth, progress, via competition, free markets, and capitalism as a whole. </p>

<p>With smoke and mirrors, corporations have found a mechanism of creating endless amounts of useless jobs to cater to other useless jobs, but in reality it is a system for farming humans for work and money that isn&#39;t necessary. </p>

<p>How cheap would it be to just live in a society with food, internet, and a home? No driving, no working. </p>

<p>The fact that an alternative energy source could replace gas, but that the gas companies rely on the money for their own sake, and that they have so much monetary power, proves an element of corruption due to capitalistic society. Society CANNOT move forward or grow, because of &quot;competition&quot;. When you say competition creates jobs, or incentives progress, you are deluded and just repeating what others tell you. In actuality, the working class only affords to live paycheck to paycheck, under the illusion of being rewarded for their hard work, but the truth is that they are functionally enslaved. They will work endlessly just to survive and get basic necessities. The time required for these jobs, as well as the draining aspects, eliminates any opportunity to rise in power. </p>

<p>Someone hating their desk job, browsing the internet, is thought to be proof that capitalism provides motivation compared to socialism? What about IRS tele-scammers? Is this a job necessary and profitable to society? How about useless plastic products that people are getting addicted to that have no purpose? Fun toys, useless tools, all this waste is incentivized by someone&#39;s necessity to survive and rise in power. </p>

<p>People never had motivation to begin with, they would rather be free and spend time on their phones all day, I bet. And so why are we creating the illusion that a competitive society is better? Or that it provides motivation? In actuality it provides a substrate to farm the working class for others who found a mechanism to abuse. Making addictive junk food products, starting cultural trends over useless boring plastic products like collectibles. Many people truly despise this lifestyle but are shamed for laziness or their lack of contribution, as if everyone must contribute. These are the people who are being enslaved. And of course they dislike it. </p>

<p>People are pressured into starting up useless businesses, building too many homes to sell, getting people fat to make more money, creating problems for drugs to solve, maybe even the depression induced by the toxic lifestyles we are forced into. </p>

<p>How many jobs are created to get people to work? For example, all the car related jobs to help people get to work, all the desks created for people to work, all the papers used to work, all the tools necessary for the jobs that help other jobs? This is useless, absurd. Capitalism is based on scam mentality at this point in time. And if you support it, its because you got scammed. </p>

<p>There is a lot of people who want a simple life, not to become the most rich or famous. How is this ever labeled as the motivation for big changes or innovations? There is always going to be a subclass of human innovators and these people can innovate if they want. If humans do not desire the changes, why do we justify the need for them by claiming that the system itself provides motivation for such? The reality is that the system helps innovators enslave others to bring their visions forward, but now these visions are required to be corrupt and there are people without visions who only desire power, abusing this system for their selfish sake, under the illusion that they are contributing heavily to a better society. </p>

<p>A solution to some things would be to make most things free, and use pure incentives of progress and a better society itself, rather than power or money to buy a yatcht. Make vegan food free, charge for non-vegan food since vegan food is much much less expensive to create, and because non-vegan food requires the input of loads of vegan food to feed the animal, we can just end world hunger by making veganism free. Then this would reduce the environmental issues caused by agricultural industries. </p>

<p>Allow robots to take over the working class, and incentives the robotic innovations and incentivize the lack of working because why would we ever WANT to work? Why do people think working is the end goal? It is delusional. Incentivize happier living, and all the methods for utopia rather than incentivizing personal selfish progress at the cost of everyone else. </p>

<p>Push for a government that is internet based. Eliminate the flowery complex language that is used in politics to deceive the viewers into voting for terrible ideas. </p>

<p>Everyone at this point, should resist society and demand rapid change, all of these things are very possible, especially if we focus on getting everyone sufficient free food and living. Make internet a necessity to living in society. Voting is necessary, education can be communal and we can teach each other and use the internet to teach ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By taking advantage of the vulnerable state of mass hysteria and induce it further than it already is from the Trump election. There is a real social vulnerability right now. The fact that people act publically angry is perfect. This dissolves their traditional group-think structures leaving them wide open for new ideologies and ways to justify their own feelings. </p>

<p>Take advantage of this and produce a radical movement before it&#39;s too late and society goes back into more distractions and mindless habits. </p>

<p>Use social engineering to mass produce a movement of paranoia and fear to further dissolve the power of the government. Find a real common enemy rather than distract yourself with fucking drivers on the freeway. Like what the fuck that is so fucking idiotic it&#39;s hard to understand. I bet you do that too. Like omg I&#39;ll just drive impulsively and aggressively because I&#39;m so paranoid and delusional that I must blame anonymous strangers for very specific events. Nah. </p>

<p>Too bad that&#39;s your best idea. It&#39;s pretty singular. Just name calling people essentially by their demographic without further explanation. And how does that fix anything? Perhaps your insecure about your lack of ideas. </p>

<p>Your just some idiot monkey with no ideas who uses overly simplistic means to express your aggression. The reality of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already seen tension from the working class and whites and other high class seeming citizens. Restaurants changed their behaviors too. Justifying more problematic employee behavior and sticking together like a team, judging the customers more now. </p>

<p>There is change already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know about the grammar mistakes. I posted this earlier somewhere else. There are some missing words in my OP. I just figured people are smart enough to not dwell on something so unimportant. I don&#39;t have much time to go deeper so I just copied and pasted. I am running late on many school tasks and some free lance projects right now. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied philosophy and actually I have many notebooks categorized by &quot;socio, psycho, ethical&quot; philosophies all with many entries discussing various topics. </p>

<p>But the reality is that people ignore concepts and focus on spelling and grammar rules as if that&#39;s what even mattered. </p>

<p>Actually, I can prove to you that grammar is not actually a factor in politics necessarily or the effect is very minuscule. Such as public speaking. I&#39;m not sure how you think spelling or grammar has such a massive factor to anything intellectual at all except to prove your ability to follow basically unnecessary rules that most people can slip by without noticing the differences. </p>

<p>And even for those who are too stupid to realize the difference of your and you&#39;re based on context alone, I&#39;m not so sure they will get anything from my writing. </p>

<p>Can you try to prove the significance of spelling and grammar without building some delusional straw man argument? Or maybe just admit that this is essentially inconsequential to most philosophical ideas and in most areas of life in general. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucking hilarious how often I get people worried about my grammar. How does it effect you? What&#39;s it like to feel stupider than your iPhone autocorrect? Your phone knows the words better than your brains ability to decipher. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not true but while we are making idiotic arguments that are irrelevant I figured I&#39;ll throw that in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time you make a spelling mistake, your audience is distracted; everything you create has attentional attributes and to communicate effectively is to make sure your point is known clearly. This is skill in producing any form of media someone else interacts with. If you don&#39;t put the effort into skillfully creating your message, no one will ever listen to you, because the standard set by consumerist structures will make any mistakes <em>glaring</em> and lower your credibility immediately.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just disregard it as others being XYZ. This is how things work. Don&#39;t mix up your idealized view of how things should be and how things actually are in reality, or you&#39;ll never make progress, simply complaining that phantoms don&#39;t exist. Act and act skillfully. </p>

<p>The fact that you put so much effort into this attack in this thread says a lot more about you than whatever you&#39;ve written. Try to work to the needs of your fellow humans, who are irrational creatures, and look openly, or you&#39;ll be ever happy to sit with your content ideas, that have never known the pain of coming up against the knowledge of others... I mean, you&#39;ll be right, but to little more than yourself. Maybe a simple &quot;learn to take criticism&quot; would be more helpful here. That is still your audience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment is very good. Thank you this is a somewhat persistent issue with me. It happens some days and I also can&#39;t think clearly consistently. Today I had an aura, possibly seizure or migraine and then after that I got all these ideas in a debate. I noticed my words were much worse than usual. I skipped many words. All day. I got tired. My vision changed. It&#39;s making me wonder if my instability could relate to unknown Epilepsy. I&#39;ve had symptoms like this in childhood but today is the first I caught it visually like this. Usually I just have bad days and I&#39;ll try to fix it with extra caffeine or meditation for hours or crazier drugs. </p>

<p>I am also yes lying. I&#39;m caught up in the aggressive atmosphere. The original post is sloppy and I make sloppy posts but usually I make references to more common ideas depending on the subreddit. I still get controversy but usually I can defend with studies and such. </p>

<p>This tho was kinda new. The epiphanies came as some grand thing as well. It blew my mind and it wrecked my day. I was supposed to work on projects but I got addicted to this idea and spent hours on it lol. Just arguing with people needlessly. </p>

<p>Later then I started regretting this idea thinking I&#39;m such a fool to get so hyped up. Then I started analyzing my whole life in a scope of resentment. I even got suicidal ideas(actually these are due to social conflicts and being sick of my daily life and daily recurring issues). </p>

<p>I try to make use of my crazy as much as I can. </p>

<p>Thank you for your writing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not too far off. The world is an exciting place. I get caught up in ideas very often, and they wreck me too; and I say things in the moment that I regret. To do so is human. We change moment by moment, just as everyone else. At least you are taking the challenge of talking about your ideas, opening them up to be attacked. That&#39;s more important than just keeping them to yourself. That&#39;s progress of your definitions and knowledge. You&#39;ll find plenty more big ideas that rock you (I hope).</p>

<p>This might be unrelated (and seemingly kooky) but I might suggest meditation. I had a lot of anxiety problems and depression; being able to connect with my own physicality, by spreading my conscious awareness over different parts of my body, has been a rewarding and focusing tool - and one that you don&#39;t need to buy, more importantly, and one that connects you to your self without the face of some middle-man inbetween.</p>

<p>Why should we let religious uneducated idiots have such a large impact on a non-religious highly complex reality?

    <div class="md"><p>You assume a lot of things. You assume scientists and intellectuals are infallible. You assume they will not make errors in judgement, or be blinded by their intellect and assume they themselves are infallible. You assume scientists would not be addicted to power, or abuse power. You assume scientists are, in other words, not human. You assume logic is the answer to everything. Question, whose logic? The logic of the ruling time? It was logical once that the Earth was the center of the universe. You are suggesting that logic is some kind of universal because logic gives us truth. But again, whose truth are we talking about here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intellects wouldn&#39;t be given power tho. There should not be &quot;different logics&quot;. Logic is one thing and some are trying to become logical. I&#39;m not sure we can argue that anyone is tho. But logic isn&#39;t much without facts. Logic can be corrupted without correct facts. Religion is like uneducated logic sometimes. Unfactual logic. </p>

<p>How can someone know there is consequence to eating junk food, and then still eat it, with no actual benefit other than to satisfy some mysterious feeling we think is good? That feeling is being abused to farm your money and ruin your life. Of course these companies will cover it all up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not debating the origins of capitalism, or that capitalism perpetuates itself in the modern age through various forms of direct and indirect violence, but again couldn&#39;t the argument be made that a properly ordered capitalist society in the modern day would not need to? In other words, we&#39;ve already butchered all the &quot;savages&quot; and &quot;tamed the land,&quot; we&#39;ve built the infrastructure and created the environment necessary to implement a true capitalist system and not one managed by the state in a way to benefit the rich.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>How cheap would it be to just live in a society with food, internet, and a home? No driving, no working. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t some people like driving? Don&#39;t some people like working?</p>

<p>One possible argument may be, &quot;Those people are conditioned by mechanisms of control created by the bourgeoisie! Who could possibly <em>like</em> working?&quot; To which the response would be, aren&#39;t you seeing a problem through your own biased lens?</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what you say, but to me this reads like my rantings in my first year Macroecon class having to listen to an old professor tout the glories of capitalism to me. Of course, when I actually read Adam Smith, to which this teacher often referred, I recognized that the teacher did not really understand Adam Smith. <em>Properly ordered capitalism</em> is fine. The end result of a properly regulated capitalist system is a world where no-one wants because everyone&#39;s needs are being met so that everyone can play a role in the market. The rich give back, they help the poor, because it benefits them to help the poor. When government steps in, when government takes tax dollars to do that, then that leaves the rich without an incentive to do what they are meant to do with their excess money. Instead, they buy frivolous things and only give enough to charities to look like they care.</p>

<p>You want more government, that is your solution. You&#39;re calling this and that toxic, you&#39;re saying people should not drive or work, you&#39;re declaring all of these things that, in order to exist, would have to be enforced by <em>someone</em>. And this is where your glorious vision begins to fall apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you proposing communism?</p>

<p>Fact is, a heck of a lot of work is required to make a functioning society. Homes, food and Internet for everyone? Then we&#39;ll still need electricity, dams, roads, farms, etc. Do you really expect big daddy State to provide all these things free with no strings attached?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe capitalism has all the answers- or indeed any of them. The question is, can we possibly get to the society you dream of without imposing tyranny on ourselves?</p>
