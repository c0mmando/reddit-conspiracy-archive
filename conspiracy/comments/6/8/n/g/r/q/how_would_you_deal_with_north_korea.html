       I would take the deal on the table where they abandon their nukes in return for the US no longer fucking with them. The way the US unilaterally bombs wherever, whenever they want makes nuclear capability almost essential for non-allied countries.

       I'm all for leaving them alone.  Near as I can tell they've never actually attacked anyone, and all they want is to sit at the big kids table (that is, they want to be a nuclear power too.). All of the rhetoric about destroying the west is because the west is holding then back from achieving equal standing as a nation.  If we left them alone, they'd have nothing to be pissed about.

       Take them over. Civilians shouldn't be treated that way in 2017. Execute your entire family because you don't mourn hard enough? Give me a break. People like that shouldn't have power of anything. Wipe out those involved calling the shots and reform. South Korea is almost a completely different world in comparison. It's heartbreaking.

       Drop leaflets on the border, loud speakers blasting messages and radio signals broadcasted from drones, that tell everyone in the army that if the army obeys any attack orders on South Korean positions, we will drop tactical nukes on their border positions.

       Leave them the hell alone, those guys have absolutely nothing going for them. We have the capacity to remotely shut down their system and have been doing so for years. How do you explain that they've successfully launched two satellites into orbit but they can't seem to direct a missile?

       Secondly, China can no longer be a supplier of goods to North Korea, point blank. China cannot dump the US dollar although they own 1 trillion of our debt, because they would collapse their biggest consumer. If China wants to continue economic growth they must comply for our demands of alienating the rogue state completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaving 2 choices for North Korea, they dump their Nuclear program or start a conventional war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, South Korea is at risk but the logistics of preparation by North Korea would be noticeable and the Pacific Fleet can devastate them in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangle China, and you forcr North Korea to either comply or starve. People revolt when face with starvation, look at Venezuela. It is at the brink of complete civil war.

       So your plan is to try and blackmail a nuclear power with the "threat" that if they shit on our currency catastrophically, it will cause lesser harm to them?  You realize China has been pushing jato SEA and South/Central America for the purpose of defusing that, right?  If the US dollar crashed AND we lost our major supplier for cheap consumer tech there would be people frothing in the streets (more than they are now).

       Leave them the fuck be.  Set up the anti-ballistic systems and leave them as is.  The one action I can recall them taking outside of their own boarder was the recent assassination of one of his relatives.  Hell, half of the human rights violations claims in NK are exacerbated by the fact that their ability to trade has been cut to effectively nil.

       I find it hilarious that half of the people here go on and on about "globalists", yet people will also advocate for the US doing what it does worst: go into a foreign nation, act like police, and leave the country completely fucked afterwards.  That really haven't worked since WWII.

       That leads us to muddy waters though, Russia has been very adamant that ABM systems by the US have shifted the paradigm of Mutual Destruction and are a coy by the US to render Russia nuclear power obsolete. Just paraphrasing, but such a scenario of more systems in the Korean peninsula coupled with NATO pushing closer to Russian borders might likely trigger an aggressive Russian response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia has publicly stated that the US is looking to encircle them and they have fantastic intelligence capabilities so if we continue to use North Korea as a means to set up and activate a defense shield around Russia, they will fire I believe.

       Honestly, I can't see that happening.  If they make any directly visible advances on the US, they run the risk of the US not ignoring the next time they annex land from a neighbor.

       Which begs the question, upon the US propping up regime change in Ukraine and the Russian annexation of Crimea, why didn't the US and allies react military? An expansionist Russia is the biggest threat to American Foreign Policy and I assume the hawkish DC establishment would have reacted unless in some way, they are concerned that we are not prepared, currently, for Russian aggresion (not that we can't win, but we would suffer heavy casualties.) My point being, it is obvious that we are working hard on missile defense shield because we are quite aware of how truly menacing Russia can be, which is why we've appeased almost as much as Chamberlain recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will Russia continue to let the US stack around its borders? That is the scary question
      </p>
      <p>
       P.s, I am a proud of American and my discussion in now way is anti-American, just simply trying to peek at the layers of the fuckery that is current international affairs.

       In fact, to reverse this reap-what-you-sow failed policy in the long run would require serious reconciliation and apologies from the U.S., in particular for 1950-1953 war crimes. This could culminate with a visit by future U.S. President Tulsi Gabbard to lay wreaths at the Pyongyang holocaust memorial in honor of the two million civilians the US bombed to death.

       Get some spies in there, find the coolest heads among the top military brass, and try to orchestrate a coup. Resulting government wont be great but it can't be worse than what they have going on now. Try find a Kruschev to the Kim Dynasty's Stalinism.

       Ignore them; then try 'diplomacy'. I think Kim feels that he's ignored; and doesn't realize WHY. Kinda sad I think.

       I'd send an agent (one man) to assassinate Kim Jung-un. Roll the dice and see if the next bozo is as stupid as this chubby runt. There must be somebody in Kim's household, or staff, or body guards, who wants to kill the little shit. Just promise them asylum in South Korea and a million dollars.
