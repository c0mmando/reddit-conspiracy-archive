    <div class="md"><p>honestly, it sounds to me like you&#39;re saying the exact same thing D3nverAirp0r7 and are for some reason associating his statement with &quot;concern trolling&quot;.</p>

<p>His statement is a bit more nuanced than yours (though perhaps naive) in that you&#39;re claiming there is NO anti-semitism whereas he is claiming that there IS, but that it is for the most part a foreign insurgency of sorts being used on this sub.  And I agree with him in that there is SOME, but it is overblown and heavily promoted by the trolls who are seeking to destabilize the ideas promoted here.</p>

<p>Anti-semitism is also defined differently by different people, and often depends on ones proclivity for &quot;defending the jewish people&quot;.  So the volume of sentiment here that could be seen as anti-semitic depends on your perspective.</p>

<p>Look harder, there&#39;s rampant anti-semitism from aged accounts in these very comments.  One can argue against that being the nature of this sub, but outright denial is silly.  If you mentally categorize every instance you see as a shill/bot, you&#39;re blinding yourself.</p>

<p>I mean all you&#39;re saying is all the Fed Chairs are Jewish! You&#39;re clearly not implying anything, like it&#39;s more than a coincidence. You just like pointing out interesting facts about Jews right? Definitely no anti semitism behind that.

<p>This is the problem with these discussion, I find. No matter how blatant the anti-Semitism (which means anti-Jewish, not &quot;against Semites&quot;, look it up) is, someone will always find some convoluted excuse to say that it&#39;s not actually bigotry.</p>

<p>How many out there get away with it every day? Let me be clear: I am not saying there are zero racists in this sub. There obviously are some here as well as some on many other subs, but they like to exaggerate how many are in here so that they can &quot;prove&quot; that this sub is very racist to others who may have an interest in reading the posts in this sub.

If you read the links I posted, it shows that a Jewish troll pretended to be an anti-semite on Reddit, and also wrote a piece on a white supremacist website claiming that &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; That article and the posts he wrote were then used by other people (and probably himself as well) to go around Reddit &quot;proving&quot; both that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for white supremacist recruitment and look at all of these racist things they say! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would it even matter what we look like?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if there are a &quot;bunch of racists in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot;, they can prevent others from looking at the content on this subreddit. Spend some time in other subs and when you find a conversation about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, you&#39;ll also find people claiming that &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment&quot; despite this being debunked, as well as people just generally claiming things like &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is so full of racists and anti-semities.&quot; It&#39;s a perfect tool to keep regular people out of this sub. </p>

<p>Just plain old pigheaded ignorance at work then. Or worse, they are promoting that ignorant thought.<br/>
It pretends that Germans and Japanese have not been in the front of historical research on the subject of WWII, in Germany it&#39;s a mini industry. Only reason more are not aware of this is that they write in German, not English, duh. The top English speaking historians specializing in the Western front all learn German. At the end of the day there&#39;s no excuse for &quot;Hitler Did Nothing Wrong&quot; , it&#39;s promoting Naziism, which is explicitly a hate filled nationalistic and racist system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think the Holocaust was exaggerated, there&#39;s pretty clear evidence that you&#39;re wrong but I guess it&#39;s possible. But if you think that it didn&#39;t happen and that the Holocaust was made up, then you might as well call yourself Harry Potter and carry a wand with you everywhere cause you&#39;re living in a fantasy world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The word holocaust didn&#39;t exist as it is known today until 10 years prior to World War II. It was reported in several newspapers printed throughout America that the Russians are planning to commit a holocaust on the Jewish community. They claim that Russians want to kill 6 million Jews.(this happened several times within this ten-year span) There are about 12 million Jews in the world at this time. So if you do the math, 6 million are in Russia, 6 million killed in Germany. Are you telling me that the entire Jewish population remained in Russia?</p>

<p>Anyways don&#39;t lump me in with controlled opposition. I&#39;m not defending Hitler. The SS is no different to me than the CIA. It&#39;s just easy to make the connection between elite Zionist and the nazis. The Nazis left Germany for dead as they fled to the US through project paperclip. The Israelis get a free pass to invade Palestine and steal the land that the Palestinians have lived on for thousands of years. Step one of greater Israel. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something to remember. I grew up in America and learned about the holocaust my entire life. I would have never thought about denying it. In fact I would have been appalled to hear someone deny it. My 180 stance will show you what a little reading and commonsense get to. </p>

<p>If you never went down that rabbit hole I suggest going. It would make everything that&#39;s going on in the world way more clear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this was said; I&#39;m on my way to work and tired but fuck it. The media and the left, love that calling someone racist discredits not only the argument but the arguer. Not to mention most people can say things like, &quot;Wow, I&#39;m not even going to continue this conversation with a  <strong>racist</strong>&quot; and walk away. </p>

<p>I think it was the first episode of Gavin&#39;s Free Speech Podcast with Anthony Cumia where they talk about just this in detail and it&#39;s kind of hilarious. But then again, the better Gavin&#39;s point, the funnier the statement usually​ is. </p>

<p>I was recently down voted like crazy when I said something about language and intention creating everything that permeates from a statement, not the subject matter. </p>

<p>I can talk about men, women, politics race, economic functions, food, entertainment, Islam, transgender issues, conspiracy, and whatever the fuck else I want, and if my opinion differs, guess what? I might not be against anything I see in my own light. </p>

<p>But to disagree is to be hateful in this overly thought policed world now. In that same episode of The Free Speech Podcast, Anthony said that we now police ourselves in how we think as to not ruin ourselves and all we&#39;ve accomplished, and that sort of blew my mind. I&#39;ve known it, I see it, but never heard it quantified so simply and actually paid attention. </p>

<p>My rambles are done.</p>

<p>I fucking love this place. Fuck everyone. We ain&#39;t racist. We ain&#39;t hateful. 
We&#39;re conspiracy.
It&#39;s a hive mind of opinion and empathy. If you&#39;re not interested in conspiracy, you&#39;re not too hip to the fact that theorist are here because they care about the world and the people beyond their own self. Its sad you have to be one to know such sentiments. </p>

<p>Stay strong, fam. ✊

    <div class="md"><p>In my view, this place is more than a warm, gooey, fuzzy-wuzzy hive-mind of opinion and empathy.</p>

<p>Racism does exist. Hatred does exist. It exists on this sub as it does everywhere.</p>

<p>To deny this dark side for warm, emotional, self-justifying feelings that assure one that everything is OK- this is to close one&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>I agree with you that discrediting tactics are used to shut off conversation. This is to be avoided.</p>

<p>But sometimes a criticism has weight and should not be brushed off because one feels oneself to be morally justified and in-the-right and impervious to criticism and other such participation-trophy forms of logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a LOT of racism and hatred by Jewish Zionists here, and all of it in defense of the right of the Jewish Zionists who run Israel to justify the continuing advance of their plan to expand the area of land they control and to remove Palestinians from the land they control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there truly that much pro-Israel rhetoric on this sub-reddit? I seem to encounter anti-Zionist rhetoric more often. For example, this thread is at the top of the pile. That seems pretty typical of the sub-reddit. </p>

<p>As to whether there is racism and hatred by Jewish Zionists in the world? Sadly I must say that it does appear to me to be the case. Yet there is violence and hatred on both sides of nearly every geo-political conflict. What about the US and its efforts to expand control? Or Great Britain&#39;s? Or Russia&#39;s? Or Iran&#39;s? Or China&#39;s?</p>

<p>The situation in Israel is tragic and complicated and from what I know both sides need to compromise. Yet it is the case that MANY states are founded upon violence. How can we criticize Israel and justify any other state that exists in the world? Why is Israel alone responsible for all the ills that every nation-state enacts? </p>

<p>I am 100% in favor of thinking of ways to mitigate tensions over areas of land, including for the Palestinians, the Golan Heights, etc. But a conversation along these lines cannot be had if one side is demarcated evil in advance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been here at reddit since very shortly after its birth.  I have accumulated over half a million karma under a few different names, having been shadowbanned completely once and having had my identity revealed a couple of times.  I do try to be 100% sincere and I will say that I very much appreciate this same effort from others.  It&#39;s not something that you or I would dare to expect 100% of the time, unfortunately.  </p>

<p>Israel is doing things which are illegal and which no other country does, hence my specific focus of wrath upon the Jewish Zionists who run Israel.  I also specifically reject any framing of what is going on in the land controlled or occupied by Israel which suggests equivalence - such as &#39;the conflict&#39; and &#39;both sides&#39;.  I reject this because I see no equivalence.  None at all.  I also reject any sanction or justification for the way the Jewish Zionists run Israel in the &#39;other nations have done it, Israel is doing nothing new&#39;.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not going to have a conversation, even if you are sincere, if you do not reject, on its face, the racist, apartheid laws on which Israel was founded and under which it oppresses the non-Jew Palestinians.   I will not abide by the embrace or acceptance of racism by any person, organization or state because it precludes the embrace of equal rights, opportunity and protection for all, without regard for race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, religion or origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate what you say about sincerity and indeed it is difficult to come by. My concern is as follows: you are talking about how you cannot &quot;abide by the embrace of acceptance of racism by any person.&quot; Yet you also speak of your &quot;specific focus of wrath upon the Jewish Zionists who run Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>You portray these Jewish Zionists as doing something which &quot;no other country does,&quot; there is &quot;no equivalence&quot; and you reject all &quot;justification&quot; based on comparisons to other countries. </p>

<p>What concerns me about these statements is that I think it&#39;s extremely problematic to describe one focus of wrath, and specifically take all the others off the table. The US has done many illegal things in terms of regime change. Discrimination along religious lines is practiced in many societies. The borders of many countries are established by violence. You speak of an unstinting admiration for &quot;equal rights, opportunity, and protection for all.&quot; Yet doesn&#39;t it seems that many, many, many countries fail to live up to these standards you have set? It is to my mind misleading to start a conversation that declares that Jewish Zionists are separate from all the rest of the world in terms of evil. That they are uniquely evil. To me this is a sign of anti-Semitic thinking, which I reject just as strongly as you reject racism. </p>

<p>None of this is to downplay the plight of the Palestinians. I don&#39;t know what the long-term answer is for the State of Israel if there even is one. However, it is extremely difficult to have a ground for conversation when one party is speaking about a evil that is uniquely attributable to &quot;Jewish Zionists.&quot;</p>

<p>My perception is that there&#39;s a lot of problems in the world, and many if not most nation-states have blood on their hands. I am extremely concerned with a logic that criticizes one of these nation-states and not any of the others. To me it is difficult for a productive conversation to take place when such logic is in place.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you probably have your own standards for what does and does not make conversation possible. This appears to be the rub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, I fully agree with you. That being said, my eyes are wide open when <em>SOMEONE</em> is pushing a racist shitfuck of an agenda. The thing is, I suppose, is that it doesn&#39;t change how I feel about this place as a whole. A few assholes trying to contort a forum into an echo chamber for their shitty views does nothing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Trumper or anything, but I see it sort of the same way as this sub: meaning when racists and dickbags used his statements and campaign/presidency as a way to justify their own shitty feelings. When someone who hates Jewish individuals sees people talking about a Zionist agenda, they pop in all excited.</p>

<p>&quot;Ohmuhgawwwww yehaaw they won&#39;t push me down! They hate the Jews too!&quot; </p>

<p>Once again, if I choose to talk about Black Lives Matter in a negative light, that doesn&#39;t mean I hate black people. But some people may see my public statements and glomb on to it in that moment. Doesn&#39;t make my original statement any better or worse. </p>

<p>Most times, prejudice is born of ignorance. And coming into this sub screaming &quot;The Jews are evil!&quot; Well that&#39;s the cream rising to the top. The ignorant who don&#39;t know the difference between criticizing an agenda certain individuals tend to hold and all other Jewish individuals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to explain my theory. I&#39;ll talk about Islam: If you know anything about Pre-Islamic Arabia, Arabs were pagans. During that time, sexism and misogyny was rampant in Arabia. Arabs would burry the baby girls alive to prevent bringing &quot;dishonor&quot; to the family name. Islam came through and put an end to all this. Now take a look at current day KSA. Women have no rights, can&#39;t even drive and are subjected to honor killings. What you are witnessing is exactly the way Arabs were before islam. They are Wahhabi&#39;s that follow a man-made &quot;reform&quot; of the religion. This &quot;reform&quot; that has infiltrated our religion and has managed to incorporate these pagan tribal values.</p>

<p>The same goes for Zionist. Do they practice Judaism? Not really. They believe in the Kabbalah and engage in practices of the occult. Many famous Zionist will admit that they worship Lucifer. </p>

<p>So yes, everyone should be judged individually but knowledge is also power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Jew. Hundreds of years ago, in Europe, Jews were called names by Gentiles and Jews just shrugged it off and moved on. I&#39;m not talking about the violent persecution they had to endure, but the jokes and name calling. Yet, Jews made no bones to let the European Gentiles know that they could not assimilate into Gentile society. (Jews can do business with Gentiles, but not assimilate) The Gentiles were the &quot;Nations&quot;, and Jews had to maintain their &quot;separateness&quot;; much like the Amish do. Jews knew this would bring ridicule, but what do you do? They lived with the ridicule. I&#39;m saying they liked it, but Jews hundreds of years ago were &quot;thick-skinned&quot;. They didn&#39;t give a shit what a Gentile thought of them.</p>

<p>But, with reform Jews, things have changed. It started in Europe, and this is especially true in the United States, Jews moving to the U.S. hid their Jewishness. They were ashamed of being Jews. They took on Gentile names and started dressing like Gentiles. The young Jewish men were having sex with shiksas; they were like kids in a candy store, much to the horror of their Orthodox, immigrant parents. </p>

<p>Today, Jews are paranoid and super sensitive to any criticism of anything Jewish because we have been brainwashed to be this way. I was raised on the holocaust, and the thought of going through what those poor souls had to do is frightening, to say the least. Any criticism of Jews is automatically linked to the holocaust. And yet, there is information on the net and books have been written that exposes Jews at the top have for lying about many things pertaining to the holocaust. In my view, these lies disrespect the memories of those Jews who did suffer and die at the hands of the Nazis. </p>

<p>People talk shit. That is a fact. To me, antisemitism is if you want to do physical harm to me and my family because I am a Jew. </p>

<p>If you want to call me names, go right ahead. But, you better be careful! I know Yiddish and I&#39;ve got more names than you can imagine to hurl right back at you! :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and its totalitarian regimes, usually socialist and fascists that have prosecuted and gone after Jews, because Jews in many cases have been more successful and therefore financially better off than them! </p>

<p>I think as you said we need to distinguish between anti semitism, which for facts sake, for reality sake, not all Jews are Semites and even if they were as long as its not belief than all Semites are evil or bad or half human, then its not anti semitism. </p>

<p>There are in modern days three different type of Jews, about a third of it is actually Semitic, in fact most of Palestinian are Semitic. So its just something that in today&#39;s culture and politics is not realized and understood and accepted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen top upvoted posts and comments calling Jews &quot;members of the Synagogue of Satan&quot;. I&#39;ve seen stickied threads claiming that Hitler did nothing wrong and WWII was a result of a mass Jewish conspiracy. I&#39;ve seen comments claiming that Jews murder Christian babies and drink their blood. I&#39;ve seen numerous posts claiming that there is a difference between Jews (not OK to hate) and Zionists (OK to hate) while in the same breath giving a definition of &quot;Zionist&quot; that applies to 99% of Jews over the last 2000 years. I&#39;ve seen Jews, the Jewish religion, Jewish people, and Jewish culture held up to a ridiculous amount of scrutiny and double standards not applied to any other ethnicity, culture, or national heritage. I&#39;ve seen Nazi propaganda repackaged and used to explain away why it&#39;s OK to be afraid of Der Jude. </p>

<p>So if you want to say that you personally aren&#39;t anti-Jewish fine. If you want to say that most people aren&#39;t anti-Jewish great. But to say that <em>no one</em> is anti-Jewish is a bold claim to make, especially in the face of so much counter evidence. Namely, people who are blatantly anti-Jewish making anti-Jewish comments and posts and getting them to the top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Address my comment, please. Don&#39;t try to derail the conversation by going off topic with a comment about Holocaust Denial. But to address what you&#39;re saying, my biggest issue with Holocaust Denial is that it supposes that 99.9% of Jews are completely untrustworthy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like linking to posts and comments because it leads to brigading. But <a href="http://imgur.com/a/F2rsh">here are a few choice ones</a>. Now, before you start fighting me and claiming that none of these are anti-Semitic, why don&#39;t you take some classic anti-Semitic (shut up, it means anti-Jewish and always had, Henry Ford and other notable anti-Semites even used it as a mark of pride, calling themselves &quot;anti-Semites&quot; to describe their hatred towards Jews) literature, like <em>The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>, articles from  &quot;The Dearborn Independent&quot; or &quot;Der Sturmer&quot;, speeches by David Duke, or just any old post on Dukes Stormfront website. I think we can agree that those would make a great baseline for what constitutes anti-Semitism, no? Then compare and contrast it to the comments I showed and tell me how they are any different.</p>

<p>&quot;Propaganda.&quot; Yeah, not everything you refuse to believe is propaganda. Not everyone who disagrees with you is paid to do so. You&#39;re not that special, and your ideas are not fresh or unique. Conspiracy theorists love to pretend like they know all the secrets of the world and everyone else is either a sheep or is paid to discredit them. The conspiracy theorist mindset is not a threat to the world. It&#39;s a fringe mindset, and it will always stay that way. The world is far more complex than the Bond villain, evil King in a castle, Hollywood movie ending world some of you clowns think it is.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/62nxah/proven_false_flags_against_rconspiracy_to_make/">Proven false flags against /r/conspiracy to make everyone here seem racist.</a></p>

<p>We already know for a fact that several &quot;trolls&quot; have been caught trying to make this sub seem racist by posting anti-Jewish comments. One of those trolls had dozens of usernames and posted tons of anti-Jewish statements on this sub and across Reddit. </p>

<p>How many out there get away with it every day? Let me be clear: I am not saying there are zero racists in this sub. There obviously are some here as well as some on many other subs, but they like to exaggerate how many are in here so that they can &quot;prove&quot; that this sub is very racist to others who may have an interest in reading the posts in this sub. This is how they keep people from questioning things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there truly that much pro-Israel rhetoric on this sub-reddit? I seem to encounter anti-Zionist rhetoric more often. For example, this thread is at the top of the pile. That seems pretty typical of the sub-reddit. </p>

<p>As to whether there is racism and hatred by Jewish Zionists in the world? Sadly I must say that it does appear to me to be the case. Yet there is violence and hatred on both sides of nearly every geo-political conflict. What about the US and its efforts to expand control? Or Great Britain&#39;s? Or Russia&#39;s? Or Iran&#39;s? Or China&#39;s?</p>

<p>The situation in Israel is tragic and complicated and from what I know both sides need to compromise. Yet it is the case that MANY states are founded upon violence. How can we criticize Israel and justify any other state that exists in the world? Why is Israel alone responsible for all the ills that every nation-state enacts? </p>

<p>I am 100% in favor of thinking of ways to mitigate tensions over areas of land, including for the Palestinians, the Golan Heights, etc. But a conversation along these lines cannot be had if one side is demarcated evil in advance. </p>
