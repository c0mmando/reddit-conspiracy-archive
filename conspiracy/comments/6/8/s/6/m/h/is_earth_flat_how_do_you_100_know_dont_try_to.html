       Alright. I already know what you all are gonna say. Im stupid for believing earth is flat. But how am i stupid? or an idiot? or whatever yall gonna call me. you believe what the scientists tell you. Im starting to think Hitler was onto something, "Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually everyone will believe". 
1. "make the lie big" - the earth is actually a sphere and we are not in the center
2. "make it simple" - almost everyone will say that Gravity is proof, that it pulls everything towards the center. Also, there is proof that Nasa has pictures of the earth where clouds are EXACTLY the same and just in a different place, kind of like copy and pasting, or they made clouds in a program and pasted it in the picture. When asked for proof that earth is round, many people say "Well if earth is flat, why dont we fall off". That is not an answer. 
3. keep on saying it - everyone is taught in school that earth is spherical, therefore we are raised to believe soemthing that we have for a fact never saw with our own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       alright, so im gonna talk about gravity first. Gravity is believed to be pulling everything downward, toward the center. but what if it only pulls things down. that would explain why things go down, as they would be the same motion on both theories. You might say that it does not make sense, but think how does gravity make sense ? how is there this force that magically appears once something is big enough. Why does gravity exist. how is there this force between EVERYTHING in the universe. it does not make sense at all. Once you can prove that it is 100% gravity, and there is no chance, not even a (1 x 10
       <sup>
        -1000000000000000)
       </sup>
       % chance that it could be soemthing, i will believe the earth is a sphere. 
Second, very very few people have been to Antarctica. "Why dont you fall off the edge if earth is flat. So what the perimeter of earth, is a giant ice wall. and alaska or the north part of the globe is actually just the perimeter of earth.
       <a href="https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=60894.0">
        https://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=60894.0
       </a>
       (link for a better explanation 
Third, we could POSSIBLY be living in a geocentric universe. We could actually be in the center. If we were in the center, then that must mean someone put us here, God. The bible even states Job 38:14 "The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.". this says that earth is the shape of clay ( think of molding clay) under a SEAL ( a seal is a ring that has a circle for its mainpart, like where a diamond would go, but its a flat circle). So if you were to take the ring, and press down with it onto clay, it will make circle have a "border-like" diameter. This supports my consideration that earth is flat and surrounded by a border, alsaka or the north , or the ice wall i was talking about. So this verse, as wel as many other verses, states that earth is flat, as it is compared to clay under a seal (ring). also, revelation 20-7-9 talks about Satan and the people battling it out on "the breadth of the earth". Breadth translated to greek is "platos" which means width, or overall just FLAT. so satan will rise to the width if the earth and battle. 
I also have some support that will make you think that the bible could possibly be real. 
(this next part im about to type doesnt relate to earth being flat, just backs up my claim that the bible could be real). 
Alright so have you ever heard of the four horsemen of the apocalypse? There is a Red, White, Black, and "pale" horsemen. Why are three horsemen colors and one is "pale". Pale in greek translates to "chloros" which means green, or pale. when translating from greek to english, they thought it must be a Pale Horse because they never saw a green horse. Well it actually should say the Green Horse, which is the rider of death. It says the the Green Horse has authority of one quarter of the earth. Well now you know that its the Green Horse. Islam's sacred color is green. And islam accounts for about 25% of the population (about 23% actually, but its not gonna be perfect). Do you think that this is just a coincidence? really? The bible also states that they will kill with swords, as does ISIS does alot of killings with beheadings or slicing the throat. 
This is just my belief that the bible is true. like how is soemthing like this a coincidence. please explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another bible verse that supports me is Psalm 19:4-6   it says that the sun moves in a circuit, or revolution, A CIRCLE PEOPLE!!!!! And what if the sun isnt as bright as we think? what if it only covers only a seperate part of the circle of earth at once. Also there are photos where it appears to be clouds behind the sun, as there would be if earths flat. simply just look it up. or go to the flat earth society website.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we really do live on a flat earth, and heaven is above us and hell is below us. what if we live in a "dome" and there might not be anything out there. regular citizens dont have any proof that earth isnt flat. They have resources they think they can trust, they have the government that could be lying to us, and all the sources they want, but they never actually saw the earth as a sphere. It could all be fake, it could all be true. but we will never know unless we for ourselves, every single person, goes into space ourselves. and just think, you know how easy it is to photoshop? to create fake "live" broadcasts? or even photos of planets or the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill make an edit if i think of any other supporting evidence i have, because its 530am and my brain is friend. 
ALL I AM ASKING IS DONT JUDGE ME OR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. REALLY DO THINK ABOUT IT AND IF YOU WANT, RESEARCH IT. theres really good youtube vids. whatever doubts you have, look it up and there will be an explanation. 
If you have any questions or wanna discuss anything about this message me. this really is a good topic to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I might have confused the Alaska / north claims with Antartica.
      </p>
      <p>
       AS I SAID BEFORE. DONT START SAYING IM ANOTHER PERSON TRYING TO CONTRADICT SCIENCE. no , im just really amazed that a whole society believes this. And everything i am saying that supports this theory is just stuff i saw in videos. i just wonder iff it could actually be possible.

       The opposite is also true. Polaris, the southern star, is visible in Sydney and not NY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually Polaris being seen in the same spot from Australia, Southern Africa, and South America doesn't work with the flat Earth map. According to them directly South from each of those places is a totally different point in space separated by thousands of miles. Polaris cannot exist in the Flat Earth model.

       Firstly, if you do believe it and this isn't part of the psy-op to discredit this sub: starting off with "I think Hitler was on to something" is never a way to open discussion with any one. Regardless of what your beliefs are on Hitler, which there are interesting accounts and stories, I don't personally believe either side and think the truth lies in the middle, you immediately will activate a rejection because of cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly Hitler never said that one of his generals did.

       Yes you are doing the same thing , rejecting what could possibly be the truth. I am not saying the earth could be SPHERICAL (i fucking hate people saying its round when they mean spherical, a circle is round)

       You can show yourself the earth is a sphere all on your own without any scientists.

         Find a friends somewhere else in the world.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Agree to Skype or FaceTime or whatever.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Agree to simultaneously put a stick in the ground pointing straight up.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Measure the angle and length of the shadow cast by the stick from the sun.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You will see the length of the shadow will be different, showing that your two locations on earth are not on a flat plane but on a curved sphere.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Get friends at different locations on the planet to duplicate the experiment, you will notice that the length and angles of shadows will follow a consistent change, which you can pretty easily see is because we're on a sphere.  Some parts of the planet will be in complete darkness, showing that we aren't on a dome that is all lit simultaneously.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Hypothesize why this is.  If we were a dome, why are some parts in darkness rather than just on the edge of something falling into an abyss?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is the sun really close and tiny and orbits the Earth, allowing for the light to cause the angles on the flat earth?  By using the angles and lengths of shadows, you should be able to come up with how close the sun is to the earth and how small it is.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assume since you're doing this test using satellites to move data that they're probably orbiting something spherical.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Come up with any other theory that would explain the differences in shadows from your friends.

       A shadow will still appear in a clockwise motion. Go look at how the sun will travel on a flat earth. on a  flat earth ; if it was daytime where you were as well as someone 500 miles away, the shadows will appear to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you try and explain a process, go look up on the flat earth society whatever question or anything you think that contradicts this claim , because if certain stars were to only be seen in the north, why do people still believe that earth is flat???????????

       All this stuff confuses me, and I believe that the truth is probably somewhere in the middle with everything in life. But with NASA and space, no matter what they tell us, it's so we somehow don't figure out there's a high orbit military base up there. That I feel sure of.

       lol no. some people say that it is about the same distance away as the moon, and it is smaller than we think. all we can do is believe what NASA and other space programs release. look at the pictures of earth taken from outer space. the continents are different sizes in proportion to the size of the earth, and a NASA worker even said it is photoshopped, and he adds color to the sea and he erases the clouds then puts them back in.

       that could support the claim that earth is a sphere, but it can also have an explanation. if you really do have questions or counters to the claim that earth is flat, go google (such as) "flat earth why are there seasons". as there would be an explanation for this, and it really does sound reasonable.

       Do you believe in God? If you do, you were probably raised believing there is a God. And say someone comes up to you and says there is no God, here is my evidence. Yet you still deny there is not God, so you believe there is a God. That is what is happening here. your only supporting evidence os that, quote on quote, "Flat eathers are fucking idiots that deny the evidence that doesnt suit them". So therefore your saying no G/god is real. Dont be a dick just because people have their own opinion. people like you are the real assholes. foh

       Do you believe that it is just a coincidence that the moon can cover the sun exactly during a solar eclipse? damn man. theres way to many coincidences that are just too hard to believe. explain how the universe created a solar system, and inside the solar system is a planet, which has a moon that, from perspective from earths surface, can completely cover the sun with just a slight edge of sunlight that isn't covered. explain to me how gravity works and prove it is. prove that earth is really not flat, that the elites didnt make up this, and also how it could possibly not be density we experience instead of gravity.

      <p>
       So the "elites" started 300 BC when they mathematically showed a heliocentric universe and a spherical Earth, mind you, centuries before Christianity even existed?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have to ask what the precise goal of these "elites" are.  And I assume "elites" is code for "nerds who do math and other weird things".  I mean, I'm all for follow the money, but there was mostly not a lot of money and power in challenging religious superstition that the moon is made of cheese and the oceans spill out into the ether.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the motivation of this group of, apparently millions of people to claim something that, apparently, also works enough that any country with a basic space program can utilize it successfully?  I mean, any country with ballistic missile technology seems to waste an awful lot of money using a spherical earth to strategic murdering one another.  Because that's all that's left after some fairly easily understood math can be drawn out by Iron Age astrologers is for flat earth believers to show how they're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the moon doesn't cover the Sun entirely, you still have a corona, which is why you see that nice ring around it, and it blinds you when you stare at it.  If it covered it you wouldn't even see a sun.  It mostly covers it, which means it's imperfect, i.e. not magical, so it's just a nice coincidence, if it was magical it would be perfect.  But what it does do is show the sun is further away than the moon, which means to support the sun being close argument, you have to support the moon being close as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since we're speaking of moons and gravity, how does the flat earth handle tides?  They occur very predictably world wide in sync with the moon, which apparently orbits a sphere, and drags the oceans around with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gravitational attraction of the moon causes the oceans to bulge out in the direction of the moon. Another bulge occurs on the opposite side, since the Earth is also being pulled toward the moon (and away from the water on the far side). ... Since the earth is rotating while this is happening, two tides occur each day.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does a flat earth handle tides, the moon, and the measurable increases and decreases in the tides as supported by a spherical planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I gave detailed instructions on how to prove the Earth is a sphere.  I have yet to see any argument, scientific or "made-up-nonsense that would discount it, not without making up more assertions such as "the sun is like 5' away, that's why shadows look different", which would require some degree of proof on the flat side.

       You flat earth people are all the same. You want somebody to convince you that your asinine theory is wrong, yet no amount of rational thinking, logic, or reasoning will change your mind. You get called out on it, given reasons why the shit is stupid, and start trying to belittle the people who respond. How the fuck does a person who legitimately is tricked into believing this horse shit have the audacity to try to belittle anybody.

       lmao i clearly stated that this is just what i gathered. Im not asking for clarification or anything , just want to see what other people think about the subject. 
No im not tricked , i believe the earth is sphere. but it could also not be. its called doubt. Just say you believe in god. sometimes, wont you doubt him? you would doubt hes real. exactly my situation here. I heard people bring the subject up and its cool how people believe this. and they got shit to back em up. What makes you better than them? lmao seems like half the people who comment are assholes and cant help but criticize what people believe.

       you "sphere earthers" are all the same. you never give a chance to open your mind and accept the possibility that earth could be flat. you try to shut us down by saying we're uneducated, crazy people, yet all the sources i got my info from have a very detailed explanation on why they support their claim. all you have is what you been taught, legally by the government. and who sounds like the one whos trying to "belittle" people? i clearly stated that i took this claim into consideration, not saying i dont think earth CAN be round, because phenomenons do happen, but i have yet to find any information that directly proves it. i will also say i have yet to find all the information i need to say i believe that earth is flat. it is a consideration. yet you still have to try and make an argument that where you have nothing to backup your claim. go find information and reply to me, or just keep being a fucking asshole and get the fuck out of here.

       Then we could go into radio communications and triangulation, weather patterns, southern hemisphere flight times, satellites,  actual photos/footage of the earth from space (which all you flat earthers seem to deny the existence of), there is even a live feed from the ISS.

       Psalm 19:4-6 - a circuit is not a Circle in this verse. It means a connection of the sun's warmth. It is poetic... saying the sun rises and sets should not be taken as science fact. This was long ago.

       We do not live in a dome. The amount of work it would take to hide this is insanely unjustified. What I'm suggesting is that is is both much easier just to photoshop out the occasional ET spaceship, and less of leap of logic.

       I appreciate your interest in learning hidden truths. There is so much being hidden. This planet is a prison, but not for the reasons flat-eathers are saying. It's a massive cover-up of a negative ET manipulation. Once we are free of this obstacle, there is a are galaxies upon galaxies waiting for us to explore.

       I've seen videos of pilots being asked if they account for the curvature of the earth and they say "No, the computers do that for us"

       Then when asking the the companies that produce the compass on the planes they replied with "No, it's completely mechanical and doesn't take in additional calculations".

       First off the compass in an airplane doesn't have to compensate for the curvature of the Earth. All it does is indicate the direction of North. It does it exactly the same as every compass. It's magnetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more to navigating an airplane than just knowing which way is North.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me that you should just take the pilots word on this one.

       Why does the railroad have to compensate for the curvature of the Earth? They lay track according to the local geography. If they can lay a straight track they do. Biggest things that they have to plan for is changing and how they're going to have to make crossings of rivers and mountains.

       "One surveyor, Mr. T. Westwood, wrote into the January, 1896 “Earth Review” magazine stating that, “In leveling, I work from Ordinance marks, or canal levels, to get the height above sea level.  The puzzle to me used to be, that over several miles each level was and is treated throughout its whole length as the same level from end to end; not the least allowance being made for curvature.  One of the civil engineers in this district, after some amount of argument on each side as to the reason why no allowance for curvature was made, said he did not believe anybody would know the shape of the earth in this life.” "

       The definition of "level" is a line perpendicular to gravity. As gravity always points to the center of mass, on a sphere gravity will not be pointing in the same direction. This means a "level line" on earth will not be a straight line, but will follow the curvature of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that line is always the same distance from the center of earth, it will be the same level line, even though it circles the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This surveyor you talk about may not understand that simple concept, but that doesn't mean it is not true.

       Yes i would. im not saying its not possible gravity is real. but when you look at every option, it sounds like it is possible that gravity could just be density of the oxygen that the earth has. or something along those lines. I never really understood how ever the universe was made , that it was strong enough to make a force that pulls things together. it just doesnt sound reasonable. and again, not saying it cant be true, just that it could be something else that makes us go down towards the ground.

       Why is the bible quoted as evidence? Not only has it been translated through many different languages over 2 thousand years and the one worshipped isn't even the same as the original testament. It had been revised by Constantine and other bishops within the order. Religion has always been here to be taken advantage of by elite members of society to warp our tiny brains.

       I am saying it could be either. there is obviously evidence for both claims. but we will never know unless we go to space ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the word was flat, i think the elites are trying to hide whatever is past that wall. maybe if the world was flat, the ice wall could go on for thousands of miles, or their could be other things we dont know about. the point of this post is that we do not know, and will not never know, what earths shape is until we go see for ourselves.

        Gravity is believed to be pulling everything downward, toward the center. but what if it only pulls things down. that would explain why things go down, as they would be the same motion on both theories. You might say that it does not make sense, but think how does gravity make sense ? how is there this force that magically appears once something is big enough. Why does gravity exist. how is there this force between EVERYTHING in the universe. it does not make sense at all.

       No, gravity is just the name given to "curved space-time". Every mass, no matter how small, curves space-time. This curvature is what we perceive as a "force" pulling us toward the center of a mass.

       A way to think of it is to imagine a thin, very stretchy, rubber sheet with different sized ball bearings on it. A ball bearing the size of a bowling ball will stretch the rubber sheet downwards creating a conical indentation. If you place a small ball bearing the size of a marble on the edge of that indentation, that ball bearing will fall down into the indentation towards the larger one. It will look like the larger ball bearing is pulling the smaller one down, but in reality they are both "falling" into the indentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how science explains gravity. There is no "force" between the two ball bearings, they are both "falling" into curvatures in space-time created by the presence of their mass.

        Once you can prove that it is 100% gravity, and there is no chance, not even a (1 x 10-1000000000000000) % chance that it could be soemthing, i will believe the earth is a sphere.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'll turn that around on you... how about you try to describe any other mechanism for what we call gravity? There is no doubt at all that what we call gravity exists. So what is
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       explanation for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't explain it without referring to magic, then we'll just have to assume that the current theory is correct.

       And what if it's not? You have zero evidence for the existence of this ice wall, and I have plenty of evidence that it doesn't exist. No one has ever claimed to have seen the ice wall you're talking about. There are no images of it. Nothing. Even if I accept the possibility that the evidence I have is faked, that still does not provide evidence for your theory.

       Well, I'll give you that... Science says the sun does move in a circle... around the Milky Way galaxy.

If thats so hard for you to take into consideration, why was it so easy for you to believe Gravity is real, yet there is no way to prove it exists. there is no way to prove that it is DENSITY also, unless we go see for ourselves what earth looks like and stop listening to what NASA, who had an employee say they photoshop images of earth, tell you.

       Time zones. You can easily Facetime somebody in a different country, and see that it's a different time of day. If the Earth were flat, you would clearly be able to see the sun in the exact same place, everywhere on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people have tried to hand-wave this problem away by saying "It's directed like a spotlight and it spins" or some other nonsense, but think about it. Assuming a flat Earth, there is zero rational reason as to why the sun would be directly overhead where you are, yet be on the horizon during sunset for somebody in Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, there is the problem of gravity. Gravity ALWAYS pulls towards the center of mass of an object. Doesn't matter what the shape is. It ALWAYS pulls towards the center. This is backed by a TON of experimental evidence and math.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth were a disc, gravity would still pull towards the center. Which means, if you were to walk out to the edge of the disc, gravity would be pulling you
       <em>
        sideways, along the ground
       </em>
       . The further south you went, the harder gravity would pull sideways. Anything near the North Pole (including Greenland, Canada, and Russia) would be tens of thousands of feet underwater because the same rules would apply to seawater.

       In your model the sun would always be visible or if you don't think that is true for whatever reason you must concede it would change size noticeably as it moved relative to your position on the flat surface. Might I suggest you visit a public astronomy observatory to examine this conspiracy up close, perhaps you will meet people who are in on it and are actively lying to you about the shape of the solar system for their paymasters the spherical earth scammers who stand to profit and gain from this immense lie.
