    <div class="md"><p>The best point is that the supposed conspiracy is so deep and carried out by every single government in the world that you can just deny every single piece of evidence against flat earth and say that it&#39;s just a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Everything is a fish eye lens so it that&#39;s why it looks curved! If the horizon looks curved from an aircraft whatever window you looked out of was rounded to give you that appearance!</p>

<p>Send up a weather balloon with your own, non fish eye lens to capture actual video evidence that the earth is flat? No way man, TPTB would just shoot it down! And you know if they didn&#39;t NASA would probably just hack it anyway and put in their own fake footage! No point in looking for actual evidence!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling#Radiative_cooling_on_Earth.27s_surface_at_night">radioactive cooling</a> and it is very simple science. When you create the &quot;moonshadow&quot; as the flat-earther experiments like to call it, you are creating a buffer in between the thermometer and space. When an object is covered by whatever you use to make the shadow, it radiates less of its heat into the night air, and it will become warmer than an object that doesn&#39;t have that buffer.</p>

<p>This is why on a cloudless night near freezing a car exposed to outer space will accumulate ice, even if the ambient air is above freezing. But a car parked right next to it under a car port will not accumulate ice</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a good question. </p>

<p>The basic thing to keep in mind here is that the rays of the sun are obviously much more powerful than rays of light that first bounce off of the moon then back to earth. During the daytime the suns rays warm the earth far more than any effects from radioactive cooling would. </p>

<p>To put this into perspective in very simple terms (as I am not a scientist, it is just a hobby) suppose there is a 20°F difference between night and day. Naturally you can conclude that the sun rising caused this change in temperature. Well, in all these experiments with moonlight and showing a warmer temperature in the shade the difference in temperature is about 2°F or less.  During the daytime the suns heat is far greater than the effect you would get from radioactive cooling, as more heat is entering the atmosphere than escaping it.</p>

<p>At night the moonlight only reflects the sun rays, which does actually give off heat but a very minimal amount, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/10/us/surprising-scientists-full-moon-is-found-to-play-role-in-warming-the-earth.html">around .03°F</a>. The .03°F effect that you get from the moon is less than the 2°F effect of radioactive cooling, so objects under cover at night retain their heat better</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start with the obvious, which is that this lens has some <a href="http://imgur.com/a/5gmVf">very obvious curvature</a>. Either that or it is conclusive proof that the earth is concave!! But the fact that the horizon is quite close the the center of the frame (which is generally what you want for the least amount of distortion) and is so concave already really does the flat argument a lot more harm than good.</p>

<p>Normally I would prefer to do the same sort of comparisons at the highest elevation possible in the video, but <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Afiex">the clouds make it difficult</a> to actually see the horizon in this video, so I was not able to properly observe curvature</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. I&#39;m not saying it is easy or inexpensive to find a wide-lens with very little distortion at those kinds of altitudes. I&#39;m just saying look at the video you posted with the perspective of someone who thinks the earth is a globe; at a fairly low altitude, where I would expect the horizon to look flat, it is instead very noticeably concave (and I haven&#39;t seen anyone push a concave earth theory yet). Then, higher up, the horizon looks even flatter, despite the fact that we can observe the camera has a concave distortion. That would more support that the earth is round rather than the earth being flat</p>

<p>Now while it is incorrect to say &quot;tesla didnt believe in sphere earth&quot;, it doesn&#39;t really matter either way since that isn&#39;t my point. Lots of brilliant people believe stupid things. Tesla believing something is not a reason to believe it yourself; you should ask why he believed it and look in to his reasoning.

<p>False. The Suez Canal is at sea level along its entire length. This means that no locks are necessary because a ship will not be raising or lowering its elevation.</p>

<p>The only reasonable explanation to this I&#39;ve seen so far is:</p>

<p>&quot;The earth isn&#39;t a perfect sphere, long stretches of &quot;straight&quot; land do occur&quot;, and I agree in theory. Except, in reality, every test I&#39;ve come across (be it in written or video form on youtube) seems to have this lack of curvature, from places all over the world.</p>

<p>Of the few I&#39;ve specifically seen debunked, the explanation is either the above (not a perfect sphere, so <em>some</em> places will lack curvature) or shitty experiment. I have yet come across someone who offers evidence that curvature was measured (independantly) through lasers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Friendly noted, though that&#39;s not exactly what I meant with lack of visual curvature.</p>

<p>We all know the Earth <em>looks</em> flat from ground perspective, and I assume you&#39;dd indeed have to go a long way up to potentially notice it. I&#39;m particularly interested in pictures (or videos) of far away mountain ranges, especially if those mountains have a known height.</p>

<p>The idea is that you look at the relation between the peaks of the mountain from your current position, and how each mountain would have a different amount of &quot;drop&quot; depending on how far away they are from you. This is especially meaningfull when all 3 mountains are (sort of) in a straight line. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inCRZzfP-7A">As an example</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s various other youtubers, aswell as several forums where people did similar tests. (in relation to far away mountain ranges and their expected drop on the horizon) From what I&#39;ve seen, the curvature is just <em>never</em> there.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not really about measuring the horizontal curvature, it&#39;s measuring how much far away objects &quot;drop&quot; on real pictures, and how much  they should drop according to our ball model.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a flat earther by the way, I just gave the FE a fair chance (years ago, before all this shit went mainstream, though only recently became more heavily invested in it) and across the 1000&#39;s of hours I&#39;ve invested into this stuff, some things simply stuck. </p>

<p>My point was that when people ask for points in favor of flat earth they usually don&#39;t include something that fits in extremely well with the globe and heliocentrism, so I was wondering if the OP meant something else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I don&#39;t appear to be at the center.  If I were to stand at the north pole, it would make sense to see the stars moving around in perfect circles above me, with the north star at the center, straight up.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not at the north pole.  The north star is much lower in the sky, as is the circle I&#39;m looking at.  If the stars were moving in perfect circles, shouldn&#39;t I see them at an angle?  Being so far away, their perfect circles should look like ellipses.</p>

<p>We know they can&#39;t be that high up, we can use trigonometry to calculate the height of the north star (when it&#39;s 45 degrees in elevation, you&#39;re about 3000 miles away, so the north star must be 3000 miles up).  Therefore, we know this effect should be really noticeable, particularly close to the equator.  Why don&#39;t we see it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying that a square doesn&#39;t have equal sides?  Trigonometry exists to build buildings, it just so happens to support the globe model.</p>

<p>If you take a square, and draw a diagonal line across it, you cut two of the 90 degree angles in half.  This makes a right triangle with two 45 degree angles.  The two shorter sides, since they came from a square, MUST be the same length.  You&#39;ll notice I didn&#39;t mention anything about the size of the square used, because it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s apply this to the north star.  One of the corners of the right triangle will be me, standing about 3000 miles away.  Another point will be the north star.  We can complete the triangle by drawing a line straight down from the north star to the ground.  This makes the very same 45-45-90 triangle we worked with earlier!  Since the north star is 45 degrees up, we know that the two legs of our triangle HAVE to be the same length.  This is about 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re telling me a circle doesn&#39;t have 360 degrees, or a triangle&#39;s angles don&#39;t add up to 180, or squares don&#39;t actually have equal sides, I don&#39;t understand what part of trigonometry is wrong.</p>

<p>In other words: Where is YOUR evidence!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep this handy to Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V</p>

<p>If day and night are caused by the globe&#39;s constant, and even, rotation, towards and away from the sun, then why isn&#39;t half the ball light and half the ball dark for equal lengths? And why isn&#39;t the transition fairly instantaneous?</p>

<p>We&#39;re taught that Mercury and Venus are in between us and the sun, but if we&#39;re facing away from the sun at night, how is it possible to see these &quot;planets&quot; at night with a telescope?</p>

<p>If we&#39;re really spinning and orbiting the sun, which is also orbiting something else, and Spaceship Earth has been flying in a random direction this whole time, why don&#39;t constellations change? Ursa Major has been referenced as early as Homer&#39;s Odyssey and if you live near the center of our circular plane you&#39;ll be able to see it in the exact same way tonight. And how would it be possible to have such a thing as a &quot;North star&quot;? Looking at a timelapse of stars, most noticeable when looking at Polaris, and keeping in mind constellations (and what the Bible says if that&#39;s up your alley, oh and what Tesla said, both in reference to a firmament), it&#39;s identical to what the flat earth model shows of stars attached to a rotating dome, and it takes a lot of mental gymnastics to equate what you&#39;re seeing to an animation of the solar system you supposedly live in. </p>

<p>How is it possible for the Nikon P900 to zoom in on things so far away, particularly at sea level? Countless examples. We&#39;re taught that ships disappear hull first because of the gradual curve of the water, but modern technology including cameras that see further than our eyes, and laser levels, have proven water doesn&#39;t curve over a 20-30 mile length (duh, it&#39;s water) so when does it curve? How do you explain extremely flat areas, like states like Kansas (it&#39;s not even the fattest state) and salt flats where they test race cars?</p>

<p>Why is there no consistency between pictures of Earth from space? Across time and between countries these clearly CGI images look complete different, in color and country shape/size. Space agencies, and globe-earth defenders, openly say they&#39;re satellite composites, but that&#39;s ridiculous considering how many HD pics we have of Pluto. Some pictures are reused for future yearly pics  (with different clouds), there&#39;s one official Earth image with &#39;SEX&#39; hidden in the clouds (Disney much?), cursors have been left over images, and there&#39;s uneven saturation in many photos, a clear sign of Photoshop. The only genuine go-far-back and snap-a-pic pictures we have of the ball Earth are from the moon landings, which were completely staged. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was theoretically advanced enough to fake globe earth pics, released 1968.</p>

<p>Satellites went from science fiction to science fact in 2 years, thought up by a Freemason. The computer representation of how many satellites surround the ball Earth doesn&#39;t match reality, namely, we don&#39;t see them pass over the moon&#39;s light (more on that in a bit). The materials satellites are supposedly made out of would melt at the temperatures the atmosphere supposedly is at their altitudes. </p>

<p>On several occasions NASA astronauts and Obama said humans can&#39;t go past L.E.O., they spoke of the difficulties of getting humans and computers to survive the Van Allen Radiation, but we went to the moon 40 years ago? </p>

<p>There&#39;s official NASA footage, from 1983, of a space ship flying in space, found in their online archives, but in the background is a human man&#39;s head for a few seconds before he hides from the camera again. Obviously, it wasn&#39;t a real space ship, it was a scale model, passed off as real. </p>

<p>Like the RHC Peppers said <em>Space may be the final frontier but it&#39;s shot in a Hollywood basement</em> That&#39;s far from the only FE reference in media.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no consistency between space agencies, and amateurs, of how high up you have to go to see the Earth curve and for the horizon to not raise to eye level. Amateur weather balloon footage with a standard lens, that goes twice as high as a commercial flight, has the same view as on a plane, or on Mt Everest, or on the shore, is all the same: flat horizon that always raises to eye level. There&#39;s no photographic evidence of a spherical world but there&#39;s plenty of video showing a flat motionless world. </p>

<p>Freemasons and pseudo-scientists like Neil Degrass Tyson say the Earth is an elliptical spheroid or pear-shaped, but their fake pictures are all perfectly circular. </p>

<p>Flight paths better match the FE map than a globe. There are no direct Southern hemisphere to Southern hemisphere flights, and emergency landings covered by MSM include: Indonesia to Los Angeles stopping because a woman&#39;s water broke...in Alaska. I could go on about planes, and will soon</p>

<p>The sun and moon appear the same size, think eclipses, because they are the same size. It&#39;s not a coincidence that their sizes just line up like that, it&#39;s all a ridiculous story we all believed when we were young. Do you trust the government enough to buy that coincidence?</p>

<p>We&#39;re taught that moonlight is reflected sunlight, but spheres like the moon would be poor reflectors, it wouldn&#39;t have the same reflection on the ocean as the sun, and its properties would be the same as the sun, not different; moonlight lowers temperatures making objects in the shade at night warmer, testable at home with an IR thermometer. Bottom line, and what Toby said in The Office, &quot;Moonlight isn&#39;t sunlight&quot;. </p>

<p>Why would they lie to us for 500 years? How? It&#39;s to hide intelligent design and free energy. This is the one conspiracy, that if spread, will have a domino effect revealing TPTB </p>

<p>If day and night are caused by the globe&#39;s constant, and even, rotation, towards and away from the sun, then why isn&#39;t half the ball light and half the ball dark for equal lengths? And why isn&#39;t the transition fairly instantaneous?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The earth doesn’t spin perfectly aligned to the sun.  Because of this tilt, the part tilted toward the sun will be illuminated longer than the part tilted away.  Shine a ling on a ball, as it rotates perfectly vertically. If you raise the light above the ball, the top part will receive longer “days” since it stays in the light longer, and the opposite will happen on the opposite side.  If you lower the light, the reverse happens.</p>

<p>We&#39;re taught that Mercury and Venus are in between us and the sun, but if we&#39;re facing away from the sun at night, how is it possible to see these &quot;planets&quot; at night with a telescope?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they’re not visible all night.  It has to be fairly close to sunrise or sun set before either of these objects can be seen at night.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we&#39;re really spinning and orbiting the sun, which is also orbiting something else, and Spaceship Earth has been flying in a random direction this whole time, why don&#39;t constellations change?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The do, but only a little.  You have to keep in mind the scale, and some things about the formation of the galaxy.  Things aren’t simply moving around in random directions.  Because of the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk">accretion disks</a> work, things in our galaxy are generally spinning in the same direction.  As an analogy, race cars are moving at well over 100 miles per hour, but can still stay in very close positions relative to each other, because the difference in their speeds is basically 0.  Couple that with the sheer scale of the things we’re talking about and we see a low difference in speed combined with unfathomably large distances.  This means that the constellations will change, but only after a great deal of time.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain extremely flat areas, like states like Kansas (it&#39;s not even the fattest state) and salt flats where they test race cars?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Flatness when you use it is different than when basically everyone else uses it.  When a surveyor or professional calls Kansas flat, they mean it differs very little from a sphere.  Uphill on a sphere means moving away from the center, downhill means moving toward the center.  These are curved, but it’s much harder to measure than you think.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How is it possible for the Nikon P900 to zoom in on things so far away, particularly at sea level?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that every flat earther tries to use the equation “Eight inches per mile squared” but they have no idea what that actually means.  It’s an approximation (approximations are great, they make the work easier), but you have to understand what it’s approximating.  It assumes you’re looking out from sea level.  That is, your camera’s lens should be halfway submerged into water when you take the picture.  If you rise up even a few feet (like standing on a beach) suddenly the approximation loses all meaning.    Any time you see these photos, the person is usually standing by a road, or on a dock, tens of feet above the water.</p>

<p>If you make up equations that have no bearing on reality, of course observations will contradict them.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is there no consistency between pictures of Earth from space?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.metabunk.org/sk/globe_comparison_with_distance.jpg">Three pictures of the same globe</a>, all taken at different focal lengths and distances.  You see, people never include the actual information you’re need about the camera to understand what you’re looking at.  Changing how zoomed in you or, or the focal length of the camera and distance, can radically alter the look of the image.  Unless you know both the distance and the focal length, you can’t really say much about how large something should or shouldn’t be in a picture.</p>

<p>Also, did you know basically every digital image taken in human history is a composite?  Your digital camera, as well as the one in your phone have only ever taken composite photos.  Even the photos of Pluto were composites.  The problem is, I don’t think you know what the word composite means.  While many photos of the earth are separate images that were later stitched together to form a complete view; others were simply red, green, and blue images that were laid on top of each other (like EVERY digital camera does).  Now with satellites like DSCOVR and Himawari 8 you can see hundreds of live images of the earth every day!</p>

<p>The materials satellites are supposedly made out of would melt at the temperatures the atmosphere supposedly is at their altitudes.</p>

<p>Ah, careful about your thermodynamics!  You’re confusing temperature and heat.  Sure, the temperatures in the thermosphere can be thousands of degrees, but that energy is spread over a handful of molecules.  If you were to spread that over a few trillion, trillion molecules, it would be negligible.</p>

<p>On several occasions NASA astronauts and Obama said humans can&#39;t go past L.E.O., they spoke of the difficulties of getting humans and computers to survive the Van Allen Radiation, but we went to the moon 40 years ago?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I too have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlXG0REiVzE">that youtube video</a>, and you’re taking the quote WAY out of context.  The current capsule designs, with current funding, can’t get out of LEO.  The person was talking about event within his own generation, not something that happened well over a decade before he was born.</p>

<p>As far as the Van Allen belt, that’s actually really interesting.  You’re probably imagining it as a sphere around the earth, but it’s more of a doughnut shape (toroid, if you want to impress your friends).  That means that you can avoid it by heading up over it or down below it, which is what the Apollo missions did.  Since the moon is orbiting the earth, it’s possible to crunch the numbers and get a very good idea of where it will be when your space ship arrives, making an approach somewhat outside of the orbital plane much more feasible.  However, in the video you’re citing, they’re planning for a mission to mars.  Now, going around the worst of the radiation isn’t as possible, as the margin for error is so much smaller.</p>

<p>Basically, you’re comparing apples to oranges, then you’re confused why they’re different.</p>

<p>You’ve grossly misrepresented the model you’re trying to debunk.  You’ve set up a strawman, and argued against that in your reply.  Of course the model doesn’t match observations: no one claims those things to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must be a SciFi fan, we are too, but it&#39;s all fiction and I think you&#39;re under some cognitive dissonance. You&#39;re on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so you probably think you&#39;re open-minded, and think you&#39;ve seen the bottom of the rabbit hole. But you&#39;re on Reddit so you could be conditioned to be athiest-ic, and know-it-all-already-y. That&#39;s a dangerous combonation, because you could be a part of a religion and not know it. You got good grades in elementary school through high school, you understood and and still understand the planet you were born on, case closed. You heard about the theory that outer space isn&#39;t real, that the only place to live is Earth and the only intelligent life are humans, aka: the Flat Earth theory. (Before you go crazy on &#39;theory&#39; being in the title, I&#39;ll remind you the big bang ____ and ____ of human evolution, and you&#39;re holy grail, gravity, are all theories still. There&#39;s debate among globe-heads about whether or not to classify gravity as a force). The phrase &quot;Flat-Earth&quot; has been internationally corrupted to sound stupid, and you already settled the matter in elementary school, so yeah, 9/11 was an inside job and Neil Armstrong was on a sound stage, but no, you <em>know</em> outer space is real. To tell you outer space isn&#39;t real would be like trying to convince an evangelical that God isn&#39;t real, because NASA is your religion. You didn&#39;t address all of what I wrote, you were pissy, and your attempt at a debunk can be refuted, right now. </p>

<p>For 3rd-parties following along I hope you see there&#39;s a shadow of a doubt on all sides, nothing&#39;s settled. Maybe the only way you&#39;ll all wake up is 50 years from now, nearing the end, and realizing why there are really no moon colonies even then yet. China wants to go to the moon next year, Trump wants to send a man to Mars by the end of his term, but none of its gonna be real. Buzz Aldrin never left Earth, he&#39;s an indoctrinated liar. I feel for people who died of old age in the early 70s, thinking their grandkids would retire on the moon. </p>

<p>If I asked 99% of America what caused day and night, they would say the spin of the Earth. To that I say, that would make half of the ball day and half night for equal lengths. You can put your fingers in your ears and shout &quot;axial tilt axial tilt&quot; to ignore your common sense and to buy into what your TPTB Approved Elementary Science Book told you. In summer day can be 16 hours and night 8 hours, and vice versa in Winter. Makes no sense on a globe, perfect sense as a local sun travels between the Tropic of Cancer and then Capricorn. Speaking of the sun&#39;s path and the real cause of seasons, the season&#39;s explanation makes no sense on a globe; we all bought it because we learned it young. Relatively small changes in distance and angles make our 4 seasons? Summer is when we&#39;re further away? If we&#39;re going around the sun, and every 6 months we&#39;re on opposing sides of the sun, why are stars the same? </p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t the climate and natural wildlife comproable at reflecting latitude and longitudes? Antarctica couldn&#39;t be more different than Santa Claus&#39; home (accepting outer space isn&#39;t real is the adult version of Santa). The middle of the ball without an axial tilt, the equator, is hottest, but that completely ignores the tilt. The solar system has a lot of flaws, NASA has been caught faking space several times, and the flat earth model reflects what we see. Wake up</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, I started with the obvious flaws (I can&#39;t believe I ever believed the heliocentric model) and you tried to ignore them but let&#39;s get into it. How do you think it&#39;s possible to see Mercury and Venus while facing away from the sun? There&#39;s a word for what you were trying to say: the terminator line. Are you saying it&#39;s only possible when your part of the ball recently crossed the terminator line? That makes no sense, one km past on the night-time side and you couldn&#39;t see the sun&#39;s inner valences. It doesn&#39;t matter though, because Mercury and Venus have been seen in the dead of night. </p>

<p>The sun appears close because it is close. It&#39;s seen amongst the clouds, there are sun spots on the top of clouds underneath the sun, and crepuscular rays easily trace back to something local. This is where cognitive dissonance will come in, to explain it away, to say it only <em>looks</em> like the sun is thousands of miles away, not tens of millions. Well sorry to say, the convex shape of our atmosphere, over a sphere world, would make the light concentrate to a point. To break the light up in the way we actually see sun rays, you would need a concave lens. Furthermore, the moon seems local too when you see the blue sky behind a moon&#39;s &quot;empty&quot; side. Through the moon and on the blue behind the moon, on rare occasions (once in a blue moon <em>rimshot</em>) a star can be seen through the moon (think Turkey&#39;s flag), proving the moon isn&#39;t the kind of thing that can be walked on, as if it&#39;s unique, self-emitting light wasn&#39;t enough. How Neil A didn&#39;t get burned to death against the moon reflecting all that sunlight, we will never know. Point being, the sun and moon are close, and the same size, obvious in eclipses. Again, do you really buy that huge coincidence? </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about stars. Here&#39;s how they work, and how you can observe them in your life. They&#39;re attached to a rotating dome, the dome (firmament) spins faster than the sun so every 24 hrs you can view the stars 1-degree to the side of where you saw them the night before. Example: I come home from work every day at 11pm, and Orion&#39;s belt is straight over my window as I walk in, then the next day after work at 11, I go home and Orion&#39;s belt is nudged to the side of where I saw it the night before. In a week, I&#39;m coming home at 11 and Orion is off to the right of my house and in a year it&#39;ll be back over my window. That&#39;s what I mean by FE being observable, besides mountains in the distance not leaning back, water staying level, no movement of any kind detected. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain a little more about the 8&quot; rule for curve. If you Google how much the Earth curves, they&#39;ll tell you 8&quot; every mile which is only half right. If point A to point B is 1 mile there is (supposedly) 8&quot; worth of curve in between, and if B to C is 1 mile there&#39;s also 8&quot; of curve there. But what about A to C? It&#39;s not 16&quot; worth of curve, nor would there be as little as 200&#39; from A to Zed. At 26 miles you would expect twice as much curve in order to match the size the Earth. For more on this, here&#39;s <del>Olly WillIams</del> a blog that goes in depth with the why&#39;s and how&#39;s and the maths: <a href="https://thenarrowgateweb.com/2016/08/27/look-around-it-will-astound-you/">https://thenarrowgateweb.com/2016/08/27/look-around-it-will-astound-you/</a></p>

<p>As scary as it sounds, humanity is alone in the universe. It&#39;s just us, and we&#39;re essentially in a Truman-Show atrium, and surely we have a Creator. Sorry Atheists reading along, I didn&#39;t want consequences either but surely there&#39;s a God. Thats why TPTB have worked so hard hiding it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yikes, there&#39;s a whole lot in here that just straight up ignored what I typed.</p>

<p>Firstly, you clearly don&#39;t understand what I mean when I say axial tilt.  If the point where the sun appears directly overhead isn&#39;t at the equator, you will ALWAYS have days that aren&#39;t exactly 12 hours day and night for most of the planet.  You&#39;ll need some kind of diagram or something to explain your point of view, because there&#39;s clearly some kind of miscommunication here.</p>

<p>But, let&#39;s pretend you&#39;re model is correct.  By that logic, the sun should never set!</p>

<p>Suppose that it is the equinox.  On the flat earth model, that means the sun is directly over the circle of the equator.  Now, let’s calculate the sun’s altitude.  At 45 degrees latitude, at exactly noon, we measure the angle to the sun.  If you have an accurate measurement, it will be 45 degrees.  If we draw a line from where we are standing, to the equator, then to the sun and back to us, we’ll have made a nice right triangle.  Since one angle is 45 degrees, we know the other is as well.  That means that the distance to the equator from where we are standing MUST be the same as the distance to the sun from the equator.  Incidentally, that’s a little over 3000 miles.</p>

<p>Now, let’s pretend, at the same time, we have another person in Antarctica, making the same measurement.  But they’re going to wait until their local midnight.  This means the sun will be on the opposite side of the equator, its maximum distance.  It’s about 6213 miles from the north pole to the equator, so we can triple that distance to get Antarctica to the opposite side of the equator, 18639 miles.  But, we now have another right triangle!  Let’s just plug in what we know in <a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">this</a>   handy calculator and find out the angle to the sun.  Side b will be the 18639 (the observer to the far side of the equator), and side a will be 3000 (the height of the sun).  Angle A will represent the angle to the sun.  This is the LOWEST the sun will ever get for that point, since we waited until local midnight.</p>

<p>I got 9.14 degrees.  To give some context, the width of your fist at arm’s length is about 10 degrees.  That means the sun should be no less than a fist’s width above the horizon at all times for the equinox.  For basically every city in the world, it should be MUCH higher.</p>

<p>TL;DR: the law of perspective would prevent the sun from ever setting on a flat earth.</p>

<p>To continue, you&#39;re claiming that Venus and Mercury are viable in the middle of the night.  Do you have ANY evidence of Venus being seen more than, say, 3 hours after sunrise or 3 hours before sunset?</p>

<p>Crepuscular rays look <a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2011/11/crepuscular_rays_from_space_10-18_2011.jpg">parallel to me</a>.  The problem is, you&#39;re looking at them as they go off into the distance.  This would be like saying rail road tracks converge.  However, if you measured the angle within each beam of the ray (like with a group of people), you&#39;d get basically exactly the same measurements from each beam.</p>

<p>And stars!  If they really had circular paths, it would make sense for them to appear circular at the north pole, with the north star directly above me.  But I don&#39;t live at the north pole.  I&#39;m looking at the stars at an angle.  Their perfectly circular paths should appear to be ellipses to me.  But they appear perfectly circular to everyone on the planet at the same time, just as they would on a spinning ball.  We can also use similar math to what I posted above to see exactly how distorted the perfect circles should be, but I&#39;ll leave that to you.</p>

<p>Lastly, you use the eight inches per mile squared again, and again you use it wrong.  It does nothing to account for the height of the observer! Even a few feet of height dramatically changes what you&#39;ll see over large distances.  Just a few feet of elevation can eliminate tens of feet that would otherwise be obscured by the curve of the earth.  You&#39;re using the equation incorrectly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m desperately trying to understand your model, but I keep seeing things that are either internally inconsistent, or that contradict basic observations I can make from my own front yard.</p>
