       For anyone who thinks NASA is benevolent  I ask you to seek out their recorded solar wind data. They record 6 numerical values that measure various parameters about the sun. They only archive the measurements every 5 minutes, they do this to prevent people using the data with machine learning techniques (Artificial Inteligence) to correlate solar wind to any other phenomenon. The fact that their is 5 minute intervals in the measurements make the data useless. NASA gives no exscuse as to why they cant archive this info. Assuming each  numerical value is stored as 4 bytes, they could record every second for years and store it on a cell phone.

       NASA distrust just became trendy in the X files days. I think if they found life in space they would be shouting it from the hilltops. I have never seen credible evidence they faked anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the angle for them in lying to us. What do they gain? Once again you come back to the X files shit, that they have secret alien technology they are hiding or whatever. Or they are hiding ET because it would crush world religion. None of the reasons people give for NASA lying really make any sense to me. I don't know, maybe I am the only one here, but I don't think the moon landing was a hoax staged by Kubrick. Finding aliens is their job, if they did I don't think they are even capable of keeping it under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you distrust NASA? And for the record I totally don't trust the government because they have a long and easily verified history  of lying. NASA is an agency for gathering scientific data, they are the good guys....

       If Earth is all there is there is no option to go to Mars and live there. That seems like the most ridiculous idea of all to be honest. We need to stop destroying this planet and using Mars as a backup plan.

       Now you're changing the conversation. You never asked me to prove we've been to the moon, all I can say about that is, if you have a telescope you can see the reflectors placed there for yourself. You said it was a giant waste of money and I was giving examples of things that came from that "waste."

       And your qualifications to make this decision that potentially effects all of humanity? You seriously don't think it's an idea even worth investigating?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in complete agreement it shouldn't be seen as a way out, but there's only the potential for growth, why would you not see what can be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if only to learn how to better do things on earth. That is a lot of what they do. I.e. growing food in a way that requires a ton less resources

       It's just a lot of things aren't starting to make sense and it seems like we've been lied to about so much already I don't know why this would be different. Not trying to convince anyone of anything but just make them question some stuff.

       Sounds like we're on the same page then. I'm not saying we should blindly accept everything that anyone says, NASA or not. I just don't see how NASA would benefit from misleading the public for so long about much of anything.

       The space landing conspiracy is just weird man, so many things that leave you scratching your head. I actually think we did go to the moon but I think all the footage is fake. I think the VA radiation belts would have destroyed all the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another thing people always ask is why haven't we went back since? I think money is a huge issue that gets glossed over very quickly when discussing this. I could be wrong and someone please correct me, but didn't NASA have an enormous budget and support from the government in those days? Now for them to get any kind of funding it's like pulling teeth. If it's not for Defense, the govt. is like nah, more bombs.

       The best ways to avoid its harmful effects are:

      <p>
       Reduce exposure
      </p>
      <p>
       Build shielding

       It's not about trusting NASA exactly. I suppose you mean in regards to the moon landing, which I do believe happened. Just because I believe that happened doesn't mean I trust anything NASA does. The moon landing was a very public initiative, but I think nearly everything else about their activities in space are something like a limited hangout to cover for the real goings on of the secret space program.  I think the goals and discoveries of the space program are completely hidden from us, as is the nature of reality. They went to the moon and something told them don't ever come back. Shoot, NASA's roots in Operation Paperclip and the 3rd Reich make me wonder if we actually have been watching the Nazi space program all these years. And I certainly don't trust the goals of that. But that doesn't mean they didn't go to the moon, just means we don't know what their actual objectives were and what may or may not have been discovered.

       I distrust NASA because they've failed to invest in technologies that could dramatically change the world for the better. For the cost of their annual budget ($30 billion) they could build a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop">
        Launch Loop
       </a>
       , which would take launch costs from $2000/kg to as little as $3/kg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even better would be an
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring">
        Orbital Ring Space Elevator
       </a>
       , which for about $400 billion would let us deploy payloads for around $1/kg. In addition, it would allow us to connect tethers from solar power satellites directly to the ground. This would let us produce power for less than 1 cent/kwh.
      </p>
      <p>
       If sold at 15c/kwh (a discount to worldwide average electricity costs of 17c/kwh), the satellites would pay themselves off in 1-2 years, and the market is well supported for massive increases in capacity at very modest cost discounts (i.e. drop the price even 1-2 c/kwh and demand increases massively).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, this means that every dollar invested into solar satellites would return at least 50% annually. So, invest $5-10 trillion over a decade, and you'll have enough money to pay the entire federal budget. We could pay off our debt entirely within a few years, abolish taxes, and eventually have a basic income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, NASA is a fraud.

       Pretty much what I was going to say. What would/do they get from lying to us? Motive on the government's side is usually pretty obvious, but maybe we're missing something here.

       The space landing conspiracy is just weird man, so many things that leave you scratching your head. I actually think we did go to the moon but I think all the footage is fake. I think the VA radiation belts would have destroyed all the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another thing people always ask is why haven't we went back since? I think money is a huge issue that gets glossed over very quickly when discussing this. I could be wrong and someone please correct me, but didn't NASA have an enormous budget and support from the government in those days? Now for them to get any kind of funding it's like pulling teeth. If it's not for Defense, the govt. is like nah, more bombs.
