    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, there is so so much. It&#39;s a bit of a contextual thing, where the more you know about the whole body of conspiracies, the more you can piece things together and arrive at a conclusive educated theory. I do believe that earth is a spherical planet, the surface-volume ratio principle makes a lot of sense, is a common occurence in nature, logical, etc. And yet there is no curvature. I think the azimuthal equidistant is the real map of the world, Antarctica might be a continent like every other or it might in fact be the ice ring. However I believe there&#39;s more behind it, more ice, more water, more land. More continents. When Jean Claude Juncker talks about the &#39;leaders of other planets&#39; infront of the EU parliament, he&#39;s not talking about Kang and Kodos, but about the leaders of other neighbouring continent-clusters like our earth. Nasa is a complete hoax, the moonlandings were a huge psyop and all of what we get to see in film and v-fx techniques is already 15 years behind tech that the CIA and Nasa have access to. Remember that the soviets invented photoshop and were faking pictures for propaganda purposes as far back as 1930. Kubrick invented many techniques for the moon landings that later turned into matte painting and front screen projection. This is where if you aren&#39;t quite up to date on the moon landings you might dismiss my logic because I&#39;m building an argument ontop of the assumption that they were faked. You need to understand the context in order to be able to even listen to the flat earther arguments. Anyway, sorry for long post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a golf ball. It&#39;s round, but there&#39;s flat circular bits on its surface. That&#39;s kind of what I believe the earth might be like. Over a large enough spherical surface, irregularities even out to the point where parts can have little or no curvature. The tiny land cluster peeking out of a body of water that we call earth is flat, and yet the planet is round. This is pure speculation though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched dozens of hours of youtube videos and read loads of articles about it but I&#39;m still a round earther (or whatever we&#39;re called). Sure, some of the videos make some good points about stuff that the average person can&#39;t test, but there are too many holes in the theory.</p>

<p>Simple things like direct flights in the Southern Hemisphere (which flat earthers claim aren&#39;t possible) disprove the theory. And when you explain that to a flat earther they always have some weak argument like the planes used in the Southern Hemisphere aren&#39;t normal planes, or they stop replying (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/68s6mh/is_earth_flat_how_do_you_100_know_dont_try_to/dh0xjzy/">see my comment history</a> for an example of this)</p>

<p>My biggest gripe is; how many people would have to be in on the conspiracy to make it work? It would literally have to be millions of people. And for what? Why would so much effort be put into hiding the fact that the earth is flat?</p>

<p>In my opinion, most flat earthers are scientifically illiterate sheep who are easily fooled by youtube videos</p>

<p>I wish there was a good onion of conspiracy about the earth and space that wasn&#39;t flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I coined the term Marblegarchs out of boredom trolling the ISS live feed awhile ago. I love to entertain any theory long enough to be entertained, and flat earth is juicy, even if it&#39;s factually inaccurate. As I said before, the moments when flat earthers noticed fucky details, they were right to notice them, but they definitely ran in the wrong direction. </p>

<p>Granted when you watch something that doesn&#39;t push flat earth so much as it tries to explain that we&#39;ve been fooled,  and not how we&#39;ve been fooled, it&#39;s very interesting and compelling. Like, The Principle for instance.</p>

<p>The Himawari 8 is a Japanese weather satellite. It&#39;s in geosynchronous orbit above the western Pacific and takes a picture of the entire Earth every 10 minutes. These images are available online and go back to July, 2015. You can view them here. <a href="https://himawari8.nict.go.jp/">https://himawari8.nict.go.jp/</a></p>

<p>WHERE ARE THE SATELLITES?</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t we been over this? They&#39;re too small to see in these photos. Satellites are going to generally be smaller than commercial passenger airplanes. Would you expect to see airplanes flying around in these photos, too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because none of this stuff is very big.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth. They travel at speeds up to 17,500 mph, fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft. There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger. There are many millions of pieces of debris that are so small they can’t be tracked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of this stuff is the size of your coffee cup, or smaller. You would have to be very close to it for it to be visible at all.</p>

<p>But you also have to understand how vast space is, even in the neighborhood of Earth. Think about how small a commercial airplane looks when it&#39;s flying overhead. That airplane is only about 30,000-40,000 feet up. That&#39;s six miles to eight miles away, and it&#39;s already just a speck in the sky. Its con trail is really what makes it most visible to the naked eye. If we&#39;re generous, we can probably only expect to see things the size of a plane if it&#39;s within ten miles.</p>

<p>Now consider how large the Earth is. It&#39;s about 8,000 miles in diameter. It&#39;s about 25,000 miles in circumference, and about 200,000,000 square miles of surface area. If we were to spread out 20,000 airplane sized objects around the surface of the Earth, you would have about one of these objects per 10,000 square miles. That means that you would be on average about 100 miles from your nearest piece of space debris. If you can barely see an airplane at 10 miles, how do you expect to see it at 100 miles? Now consider, most debris is much smaller than that. Of course pictures of space are empty. There may be thousands of bits of junk up there, but it&#39;s spread out over very large distances.</p>

<p>This is not specific. This is very vague. What aspects of the images tell you that this is &quot;bad cgi&quot;? Can you point to better examples of CGI renders of the Earth?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are two years worth of images. You can jump to any date and time you like by clicking on the calendar icon at the top of the screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so let me ask YOU... What about the Himawari photos is realistic? Please be specific</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though you still haven&#39;t answered my question, I&#39;ll humor you.</p>

<p>For one thing, you can see artifacts from how the camera takes pictures. These artifacts are not the kind of thing you would expect to see in computer renders. Specifically, the lens flare when the Sun passes behind the Earth shows how the satellite is scanning the Earth in horizontal stripes from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>When the sun passes behind the Earth, it is travelling from left to right across the view of the satellite. As you follow the lens flare from the top of the image to the bottom, you see abrupt interruptions where it shifts to the right. This is because in the time it has taken the satellite to record one horizontal stripe of the photograph, the sun has moved across the frame slightly, and the lens flare in the next stripe is offset.</p>

<p>Second, these are photographs of real weather. You can go look at specific Pacific cyclones from the past two years and compare them to the historical record. You can also do that with more mundane historical weather data.</p>

<p>Here is a site similar to the Himawari website. It&#39;s from the DSCOVR satellite. This satellite is not in geosynchronous orbit like Himawari 8, rather it&#39;s at the L1 Lagrange point, so it has a constant view of the sunlit side of Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/">https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/</a></p>

<p>This site also has historical data that you can access by clicking on the date. The cool thing here is that you can compare the images from the two satellites. Go to any date and look at the DSCOVR images of the western pacific and compare them to the Himawari 8 images.</p>

<p>That&#39;s caused by the atmosphere. When you&#39;re looking at the center of the disc, you&#39;re looking through the atmosphere perpendicularly, which means you only have tens of miles of gas to look through before you can see the surface. As the surface turns away and becomes more parallel to the line of sight you&#39;re having to look through a whole lot more atmosphere, so you see a haze.</p>

<p>It&#39;s similar to how slices of carrots <a href="http://cookwitholga.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_3113-1024x768.jpg">cut on the bias</a> are a lot longer than carrots <a href="https://media2.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/hj21UdV9SL83FIsDMxDK3-zgn7A/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2012/02/07/2/192/1922195/57d382257ae30d7b_coincut.jpg">cut in perpendicular slices</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>all the land masses are a uniform brown.</p>

<p>They&#39;re really not. There&#39;s a lot of texture in northern Africa, and you can even see the Nile river delta. Central Africa where there&#39;s a lot of jungle is very green. The southwestern US is rather brown, but the southeastern US is quite green.</p>

<p>What should they look like, in your opinion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it would be easy to reproduce better these days. look at how realistic the moon from earth shot looked in comparison.</p>

<p>What makes the video of the moon look &quot;real&quot; but the images of Earth look &quot;fake&quot;? What would a &quot;real&quot; image of Earth look like? Can you produce one of these &quot;better&quot; fakes that you keep referring to?</p>

<p>Now, please bear in mind, every time you&#39;ve asked for images, I&#39;ve provided them. This is the second or third time I&#39;ve asked you to provide examples of &quot;better&quot; fake images to demonstrate how the images I&#39;ve linked are apparently cheap fakes.</p>
