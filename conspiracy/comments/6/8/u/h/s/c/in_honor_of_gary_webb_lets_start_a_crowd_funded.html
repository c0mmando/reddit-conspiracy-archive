       I have an interest in both Journalism and conspiracies, so naturally investigate journalism has always been a passion of mine. Of all the explosive stories in the 20th century (Sinclair's "The Jungle", 'Woodstein's' Watergate investigation, 2013 NSA disclosure, etc.) one story has always stood out and that's Gary Webb's investigation into the CIA affiliation in the crack-cocaine epidemic. The truly shocking aspect of the entire ordeal was the mainstream's media vitriol reaction to Webb's story and intent on destroying him (imagine if the media has scrutinized the Bush administration like they did Webb).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other intriguing aspect is the similarities between the 80's crack epidemic and the present Opioid crisis:
The CIA (an organization with a terrible record) being very active in a region (Latin America/Middle East, specifically Afghanistan) on the basis of a threat to nation security (communism/terrorism) followed by a drug epidemic that just so happens to include a drug from that region (cocaine/opium).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I bring this up is because I have always frequented this site, but I was personally (and probably others too) invigorated by the recent 4/26 events with the amount of details and effort that was put into gathering, sifting, and interpreting all the information. If this sub reddit takes that same amount of effort to another cause such as investigating the Opioid crisis, not only could we come up with some solid evidence, but while the mainstream media was able to persecute Webb, they can't kill an entire sub reddit investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't know truly where to begin, other then searching wikileaks so any suggestion an help would be thank full-time.
Lastly, RIP Gary Webb (1955-2004)

          In Guilty Plea, Purdue Pharma to Pay $600 Million. The company that makes the narcotic painkiller OxyContin and three current and former executives pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused.  Company sales officials were allowed to draw their own fake scientific charts which showed a lower addictive potential, which they then distributed to doctors.

       I'm not sure I understand what the conspiracy part of this is, it's not like crack  was given as medicine in the 80s. It's just abused medicine, now, just like americans abuse all drugs.

       People are not forced, but desperate pain drives people to try anything for relief. Then they become addicts....now the pharma company has created an addict who returns to acquire the drug on a regular basis. The more the patient is prescribed the more profit for the stock holders and CEO and sales reps. The more kickbacks or bribes are awarded to the prescriber. The idea is to addict them and profiteer off of them. Doctors are complicit too.
