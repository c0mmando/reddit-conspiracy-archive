If OPEC didn&#39;t sell their oil for dollars, the dollar would collapse. So, that is why Washington kills people who don&#39;t want to use America&#39;s counterfeit money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you stick by what the Constitution says, it is counterfeit money. Only Congress is allowed to coin gold and silver, or to print paper. The Federal Reserve System is owned and controlled by Wall Street and international financiers. They print and control America&#39;s money supply, with no one overseeing what they are doing.</p>

<p>Not really. Gold has physical properties that make it useful. For example, it&#39;s use in electronics alone would create a demand for it. Its value as a currency is based on perception, but unlike &quot;paper money&quot;, gold does have real intrinsic value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weirdly enough, Bush II said it best. America is addicted to oil. We have to make the dealers happy. North Americans try to manufacture our own, and the Saudi&#39;s lowered the price. They have the cheap good stuff.<br/>
By refuse the petrodollar, I guess you mean that they would accept other forms of currency for oil. That&#39;s a loss of control. How the fuck do Americans get the other currency? Is that a better deal? Is our US currency really worth what we think? It forces us to reconsider our assumptions about American power and wealth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the best question I&#39;ve seen here in a while...</p>

<p>Due to the petroldollar we can basically print unlimited money because other countries need massive foreign exchange reserves in order to purchase oil.  This means that we can continue to print and export all of that inflation around the world, where it can&#39;t come home to roost.  This in turn has allowed us to run virtually unlimited deficits to fund all of the programs, welfare, food stamps, bailouts, medicare, wars, etc. that saddle the American economy with entitlements.  However, jig is almost up.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if the value of the dollar fell significantly it would boost other world currencies and thus hurt international exporters as they would be forced to convert to the dollar at a less favorable rate.  Thus, these folks intentionally destroy the value of their own currencies in order to keep a strong dollar, maximize exports, and maintain (somewhat) healthy labor markets.</p>

<p>But this won&#39;t last forever.  Enter China (and potentially Russia).  Arguably a more important economy than the US and one that does not want to have to manipulate their own currency and exports (because they already have a favorable production model based on cheap labor) by paying to exchange to the USD.  If successful in creating a reserve currency status for the Yuan, China will cause hyperinflation in the US as all of those holding USD reserves around the world will seek to offload and redeem their investment. </p>

<p>This is why oil is so important to the united states.  It is what keeps our entire economy running, all the way down to controlling our inflation.  If this happens, we will see an end to life in the US as we know it including massive poverty, most likely leading to significant insurrection.  Keep in mind that anyone (across the world) who seeks to 1. issue currency tied to labor and not debt 2. print their own reserve currency 3. tie currency to physical assets or 4. issue interest-free bonds are almost immediately killed.  Coincidence?</p>
