       Lots of people around the world investigate GMO, it is just that bad people produce them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if Elon Musk started a GMO company, I am sure his products would be very safe.
      </p>

       The problem is the people behind the production, not the research.

       Completely wrong. If a scientist in American university investigated GMOs from Monsanto and revealed research that damaged the companies reputation they would lose their certifications.

       Elon Musk has no say in this matter. I like him, but he still has no say here.

       The problem is the people behind the production, AND, the lack of the research.

       I can actually talk on this with some knowledge. Not because I'm a scientist, but because I am/was a chef.

       The difference in GMO grown foods and organic is night and day. Same for GMO grown and organically grown animals. It is perfectly okay to alter the DNA of say, a stalk of corn. IF you do it through organic selective breeding. But, if you splice that corn with say, the DNA of a jellyfish or whatever, and the result is that the corn grows far faster, then you have physically altered the DNA of that plant in an un-natural way.

       Give me a cow from a backwoods farm over something from a supplier like Smithfield any fucking day. I've butchered sides of beef from big suppliers, and some of the shit I've seen has made me hurl (tumors, growths, atrophy in muscle, no fat, etc). Those animals were fed GMO grown feed, now what the actual fuck do you think that'll do to the human body over time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen growth abnormalities on fucking GMO grown vegetables for fuck sake. I am so fed up with seeing restaurants feed this shit to people that it has actually spurned an incoming career change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, your body is not meant to process things which have been un-naturally altered or produced. Anyone who thinks differently is woefully misinformed.

       That doesn't justify why we shouldn't use GMO. A GMO plant is the same as a natural plant, with slightly dufferent genes.
      </p>

       Didn't you know the genes also mutate randomly in Nature?

       Yes, I do know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, when it naturally occurs, that is one thing, when we
       <em>
        force
       </em>
       that genetic change through splicing unfamiliar DNAs together, that's where problems arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heirloom tomatoes have been naturally altered, they are huge, they are delicious, and they are genetically different. That happened through generations of selective and natural breeding/genetic changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stick to my point; you can't force these kinds of changes in nature. It goes against the very grain of The Universe, and the Planet itself. It is not natural, organic evolution. It is force-fed bullshit to get 4 crops a season instead of 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanna find the reason for most things? Follow the money. Who benefitted from GMO's? Who made the most money off of them? Who pays to stifle research into GMO's? Answer those questions for yourself, and you'll understand why most "red-pilled" people are against GMO's.

       This is such a generic statement that selective breeding would basically fall under "un-naturally altered".

       People don't trust the intentions of corporations or the fact that a single entity could have a monopoly on the food supply as we know it. It is unsettling. GMOs aren't all bad by no means, I like bananas as much as the next guy and seedless watermelon but idk if I trust Monsanto and their influence telling/buying doctors and politicians that their products and pesticides are harmless. A lot of people express distrust for corporations and for good reason. Not so much fear of science

      <p>
       Its not really the 'altered' part, its more so the spraying of megatons of poisonous pesticides all over their trademarked crops that are monopolized and force the farmers to purchase seed for the next season instead of getting seeds from your own crop.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is also massively destroying the biodynamics of the soil ecosystems. Imagine a GMO farm spraying poison on the crops for decades, what its gonna do to the soil. They are freaking the fuck out about this because its gonna create a dust bowl, soil drying out, all the good bacteria in it dead, so then the crosswinds blow the top soils away, and the good top soils in many states get lower and lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally a large number of levels of fuckedupedness going on with the tyrannical poison factories

       Wrong. GMO can be made resistant to plages and diseases so they don't need pesticides.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it is the original crops the ones that do need pesticides.

       There are at least two major issues that fall under a broad GMO-claims category.
      </p>
      <p>
       One involves the moral/societal/scientific implications of a company developing and essentially owning a particular genetic strain of plant. For example, these plants can be (and are) developed such that they'll die if they don't get sprayed with X, a chemical only one company sells. (It's how they enforce their IP rights.) And some strains are so superior in terms of yield that any farmer who doesn't use them will quickly go out of business. The concerns that surround this issue are valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second broad category is the collection of claims that GMO foods are unnatural, cause cancer, are used for mind control, basically everything else. These concerns are ridiculous and are, for the most part, concerns of the paranoid &amp; undereducated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens is people (including lawmakers) hear real scientists mention GMOs in connection with an issue from category 1 and then mistakenly believe people talking about an issue from category 2 are legit, which couldn't be further from the truth.

       Pretty certain I never defended or even mentioned them. You might as well accuse someone who knows the chemical structure of water of defending Dasani, it makes just as little sense. But keep on thinking yourself a well-educated genius, my man. You've just not gotten your due because those evil corporations are holding you down. It's so unfair.

       You are asking a question to the public, but yet when people reply with informative responses with their input/experience, you keep dismissing it and refusing to acknowledge their context.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world, where profit ,power and monetary gains weren't desired, yes, I'd agree with you that GMOS could be good. Through
       <em>
        careful
       </em>
       breeding could intensify the taste of fruits/vegetables and maybe make them resistant to disease and infection. However, the reality is we don't live in a perfect world. Corporations want money and power, the fastest way possible. And they are definitely not careful, intentionally or not. This has and will continue to compromise the health of human beings.

       To  u/fuckaduckfuckaduck , thank you for your comment. You explained the problem with GMOs in the best way possible, in my opinion.

       Lots of people around the world investigate GMO, it is just that bad people produce them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if Elon Musk started a GMO company, I am sure his products would be very safe.

       The problem is the people behind the production, not the research.
