        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">107</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CptFizz.html">CptFizz</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So while browsing reddit I came across this <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> thread: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/68l83g/serious_what_secret_could_ruin_your_life/">What secret could ruin your life?</a></p>

<p>Well, those &quot;what secret do you have?&quot; threads are nothing new and they pop up at least bi-weekly. What made me suspicious is that OP asks specifically for life ruining secrets and marking the post &quot;serious&quot;. Close to 26k posts and if you dig into it there are a lot of people spilling really compromising stuff. Many of those people use their &quot;real&quot; reddit account and not a throwaway. The next thing that rustled my tinfoil hat is OP itself. He/she is a new user with a throwaway account made only for this post. OP doesn&#39;t post a secret of his/her own, so why make a throwaway? Hmmm. Now, it&#39;s probably nothing as OP is just riding the coattail of this popular thread posted 5 hours earlier <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/68khhd/5_years_ago_today_was_the_infamous_what_secret/">5 years ago today was the infamous &quot;What secret could ruin your life?&quot; thread. For those who posted in it, where are you now? For those who read it, how did it change you?</a> but I can&#39;t shake the feeling that these threads are more than just reddit entertainment. </p>

<p>I think there is a real chance that threads like this one are datamining threads. Think about it, how difficult would it be for law enforcement or an intelligence agency to find the real person behind a reddit account even a throwaway? With their access to IPs and ISP data not very difficult at all. Even for non state actors revealing the real person is not as difficult as one might think. Give me a 3-4 year old active reddit account and I have around a 5-8% chance of doxing the person with moderate effort. I put in high effort and I&#39;m at 10%. Throw social engineering on top of it and I&#39;m confident I can dox 1 in 5 accounts.</p>

<p>Even if we rule out any kind of foreign or domestic state actors there are still enough people who could use this information to ruin someones life. More than enough trolls around who&#39;d do it just for fun. Perhaps I&#39;m just paranoid and it&#39;s nothing but I would like to remind everyone to be careful about what they post. </p>

<p>If they are using the same technology that is in Quora, then they can dox ~ 100%.</p>

<p>Today, they can just buy the IP logs paired with detailed information from the cable or telecoms.  They could know your home address when you access the site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro even if you put tape over all the cameras and put your phone in the fridge (faraday cage) you still have zero privacy because the NSA has satellites with radar systems that can see through walls, with resolution great enough they can measure vibrations (and hence determine the sounds in the area). There is no privacy. We&#39;ve all been on big brother for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had an idea for awhile I&#39;m gonna try to explain that kind of jams to this. This is my pet theory.</p>

<p>So, there is a real standardized psychological test test that everyone takes as a baseline to evaluate them at the shrink&#39;s office. There are no right or wrong answers. But they have been keeping track of the answers to this test for a very long time. And what they have is many sample sets that have been taken by people with very specific traits or diagnoses. So, based on the comparison of your answers to this test and the knowm answers of all the other ones, they are able to infer what might be going on in your mind to a great degree of accuracy. And the kicker is the more people that take this test the more accurate it becomes. I am probably embarrassingly oversimplifying this, and I can&#39;t remember the name of it either, but this was explained to me by my psychologist long ago.</p>

<p>Ok, now we take this strategy and apply it to reddit. We have a bunch of control users that we know a great deal about, and we track their voting behavior carefully. We add a whole bunch of seed comments among the normal ones that will be carefully tracked as well. So, as a normal user goes through and up or downvotes these comments, they collect that information and compare it to the data created by the control group, and are able to generate a progressively more accurate picture of the minds of regular users based on these voting behavior comparisons. </p>

<p>Notice in your user page you can see your up and downvoted posts? Now you can choose whether or not you share that with reddit publicly, but without doubt it is tracked and available to the admins. So, every day you vote on reddit, you generate a clearer and clearer psychological profile of yourself.</p>

<p>And this is what reddit sells.</p>

<p><a href="/u/ninjakick666">/u/ninjakick666</a> has stated many times that he does not vote at all. That is one way to defeat this. My way is to literally upvote evrything I see, except for the most obvious toxic troll or shill stuff. And I even hesitate on shills because I think those are marker or control posts often enough, that are designed give a better baseline to the data.</p>

<p>I do database for behvior modeling in casino gaming. And this has actually inspired me for doing something roughly like this strategy to profile gambler&#39;s habits more accurately, and predict and modify future play bahavior. This program is still gestating, and I don&#39;t know if it will ever make it to a live environment. But, my idea has been given attention as having some merit by better minds than mine fwiw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Upvotes / downvotes are only a part of the equation. I&#39;m convinced that by simply analyzing the amount of posts and the subreddits they were posted in, it&#39;s possible to create a dataset that when matched to reference personalities can give a quite accurate description of a persons personality.</p>

<p>The whole thing gets really scary when you think about browser fingerprinting and cross website data accumulation. It&#39;s no joke when amazon claims they soon will be able to ship your order before you even ordered it. Imho the time is over where you can protect your privacy by being careful with your data. There are already too many data points that can lead to accurate models. The only way out is creating so much data noise so your real data is obfuscated. I remember reading about a guy wanting to create a plugin that whenever you search something on google the addon would create 20 random searches and fire them off. Something like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, we are reaching the information singularity where with the inclusion of the power of black box AI, they will literally be able to predict nearly anything you will do based on the crosslinked dataset they have compiled about you. This is some Minority Report shit, and absolutely horrifying in a lot of way. </p>

<p>I have configured a special set of browsers specifically to defeat browser fingerprinting. This browser has never touched any of my networks or social media accts (such as they are, I really hate social media) And I have also wondered if it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to share a browser configuration with a large group of people to further obfuscate what they are able to tell based on that fingerprint. If 100k people use the same thing, it fluxxes up a bunch of their data models. Maybe not in a truly significant way, but it can&#39;t hurt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AskReddit is obviously datamining. There are always questions pertaining to where you live, marital status, what your job is, and all sorts of stuff, that I see and automatically think &quot;that&#39;s Reddit trying to gain personal info on users.&quot;  </p>

<p>Sooner or later, Reddit will be more and more like Facebook, because it&#39;s going to have make money sooner or later.  And we&#39;re going to need a place that is DuckGoGo-ish and has no agenda to gather info on users. If Reddit ever goes public, and I believe it will, this place is surely doomed.</p>
