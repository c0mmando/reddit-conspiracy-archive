<p>Watch he Dr. Strange Movie with Cucumber Bumblesnatch. His teacher is alive for 100&#39;s of years by connecting to some zero point dark energy that keeps her going.</p>

<p>Now even though that&#39;s just a movie, I remember reading about some Qi-Gong masters that figured out how to do somthing similar and one of them has been around for a few hundred years, stashing out in monasteries and forests, basically she reached a state of food and death suspension was living entirely on chi energy, which you can start to feel if you get into chi gong or tai chi, its like a tingling energetic quality to it.</p>

<p>Anyway, according to some of these accounts, the body is completely locked and certain channels closed/blocked. If you can open them all via various techniques, then you can reach a state of inedia and master death.</p>

<p>I have an out of print book on it somewhere in a box in my attic, I&#39;ll see if I can find it</p>

<p>I like this guy&#39;s vids. This is section 8 brocade, which is Qi Gong. Less martial art, and more exercise? I like to do the 8 sections in the morning, and before I lift weights. </p>

<p>Get a book, watch some vids, start slow, it&#39;s probably a good idea to actually take some classes at some point, some of the movements are supposed to be precise, I remember my Sifu being a dick about the Tai Chi movements, like where my feet were pointed and shit like that. </p>

<p>Best advice is to just do it, there are tons of videos on youtube, and TONS of different variations, none of them are wrong, in case you get confused seeing different version and stuff and start thinking you are doing it wrong or something. Find the one that suits you and go for it. </p>

<p>No, my practices have been mostly Dan tien based cultivation (awareness, heart, belly) along with specific pranayama, bandhas, and general Tai Chi cultivation.</p>

<p>Some of the supernatural stuff is birds landing on my shoulder, animals coming from out of nowhere to sit at my feet (one time with a friend who was on his porch, he witnessed a white dog and cat come and lay at my feet, I had my eyes closed so did&#39;t see them until I opened them and spotted them there), began to freely OBE and see other realms/beings/dimension, I&#39;ve had a bright shining light manifest several times in the MDT which then floods my whole being and let me see through walls, skin, ground, everything became basically X-Ray vision via the light, and many others as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like Naruto Sage training. Were you pearched on a slab resting on the tip of a mountain when the bird landed on your shoulder? I&#39;m kidding btw, not trying to be a jerk. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had similar experiences from hallucinogens, OBE&#39;s, seeing auras and in infrared/other dimensions, odd animal encounters, I think they can sense the altered state and are drawn to the energy. </p>

<p>What school did you learn this at? I&#39;m in the midwest and the best I can find for the more... esoteric? martial arts disciplines is Kung Fu schools that require private sessions, because they just don&#39;t have enough students to justify having public classes. I can&#39;t afford that stuff.   </p>

<p>If you can get the spine unlocked and opened via yoga and pranayama practices, then your awareness/consciousness can literally be freed from the position of the head space and fall downwards via the spinal &#39;central channel&#39; and enter literally into the heart or belly which activates all sorts of supernatural experiences</p>

<p>Also the albigen tech, 2nd link, after doing that for a while, my consciousness began to spontaneously OBE, because its identification with mind/thoughts/ego/body that keeps it locked in the head. If you turn consciousness around so that consciousness is conscious of itself only, then it will free itself from the body/mind construct</p>

<p>Yeah I can Kechari legit, but I was doing tongue stretching with a towel every other day, and there is a mthod where you suckle your tongue to the roof of your mouth and open your mouth wide open in order to stretch the frenum. After 3 months I was able to get it up there and tickling the brain with your tongue while doing breathing exercises legit increases consciousness, bliss, etc..</p>

<p>Yeah, I would start with link 2, its just being aware of your awareness by itself. Also I would do spinal breathing for 30 mins a day here:</p>

<p>After that you&#39;ll start getting some experiences and unlocking things within the first few weeks of these 2 alone, however I&#39;d also start doing the tongue stretching and roof of mouth pulling techs as well</p>

<p>Watch he Dr. Strange Movie with Cucumber Bumblesnatch. His teacher is alive for 100&#39;s of years by connecting to some zero point dark energy that keeps her going.</p>

<p>Now even though that&#39;s just a movie, I remember reading about some Qi-Gong masters that figured out how to do somthing similar and one of them has been around for a few hundred years, stashing out in monasteries and forests, basically she reached a state of food and death suspension was living entirely on chi energy, which you can start to feel if you get into chi gong or tai chi, its like a tingling energetic quality to it.</p>

<p>Anyway, according to some of these accounts, the body is completely locked and certain channels closed/blocked. If you can open them all via various techniques, then you can reach a state of inedia and master death.</p>

<p>I have an out of print book on it somewhere in a box in my attic, I&#39;ll see if I can find it</p>

<p>I like this guy&#39;s vids. This is section 8 brocade, which is Qi Gong. Less martial art, and more exercise? I like to do the 8 sections in the morning, and before I lift weights. </p>

<p>Get a book, watch some vids, start slow, it&#39;s probably a good idea to actually take some classes at some point, some of the movements are supposed to be precise, I remember my Sifu being a dick about the Tai Chi movements, like where my feet were pointed and shit like that. </p>

<p>Best advice is to just do it, there are tons of videos on youtube, and TONS of different variations, none of them are wrong, in case you get confused seeing different version and stuff and start thinking you are doing it wrong or something. Find the one that suits you and go for it. </p>
