    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you don&#39;t know much about China. </p>

<p>At the start of the 20th century China was not a very industrialised nation. </p>

<p>After WWII millions died of famine </p>

<p>They had a series of bloody revolutions and only in the 1970s did they even start get their shit together. </p>

<p>Tienamen square was 1989.</p>

<p>So, basically China has gone from a country of poor farmers to space explorers in about 3 decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re joking I guess, but that&#39;s actually a devastating point for the whole hoax. NASA ran a contest recently with a big money prize for anyone who could solve the problem of pooping in space. Which begs the question, why reinvent the wheel if you already figured this out 50 years  ago? But if you really look into it they say that those guys wore diapers under their suits. Yes I&#39;m serious, they shat in diapers on the moon. Of course in Mike Collins&#39;s book <em>Carrying the Fire</em> he talked about emptying a urinal on the moon and seeing it all burst into ice crystals and float down.... which contradicts people who say that the condensation from their suits wouldn&#39;t be visible on the moon. </p>

<p>The whole hoax is a big mess. It&#39;s like that saying at the beginning of Dave McGowan&#39;s book, the lie changes with each telling or something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has never contested the moon landings because they wouldn&#39;t have been believed as the US could have just decried it as wartime propaganda. Instead, it would have made more sense for it to be used as blackmail. There is evidence that this took place, as the US sold the USSR heavily discounted grain.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grain_robbery">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grain_robbery</a></p>

<p>Also, this is getting further into the hoax, but Russia currently participates in ISS fakery with the United States.  In other words they&#39;re in on it. Many believe the entire Cold War to have been a fabricated event between the two nations.</p>

<p>The reasons for faking the moon landings are fairly obvious... several of them are covered in Dave McGowan&#39;s <em>Wagging the Moondoggie</em> which has been linked elsewhere in this thread. Once they got away with the first one, they made what they thought to be slight improvements and continued to cash in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure if this stuff is legit, but it seems like the Apollo 11 mission was chock full of freemasonry ritual and artifacts:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/images/EdwinBuzzAldrinAstronautFDC1.jpg">http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/images/EdwinBuzzAldrinAstronautFDC1.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.texemarrs.com/images/masonic_flag.gif">http://www.texemarrs.com/images/masonic_flag.gif</a></p>

<p>Texe Mars of &quot;Power of Prophecy&quot; writes this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, a small replica of our proud U.S. flag was dutifully carted off the Eagle lander and posted for all to see. But, then, a strange ritual of an entirely different sort, of a dark and ominous character, took place at Tranquillity Base on the moon. It was not beamed to the earth via television, for this ritual was carefully crafted beforehand as a secret ceremony, to be hidden and seen only by the eyes of the adepts of the Illuminati and its Masonic fraternity.</p>

<p>Astronaut Neil Armstrong carefully took out his Masonic apron and held it up for the cameras over his space suit as if to cover his genitals area-the power center, or dynamo, of Luciferian energy in Masonic ritual. Today, a photograph of Armstrong holding his occultic apron hangs on a wall at the House of the Temple, the sanctuary of the Scottish Rite, in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Astronaut Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin took this Masonic flag to the moon on Apollo 11 in 1969 and conducted a secret ritual.</p>

<p>Next, brother Edwin &quot;Buzz&quot; Aldrin, at the time a 32° Masonic initiate, planted on the moon&#39;s surface the real flag intended for honor, the flag the Apollo 11 had carried in its storage compartment, the flag with the Scottish Rite&#39;s emblem of deep and mysterious spirituality, the doubleheaded eagle.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Bird—The Doubleheaded Eagle. This, then, was the esoteric, but hidden and encoded meaning of the name &quot;Eagle&quot; for the lander. The cabalistic ritual script called for elevated man, initiated god-man, to &quot;ride&quot; the black phoenix bird, the &quot;Eagle,&quot; to glory, upward toward the sun. God-man was to make his nest among the stars which decorate the black-garbed night, amidst the day-time canopy of the blue sky (the blue lodge).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An article from The Guardian had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story of the secret communion service only emerged after the mission. Aldrin had originally planned to share the event with the world over the radio. However, at the time Nasa was still reeling from a lawsuit filed by the firebrand atheist Madalyn Murray O&#39;Hair, resulting in the ceremony never being broadcast. The founder of American Atheists and self-titled &quot;most hated woman in America&quot; had taken on Nasa, as well as many other public organisation. Most famously, she successfully fought mandatory school prayer and bible recitation in US public schools.</p>

<p>After the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit, O&#39;Hair wanted a ban on Nasa astronauts practising religion on earth, in space or &quot;around and about the moon&quot; while on duty. She believed it violated the constitutional separation between church and state. In Magnificent Desolation, Aldrin explains how astronaut Deke Slayton, who ran the Apollo 11 flight crew operations, told him to tone down his lunar communiqué. &quot;Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general,&quot; he advised. Looking back Aldrin writes that the communion was his way of thanking God for the success of the mission. Yet, later he hinted that he could have been more inclusive:</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, if I had it to do over again, I would not choose to celebrate communion. Although it was a deeply meaningful experience for me, it was a Christian sacrament, and we had come to the moon in the name of all mankind – <em>be they Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, agnostics, or atheists</em>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, some ritual occurred, but it is unclear what exactly.</p>

<p>The last part in bold suggests to me that freemasonry was at work that day, not some religious &quot;home connection&quot; they try to write it off as. But perhaps it is two sides of the same coin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The original video from the moon was in an unconventional &quot;slow-scan&quot; format, made necessary because almost all of the broadcast spectrum was needed to send flight data to Earth. The format scanned only 30 percent of the normal frames per second, and it was done at a much lower than normal radio frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The images would probably have remained forgotten and of little consequence to Lebar, Nafzger and NASA but for the initiative of a retired California ground station engineer and several Australian technicians who meet regularly for reunions.</p>

<p>In 2002, one of the men who had worked at Australia&#39;s Honeysuckle Creek ground station in 1969 -- and who had seen the high-quality Apollo 11 video originals back then -- found a 14-inch reel of tape in his garage that seemed to be from that period. He brought it to a Honeysuckle Creek reunion and passed it around.</p>

<p>At the next year&#39;s reunion, several more Honeysuckle veterans brought in mementos from the Apollo era, and this time they included actual moonwalk photos they had taken as the video played on their special monitors. The photos were of the original images -- not the ones reformatted for television -- and they were clearly much better than what everyone else had seen. An American engineer had similar pictures taken at the Mojave site.</p>

<p>The Australians were eager to learn whether the tape was of the actual Apollo 11 moonwalk, but they had no way to play the ungainly reels. Convinced that the tapes could have historical and educational value, they tracked down Nafzger, 66 -- one of the few Apollo 11-era people still working at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, where most Apollo data had been processed.</p>

<p>The good luck continued when Nafzger found that the soon-to-be-mothballed Data Evaluation Lab at Goddard still had one of the few seven-foot-tall analog machines that could play the Apollo video. The Australians sent him the tapes and he put them into the recorder with great anticipation. But what came out was just chatter and computer data from an earlier Apollo mission.</p>

<p>So the story goes on, but this is what I was talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but it appears not many people even knew there was a higher quality video. Some old engineer showed photos taken of monitors back in 69, and in those photos, the images were more clear than the ones everyone saw on TV. Everyone was surprised.

<p>My opinion is that we did go to the Moon. If there is a conspiracy, it&#39;s probably a side story like something we found or maybe it involves nuclear weapons (Cold War stuff).</p>

<p>The guy claims that it would be impossible to fake the moon landing in the late 60s because the technology didn&#39;t exist.  BUT! He then goes on to explain what they would&#39;ve had to do to fake the moon landing - they would&#39;ve had to use film.  The problem here is that they did use film.  Another problem is that if they used film there would be evidence in the original footage that it had been tampered with.  NASA claims to have lost the footage.   </p>

<p>So contrary to it having been proven that it would be &quot;impossible&quot; to fake due to technical concerns he actually just ends up explaining why them &quot;losing&quot; the original footage is such a serious issue.    </p>

<p><strong>NASA Erased Original Moon Footage</strong>
By Sarah Fleming, AP Science Writer November 17, 2014</p>

<p>WASHINGTON – &quot;It&#39;s appalling that NASA didn&#39;t have the common sense to save perhaps the most important historical footage of the 20th century.&quot;</p>

<p>NASA put a man on the moon but didn&#39;t have the sense to keep the original video of the live TV transmission. In an embarrassing acknowledgment, the space agency said that it erased the original Apollo 11 moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the videotape.</p>

<p>But Hollywood is coming to the rescue. The studio wizards who restored &quot;Casablanca&quot; are digitally sharpening and cleaning up the ghostly, grainy footage of the moon landing, making it even better than what TV viewers saw on July 20, 1969. They are doing it by working from four copies that NASA scrounged from around the world.</p>

<p>The first batch of restored footage was released just in time for the 40th anniversary of the &quot;one giant leap for mankind,&quot; and some of the details seem new because of their sharpness. Originally, astronaut Neil Armstrong&#39;s face visor was too fuzzy to be seen clearly. The upgraded video of Earth&#39;s first moonwalker shows the visor and a reflection in it.</p>

<p>The $230,000 refurbishing effort is only three weeks into a long project, and only 40 percent of the work has been done. But it does show improvements in four snippets: Armstrong walking down the ladder; Buzz Aldrin following him; the two astronauts reading a plaque they left on the moon; and the planting of the flag on the lunar surface.</p>

<p>Nafzger said a huge search that began three years ago for the original moon tapes led to the &quot;inescapable conclusion&quot; that 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and taped over. The original videos beamed to Earth were stored on giant reels of tape that each contained 15 minutes of video. In the 1970s and &#39;80s, NASA had a shortage of videotapes, so it erased 200,000 of them and reused them.</p>

<p>How did NASA end up looking like a bumbling husband taping over his wedding video with the Super Bowl?</p>

<p>Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings back in the Apollo years, said they were mostly thought of as data tapes. It wasn&#39;t his job to preserve history, he said, just to make sure the footage worked. In retrospect, he said he wished NASA hadn&#39;t reused the tapes.</p>

<p>Outside historians were aghast. &quot;It&#39;s appalling that NASA didn&#39;t have the common sense to save perhaps the most important historical footage of the 20th century,&quot; said Rice University historian and author Douglas Brinkley. He noted that NASA saved all sorts of data and artifacts from Apollo 11, and it is &quot;mind-boggling that the tapes just disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p>The remastered copies may look good, but &quot;when dealing with historical film footage, you always want the original to study,&quot; Brinkley said. Smithsonian Institution space curator Roger Launius, a former NASA chief historian, said the loss of the original video &quot;doesn&#39;t surprise me that much. It was a mistake, no doubt about that,&quot; Launius said. &quot;This is a problem inside the entire federal government. ... They don&#39;t think that preservation is all that important.&quot;</p>

<p>Launius said federal warehouses where historical artifacts are saved are &quot;kind of like the last scene of `Raiders of the Lost Ark.&#39; It just goes away in this place with other big boxes.&quot;</p>

<p>The company that restored all the Indiana Jones movies, including &quot;Raiders,&quot; is the one bailing out NASA. Lowry Digital of Burbank, Calif., noted that &quot;Casablanca&quot; had a pixel count 10 times higher than the moon video, meaning the Apollo 11 footage was fuzzier than that vintage movie and more of a challenge in one sense.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s certainly a little better than the original,&quot; Launius said. &quot;It&#39;s not a lot better.&quot; The Apollo 11 video remains in black and white. Inchalik said he would never consider colorizing it, as has been done to black-and-white classic films. And the moon is mostly gray anyway.</p>

<p>Neil Armstrong had the last word about the video from the moon: &quot;I was just amazed that there was any picture at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Think of it this way. You&#39;ve got a CD with all your favorite playlists on it. You copy the playlist onto another CD. Then, you destroy the original with an axe.</p>

<p>The duplicate CD literally contains the same information, so who cares? It&#39;s the same information. </p>
