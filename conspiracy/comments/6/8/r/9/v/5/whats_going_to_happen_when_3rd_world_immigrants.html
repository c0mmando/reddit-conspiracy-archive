    <div class="md"><p>In America around 1900, there were Italian neighborhoods, Irish neighborhoods, Polish neighborhoods, Bohemian neighborhoods, etc. Today, there are Black neighborhoods, Hispanic neighborhoods, Asian neighborhoods. It would make sense for America to first work together help these groups assimilate that are isolated before letting in immigrants from countries that Americans have no clue where they are from on the globe. The more immigrants that are let in will mean more segregated neighborhoods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you see a lot of blacks going for whites but the opposite isn&#39;t so popular.
Technically the white girl is seen as &quot;the first prize&quot; and the black girl &quot;the x-th prize&quot; by all human colors.
So basically that&#39;s spewing from the horse mouth. There would be no point going for white educated often bitchy girls if they weren&#39;t a greatest catch.
Again, this is not absolute truth, is simply what the sexual market is telling us right now.</p>
