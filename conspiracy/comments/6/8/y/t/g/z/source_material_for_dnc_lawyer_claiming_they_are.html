         : [T]hat’s for the party to decide. The Court’s not gonna get into that. Here, you have something far more inchoate, your Honor, which is this purported — this claim that the party acted without evenhandedness and impartiality. That — even to define what constitutes evenhandedness and impartiality really would already drag the Court well into a political question and a question of how the party runs its own affairs.

       It's interesting because although they are private they are also non profits. They accept donations and regularly hold fundraisers. The odd thing is if this was a church the pastor would be arrested for corruption. Taking funds as a non profit under false pretexts should be enough to charge them with conspiracy and tax evasion. Using non profit status when you are a for profit organization that rigs false competitions in order to raise funds is a conspiracy. Not even horse races or casinos are allowed to do that. Very odd I bet this case will be poorly argued and dnc will be exonerated of wrong doing.

       If anyone votes for the DNC after this they are clearly making against democracy. George Washington warned about political parties, and he we have one saying fuck citizens, your not in our good ol' boys club, so we pick your leader.
      </p>

       How could anyone vote for them in the next election or even at local elections. Not saying vote republicam, I think someone with no experience has better shots then these current elected idiots.
