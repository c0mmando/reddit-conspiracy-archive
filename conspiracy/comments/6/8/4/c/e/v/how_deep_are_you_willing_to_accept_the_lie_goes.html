       I've been really questioning EVERYTHING recently, and the lie seems to have no end anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure there were homocidal gas chambers used in WW2, that's the claim "holocaust deniars" make btw they aren't arguing that WW2 didn't happen like everyone strawmans their argument to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think we have ever been to the moon, and I'm not sure Hubble and the ISS are even real. I'm not even sure satalites and gravity are real anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what shape the earth is but think the flat earthers have a more convincing argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure dinosaurs ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure nukes exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Jesus was even based off a real deluded rabbi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know 9/11 was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook seems such a poorly done false flag it seemed mostly just a test to see if they actually even need to try anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems obvious satanic pedophiles run the show at the very top levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think witchcraft is real and that "spooky" way our mind seems to influence the external world will be fully explained by quantum physics someday.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure reality even exists outside the mind of an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think religion is generally creepy and is just a tool of oppression most akin to a lobotomist's scalpel. A scam at best, and telling children it's real is sadistic child abuse literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are all just the one living universe becoming aware of itself, like a deistic Pantheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty much all lies imo, all of it. History itself is just another rich man's trick.  Any other big ones I'm forgetting? Where you guys at in your voyage to the bottom of the rabbit hole?

       You should open your mind to the other side of religion.  Part of me thinks that these elites know something we don't, and there's another side of the coin.

       They do seem to know all sorts of stuff we don't, and I agree there may be a creator god or at least a first observer that collapsed the first quantum wave function into the first observation.  I'm not sure how literal referring to the universe as one living organism is vs how much of it is. Philosophy of unity. It DOES seem though that the Bible at least has been tainted and turned into something very bad for humanity and the world. If the Bible is nonfiction it must be a work of the devil to drive people away from God and keep humanity divided.

       It's very hard to tell, no matter what the truth is there's a lot of misdirection.  But the elites are incredibly intelligent, well informed people, and are all devoutly Christian.  They just root for the other team.

       I'm not sure how many of them actually believe in that, vs how many are Just in it for the thrill of depravity and the power and status it brings and because if you don't rape children too no one can trust you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tbh I'm not sure how many of the elites are actually Christian and lucifarian vs how many just want in the club, it's pretty much impossible to do anything but speculate on that.

       Galen windsor is who you need to research it you want to take this red pill, there are also countless great we'll sourced videos on YouTube that explain the "nuclear hoax" you could check out of you want to understand even better.
      </p>
      <p>
       After looking into it, it seems heroishima and Nagasaki were firebombed like Tokyo and not nuked, and that nuclear test vidoes are faked or just testing big non-nuclear bombs. When you look into it, it seem mostly about fear mongering and having the ultimate undefeatable boogieman, and also about keeping safe small-scale nuclear reactors out of the hands of communities and individual so we are dependant and tied to the grid. It also seems to be about securing cornering and playing the plutoniums futures market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of radiation sickness like we would expect in Japan after heroishima and after fukisma plus Chernobyl seems just fine too, just way too much doesn't add up. Nukes MAY exist, I just would bet not.

       MAY have been radiation sickness, she was around a lot less stable isotopes than we use in bombs or powerplants. People who don't think nukes are real still believe in radiation sickness. However we don't really know how she died we only know what the official narrative is.

       No, my argument is that they worship satan and truly believe him to be real, and they aren't the type to base their beliefs on guesses.  They know all the secrets.  And if what they believe is true, the flipside, God, would also be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the truth is, but I think this is a reasonable platform to be curious about religion.

       Lets think of it as spirituality a one connectedness its beautiful if you think about it. If you study enough the picture gets clear and we are the only way its gonna stop if aliens were gonna help they would have already that infringes free will.

       I agree with most of it as well.  But one thing.  If you accept the elite worship satan but think religion is bullshit.  Where does our innate goodness/humanity/compassion come from.
       <br/>
       Because I believe that the opposite (anger, fear, hate) comes from without.  It is not natural to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all of this is misery and suffering is designed to turn us away from God.

       Im not sure if Satan is real but I don't think he is. The satanic pedo elites either are deluded and worshiping a non-existent fictional character or else are using that as an excuse to get away with super fucked up stuff like raping children, I'm not sure which is more common or how much of it is simply about the blackmail either and letting them have something over you so you can join the club.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our inmate compassion comes from our grand unity and that your neighbor IS yourself. Love your neighbor because he IS yourself, we are just the one living planet experiencing consciousness. Also that compassion comes from raw selfishness too because it feels good to do good and because no one wants to live in a shithole of raping and pillaging so refrain so other people don't rape and pillage them back likewise.
      </p>
      <p>
       AS SO
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who work define God as the grand unity of the entire universe, I would agree with that last part and its about keeping us divided and conquered more than keeping us atheist but you're still exactly correct imo

       I think the elites are deluded also but also victims.  They've been duped into the bidding of another.  I think this behaviour is much older than we know (there's a story that Cain actually ate Abel after killing him).
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we are of one, Jesus did teach to love your neighbour as yourself.  I feel like we are awakening to something greater than ourselves.  Be that God/Source/Singularity, I don't know for sure. 
 It's all very confusing, I jump from one position to another.
       <br/>
       All I know for sure is, Jesus had a really positive message.  Now look at how his image has been distorted in the last 60 or so years.  Almost a joke.  To me it seems a deliberate attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, Whatever we each of us believe, we should treat each a lot better than we have so far.

       I firmly believe we are in space, and that the fake moon landing conspiracy, and maybe more recently flat earth, is designed to keep people like us from even trying to look into what they are doing up there.

      <p>
       Ask yourself not did we go to the moon, but why did Russia stop trying? They were our arch-enemy back then. If we left room in a space for them to occupy and have advantage, why didn't they take it?

       I'm not sure how many of them actually believe in that, vs how many are Just in it for the thrill of depravity and the power and status it brings and because if you don't rape children too no one can trust you.
      </p>

       Tbh I'm not sure how many of the elites are actually Christian and lucifarian vs how many just want in the club, it's pretty much impossible to do anything but speculate on that.

       Galen windsor is who you need to research it you want to take this red pill, there are also countless great we'll sourced videos on YouTube that explain the "nuclear hoax" you could check out of you want to understand even better.
      </p>
      <p>
       After looking into it, it seems heroishima and Nagasaki were firebombed like Tokyo and not nuked, and that nuclear test vidoes are faked or just testing big non-nuclear bombs. When you look into it, it seem mostly about fear mongering and having the ultimate undefeatable boogieman, and also about keeping safe small-scale nuclear reactors out of the hands of communities and individual so we are dependant and tied to the grid. It also seems to be about securing cornering and playing the plutoniums futures market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of radiation sickness like we would expect in Japan after heroishima and after fukisma plus Chernobyl seems just fine too, just way too much doesn't add up. Nukes MAY exist, I just would bet not.
