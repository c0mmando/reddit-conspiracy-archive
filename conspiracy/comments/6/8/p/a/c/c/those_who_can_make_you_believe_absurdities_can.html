       I don't think you're confronting the real issue. I'm asking if there is more to life' reality than that which can be supported scientifically. Humanism does not address the core assumptions that science makes. Saying meaning is real but is entirely subjective is exactly the same as saying meaning is fantasy, therefore how can you say something is real but also fantasy. My goal isn't to slap a label on you, but to make you ask if your underlying assumptions stand up or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I say 'meaning' I don't mean something a person may find meaningful. What I'm saying is, is there a greater meaning to life? Is the process of your life moving toward a greater reality - i.e. Is everything divine and meaningful or is that bullshit and therefore it's all just random and life is an accident?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm embellishing here for the purpose of illustration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, how do you justify your answer? Most people seem to assume one position or another without considering how much impact this will have in any resulting philosophy. If life is entirely materialistic, then such things as love, emotion, fullfillment, fun, etc are not real and are therefore irrational. Anything not for the purpose of survival is a waste of time. Meaning is not worth persuing. So even if subjective meaning is valuable, then we have to actually consider that it might be real even if we can't describe the mechanism.

       I personally flip flop on the issue. The older I get the more I seem to lean towards no greater meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that we have much to consider and may discover a scientific basis for spiritual things in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm just trying to say science is not a belief system, it is a system of verifying objective truths, a tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm clearly no philosopher. What does this mean ". Humanism does not address the core assumptions that science makes. "?

       Well, science by definition is a tool, which for all intents, is designed to remove bias i.e. deal only with what can be established as fact. The thing is it requires a kind of philosophical software to run e.g. Taking logical steps allows us to arrive at something higher i.e. the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since science has enjoyed a lot of success, society in general has turned a blind eye toward the philosophical under pinnings and simply accepted them as axiomatic truth. It takes an enormous fortitude to swim against this current and ask if this underlying philosophy is able to adequately explain the human experience. It's a bit like an insurance claims adjuster who obsesses over every decision from the point of view of risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the point is simply that humanism and virtually every philosophy and even most religions are unable to think outside of the philosophy of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that brings me back to my question: is meaning real or unreal? The point here is to notice that meaning is not material. It can't be dissected to understand how it works and it really doesn't follow a kind of logic. Yet at the same time it represents a kind of truth that virtually everyone agrees on. So you're forcing me to be verbose here: The popularly accepted philosophies under-pinning science are unable to adequately describe the human experience. Hence most of us are less able to deal with emotions, abstractions, etc since we lack the philosophical tools to accept them as real. Even Humanism to large extent, although you're obviously able to exploit some wiggle room here, which is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point here is to logically show that we can't live lives where we assume everything is inherently mechanistic and explainable. I can guarantee you there is a lot more to you than a biological robot who is only concerned about survival and that alone breaks the popular scientific paradigm.

       This makes no sense to me. Religion assumes magic and superpowers and angels and omniscient beings... all things which science does not apply to or science has proven to be never observed/no reason to support the hypothesis. 
And isn't philosophy built on abstractions that require human assumptions, agreement on semantics, subjective interpretation? Or, religion paints itself as existing outside of science from the very beginning.

       It all depends on the damn semantics of "meaning".
Deep meaning/purpose of my life/afterlife/a plan: not real. 
Love/non-material meaning: real.
Interdimensional aliens/peyote shapeshifting: agnostic, really hope so.

       The human experience is very subjective, what do you want science to describe about it? Cognitive science advances daily and can someday will be able to give you a "scientific" answer about anything. I imagine everything will be explained by your DNA, brain configuration, and overall health of other brain related organs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We can barely talk about nonpysical reality because our whole way of thinking has slowly strangled the reality out of thise more subtle experiences. The demise of art, real intellectual learning, poetry etc in favor of instant gratification and consumerism which has endlessly been pointed to should serve as evidence here.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What more subtle experiences? Isn't the demise of culture more a political topic? String theorists and the truly religious are operating outside of the materialistic box.

       I agree that there may be a tendency toward this in general. I think it's because it's easier and apathy. Myself, I'm more agnostic than most, I hope a whole lot of stuff is real. Maybe we live in n dimensions and not just 4, and other life exists in other dimensions. I hope that's true, and believe that if it is true, science will someday be able to verify it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or: if something isn't explainable, then the language is insufficient. I think you mean "scientifically explainable" though.

       If science proved God, then sure, I would believe. As mentioned previously, I'm personally not waiting for science to tell me that hallucinogens can give me mystic experiences. I'm not waiting for science to tell me that demons might be aliens and they might be multidimensional. I'm here on reddit looking for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a specific example of "deeper meaning" would help me. If you are getting at people using science as a crutch, then I agree. That's why I was shit-commenting on you in the first place, I thought you were pitching science as a belief system.

       Did you know that empty space is made of an invisible fabric which can be bent? So I can manipulate nothing at all to make something happen. I might also be able to fold 'nothing' and travel through the 'worm hole'. I swear I'm not crazy, you're just too stupid to understand. The rotation of the earth causes matter to shrink or 'contract'. You don't have a Phd so of course you don't understand. But we can't prove that but we can make the math 'work out' so therefore you should take it as fact becuase math is too hard for you. Go science, fuck yeah!
