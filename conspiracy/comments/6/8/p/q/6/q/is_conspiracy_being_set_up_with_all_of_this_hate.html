    <div class="md"><p>Can you distinguish between Zionism and Judaism?</p>

<p>Most American Jews are ordinary middle class folks who are as worried as you about the state of the world.  It may surprise you that many of them are actually very critical of Israel, its human rights abuses, and execrable foreign policy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll grant that Jews are over-represented in higher social positions.  Much of this is explained by the high regard Jewish culture has for literacy, in contrast to many Christian cultures that are fairly anti-intellectual.  Literacy and intellectualism are very helpful to securing higher-level positions in this society.</p>

<p>I will also grant that there are some evil Jews who are very powerful.  There are also some evil Christians who are extremely powerful.  Extremely powerful people tend to be evil, regardless of their stated religion.</p>

<p>I was with you til right there. I think the term you were looking for was tribal nepotism. Your notion reeks heavily of the same self importance with which many Jews hold themselves thanks to their alleged &quot;chosen&quot; status.</p>

<p>Look I get it…not all Jews are bad…just like not all cops are bad. But if the bad cops are not speaking out against/standing up to the bad cops they then also become bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tribal nepotism is a feature common to all human groups.  Yes, Jews will engage in it.  Just like everybody else does.  You can see this same human trait in the garden variety whites-only racism that lurks just below the surface in this sub.</p>

<p>I&#39;m behind you 100% if you want to criticize all the evil scheming that goes on in our government (both visible and invisible).  Ditto on the evils of the very most wealthy families that control almost everything.  But to single out Jews as being the sole culprits is pretty regressive. </p>

<p>Please. Are you suggesting that Christians…or German Americans engage in the same type of nepotism that Jews do?</p>

<p>Of course I rail against all scheming…but to deny that those with the most per capita power in the arenas with the biggest ability to corrupt and enslave (banking and media) aren&#39;t worthy of extra scorn seems disingenuous.</p>

<p>Shut the fuck up about it. There is a faction of people who identify as &quot;jewish&quot;, that yes, are a competing and forceful faction within the New World Order matrix. Big fucking deal.</p>

<p>The Bilderberg group? The Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission, Elite Pedo Rings, Presidential puppets, all of that stuff is equally important. There is a &quot;faction&quot; in every developed part of the country, where powerful people have convened for control, including asians, africans, english, latin, ect. I don&#39;t see an uproar over that.</p>

<p>For a group of people who are privy to the &quot;divide and conquer race war agenda&quot; that we are undergoing currently, theres a lot of you who are unknowingly playing into that, by creating this <strong>Jewish Hysteria</strong>.</p>

<p>On behalf of this whole sub (and this is a new account, before anyone gives me shit about my account), I Apologize to any of the new lurkers and readers visiting r/conspiracy. We are currently under attack by a division psyop, trying to paint us as anti-semetic/anti-jewish...whatever you want to call it. The idea is to make us appear to be anti-jewish, and associate us with a &quot;right leaning&quot; slant, and as Trump supporters. None of those things are true.</p>

<p>Conversations can be had about this, however, leave the fucking jewish hate-click bate titles out of the fucking posts guys. Fuck...</p>

<p>We have to protect our image. Psyops like flat earth and this shit are used to attack our credibility. Im tired of being the fucking PR guy for r/conspiracy all by myself. Use your heads, please....</p>

<p>Or is it more likely that there has been an influx of anti-Jewish/flat Earth folks who find resonance in what they think this sub is about?</p>
