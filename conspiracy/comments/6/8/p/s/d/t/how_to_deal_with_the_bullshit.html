       Needing some advice reddit...
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the past year or so I was convinced I was depressed. College-student who switched majors 3 times, kind of enjoying what I'm doing now, but still not a "spark". Anywayy...
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you people deal with this society? I'm currently going down the drain, school, relationships, happiness, bank account, everything. I'm convinced it's not depression because I'm not sad, I'm just unmotivated. I feel like all I have to look forward to is 10 years of paying off debt, 45 years in the work force working for some scumbag so I can [hopefully] fund a retirement one day; one of which I'll probably be too old and crippled to even enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't seem to get my head right. Everytime I get my ass to work, or go to school I can't help but think everything I'm doing is a waste of this miracle we call life. I mean shit, TRILLIONS OF FUCKING GALAXIES and I'm sitting in a classroom learning shit, or sitting at work getting treated like dirt for $9 which isn't even remotely enough to pay for my expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you get yourself to ignore the fact that every single one of us is wasting this gift of life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  wow this blew up, at least I know I'm not the only one! I still get my shit done but it gets harder everyday!
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I'm listening to see if it helps yall!~

       I think what gets me down the most with being a part of this community is we look for any inkling of something that might force a change...i.e date setting, nibiru, or dozens of other conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe nothing will change unless we make it happen. But they've rigged the game so well that's not even plausible any longer...

       That weighs me down too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a lot of potential, but people's minds and hearts are elsewhere and not focused on what's really happening to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think that if there was some true 'way' or cause that would guarantee that the world would be better for future generations, that I would join. But every movement is corrupted and every group is comprised somehow.

       Exactly! I always ask that question: "where have all our heroes gone"?!? We have none! Everything is corrupted, we had a May Day march here in Portland today and it was canceled because the anarchists took it over and they shut it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way society is makes me want to be less and less a part of it. Where's everyone's awareness? I feel like everyone is taking crazy pills, and us select few are immune to them...

       Speak for yourself mate, I'm not wasting mine (except maybe the time I spend on reddit). It's an unfortunate reality though that there are many boring jobs to fill so a lot of people are going to not have another choice but to do a job they hate to pay to susurration themselves, family and hopefully finance something to do in their little spare time.

       Oh, I don't know…I think the studies show that the effect is real. It's not saying bad shit isn't happening…I just think it would tend to affect those that are "awake" more than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, really…what hope is there for us to really affect change short of revolution? That kind of knowledge can really affect those that are aware just how shitty and contrived things really are.

       36 I think trying to figure this shit out. I used to be a lot more motivated 8 years ago but now I see all the bullshit in front of me and am stepping high. I try to get my adrenaline cranked up on weekends but they just fly fucking by and I feel a little wore out and miss it bad on Mondays. Hell Mondays at 2AM I lay awake dreading what I gotta do. It really isn't the job but it's looking down at it from 30,000 feet on my back in my bed that is crushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is because we are all woke as fuck but still cornered somehow looking for a way over the wet paint. I might just gotta stomp through that shit and look back way on down the road.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often wonder if I can change the whole spectrum of our collective feelings just by making that brave jump for us all/myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I didn't have an 9 year old it would be a lot easier of decision for sure.

       That weighs me down too.

      <p>
       I see a lot of potential, but people's minds and hearts are elsewhere and not focused on what's really happening to them.
      </p>

       I'd like to think that if there was some true 'way' or cause that would guarantee that the world would be better for future generations, that I would join. But every movement is corrupted and every group is comprised somehow.

       I feel this so strongly. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, but like you, I don't feel like brain chemistry is the source of my anguish. I'm in my mid twenties &amp; it makes me physically ill imagining continuing my life slaving away. The idea of trading time for money is something I am not interested in. When I mention this to people I know, they look at me like I'm crazy. Even after I explain how time is essentially priceless because you only get so much of it.

       I didn't really hit my stride until my 30s. I quit drinking, got a healthy running habit, and matured professionally where I was doing more or less what I liked, and had command of my skillsets.

       I think what gets me down the most with being a part of this community is we look for any inkling of something that might force a change...i.e date setting, nibiru, or dozens of other conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe nothing will change unless we make it happen. But they've rigged the game so well that's not even plausible any longer...
