<p>I&#39;m sure the defense industry is prodding him in the direction they want. But the reason Trump is starting to beat the war drum, particularly against North Korea, is merely as a distraction from all his scandals and failures.</p>

<p>LOL. Neither is half this sub. They&#39;re just here to shill for Trump and concern troll to distract away from him. I discuss conspiracy theories all the time, but considering the sub has been taken over by The_Donald, is it any surprise that Trump gets discussed a lot?</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to discuss conspiracies such as Trump&#39;s numerous connections to Russia. But any post about Trump gets immediately downvoted into oblivion.</p>

<p>They&#39;re both shit. That&#39;s what people need to open their eyes and accept. Instead, we get people defending him at all costs and spreading state propaganda in a conspiracy theory subreddit. LOL.</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally had 5+ people in his campaign and administration quit due to their ties to Russia and/or lying about their ties to Russia.</p>

<p>To act like there&#39;s nothing at all there worth even contemplating or discussing is just plain willful ignorance.</p>

<p>And of course, as soon as Trump gets criticize, Hillary has to get mentioned. I&#39;ve not argued she would have been better. I&#39;m merely trying to discuss Trump&#39;s merits. Can that be done without trying to deflect to someone else? Because saying he&#39;s atleast better than Hillary is a pretty low fucking bar.</p>

<p>He already has. His ignorant and racist rhetoric alone is going to be a boon for terrorist recruiting. He&#39;s pissed on almost every ally we have already, while simultaneously praising nearly every dictator around the world.</p>

<p>Lmao because we aren&#39;t scared of Russia. Take Obama&#39;s word for it Russia isn&#39;t anything. There economy is shit and wouldn&#39;t last a day in a war against us. Fearing Russia is like a lion being scared of a fucking squirrel.</p>

<p>So literally nothing is what I&#39;m getting form this. The Russian conspiracy can be destroyed by the most simple questions. That&#39;s why no one takes it or the democrats seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the problem with the nuclear is that Westinghouse just filed for bankruptcy and the Vogel plant is a multi million dollar hole in the ground. The AP1000 is a fantastic design but due to regulations and a shit load of set backs and being hilariously over budget the plant might never get built. And it&#39;s one of the only plant getting built right now nuclear is in a sad state. 
Sorta because of regulations but also because natural gas and solar/wind are super cheap right now and is just undercutting coal wich is good but also nuclear. </p>

<p>But coal isn&#39;t the cheapest energy source available right now... That&#39;s why the coal market shrunk so quickly. Natural gas is significantly cheaper to get out of the ground, and natural gas plants are a lot cheaper and cleaner to run.</p>

<p>FYI, between Sanders, Clinton, and Trump, only one of them argued for advanced nuclear power plants. I&#39;ll let people look that up themselves.</p>

<p>Ok, yes technically natural gas prices are cheaper right now. Should have said &quot;fossil fuels.&quot; In any case, 3c/kwh is the conservative estimate for 4th gen nuclear, and natural gas isn&#39;t there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump needs to order the replacement of coal plants with Natural gas, and use the money that we use to subsidize the coal industry to train the workers  &amp;  buy out men who&#39;re too old to be worth retraining.

<p>Natural gas is SO much cleaner than coal, and you could probally gut out the old coal power plants and install gas turbines for not that much money.</p>

<p>If you have coal workers in their 20s it would be economical to send them to college to train them to work in nuclear power plants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is US destabilized the middle east on purpose due to Fertility rates in there own country. The Fertility rates are that low that without mass immigration one generation wouldn&#39;t even replace the last which would likely cause the economy to crash, a lot of businesses especially in rural towns would go under, and with the average lifespans increasing there&#39;s concerns about how the coming generation will be able to support older generations who reach retirement age. Fertility rates are a MAJOR issue no ones talking about, you need 2.11 just to replace the previous generation, Europe, US, Australia are all well below that and I think all those countries are using mass immigration to stabilize there own populations/economy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might look for a conspiracy. Since the beginning of time people have been looking for a simple explanation for complex problems. It&#39;s never worked. There isn&#39;t a magical thing sapping &quot;life force&quot; from the nation as someone wrote in this thread. What there is is various destructive ethos held by the public and then implemented by elected officials. Among these are hatred of various groups and destructive economic views.</p>

<p>In both education and healthcare, the government has been socialist enough to provide government subsidies but capitalist enough not to impose any restrictions on providers. The effect is that providers demand more and more money, the government then provides more and more assistance, ad infinitum. That&#39;s the reason education and healthcare got so incredibly expensive.</p>

<p>Similarly with the effect of globalization on the economy. It is economically sound to import from abroad whatever is cheaper to produce abroad. The capitalist view is that if China wants to send a lot of goods to America for basically free, America should take the deal. The flip side is the socialist view that if this happens, factories will close, and the people who worked in these factories should be taken care of. They should be able to live their lives in dignity, and their children should go to college to study modern, more lucrative professions, which are America&#39;s comparative advantage. Due to the American public&#39;s disdain from socialism, none of that happened. The people whose parents worked in industries where America can&#39;t compete are living without dignity, can&#39;t afford health insurance or higher education, and Fox News is running items blaming them for laziness and trying to convince the public that the government should limit what you can buy with food stamps.</p>

<p>Why can&#39;t there be a Silicon Valley in Kentucky? Is America unable to train rust belt teenagers in engineering? Can&#39;t America provide a future to a black kid from the ghetto?</p>

<p>Is any of this anyone&#39;s fault but the American public&#39;s?</p>

<p>As to wars, you all were for Trump, and he&#39;s going to increase the defense budget, as he said he would. Vote better.</p>
