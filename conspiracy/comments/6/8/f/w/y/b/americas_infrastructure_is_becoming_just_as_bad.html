       There will always be opportunities for the people who are smart enough to "join the ranks". This has been going on for a while.

      <p>
       The reason why people are becoming so poor is because of a certain family R. not wanting them not be able to buy gold/silver and start an independent real currency.

       ive noticed this change as well(im 29) it really doesnt matter what you do at a job like that these days a long as it ant get you fire or the company sued.  I worked as a state corrections officer and it has turned into that as well.  Dont pay attention to whats going on around you just dont let any inmates murder other inmates if you can help it, dont get us sued. go home.

       You're funny you think we actually have a choice in the matter. Remember trump talking about building infrastructure instead of bombing shit in the Middle East? Shit even Bernie probably would have dropped a few bombs on the Middle East. The arms dealers have our government by the balls and they make the rules.

       Dude, Trump literally promised everyone everything. He has no convictions whatsoever, and if you think he was really going to do shit to help the average American, than I have a bridge to sell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure the defense industry is prodding him in the direction they want. But the reason Trump is starting to beat the war drum, particularly against North Korea, is merely as a distraction from all his scandals and failures.

       Ok bush did the same shit. Obama did the same shit.  Look I get it people hate Trump, but just look at the pattern. Why does every president who takes office become a neocon war monger? Our government is corrupt from the very foundation up and the only way it will change is with a violent revolution. Not filling in a check mark on a ballot.

       LOL. Neither is half this sub. They're just here to shill for Trump and concern troll to distract away from him. I discuss conspiracy theories all the time, but considering the sub has been taken over by The_Donald, is it any surprise that Trump gets discussed a lot?

       Russia hasn't attacked American on American soil in a long, long time. So no one sees them as our enemy. Not to mention they wouldn't have wanted Hillary because she would have continued the proxy war in Syria big time. Wow the conspiracy debunked in a paragraph amazing conspiracy.

       And of course, as soon as Trump gets criticize, Hillary has to get mentioned. I've not argued she would have been better. I'm merely trying to discuss Trump's merits. Can that be done without trying to deflect to someone else? Because saying he's atleast better than Hillary is a pretty low fucking bar.

       Ok so let's say you are right and Trump has Russian influences. What I don't understand is how that is some how the worst thing in the world? Do you have any evidence Russia is going to use trump to hurt America? What would Russia reasoning for helping trump? It's pretty obvious to me that they would have help Trump because they didn't want Hillary as president.

       That's going to change. Once you get past things like safety and human rights, Infrastructure is the biggest driver of economic growth. And we have several decades of advanced infrastructure projects that have been held back for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like a Hyperloop, meltdown-proof 4th Generation Nuclear that creates clean energy for half the cost of coal, non-rocket space launch systems, and NAWAPA. These are projects that would create trillions of dollars in free cash flow for the government, and double-digit economic growth.

       Well the problem with the nuclear is that Westinghouse just filed for bankruptcy and the Vogel plant is a multi million dollar hole in the ground. The AP1000 is a fantastic design but due to regulations and a shit load of set backs and being hilariously over budget the plant might never get built. And it's one of the only plant getting built right now nuclear is in a sad state. 
Sorta because of regulations but also because natural gas and solar/wind are super cheap right now and is just undercutting coal wich is good but also nuclear.

       It's entirely due to regulatory capture of the NRC. 4th Gen reactors would easily be half the cost of coal if they had a similar regulatory regime. Even 1st gen reactors are only about 25% more than coal.

       But coal isn't the cheapest energy source available right now... That's why the coal market shrunk so quickly. Natural gas is significantly cheaper to get out of the ground, and natural gas plants are a lot cheaper and cleaner to run.
      </p>

       FYI, between Sanders, Clinton, and Trump, only one of them argued for advanced nuclear power plants. I'll let people look that up themselves.

       Ok, yes technically natural gas prices are cheaper right now. Should have said "fossil fuels." In any case, 3c/kwh is the conservative estimate for 4th gen nuclear, and natural gas isn't there.

       Trump needs to order the replacement of coal plants with Natural gas, and use the money that we use to subsidize the coal industry to train the workers  &amp;  buy out men who're too old to be worth retraining. Give men who should retire a million or two bucks and the would line up to retire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural gas is SO much cleaner than coal, and you could probally gut out the old coal power plants and install gas turbines for not that much money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have coal workers in their 20s it would be economical to send them to college to train them to work in nuclear power plants.

       We do feed the poor. You can get free housing and an EIB card for food. If you are poor you can get medicare and a lot of other benefits and more and that is just from the government. There are plenty of church and private programs to help the poor too.  The real question is why are the poor actually poor? Illegal immigrants can get jobs. Why can't the poor?

       Over half of food stamp recipients already have jobs. Walmart and like companies get rich, they save gobs of money paying low wages, then get more money when their employees spend the food stamps they qualify for in the store. And the working poor stay poor.

       My local library got rid of its entire reference section, including encyclopedias, and created a "quiet space" in it's place. Isn't the whole library supposed to be a quiet space...and full of...books? We are doomed.

       The powers that be do not care if this country continues or blows away with the wind.  It is not considered a holy country or anything that needs to exist for eternity.  All funds and resources for infrastructure will be funneled to other channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Borders in this country, and others, will be open such that the cultures become a blend.  No country is allowed to have groups that have an "identity" or can band together.  Everyone needs to be mixed, confused, scattered and lost.

       In general a state can't re-finance maintaining its infrastructure anymore after some time due compound interests. It usually requires a currency reform, infrastructure destruction and debt/ownership "restructuring" by war or it ends in long suffering agony of decay(Sounds familiar?).

       My theory is US destabilized the middle east on purpose due to Fertility rates in there own country. The Fertility rates are that low that without mass immigration one generation wouldn't even replace the last which would likely cause the economy to crash, a lot of businesses especially in rural towns would go under, and with the average lifespans increasing there's concerns about how the coming generation will be able to support older generations who reach retirement age. Fertility rates are a MAJOR issue no ones talking about, you need 2.11 just to replace the previous generation, Europe, US, Australia are all well below that and I think all those countries are using mass immigration to stabilize there own populations/economy.

       You might look for a conspiracy. Since the beginning of time people have been looking for a simple explanation for complex problems. It's never worked. There isn't a magical thing sapping "life force" from the nation as someone wrote in this thread. What there is is various destructive ethos held by the public and then implemented by elected officials. Among these are hatred of various groups and destructive economic views.
      </p>
      <p>
       In both education and healthcare, the government has been socialist enough to provide government subsidies but capitalist enough not to impose any restrictions on providers. The effect is that providers demand more and more money, the government then provides more and more assistance, ad infinitum. That's the reason education and healthcare got so incredibly expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly with the effect of globalization on the economy. It is economically sound to import from abroad whatever is cheaper to produce abroad. The capitalist view is that if China wants to send a lot of goods to America for basically free, America should take the deal. The flip side is the socialist view that if this happens, factories will close, and the people who worked in these factories should be taken care of. They should be able to live their lives in dignity, and their children should go to college to study modern, more lucrative professions, which are America's comparative advantage. Due to the American public's disdain from socialism, none of that happened. The people whose parents worked in industries where America can't compete are living without dignity, can't afford health insurance or higher education, and Fox News is running items blaming them for laziness and trying to convince the public that the government should limit what you can buy with food stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why can't there be a Silicon Valley in Kentucky? Is America unable to train rust belt teenagers in engineering? Can't America provide a future to a black kid from the ghetto?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is any of this anyone's fault but the American public's?
      </p>
      <p>
       As to wars, you all were for Trump, and he's going to increase the defense budget, as he said he would. Vote better.

       Yuri Bezmenov was a High Level KGB defector in the 1970's and gave a series of talks about Ideological Subversion and it's implementation by the Soviets to take over countries from the inside...it struck Yuri most when he came to America was that it wasn't the primarily Russians doing it here it was the Elite Left of America. Worth a watch he explains so much of what is happening  as David Horowitz has said decades on decades of Liberal professors hiring Liberal professors has left us fully subverted and phase one demoralization is complete, now we have come to destabilization next will be crisis...

       ive noticed this change as well(im 29) it really doesnt matter what you do at a job like that these days a long as it ant get you fire or the company sued.  I worked as a state corrections officer and it has turned into that as well.  Dont pay attention to whats going on around you just dont let any inmates murder other inmates if you can help it, dont get us sued. go home.
