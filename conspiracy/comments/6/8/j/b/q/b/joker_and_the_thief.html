<p>Who is God?  What is his character?  How does he work in the World?  How does someone lean on him?  Someone growing in Faith learns to answer these questions as they have trials to test their Faith.  (James 1:2-4)  Someone who grew in Faith, and learned God&#39;s character, and how he works, may learn how to see Satan as well.  I am going to give brief clues someone else could follow through the Holy Ghost. This may be uncomfortable.  </p>

<p><strong>God and The Media</strong></p>

<p>Did you watch &quot;Man of Steel,&quot; the newest Superman movie?  There are a lot of Biblical and Spiritual themes woven into the movie.  Themes of Faith.  To not spoil it, and just give you an intro, Superman is Kal of the House of El.  What does El mean?  God&#39;s Angels are Micha-El, Gabri-El, Uri-El, Ragu-El, and so on.  That would make Superman Earth&#39;s Guardian Angel?  He exited his home planet like Moses going down the river Nile?  When you get the beat, there is a lot going on.  There are spiritual themes woven into the media, and we could go so far as to say, in a very big way, in many comic books when you know what to look for.  </p>

<p>Batman is a detective.  He doesn&#39;t really have any superpowers.  According to Leonard Ravenhill:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The prophet is God&#39;s detective seeking for a lost treasure. The degree of his effectiveness is determined by his measure of unpopularity. Compromise is not known to him. He has no price tags. <a href="http://ravenhill.org/prophet.htm">(&quot;Picture of a Prophet.&quot;)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Batman could be an allegory for a Prophet.  </p>

<p>Satan would be a Joker.  Man is God&#39;s Glory.  God does not share.  Lucifer masquerades as an Angel of Light, but really he hates you.  </p>

<p>God is Love.  (1 John 4:8)  God loves you.  He has good plans for you.  </p>

<p>Satan does not have good plans for you.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!(Isaiah 14:12)</p>

<p>&quot;I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.&quot; (Revelations 22:16)  </p>

<p>To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations--that one &#39;will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery&#39; --just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give that one the morning star. (Revelations 2:26-28) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U9ZEm5hpNc">Lucifer was a fallen angel.</a>  He covets man.  People worship a Lucifer Fallen Angel.  This is fact.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ is The Morning Star in Revelations.  He promises to give the Morning Star.  The Morning Star is a Title or Function in heaven or The Church.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ is The Man.  (1 Timothy 2:5)  The Man like &quot;The Man&quot; Aloe Blacc which is a stong about The Kingdom of God?  The Man like &quot;When The Man Comes Around&quot; Johnny Cash.   The Man like Hulk Hogan who went NWO and liked to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_itzww0XTo">&quot;I&#39;m The Man Brother!!!?&quot;</a>  Hulk Hogan says he has Eyes to See and Ears to Hear which is a major theme in the Bible among Prophets.  Do you have eyes to see and ears to hear?  </p>

<p>When I first heard the song &quot;No Good&quot; by Kaleo, I soon posted it on my Facebook as something for God.  I was going for more of a &quot;When The Man Comes Around.&quot;  I later discovered an HBO series called &quot;Lucifer&quot; and that was the theme song.  I deleted it because it was uncomfortable afterwards.  It may have gave people the wrong impression.  </p>

<p><strong>Luciferianism</strong></p>

<p>Music is a theme in the Bible. King David was a psalmist. He was a musician and played for King Saul. Lucifer was an Angel and was said to be God&#39;s favorite and a musician. Not that David at any way equates with Lucifer, but there seems to be something profound with music and how it is used for spiritual things.</p>

<p>&quot;Sin City&quot; is an example of a song that has spiritual connotations. Ladders give and snakes take? A ladder would be Jacob&#39;s Ladder helping you up to heaven? A snake is an occultist or thief trying to steal some sort of truth or greater meaning of life from you? Trying to occult away spiritual things for himself in a corrupt way?</p>

<p>If you were to listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u8Ju_-OyNA">&quot;Sin City&quot;</a> and say it is a wicked song about going to Vegas for a sinful time you would not be wrong to see it that way.</p>

<p>Jonah goes into Nineveh. Jonah leaves Nineveh, and they greatly fear The Lord. What did Jonah do?</p>

<p>Jonah called Nineveh into repentance. The way &quot;Sin City&quot; is laid out, it could be listened to from the standpoint that a Jonah or Jesus like figure is going into Sin City, and he is going to win. He is going to call them into repentance or bring God&#39;s Judgement.</p>

<p><strong>Luciferian Secular Humanism</strong>  </p>

<p>Secular Humanism is Luciferian.  Given you have been following me, and reading what I post on Reddit, I have made strong argument.  I don&#39;t care to make it again here.  What I will point out is some Ties That Bind.  God works in particular ways.  Satan works in particular ways having to do with his character.  </p>

<p>Satan is a Joker.  We have Bush <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0QqkXOIfwI">&quot;The Only Way Out,&quot;</a>  a Luciferian song.  He blows up a hospital.  </p>

<p>We have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvKZq705t1Q">Joker in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;</a> blowing up a hospital.  </p>

<p>Satan is a liar and a thief.  He steal and &quot;occults&quot; knowledge.   </p>

<p>The Lord comes like a thief in the night.  (1 Thessalonians 5:2)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je84VupqD58">&quot;The Joker and the Thief&quot;</a> Wolfmother. </p>

<p>I may go further.  Given people don&#39;t understand this far, there may not be much point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I talk to God. </p>

<p>Doing research for God over Summer 2014 I learned that Satanists believe this is to be the age of Lilith.  Lilith was a rebellious woman that birthed demons and abominations.  </p>

<p>&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; by Madonna, is just a horrible song, and it is a corruption of things in the spiritual.  It is a song about a BJ.  To best illustrate it so you can see, I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM-1ETeSdXg">&quot;Like a Prayer&quot;</a> Post Modern Jukebox.  </p>

<p>How is &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; a corruption?  Christ is to man as man is to woman.  (1 Corinthians 11:3)  Man is the head, woman the neck turning the head.  The Greater Church is a Bride for Christ.  Turns his head.  </p>

<p>God&#39;s Love is Fatherly and Patriarchal.  It has nothing to do with sex.  &quot;Take Me to Church&quot; is another example of a bad song.  &quot;Holy&quot; Florida Georgia Line is a bad song for another reason.  It is a deception.  </p>

<p>Given Madonna is a Lilith like character she birthed a Brittany Spears and a Katy Perry and like minded females?  Katy Perry is all about some &quot;Dark Horse.&quot;  Taken in context of <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/03/11/got-thumos/">Plato and the Allegory of the Chariot,</a> and the Bible, God has a mighty Thumos, and we have a Conqueror on a White Horse.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals;[a] and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a voice like thunder, “Come and see.” 2 And I looked, and behold, a white horse. He who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.  (Revelations 6:1-2) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was sitting one day talking to God, and pondering Lilith.  I ask &quot;Could Lilith be an actual person?&quot;  I hear a voice that say Gwyneth Paltrow.   </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know anything about Gwyneth.  I had not hard feelings towards her.  She was a name I recognized, and that was about all.  I ended up doing some research.  She comes from a family with a Rabbi from Poland.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really have proof, and God didn&#39;t motivated me much to research, but I was seeing some things.  Alleging something with no proof is pretty rough.  It could be dangerous.  Bad precedent.  Still, when God firmly tells you a name like that, you give testimony about it.  I did so some months later.  </p>

<p>Tracking Satanism, I started just labeling it all &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot;  It is an ugly mess, but pretty much any University or major city you go to, you may find some occultists doing some sort of pagan rituals that may look similar to, or be a secularized version of, Baal Worship and Temple Prostitution.  </p>

<p>Keeping track of the news, I found out the Gwyen likes sex parties which is what I would term &quot;Eye&#39;s Wide Shut&quot; or &quot;Killing Kittens.&quot;  </p>

<p><a href="http://nypost.com/2017/02/01/inside-las-most-exclusive-sex-party/">http://nypost.com/2017/02/01/inside-las-most-exclusive-sex-party/</a></p>

<p>That is enough evidence for me to firmly state or postulate something about Gwyen.  </p>

Cyrus the great had 10,000 Immortals. Like 10,000 immortals in The Book of Enoch referenced in Jude 1:14? Nothing new happens under the sun? (Ecclesiastes 1:9-19) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am aware exactly who I work for, and am tested a lot.  </p>

<p>God created Adam.  The first man.  He later created Eve.  God still created her.</p>

<p>Christ is to man as man is to woman.  (1 Corinthians 11:3)  </p>

<p>Man is meek before God.  A woman is meek before her husband.  Given you read the Bible, that theme is consistent.  </p>

<p>God is love. (1 John 4:8)  God&#39;s love is fatherly.  God&#39;s love is Patriarchal.  I can prove God exists just off what Satan is doing.  You may not like the answers and go into willful ignorance.....it is what it is.    </p>

<p>Weirdos, like Madonna, like the making the 1 Corinthians 11:3 relationship weird.  She studies Kabbalah.  The song &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; is a song about a BJ.  She is hitting on some Temple prostitution.  God&#39;s love is not carnal.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what weak minded people often do when they know they are wrong or have doubts?  They play off their sin and wrong doing on someone else.  </p>

<p>You are misinformed and on the wrong side of history.  </p>

<p>I experience cause and effect with the Spiritual.  I talk to God.  He has a character.  Do you know who God is?  Faith is hard.  Someone  gets the character of God wrong?  They will not find him.  That is a slippery slope to paganism and heresy.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that you have the fortitude to grow in faith?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need a lie or deception to be Truth, and you keep asserting it. You need all Christians to be ignorant or in &quot;The Dark&quot; because you embraced  an identity that sets itself against God and Christianity.  Your friends like that?  They give you pats on the back?  You are accepted because of it?  It is an ego trip and a source of pride.  </p>

<p>Reject The World and love God.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father[a] is not in them. 16 For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. 17 The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever. (1 John 2:15)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I posted good things on <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a>.  Posting Good things to move people to God could get me down voted each and every time on <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a>.  I ended up banned for speaking Truth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christians are children of the light and not the dark.  Has someone you dated ever lied to you?  Did you accept that lie as truth?  You are in The Dark.  You accepted something false, and now have a false perception of The World.  It is like you are in a Cave of ignorance and deceit.  Jesus Christ is the shining light of the world.  He leads people out of The Cave.  </p>

<p>8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (Ephesians 5:8) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>5 You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. (1 Thessalonians 5:5)  </p>
