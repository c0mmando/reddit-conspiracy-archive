       Comet-ping pong may not have been directly involved, but there are absolutely pedo rings at the highest levels of society who keep getting away with it. Many victims have come forward from Hollywood, powerful governments, etc. Even if youre not conspiracy minded, if fucking Sandusky could get away with it using his influence as an authority figue in FUCKING SPORT imagine what the people in real power could do. Furthermore a disproportionate amount of high level authority figures are already known pedos! Modern technology, for all its flaws, has made it easier foe Joe Detective to get the goods on these diddlers. Look at how many have been caught in the last 20 years. The tide is turning.

       The problem with pizzagate (and may be by design) is it's too politicized. All those cocksuckers in DC are doing/apart of this. This shit needs to be re-branded ASAP, if we want true justice.

       Youre absolutely right. I think pizzagate was a deliberate disinfo campaign with nuggets of truths targeted at the alt right. Now the link in most people's mind is: concerned about powerful pedo rings=literally hitler

       Pizzagate is politicized because it's supposed to be. Why do you think that the vast majority of people talking about it nonstop are/were die-hard Trump supporters?
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of it was to be a distraction away from Trump and all the skeletons in his closet.

       to be fair it kinda makes complete sense that it would coincide that way. I mean Trump supporters probably made up a large percentage of the people who combed through the DNC leaks looking for dirt. And Trump supporters revealed a lot of their findings to other Trump supporters. Meanwhile Trump was on TV talking about crooked Hillary, crooked system left and right, and Hillary fans were limited specifically to the people who swallowed up the MSM bullshit. So it shouldn't come as a shock that there's more Trump fans than Hillary fans on top of this thing, or on top of any conspiracy material for that matter.

      <p>
       i mean, probably not now... i suspect they have cleaned their operation up now with the spotlight on. but... even if you are right, child trafficking is still illegal.  (i.e., even if you don't fuck the kids on site, parading the kids around like objects for sale is sick and illegal.)

       Nah man. Before pizzagate people didnt know that child trafficking
existed. Pizzagate opened the public's eyes! /s

      <p>
       I like how pizzagate apologist tried to revise its own history to be about child trafficking rather than blatant patisian witchhunting after finding nothing.

       Except i never denied that sex trafficking exists lol. However Pizzagate was never about that. It was a political smear campaign and that is it. Acting like it was anything else is simply being revising history to fit a narrative/into a better light.

       Did you know that the Catholic Church had a pedophilia scandal? You won't hear about it ever, except in this subreddit. There definitely wouldn't be like 5 Law and Order episodes, and a movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffmann about it.

       The term Pizzagate still put Child Sex and Human Sex Trafficking into the minds and faces of very average, everyday people. Pizzagate as an
       <em>
        amplifier
       </em>
       more than any other outcry of the past, struck really hard and red-pilled many, almost overnight.

       Unfortunately it really only amplified it for people that were already inclined to believe these kinds of things. How many people did pizzagate seriously convince of high level pedophilia that didn't believe it before? Probably not many. It was seen by the average person as a politicized witch hunt based on loose evidence, carried out by crazy conspiracy theorists. Not saying pizzagate is true or not, just saying its weak to go on a witch hunt then when it doesn't pan out to just be like oh it was an awareness movement!

       Well I humbly disagree. Many parents are now far more aware and this didn't come from the MSM it came from people being
       <em>
        connected
       </em>
       through
       <em>
        social media
       </em>
       and sites like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The symbols that were
       <em>
        exposed
       </em>
       Internationally (because of Pizzagate!) had been on the webbs for several years prior by alarmed and concerned parents...it just didn't
       <em>
        take off
       </em>
       and become a
       <em>
        five alarm
       </em>
       siren to the masses but Pizzagate helped do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been at this and in the trenches since the early nineties; I've never seen a more effective campaign than this one. Pizzagate is a term that causes people to think about the underbelly every time they order a pie or stick a slice in their face!
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate that others want to claim it has become a political witch hunt all slavered against the democrats but this just isn't true and at one point there was a massive long list posted (I'm still looking for it!) on the internet, with the Right Leaning politicians outpacing the Left Leaning politicians by quite a stretch!

       It hasn't been debunked, the echo chamber of ridiculing anything attached to the topic has caught on more because people are afraid to acknowledge overwhelming suggestive data.
      </p>
      <p>
       They bicker over the name and easily dismissable facts while forgetting that ALL ALONG the whole thing included a massive led network that had plenty of historical evidence before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And people come along and say the pizzagaters changed this and that, but it's bullshit.  The bottom line is the data that hasn't changed and where it came from BEFORE the pizza codes.  Pizza gate hashtag wasn't the beginning of anything except a viral marketing technique to shock interest people into the entire rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people looked in and turned away and call pizzagaters loons.  That's a majority of what we deal with because in the face of asking for proof they are given pages of links that end up starting Symantec arguments distracting from the entire point.
