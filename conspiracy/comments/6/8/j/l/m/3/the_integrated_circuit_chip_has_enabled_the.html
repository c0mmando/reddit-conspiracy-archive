        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a background in electronics from the US military.  I&#39;m an old head, and started with the Commodore 64, followed by the IBM 8086/8088 PC&#39;s.  Recently, I was reminiscing on the rapid rise in computing power and technological advances.</p>

<p>What invention/discovery precipitated this tidal wave of technology?  Simple - the integrated circuit (IC) chip.  It wasn&#39;t the vacuum tube or  transistor, it was the IC chip.</p>

<p>Surely this paradigm shattering invention must have an incredible story behind it.</p>

<p>Jack Kilby wound up getting most of the credit for the IC chip.  In fact, he was awarded the Nobel peace prize for it.  Amazingly, he is also the inventor of thermal printing and the calculator, among others.  Those are three big inventions, any one of which would be a pivotal point in one&#39;s career.</p>

<p>Ol&#39; Jack was a radio operator during WWII.  He served his time in a unit under the Office for Strategic Services “OSS,” the predecessor to the CIA.  He received two letters, rare for a simple radio operator:</p>

<p>Letter from Gen. Donovan, Director of O.S.S.</p>

<p>Letter from President Truman</p>

<p>Think about that.  A simple enlisted radio operator gets signed letters from the Director of the OSS and the President of the United States.    </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are a number of well deserved war heroes that received awards and letters.  These letters do seem out of place for a radio operator who served in Burma.</p>

<p>Now, Kilby leaves military service in 1947, earns an electrical engineering degree in 1947, and a masters in 1948. He may have started his education prior to the military.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00116/smu-00116.html">https://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00116/smu-00116.html</a></p>

<p>He belonged to the Acacia Fraternity.  This fraternity is based upon Masonic principles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acacia.org/moments-how-acacia-came-by-its-name/">http://www.acacia.org/moments-how-acacia-came-by-its-name/</a></p>

<p>Jack Kilby was a Mason.</p>

<p><a href="http://eb1870.org/project/jack-kilby/">http://eb1870.org/project/jack-kilby/</a></p>

<p>Jack Kilby attended State Universities.  He attempted to get into MIT, but couldn’t.  He was just an average student.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/kilby/index.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/kilby/index.html?pagewanted=all</a></p>

<p>“ In July of 1958, Kilby had been at Texas Instruments for little more than two months. The halls of TI were deserted as most of the researchers were on vacation. With plenty of time to himself, Kilby thought out how to build an integrated chip.”  </p>

<p>Beyond impressive, an average Joe figured out this critically important technological innovation while everyone was on vacation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/kilby/index.html?pagewanted=all">http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/kilby/index.html?pagewanted=all</a></p>

<p>Yes, there were two other people working on a similar design at Fairchild.  However, Kilby is credited with the invention, received the Nobel prize and he somehow came up with the hand held calculator and thermal printing.</p>

<p>Tesla claimed to have tapped into a universal knowledge source of consciousness.  I don’t know how Kilby obtained his ideas.  I just doubt the official story.</p>

<p>In my opinion, he was tapped to be the person whom this technology would enter public knowledge,  He was chosen due to his working with the OSS/CIA and being a dedicated mason, including his association with the Acacia Fraternity.  </p>

<p>Jack&#39;s papers are housed at DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University (top link).  If I was closer, I would go and dig.</p>

<p>“Later in his career, he developed a strong interest in books on technology and engineering leadership that recounted the story of major inventors and their innovations during the twentieth century and he enjoyed interacting with several of the authors.”  Perhaps it was a Freudian thing, wanting to know/understand actual inventors.  Pretenders also want to know who they are emulating.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/1510413.pdf">https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/1510413.pdf</a></p>

<p>The Acacia fraternity may be an important link.  This is a very interesting read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acacia.org/moments/">http://www.acacia.org/moments/</a></p>

<p>The Acacia fraternity talk about their masonic roots and Jack Kilby.</p>

<p>They also talk about one of there other members,  including Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner.  He was responsible for the creation of the International Geophysical Year (IGY).  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve looked at the IGY.  The Acacia  fraternity may be a linking mechanism for the Masonic cabal if you will.</p>

<p>This Berkner guy was also in the MJ-12 alien documents.  This could infer the Masons were part of that component of the alien deception.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if you respected Bill Cooper, but he talked of seeing a document regarding alien life forms while in the military.  His opinion was that it was fake and conveniently left out for him to see.  The hope was that he and other military members would talk about it years later and build the fake alien invasion hype.</p>

<p>The IGY, Operation High Jump, and the IC chip all happened in the mid 1950&#39;s.  </p>

<p>Whether the IC chip came from channeling demons, alien or prehistory technology is up for debate.  I just find the official IC chip invention narrative a bit difficult to swallow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. You may or may not know this but Acacia contains DMT (the active ingredient in Ayahuasca), which is a VERY powerful psychedelic, and possibly the source of Tesla&#39;s universal knowledge - many people who have taken DMT explain visions of dialogues with seperate entities that can reveal information, such as how to construct an integrated circuit.</p>

<p>Could just be that the psychedelics boosted his creativity a bit, could be a Masonic conspiracy.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never tried DMT.  Joe Rogan claims he talks to aliens when he smokes it.   I find it easier to believe that Joe Rogan talks to aliens than Kilby invented the IC chips.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acacia plays a HUGE role in the symbology of Freemasonry; some believe the biblical &quot;burning bush&quot; was really a metaphor for smoking DMT.</p>

<p>Though he&#39;s better known for his geology work, Randall Carlson touches on this in some of the Joe Rogan podcasts with Graham Hancock - Carlson himself is a Mason and goes over a bit of the symbology there. His analysis is about a lost ancient civilization not about receiving divine inspiration, but the gist is the same.</p>

<p>the &#39;Integrated Circuit&#39; was first &#39;conceived&#39; by in the early fifties, some paper written on what a good idea it would be.</p>

<p>so from point contact diodes in the thirties, to the first transistor in 1947 at Bell, then ICs conceived in 1952 or so.</p>

<p>and the very first ICs were quite simple and crude, BUT a massive step compared to Vacuum tubes or complex transistor circuits.</p>

<p>the first ICs were basically precision custom modules , either or for precision or repetitive circuits ie logic.</p>

<p>there were DTL !? logic circuits with a pin/leg pitch of .2&quot;, looking exactly like normal DIP circuits of the 80s but twice the dimension in xyz. only ever seen them once many moons ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The IC chip predates the pcb. What was being miniaturized was the vacuum tubes in early computers. An array of tubes could be built on one integrated solid state chip. It is not an intuitive leap to make even the first conceptual realization that a vacuum tubes switching function could be duplicated on a specially made cristal. From there its a lot of challenges​ to figure out all the material problems with getting circuitry integrated into the cristal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m atheist so I&#39;m not too worried about Lucifer. Also my father (now deceased) used to work at TI around the same time that Jack Kilby was there. My father had patents on some of the original crystal growing, and I have known people similar to Jack Kilby. Nothing seems out of place to me. The bulk of your assertion seems to be based on the fact that he came up with this inspiration during a period when there was nobody else around and he had free time. That seems like the perfect time to develop new ideas. If you&#39;ve ever worked at a place on the weekend when everybody&#39;s gone you quickly realize that you can be so much more productive then without the constant distractions of the normal work day. Also his invention wasn&#39;t that exceptional, he just figured it would be easier to put multiple transistors on a single wafer instead of 1 per a transistor. He was just the first. If not for him someone else would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a case of the breakaway civilization picking someone they could trust to control the release of this technology as it was due to happen naturally and the best course of action is to commandeer the public version of the tech as much as possible. </p>

<p>Strangely there have to be computers and much more which is 50-100 years ahead of public perception on technological progress. Some recent examples of a similar thing happening are almost laughable now with the internet. Can they disclose enough to keep a lid on things and maintain control of &quot;new&quot; discoveries or will the discoveries find themselves free via other means?  This is currently happening so things could get very interesting at any time or stay boring depending on how much people are paying attention and how long until they finally call for the truth about a few certain things.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If you believe thought is the only thing, and if you know it is a thing, you also know it doesn&#39;t vanish, it also doesn&#39;t change itself though it is a creator and communicates and I once was throttled about the origins of new knowledge, now that there is an accumulating and growing body of knowledge about a previous advanced civilization here on earth, it becomes more plausible. </p>

<p>Every thought ever is still here and available and accessible, I believe we have  been robbed of this tool by deliberate oppressive cultures that have dominated the most recent 10K years. </p>

<p>Tapped in is more like being tuned in and now I am leaning to the kind of focus we give some of our efforts, allows other thoughts in to join your own.</p>

<p>This is a problem for the AI creators, understanding the source of human intelligence.  </p>

<p>It is not all from conscious study and filling up with knowledge about this or that. I don&#39;t think very many of the great advances or talents were consciously acquired.</p>

<p>Some very learned/educated people are limited because they trust the system, or are forced by custom and rules and expectations to ignore the insights,  and wanting to believe they are the source of their own ideas and many others are by circumstance of poverty and opposition from existing institutions who would lose power to progress or like what we see now, a hording of the knowledge by a few. </p>

<p>I see books like Napoleon Hill&#39;s and others as trying to help people gain the ability to access and use this way of gaining knowledge. The Peal book was another  and the new understanding about using visualization and more recently using drawing the ideas to help Master Minding is another good tool and is Biblical from when Jesus said where ever 2 or three of you are gathered I am there, the &quot;I am,&#39; being this knowledge.</p>

<p>It always sounds like nonsense because we are bullied into ignoring and dismissing it  especially when it conflicts with tptb.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t mind using our collective and similar knowledge when they want us to focus or war here and there. </p>

<p>And sadly I don&#39;t think I know of any that undo the damage that blocks it,  our damaged brains from various kinds of harm from physical and emotional abuse wars and all the other cruelties we inflict on each other to be part of our societies. </p>

<p>And no I  haven&#39;t received  any financially useful to me tips or gifts of technology or any remarkable talents or knowledge gifts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>good post, OP!</p>

<p>The wikipedia page calls also calls it a &quot;monolithic integrated circuit,&quot; which is odd, considering recent conversations I have seen about &quot;the monolith&quot; in 2001... I wonder if there is a connection there. Much like the IC, the next development in computing, the quantum computer, shares the same symbolism. The DWave computer is often referred to as a black cube (like Saturn). I must admit that these things seem a bit esoteric to me, but I do not claim to understand how these things work. I have assumed that they function as calculators where numeric values are assigned to calculate functions programmed ahead of time. Could just be an ancient allegory for the mechanization of thought (and the dangers that it might present). Also, major leaps of 20th century science seem to have revolved around use of hallucinogens, which is weird af.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This story is interesting but a bit misleading. The IC chip was one incremental step in the development of modern computers. It was kinda obvious at the time that mass-production of transistor networks would be very desirable. The question was exactly how to do that from an engineering standpoint. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Invention">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit#Invention</a></p>

<p>If you read the Wikipedia article you&#39;ll see that Kilby&#39;s ICs were one design that was incrementally better and soon surpassed by others&#39; work. That&#39;s not to say he wasn&#39;t a smart guy, credit where it&#39;s due. But in context it makes sense that this invention happened.</p>

<p>Regarding his personal history, the OSS was heavily involved in secret matters including cryptography, which at the time required the worlds&#39;s first computers to decrypt enemy signals. This was a big secret because it enabled U-boat transmissions to be decoded, allowing convoys to avoid being sunk. So in his OSS radio work Kilby may well have heard of or worked with data from these early cryptographic machines. At the time, they had valves - transistors replaced valves, being smaller and cheaper to make in quantity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that it only looks like an explosion if you look at one event out of context. When you dig more into the history, it looks more and more like a series of small steps. </p>

<p>Most of the theoretical foundations of computing were developed before the start of world war 2, by prodigies such as Von Neumann <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann</a> . Look him up, he invented so many things... if anyone was an alien intelligence it was him. </p>

<p>During WW2, the allies invested huge resources - almost manhatten project resources - into making the theoretical computer a practical thing of engineering. They tried all sorts of mechanisms - cams, gears, valves, tape, drums, even liquids like water and mercury.</p>

<p>This PDF has a good overview of how it happened:

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know about Neumann. We all know he is responsible for a lot of things. The idea is though no one was even close to putting these things on a microchip, and all the sudden bam after 1947 it didn&#39;t take very long and things were moving at an exponential pace.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying it could not happen, but I&#39;m also not confirming it 100% could happen without help. I&#39;ve delved deep into the history of microchips. There are no real explanations as to how things matured so fast between 1947-1950s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all well and good. There is no real answer here. Bell Labs is pretty secretive about their stuff and no doubt much of that era is still top secret. We will never know until Roswell is fully understood. It has nothing to do with conspiracy really. We just don&#39;t know what happened. And until we do it is impossible to predict with certainty that we did not reverse engineer something.</p>

<p>There were of course many brilliant people working on these things. But to go from natural elements and tubes to doped silicon is a fundamental leap of the most dynamic kind. It changed everything from that point on. Yes, there was plenty of research into crystals, semi-conductors, and other things, but no one had even gotten close to putting it into a smaller microchip of doped silicon before 1947. Those things were unheard of, and no scientist in the mainstream could have ever thought it would come about.</p>

<p>Maybe in 20 years they will tell us more about this very curious time period.</p>

<p>thats how revolutionary technology works, people have ideas then suddenly the tech evolves to fulfill dreams.</p>

<p>modern desktop PCs and Moores Law, PCs and home computers of the early 80s were rather crude until the 16/32 bit ones evolved and made it to the desktop in the mid 80.</p>

<p>but the idea of even a cheap home computer on a table or in front of somebodys TV would have been outrageous in the 70s.</p>

<p>mid 1970s you had $50K minicomputers (by a desk in a filing cabinet unit) for the elite designers/engineers back then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion the development of these technologies is demonic technology in order to bring about the infrastructure for the NWO system. Often times the heads of many companies that have brought in major new technologies say they received information and inspiration while on drugs or other methods. Most recently admitted tech learned by this method is the iPhone. And then dude died a few years later. There is a conglomerate of people who actively appease the bringers of knowledge and they are used as pawns in exchange for money or power. The next phase we are entering into or already have is nano technologies required for the RF identification of every person on earth with live monitoring. This could be a vast system or overlapping system of different technologies like cell phones or iot devices but the end goal is still the same.</p>
