       Do you also find yourself scrutinizing his every step?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's not all of you but myself and many others are genuinely seeing the same people who complain that he's a conman and won't do anything to bring anyone down are also ultimately promoting the MSM to not allow him to investigate and try oh so desperately to smear him. Me? I don't think he's perfect but I do see an obvious attempt to smear him. This opens up many questions and doubts about the people who support this narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my real question is: How can he do anything if you don't allow him to by supporting the establishment's narrative and helping push it passionately? Am I being sarcastic when I say the irony is thick? Many people observe this and it's actually plain as day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you blame him but at the same time don't give him the space to do anything? Are you afraid of something? Is it fear that's holding you back? What is it? I'm curious to know if there is a real reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're complaining that he's ruining everything but I think that it's really you. I don't think you are doing it on purpose. Maybe some of you are. Maybe a lot of you are. But I think people are just confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       By being defiant against him you're stoping us by being truly critical of him and diminishing the chances of any investigations ever taking place. Right now you're being critical of him by the same narratives that's pushed by the veey same people that he's trying to take down...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you demand these investigations? Why don't you help to make them happen? Don't you want to see what will come of it? Don't you want to move forward so that we can also start holding Trump accountable? Don't you want to be in the driver's seat?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's wrong with backing down off him and have everyone rally and demand that he, as elected president re-opens an investigation? THEN IF he refuses we can start beoming doubtful of him. But we cannot put the man in a corner and expect him to bring down the matrix at the same time. Should we all not be working together? What's stopping you?
