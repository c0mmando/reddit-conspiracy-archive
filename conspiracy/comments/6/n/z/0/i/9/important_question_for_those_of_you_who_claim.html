        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do you also find yourself scrutinizing his every step? </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s not all of you but myself and many others are genuinely seeing the same people who complain that he&#39;s a conman and won&#39;t do anything to bring anyone down are also ultimately promoting the MSM to not allow him to investigate and try oh so desperately to smear him. Me? I don&#39;t think he&#39;s perfect but I do see an obvious attempt to smear him. This opens up many questions and doubts about the people who support this narrative. </p>

<p>So my real question is: How can he do anything if you don&#39;t allow him to by supporting the establishment&#39;s narrative and helping push it passionately? Am I being sarcastic when I say the irony is thick? Many people observe this and it&#39;s actually plain as day.</p>

<p>Why do you blame him but at the same time don&#39;t give him the space to do anything? Are you afraid of something? Is it fear that&#39;s holding you back? What is it? I&#39;m curious to know if there is a real reason. </p>

<p>You&#39;re complaining that he&#39;s ruining everything but I think that it&#39;s really you. I don&#39;t think you are doing it on purpose. Maybe some of you are. Maybe a lot of you are. But I think people are just confused. </p>

<p>By being defiant against him you&#39;re stoping us by being truly critical of him and diminishing the chances of any investigations ever taking place. Right now you&#39;re being critical of him by the same narratives that&#39;s pushed by the veey same people that he&#39;s trying to take down...</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you demand these investigations? Why don&#39;t you help to make them happen? Don&#39;t you want to see what will come of it? Don&#39;t you want to move forward so that we can also start holding Trump accountable? Don&#39;t you want to be in the driver&#39;s seat? </p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with backing down off him and have everyone rally and demand that he, as elected president re-opens an investigation? THEN IF he refuses we can start beoming doubtful of him. But we cannot put the man in a corner and expect him to bring down the matrix at the same time. Should we all not be working together? What&#39;s stopping you?</p>
