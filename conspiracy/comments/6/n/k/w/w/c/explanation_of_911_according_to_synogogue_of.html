        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This documentary called Synogogue of Satan covers the Zionists movements from the 1800s until 2006. It admits Rothschild is at the helm. As far as 9-11:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>By 2001, Zion controls most of the world&#39;s media and uses it to their advantage. It also has the US by the balls. According to FBI anon, it controls the US because it has pedophelia tapes on most politicians and they use this as blackmail. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel is Rothschilds own country with Mossad as his own spy agency. Mossad motto is: By way of deception make war. </p></li>
<li><p>Rothschild was unhappy with the Middle East for a few reasons. The afghans has stopped the opium trade and the lack of heroine causes financial losses for Rothschild. Both Iraq and Afghanistan didn&#39;t have a Rothschild central bank. Israel has a water supply problem and Iraq has a lot of water. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel orders the US through AIPAC. AIPAC is essentially an Israeli spy agency and a control base in America. AIPAC literally runs America and overrules actions made by the main government if needed. </p></li>
<li><p>Israel, through AIPAC, order the US to attack both Iraq and Afghanistan with plans to attack many other middle eastern counties for various reasons with the final country to be Iran. </p></li>
<li><p>Mossad agents posing as art students are given access to the Twin Towers. They use big moving trucks to move bombs back and forth and plant them in the buildings. </p></li>
<li><p>When the buildings went down, 5 of the Mossad agents were caught dancing in Arabic clothing while filming the collapse of the towers. They were arrested and later released becuase of Israeli orders from higher ups. Any and all evidence against Israel is destroyed, all apprehended Israelis are released, and any investigation against Israel is forced to stop. </p></li>
<li><p>Also, it mentioned that George W Bush had borrowed more money than all other presidents combined. All ex presidents borrowed a total of 1 trillion. Bush and Obama together brought the debt up to 20 trillion. The movie has a lot of parts where someone is moving our wealth and gold out of the country. We already know ten trillion is missing. It looks like they are trying to bankrupt the US and transfer the wealth to Israel to make Israel the future super power. </p></li>
<li><p>The good news was that around 2004, the Israelis were so afraid that the world would find out about them. They are currently trying to make it illegal to speak out against Zionism. I wonder how they feel in 2017 now that the masses are being rapidly redpilled on Zionism. </p></li>
</ol>
