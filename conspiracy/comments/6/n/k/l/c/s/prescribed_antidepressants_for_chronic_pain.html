       Edit 2: I just wanted to say that I really appreciate everyone taking the time to give me advice and support. I came to this sub expecting a lot of "antidepressants are government mind control" types of responses but I actually got a lot of good information instead. Thank you.

       Hey guys and gals,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry if this isn't a proper subject for this sub, but I wanted to see if this is something that anyone might have a theory about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have been dealing with chronic back pain for a few years. It's not crippling by any means, but it bothers me most of the time. I'm a young guy, and fit. I have had trouble getting doctors to take this seriously, because of that. They never seem to want to go beyond x-rays, which don't show damage to soft tissues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, my back started acting up and I spoke to my doctor. I specifically told him I don't want medication, I want to find a cause. Still, he suggested that I take something and gave me a prescription. I found out that this med is a type of antidepressant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never told any doctor that I felt depressed. And I really don't. Apparently this medication has shown to help with chronic pain, but like I said I would prefer to not have to take anything. But my doctor seemed so cavalier about prescribing me a pretty serious med, and didn't explain what exactly it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, it seems like so many people are being prescribed antidepressants and I find it hard to believe that so many people are legitimately depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there something else going on here? Is there a movement to get everyone on these drugs for a more sinister reason? Or is my doctor actually doing the right thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The medication is called nortriptyline. My point is, though, that I'm 26 years old and I feel like the only reason I would have pain like this is because of injury/damage. My back's been hurting since I was 18. I find it hard to believe that I would feel this way if there wasn't something seriously wrong. If I need surgery to fix a disc, then so be it. But I don't want to pop pills for the rest of my life.
