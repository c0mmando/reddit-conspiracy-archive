        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit 2: I just wanted to say that I really appreciate everyone taking the time to give me advice and support. I came to this sub expecting a lot of &quot;antidepressants are government mind control&quot; types of responses but I actually got a lot of good information instead. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey guys and gals,</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this isn&#39;t a proper subject for this sub, but I wanted to see if this is something that anyone might have a theory about.</p>

<p>So I have been dealing with chronic back pain for a few years. It&#39;s not crippling by any means, but it bothers me most of the time. I&#39;m a young guy, and fit. I have had trouble getting doctors to take this seriously, because of that. They never seem to want to go beyond x-rays, which don&#39;t show damage to soft tissues.</p>

<p>Recently, my back started acting up and I spoke to my doctor. I specifically told him I don&#39;t want medication, I want to find a cause. Still, he suggested that I take something and gave me a prescription. I found out that this med is a type of antidepressant.</p>

<p>I have never told any doctor that I felt depressed. And I really don&#39;t. Apparently this medication has shown to help with chronic pain, but like I said I would prefer to not have to take anything. But my doctor seemed so cavalier about prescribing me a pretty serious med, and didn&#39;t explain what exactly it was.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like so many people are being prescribed antidepressants and I find it hard to believe that so many people are legitimately depressed.</p>

<p>Is there something else going on here? Is there a movement to get everyone on these drugs for a more sinister reason? Or is my doctor actually doing the right thing?</p>

<p>Edit: The medication is called nortriptyline. My point is, though, that I&#39;m 26 years old and I feel like the only reason I would have pain like this is because of injury/damage. My back&#39;s been hurting since I was 18. I find it hard to believe that I would feel this way if there wasn&#39;t something seriously wrong. If I need surgery to fix a disc, then so be it. But I don&#39;t want to pop pills for the rest of my life.</p>
