       Also, I've read that when you really get down to it, the religion of Freemasonry is gnosticism/Luciferianism. But Judaism worships YHWH, who is the enemy of Lucifer, so how could Luciferianism be based on Judaism if Lucifer is the enemy of the Jewish God?

       <p>
        Not builders and blocks, "Master builder" is a specific Freemason term isn't it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. The word master comes from, and is still used by trades of all sorts, and yes is used within Freemasonry. But "builder" isn't a term we use. Craftsman, Mason, definitely terms we use, but not builder.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... but aren't you sworn to secrecy?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can't talk about the text of the degrees and the modes of recognition. That's it. If you want to know if we're doing something that I or any other Brother I've ever met has found objectionable, there's no one telling me not to share that information. Frankly, no one has to, as the most upset I've ever been at anything Masonic was finding out that the giant and delicious breakfast we had when I joined the Scottish Rite was a special thing for the anniversary and we weren't going to get that every time we went...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In other words even if I accurately described exactly what you were taught in the highest degree of Freemasonry, you would still deny it, right?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would neither confirm nor deny specifics, but a) I won't lie and b) I won't conceal any details of the broad strokes. I'll happily tell you that there are three main initiations and many side orders that you can join if you want, after that. I will tell you that the content of those degrees are basically allegorical stories, centering on Abrahamic traditions that convey a moral philosophy that you can find, more or less, in any cursory examination of the moral philosophies of the Enlightenment period. I can tell you that there's nothing that has ever made any Christian or Jewish Brother I've met uncomfortable. I can tell you that the degrees are beautiful in their simplicity and yet profundity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You wouldn't be allowed to say, "yes, that is correct. That is what we're taught for the highest degree.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, no I wouldn't, but not for the reason you think. There's no such thing as a "highest degree". There are probably thousands of Masonic degrees out there, and they're not laid out in an order. After the first three, there are 29 degrees in the Scottish Rite (plus an honorary one), 13 degrees in the main progression of the York Rite, the Shrine has its initiation and every little spin-off or concordant group has its own collection of degrees. There was even a group that used to do 99 degrees. Then every Jurisdiction has their own flavor of those. Sweden is so different that it's hard to figure out what groups you can and can't visit there if you were initiated elsewhere. In the US the Scottish Rite is a big deal, but in England, it's a minor side-order that few join...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is exactly what we believe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is tricky. There's no belief system that's part of Freemasonry. Every Brother has his own beliefs and Freemasonry doesn't tell you what that has to be. There are moral lessons and what you take away from those is based on your own personal perspective.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You would have to deny it because you have to guard the knowledge, or gnosis, right? Isn't that the meaning of [details that I won't confirm or deny] to symbolize that the masses are not ready to know the truth, and it has to be hidden from them and guarded by the Enlightened.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm sure there's someone out there who has that interpretation, but a) it's not
       <em>
        my interpretation
       </em>
       of anything in the degrees and b) there's no "right interpretation". I would say that view would be seen as fringe at best among the Masons I've met.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... But even this philosophy begs certain questions. The potential to become aware of true reality... how? Through what process?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, that's the trick, isn't it. Every group throughout history to hold these views from the Neoplatonists to the Gnostic Christians and so on have had different answers to that question. Hinduism is basically gnostic at its heart and it too has its own answers (many of them) to that question. But again, that has nothing to do with Freemasonry.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Lastly, why do I think Freemasonry is involved with a conspiracy? I mean didn't Albert Pike found the KKK?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. There is a long-standing speculation that he was involved early on when it was just a social club focused on southern culture, but there's no evidence to support even that claim. But based on his writing it's pretty easy to see that he would have had nothing to do with the violent, fanatical thing it became in its second or third incarnations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And wasn't he involved in the Civil War?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course. It was impossible to live through that period without being involved in some way. He started the war working with Native Americans, creating a fighting force for the southern states from tribal groups (with some limited success) and then resigned over differences with the southern leadership.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Not to mention Freemasons were involved with the Founding of America.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So were members of many groups. Freemasonry,
       <em>
        after the war
       </em>
       became symbolic of the brotherhood of those who founded the nation, but don't confuse the colorful storytelling for reality. Less than half of the founders were Freemasons and that included some heavy hitter non-Masons like Thomas Jefferson.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you really arguing that many of the smartest, most powerful people in the world join a single organization only to play bridge?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I love that you think that highly of us, but a) we don't just play bridge, we communicate an initiation that is the better part of a half millennium old and b) I think you're projecting, here. Perhaps it's you that thinks being a part of a group means that it has to have an agenda for society... I certainly don't think that way.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Freemasons have been involved in political movements for centuries, sometimes good sometimes not, but they tend to be involved.
       </p>

      <p>
       So do members of the Odd Fellows. Belonging to an organization and being involved in your community isn't sinister.

       There is basically no solid historical evidence to support this claim, much as many families in Scotland would love to have you believe it.

      <p>
       I don't think you're deluded. If I did, I wouldn't bother. I think you've been mislead by people who profit from it, simply enjoy chipping away at anything good or actually are deluded.

       <p>
        To be honest though I do sometimes think about if I should join Freemasonry and learn from more informed people.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's why I joined. "Hey, I've heard all this crazy stuff, less than half of which is probably true, why not join and find out..." Yep. That was me. Been a wild and wonderful ride since...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's just most my research regarding Masonry...
       </p>

      <p>
       Just don't confuse reading anti-Masonic screeds with actual research. Real research is hard work, but the crazy rants are just a google away.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I would worry if the chapter I joined somehow got word of that they wouldn't trust me or they would I only joined to confirm that it's evil or something like that.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure, if you walk in the door saying, "I want to prove you're bad guys," no one is going to want you. But if you go in with an honest curiosity and, more importantly, a desire to be a better person, then what you've said on the net in the past is not going to interest anyone.

       How did World Jewry start Islam? And why would they let Islam take over Jerusalem, only to need the Christian crusades to get it back, if Islam was their weapon
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Christianity not vice versa? Or did Islam get out of control, too powerful, a Frankenstein monster, so they had to go to their enemy, Christianity, for help to take it out?
