        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>there have to be enough of us, from independents, to communists, to anarchists, to libertarians, those whom never voted, and dissatisfied liberals even.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get why we cant just form a temporary revolutionary party and garner massive support on basis of a sort of government inquisition. the platform itself would be inquisition and exposition rather than making changes based on a conservative OR liberal agenda. it could have a charter breaking up the party after 8-16 years maximum, preferably only 4 even, not to directly even make the changes but to discover what ideas could be made without the influence of current leaders</p>

<p>if any agendas should be introduced, it should be agreeable to all like election reform, but its difficult to do without first proving it to be necessary to all. otherwise the masses will resist ignorantly. the point is to get people on the same page, or a similar one even. so they open their own minds to change gradually without interference</p>

<p>the point would be to open issues directly to popular debate and utilize direct democracy to guide the influence of executive action instead of party lines (in fact, directly opposed to all party lines and the &#39;traditional&#39; interests of the USA)</p>

<p>this promise would ensure relatively equal terms of control amongst parties and avoid any sufficiently radical change initially, </p>

<p>mostly it would be an inquisition to find out what the real problems are in the perspective of the people, rather than existing monopolies and colluders.</p>

<p>the point would be mega trust busting and regulatory elimination and replacement if possible where current regulations create artificial monopoly and overt political power -- but first the public must be made aware of the issues.</p>

<p>we need all our candidates to be willing to sacrifice their lives for the cause and die exposing the true positions that are in our interest</p>

<p>it seems almost impossible. but if we united our efforts over the next 8 years or so to build up a united front and a totally new third party -- one that vilifies itself in the media intentionally, and becomes the anticorporate party that everyone with power hates intentionally.</p>

<p>we can use the same tactics they do to manipulate the dissatisfied to join us and actually begin to make change by identifying the real problems without biased leadership</p>
