       Let's talk about that curious Trump quote a little.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's say Trump and Epstein were in cahoots with the pedo racket. Does it make sense that he would call himself out like that? It sounds much more, to me anyway, like an "I'm on to you, you weasel, and you better watch your back" sort of statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we are at it, did you know that it was also in the court testimony you cited, that Trump never deplaned at Epstein's island of horror (unlike the Clintons and Co did several dozen times.) Trump refused to exit and demanded a flight back to NYC. Maybe he was doing some recon. Maybe he just got freaked out by the creepiness. Dunno, but it's an important detail you left out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another little detail you may have missed from the Epstein transcripts- did you know that it was testified, under oath, that every time Trump visited Epstein's mansion, he refused to eat at the same table with him? He chose to eat in the kitchen with the staff. Doesn't sound like very good friends to me.

       Let's suppose that Trump did participate in underage girls (very unlikely considering his taste in wives but we'll run with this theory).Doesn't it make Trump,Bill C. and Hillary C. all look really,really bad?
