        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here&#39;s a screen shot I took of some of the comments. People are ripping into him for being biased in his &quot;reporting&quot;. </p>

<p>First off, here&#39;s the beginning of he&#39;s video...it&#39;s a &quot;Bon Iver&quot; song parody of his stupid antics. And he shared it himself, with this as the first frame of the video...</p>

<p>What a jackass...</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/fraasskqh/">https://postimg.org/image/fraasskqh/</a></p>

<p>How does this help out cause at all? This isn&#39;t spreading GOOD awareness or attention for us...</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/xic1mkw17/">https://postimg.org/image/xic1mkw17/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s another one</p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/4f34g1kk3/">https://postimg.org/image/4f34g1kk3/</a></p>

<p>He&#39;s promoting the spread of memes about him and encouraging his audience to do so. I think this is part of the planned &quot;character assassination&quot;.</p>

<p>Memes circulate if AJ acting like a dumbass loony tune, and people start to wonder, &quot;who IS this guy&quot;. So they do a search on him, find the conspiracy stuff, and it&#39;s automatically deemed &quot;wacky&quot; by association. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a great plan to associate a crazy wackjob, through viral memes and videos, to discredit the conspiracy culture and the information available online.</p>

<p>&quot;That jones guy is nuts. He believes 9/11 was an inside job and shit like that&quot;</p>

<p>Keep spreading the word and holding them accountable. We&#39;re dealing with something WAY more sinister than a simple money grubbing snake oil salesman. </p>

<p><strong>I think We&#39;re dealing with likely a CIA plant, who is being used to &quot;build&quot; a large following, and then burn it to the ground and desecrate that culture through the viral Internet circulation of his outlandish behavior.</strong></p>
