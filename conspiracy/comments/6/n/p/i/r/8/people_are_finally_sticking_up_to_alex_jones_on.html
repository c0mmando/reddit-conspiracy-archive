       Here's a screen shot I took of some of the comments. People are ripping into him for being biased in his "reporting".
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, here's the beginning of he's video...it's a "Bon Iver" song parody of his stupid antics. And he shared it himself, with this as the first frame of the video...
      </p>
      <p>
       What a jackass...

      <p>
       How does this help out cause at all? This isn't spreading GOOD awareness or attention for us...
      </p>

       Here's another one

       He's promoting the spread of memes about him and encouraging his audience to do so. I think this is part of the planned "character assassination".
      </p>
      <p>
       Memes circulate if AJ acting like a dumbass loony tune, and people start to wonder, "who IS this guy". So they do a search on him, find the conspiracy stuff, and it's automatically deemed "wacky" by association.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a great plan to associate a crazy wackjob, through viral memes and videos, to discredit the conspiracy culture and the information available online.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That jones guy is nuts. He believes 9/11 was an inside job and shit like that"
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep spreading the word and holding them accountable. We're dealing with something WAY more sinister than a simple money grubbing snake oil salesman.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I think We're dealing with likely a CIA plant, who is being used to "build" a large following, and then burn it to the ground and desecrate that culture through the viral Internet circulation of his outlandish behavior.
