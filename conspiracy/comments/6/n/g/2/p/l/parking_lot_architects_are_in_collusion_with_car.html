        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My local area has recently been being &quot;built up&quot;. There have been three shopping plazas being &quot;revamped&quot;, or opened, in the past two year span. These parking lots are actually set-up in such a fashion- that are heavily confusing and dangerous. I work within these plazas, and I have an office job where I can sit and analyze these driver interactions. They are tight, stop signs are misplaced, one way only, left turn only, round-a-bouts. All of it. My theory is that there is some form of collusion between car insurance companies and the people designing these parking lots. The parking lots actually foster car accidents/potential accidents- through poorly designed flow. Can anyone buy into this thought? I know that parking lots are usually designed so customers stay in the parking lot and consider shopping around more- but it is at the point where I truly believe that they want rear-ending or slight scuffs that get filed into insurance companies.I&#39;ve accounted for poor drivers, but even still- it is a bit ridiculous.</p>
