        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TREASON by Congress--which has practically abdicated oversight of DoD/CIA/FBI and votes for Funding without an Audit of DoD (as required).  How many in Congress own Defense stock--and does this ownership affect their view on war in Syria (looking at you, McCain)?  What about Congress kowtowing to Israel and other foreign powers?  If any country affects US politics--it&#39;s Israel (not Russia).  How is it Not Treason to allow drug/health/insurance companies to write our healthcare laws (which drives up prices and cheats future generations)?   </p>

<p>TREASON by DoD/intell agencies which provide LIES to go to war. Remember Colin Powell selling us and the world LIES at the UN--lies provided by CIA/DoD.  CIA/DoD also back &quot;rebel&quot; groups in Iraq and Syria...in fact, last year CIA rebels were fighting DoD rebels in Syria.  Who was the traitor?  The CIA&#39;s rebels or the DoD&#39;s rebels?</p>

<p>TREASON of the Corrupt MSM which acts as DoD&#39;s stenographer and repeats the LIES.  935 Lies in the build up for the Iraq War which the MSM gladly reprinted and disseminated to the public.  They no longer act as a Free Press; instead they check with DOJ before making their reports (like little children asking if they can go to the washroom).  The US press is supposed to act a as a check to the 3 branches of government--yet they spend all their time on Gossip &amp; Garbage.  </p>

<p>TREASON by POTUS -- committed by GW Bush, Obama and Trump -- they&#39;ve all protected Saudi Arabia from lawsuits and investigations into 9/11.  How is that NOT TREASON?  Even worse--they have all sold larger and larger weapons packages to Saudi Arabia.  </p>
