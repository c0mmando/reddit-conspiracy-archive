        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This goes way too deep.</p>

<p>Was it common knowledge that Donald Trump&#39;s uncle was a professor at <strong>MIT</strong> who prominently assisted in <em>WWII</em>? I can understand why the government wouldn&#39;t want to highlight this information. </p>

<p>Has this has been brought up in conspiracy circles and investigated further?</p>

<p>Have they successfully bombarded us with so many conspiracies and theories that we would overlook something as important as this? </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s family received Nikola Tesla&#39;s personal scientific research. It was immediately brought to John Trump to be interpreted when Tesla died.</p>

<p>LET&#39;S GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1943, as the technical aide in Division 14 of the NDRC, Trump reviewed and analyzed the papers of Dr. Nikola Tesla when Dr. Tesla died in a NY hotel. The research was completed on behalf of he Alien property Custodian office in Washington DC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_G._Trump">John Trump</a> worked alongside Alfred Lee Loomis</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During 1942, Trump became Secretary of the Microwave Committee, a sub-committee of the NDRC. The director of the Microwave Committee was Alfred Lee Loomis, the millionaire physicist, who decided to create a laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lee_Loomis">Alfred Lee Loomis</a> assisted in developing the atomic bomb as apart of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He invented the Aberdeen Chronograph for measuring muzzle velocities, contributed significantly (perhaps critically, according to Luis Alvarez) to the development of a ground-controlled approach technology for aircraft, and participated in preliminary meetings of the Manhattan Project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Alfred Lee Loomis</strong> helped build the first <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron">CYCLOTRON</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090825030639/http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/BERKELEY-LAB/images/97401421.lowres.jpeg">http://web.archive.org/web/20090825030639/http://imglib.lbl.gov/ImgLib/COLLECTIONS/BERKELEY-LAB/images/97401421.lowres.jpeg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080922015902/http://acs.lbl.gov/Seaborg.talks/65th-anniv/24.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20080922015902/http://acs.lbl.gov/Seaborg.talks/65th-anniv/24.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A March 1940 meeting at the University of California at Berkeley concerning the planned 184-inch cyclotron (seen on the blackboard),[15] from left to right: Ernest O. Lawrence, Arthur H. Compton, Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, Karl T. Compton and Loomis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first Cyclotron was patented by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Szilard">Leo Szilard</a>, who also worked on the Manhattan Project. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project&#39;s Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now here&#39;s where <strong>CERN</strong> comes to play. </p>

<p>The invention of the <em>first</em> Cyclotron lead to the invention of the <strong>Heidelberg Cyclotron</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>How did I come to this conclusion?</strong> The Heidelberg Cyclotron was proposed in 1932 by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gamow">George Gamow</a>, a Nazi physicists. Guess where George Gamow frequently visited? </p>

<p>The same place where they gathered to develop the first Cyclotron. This is how the Germans were able to build their own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gamow worked at George Washington University from 1934 until 1954, when he became a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CERN was established by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Bernhard_of_Lippe-Biesterfeld">Prince Bernhard</a>, and this was all a revenge plot against Nazi Germany...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After World War I, Bernhard&#39;s family lost their German Principality and the revenue that had accompanied it. But the family was still wealthy and Bernhard spent his early years at Castle Reckenwalde</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prince Bernhard gathered scientist to scourer Germany to retrieve all of his research on the <strong>Heidelberg Cyclotron</strong>. </p>

<p>Prince Bernhard helped form the <strong>European Organization for Nuclear Research</strong> (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of World War II, this report Prince Bernhard financed a private investigative force of over 200 former British and German intelligence operatives to scour Germany for all documents and scientific literature related to the Heidelberg Cyclotron— agreed to form and finance the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</p>

<p>Prince Bernhard, a former Nazi, was co-founder of the Bilderberg Group. Prior to World War II, he was a member of the Nazi Party of Germany and Reiter-SS officer whose “main/central” duty was securing Western nation funding for Waffenamt (German Army Weapons Agency) scientific projects— most particularly the Heidelberg Cyclotron.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group">Bilderberg Group</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group">Waffenamt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1954, he was a co-founder of the international Bilderberg Group, which has met annually since then to discuss corporate globalization and other issues concerning Europe and North America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is specifically why The Bilderberg Group funded, and created CERN. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The convention establishing CERN was ratified on 29 September 1954 by 12 countries in Western Europe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the <em>200</em> scientists who scoured Germany for Prince Bernhard&#39;s research on the Heidelberg Cyclotron. </p>

<p><strong>I hope you guys are understanding the implications.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Back to John Trump and Alfred Lee Loomis.</strong> </p>

<p>Loomis was responsible for inventing the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-complex">K-Complex</a>... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>K-complexes have two proposed functions: first, suppressing cortical arousal in response to stimuli that the sleeping brain evaluates not to signal danger, and second, aiding sleep-based memory consolidation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Memory-consolidation? </p>

<p>He also pioneered techniques for EEG&#39;s </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working with Edmund Newton Harvey he co-invented the microscope centrifuge, and pioneered techniques for electroencephalography.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy worked heavily with brainwave states. He understood, and valued the importance of the brains frequency. </p>

<p>Everything is connected. I hope we&#39;re starting to see the bigger picture. </p>

<p>Who else has gone down this rabbit hole? What other connections can we make? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book, &quot;Baron Trump&#39;s Marvelous Underground Journey&quot;, by Ingersoll Lockwood, came out in 1893. It&#39;s about a boy named Baron Trump who can time travel. His next book was called &quot;The Last President&quot;, of which the president had a cabinet member named Pence. The entire text of both booths are posted below.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without delving into the means of such a technology (cyclotrons, Tesla-based items, colliders, &quot;Hollow Earth Dweller&quot; technology, etc.), I&#39;d like to make a long spiel on theory and politics-<em>all from a point of radical speculation</em> (of course):</p>

<p>Borrowing from pop-culture, what we see from the recent installment of Twin Peaks, there seems to be a problem with reality shifts and perception. <em>Back to the Future 2</em> (which someone else already pointed out) also looks into this. One classic (and with this sub) is &quot;X-Files&quot;, and they had an episode (&quot;Synchrony&quot;) involving MIT (SPOILER) and time travel and someone coming back to warn of the misuses of it and the chaos it will cause. Heck!-I just see &quot;JamesColesPardon&quot; as being a moderator, and I can tell this is a popular subject and one not afraid to allow pop-culture speculation. </p>

<p>Supposing some agency has access to such a time machine, a lot of what is being documented on <a href="/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix">/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix</a> and <a href="/r/MandelaEffect">/r/MandelaEffect</a> would attest to this. I even venture a guess (which I will explain) that a few entries in <a href="/r/Dreams">/r/Dreams</a> can come into play here. These are observed effects created by a tampering of forces by entities attempting to exploit to get the inside track or jump ahead on a situation or the ability to steer destiny to their whim. These agencies/entities can be influentially local, worldwide, or even  a distant nation that has recently acquired a large amassing of wealth (through extortion and robbery), is stupendous at chess-like strategy, and has no ethical hesitation with tampering with the (online) media and politics of other regions.</p>

<p>Such tamperings may have to be done cautiously though. It may involve seeding little lies gradually here or there, influencing channels here or there, and it would be in the best interest of those doing the time traveling to not go back too far in time or they would jeopardize their own existence (so getting landmark dates on when time travel could be theoretically achieved is crucial).</p>

<p>What if such tamperings cannot go completely unnoticed? When one tampers with time, you are creating shifts in timelines and probable outcomes (unless we delve further into the never-ending debate of paradoxes of self-sustaining looped-enclosed &quot;tampering is and was and will be part of history&quot;-which I&#39;d like to forego here); this was depicted in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise. One can speculate something metaphysical can be observed with such shifting of outcomes: psychic or spiritual energy that can picked up as echoes in the mind or in dreams. Maybe some mindsets can be receptive and &quot;feel reverberations&quot; from other probable timelines running closely parallel to the one they are in. Yet...</p>

<p>If one wants to be reductive, that theory is not solid. Most, reductionists, however, will acknowledge the untapped potential of the subconscious mind that always perceives, always retains, and always calculates and sorts matters out to the best of it&#39;s limited perception. Granted, there are far too many &quot;wild card&quot; variables that the subconscious may not grasp, but if the subconscious realm of an individual has enough retained as pertaining to a certain chain of local and personal events and those get strangely interrupted in a manner that completely throws off the calculated expectations (or recollected calculations of what the &quot;outcome should&#39;ve been&quot;) the subconscious mind has anticipated, then the individual is going to perceive such disruptions as &quot;glitches&quot;, de ja vu, coincidences that are out of phase with a predicted time scheme, dreams, Mandela effect, etc. The subconscious mind perceives and interprets it as a stark and dramatic error of some sort to be observed. This still might not explain such phenomenon as synchronicities where someone will say something just as you are thinking it or odd time loss/skips (unless someone can weave a far more interesting over-arching time travel theory then the screed-like speculation I present here).</p>

<p>The chance for a paranoiac slide is still there though. If one has issue with inconsistencies or odd shifts as it applies to pop culture or other objectively witnessed events, this might be something that affects all who are being observant to catch tamperings going on that reverberate on a vast level. It may very well be something that can be observed by an individual but has no personal interaction or involvement with said individual.</p>

<p>Yet, when something seems more localized or personal, one can&#39;t help but feel they are being targeted. If an agency were elaborate enough they could tamper with ones dreams and expectations <em>without</em> time travel (ie. the Avengers episode &quot;Death&#39;s Door&quot;-1967). </p>

<p>Yet, what if an agency felt certain individuals interfered with their attempts to sway politics....one would have to ask themselves some serious questions----questions like &quot;what am I to them?&quot; or &quot;at what point did I start noticing these disruptions?&quot; or better still, &quot;are there any individuals I&#39;ve met with the ability to disrupt or influence my situation in any given aspect that really have no strong perceivable roots in my locale?&quot;-that is to say, are there free-floating individuals who just breezed into your town, community, job, or an organization you are a part of that may claim to have family or a past, but you have never personally witnessed any solid evidence of such a backstory? Well, that can inspire a whole lot of unstable paranoia, when one contemplates that that one particular over-confident co-worker or drinking buddy might be a time-traveler sent to sway you from interfering with things.</p>

<p>So, the best remedy in such a situation is to be observant, keep constant records, keep a cool head and spirit, juggle theories (without adamantly adhering to just one) and stay on course with sharing the most accurate information you can provide on the topics that threaten power-hunger entities/agencies the most.</p>
