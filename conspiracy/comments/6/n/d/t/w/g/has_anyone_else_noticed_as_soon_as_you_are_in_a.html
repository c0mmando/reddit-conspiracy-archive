       I've noticed this today in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a great way for either shills or useful idiots, to "suck you in" to a partisan argument. It's like a trigger. I've been scouring the boards here so often that I almost block out the word "Russia" at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia acts as a distraction and a shield against criticism for the current administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Criticizing the president? You must buy the Russia story!"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And why do people still honestly think that Hillary legitimately was beaten by her opposer? Some of you still think the establishment was bamboozled and their "puppet" lost. No dummies! BOTH nominees are "selected" and they write a stupid script and a story and use the MSM to beef it up and get you involved, like a fucking movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       They stage the fuck out of these phony elections. I hate hearing stupid shit like;
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Well, the
        <em>
         liberal
        </em>
        demographic was disenfranchised allowing for a victory blah blah"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       "The
       <em>
        conservative
       </em>
       base was largely rejecting the frontrunner blah blah..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about this shit as if these factors legitimately had an effect on the outcome. Some of you guys still think there is a degree of reality to this world we live in. Knowing that every facet and element of our elections are rigged, is like the FIRST thing I learned as a theorist. That's like conspiracy 101...
