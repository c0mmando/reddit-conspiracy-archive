        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed this today in particular. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a great way for either shills or useful idiots, to &quot;suck you in&quot; to a partisan argument. It&#39;s like a trigger. I&#39;ve been scouring the boards here so often that I almost block out the word &quot;Russia&quot; at this point.</p>

<p>Russia acts as a distraction and a shield against criticism for the current administration. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Criticizing the president? You must buy the Russia story!&quot;</strong></p>

<p>And why do people still honestly think that Hillary legitimately was beaten by her opposer? Some of you still think the establishment was bamboozled and their &quot;puppet&quot; lost. No dummies! BOTH nominees are &quot;selected&quot; and they write a stupid script and a story and use the MSM to beef it up and get you involved, like a fucking movie. </p>

<p>They stage the fuck out of these phony elections. I hate hearing stupid shit like;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Well, the <em>liberal</em> demographic was disenfranchised allowing for a victory blah blah&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Or </p>

<p>&quot;The <em>conservative</em> base was largely rejecting the frontrunner blah blah...&quot;</p>

<p>Talking about this shit as if these factors legitimately had an effect on the outcome. Some of you guys still think there is a degree of reality to this world we live in. Knowing that every facet and element of our elections are rigged, is like the FIRST thing I learned as a theorist. That&#39;s like conspiracy 101...</p>
