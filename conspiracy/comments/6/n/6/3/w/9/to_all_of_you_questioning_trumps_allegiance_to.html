       About a month ago Trump goes to Israel, The Vatican, and Saudi Arabia. About 2 or 3 weeks after he leaves, Saudi Arabia turns on Qatar and says they are supporting terrorists. About the same time Israel turns on George Soros. Also about the same time 2 of the Popes top guys get caught up in gay orgies and the other child sex as the Vatican starts to turn on the Pope. You really think that was all a coincidence??  Theres NO WAY that is a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think Trump isn't about to drop a JFK and or 9/11 and or ISIS bomb and that's why these entities are jumping ship? When you hear someone say "x" controls US government or controls ISIS or done 9/11, who usually is "x"?  Its always Saudi Arabia, or Vatican or Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is currently in France. Should we expect something outstanding from them in the next few weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
       You really think its a coincidence that all the "terrorist attacks" have shifted from the US to Europe now that Obama isn't President and Trump is?  Why are all these "refugees" showing up in Europe but not so much in the US?  I bet if the previous President was still in charge they would be here right now by the boatload (just ask the illegals he bussed in when he was in charge).
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS on the verge of being destroyed. Trump has been President 6 months. Obama President 8 years and couldnt stop ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what the first step in ending a cabal would be?  Getting rid of their mouthpiece. Right CNN?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said his intentions are to drain the swamp. I think the swamp was bigger than expected. But have no doubt, he is draining the swamp!
