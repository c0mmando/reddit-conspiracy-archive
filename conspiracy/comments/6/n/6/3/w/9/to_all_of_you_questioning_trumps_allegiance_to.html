        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>About a month ago Trump goes to Israel, The Vatican, and Saudi Arabia. About 2 or 3 weeks after he leaves, Saudi Arabia turns on Qatar and says they are supporting terrorists. About the same time Israel turns on George Soros. Also about the same time 2 of the Popes top guys get caught up in gay orgies and the other child sex as the Vatican starts to turn on the Pope. You really think that was all a coincidence??  Theres NO WAY that is a coincidence.</p>

<p>You think Trump isn&#39;t about to drop a JFK and or 9/11 and or ISIS bomb and that&#39;s why these entities are jumping ship? When you hear someone say &quot;x&quot; controls US government or controls ISIS or done 9/11, who usually is &quot;x&quot;?  Its always Saudi Arabia, or Vatican or Israel.  </p>

<p>Trump is currently in France. Should we expect something outstanding from them in the next few weeks? </p>

<p>You really think its a coincidence that all the &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; have shifted from the US to Europe now that Obama isn&#39;t President and Trump is?  Why are all these &quot;refugees&quot; showing up in Europe but not so much in the US?  I bet if the previous President was still in charge they would be here right now by the boatload (just ask the illegals he bussed in when he was in charge). </p>

<p>ISIS on the verge of being destroyed. Trump has been President 6 months. Obama President 8 years and couldnt stop ISIS. </p>

<p>You know what the first step in ending a cabal would be?  Getting rid of their mouthpiece. Right CNN? </p>

<p>Trump said his intentions are to drain the swamp. I think the swamp was bigger than expected. But have no doubt, he is draining the swamp! </p>
