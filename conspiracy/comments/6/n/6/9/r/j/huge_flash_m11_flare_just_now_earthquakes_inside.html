Was expecting something like this all week. Sunspot region 2665 just exhibited a <a href="http://www.solarham.net/xray.htm">flash M1.1 flare</a> with a likely westlimb cme. This will likely lead to a 7.3 - 6.3 magnitude quake. 
Because a speeds not reported nor associated cme I speculate 3-7 days (no sooner nor later). 
<strong>Sunspot 2655 was a beta-gamma spot</strong> heightened conditions for a larger amplitude event. </p>

<p><strong>Regions on earthquake watch:</strong> <strong>Philippians</strong>, <strong>Nepal</strong>, <em>chile</em></p>

<p>These regions all are late in their annual cycle. The Philippians showing the highest likelihood annually, Nepal being the most dormant.</p>

<p>Another last place of concern is the newmexico and chilean faults. While, concerning they appear to show less liklihood of a future series of this proportion. Their annual activity was ripe earlier in the year, and I feel their faults have settled. Just mentioning we will likely see activity in all areas in the following week. With the largest activity being in one of the three primary selected locations. </p>

<p>Still need programmer&#39;s-  update and general life update.

<p><strong>Ok. I am offline next few days. Sorry.</strong> 
I have a date with a freaking beautiful girl named angelica, nd seriously... WoW. I actually feel hopeful for a change guys. We&#39;re going camping for the first time! Wish me luck ya!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p><em>July 14, 2017 @ 09:30 UTC</em></p>

<p>Long Duration M-Flare and CME (UPDATED)</p>

<p>Finally a noteworthy event to report. A long duration M2.4 solar flare was observed around region 2665 in the southwest quadrant beginning at 01:05 UTC (July 14th). </p>

<p>The flare was associated with a 10cm Radio Burst (TenFlare) lasting 44 minutes and measuring 130 solar flux units (SFU). A Type IV radio emission was also logged at 02:02 UTC. Updated imagery by SDO suggests a coronal mass ejection (CME) is associated. More updates to follow.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE #2</strong> Earth facing coronagraph imagery is now available. A bright coronal mass ejection (CME) was produced, but was directed mostly to the west. There does still however appear to be an Earth directed component that could reach our planet within 72 hours. This could lead to a geomagnetic enhancement at higher latitudes. It should also be noted that a minor (S1) radiation storm is now in progress as fast moving particles propelled into space by the flare are now moving past our planet. More updates later today regarding an approximate arrival time. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 3</strong> <strong>The STEREO Ahead spacecraft confirms that a halo CME is associated with this event and could have an Earth directed component. More to follow.</strong></p>

<p><strong>M 2.8 with cme boys- thats a biggie-</strong></p>

<p><em>Click</em> <a href="http://www.solarham.net/data/cme/07142017_m2.4.wmv">HERE</a> <em>to see a short video of the CME.</em></p>

<p><strong>This could be a 7.8- 8+ magnitude event! M 2.8 is not welcoming-</strong> <em>This will not be good</em>!</p>

<p>Another factor is the coronal hole group following </p>

<p><a href="http://www.solarham.net/regions.htm">View the current Solar Lens</a></p>

<p>There is a coronal hole group numbered: <a href="http://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211b.htm">13</a> Following this sunspots cme. This is certainly going to increase the original forecast from 6.0 territory. </p>
