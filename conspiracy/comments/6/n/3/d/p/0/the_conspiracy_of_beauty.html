        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Edit: It&#39;s kind of funny I write about reptilians and crap, but this post seems to get attacked.</p>

<p>Have you ever met a secure women? Chances are if you have, it is not any woman 35 or younger.</p>

<p>This is going to sound clich√©, but I feel the perspective is important. Growing up, I was bombarded by a multitude of sources saying I would never be good enough. No matter what I did, I would never ever be pretty enough. I was a teenager in the 2000s (I&#39;m 27 now), so I was right in the middle of the social media transformation. Even before social media, though, there were plenty of things to make me feel insecure. Our media programmed me and my friends and basically every girl I ever knew to hate themselves. When I look back, I was never ugly. In fact, I was quite pretty. So why was the entire world telling me the opposite?</p>

<p>Perhaps that is a normal part of growing up, but something tells me there is all something deeper to this. What worries me more than ever is what is happening to girls today. I thought I had it bad...</p>

<p><strong>Selfies</strong></p>

<p>We all like to joke about them, but selfies are warping people&#39;s minds, especially young girls. I have to spend a lot of time around teenage girls since I am a teacher. Gone are the days when girls hang out and talk. I am not lying or exaggerating when I say any moment they have is spent taking selfies, browsing selfies on social media, and then taking more selfies. Studies show that these selfies are really linked with low self-esteem:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/24/health/selfie-self-esteem-trend/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/24/health/selfie-self-esteem-trend/index.html</a></p>

<p>For one, selfies give people a false perception of themselves. Almost no one looks as good in real life as they do in a selfie. The filters and apps create a way for people to literally transform their entire images, from face-thinning tools to apps that make your eyes look bigger. There is a never-ending supply of apps telling you are not beautiful enough. When I was a teen, I&#39;d take pictures with my friends and not think twice. Now, one spends hours from thousands of angles to find that perfect shot for the most likes possible.</p>

<p>There is this strange juxtaposition between complete narcissism and almost no self-esteem. Our teenagers are growing up to see every flaw in themselves, and they simultaneously cannot stop obsessing over their images.</p>

<p><strong>Only Beauty Matters</strong></p>

<p>A few years ago, I made a post on a feminism sub (I was a different person then). I asked, &quot;Why is feminism only about beauty?&quot; I got downvoted like crazy, of course, but I asked why we could not curb feminism to be more about our inner values. In fact, isn&#39;t it okay for a woman to be ugly? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to say not ALL women are beautiful, but beauty doesn&#39;t <em>really</em> matter? What matters is who we are on the inside....right? They didn&#39;t like that.</p>

<p>In the years since, the body positivity movement has exploded. First and foremost, I think this movement is inherently flawed for many reasons. I am going to go beyond the health argument, and I am going to say that this movement is promoting the wrong concepts. Again, there is this huge emphasis on beauty, and you never hear about women without being linked to beauty. So, in their efforts to empower women, all these feminists are really saying that a women should sit their preoccupied with beauty - not health, not intelligence, not kindness. Is it no wonder women are unhappier than ever?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/26/women-wellbeing-unhappiness">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/26/women-wellbeing-unhappiness</a></p>

<p>Does anybody see the irony in any of this?</p>

<p><strong>Beauty and Beyond</strong></p>

<p>Today, more than ever, women are losing a grip on reality, and body dysmorphia is a real issue, not just a &quot;first world problem&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-33190297">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-33190297</a></p>

<p>I admit that I love makeup, being &quot;feminine&quot;, and looking pretty. However, when looking at beauty products today, I am almost overwhelmed. I know beauty products have always existed, but the way we see beauty has transformed. I was watching a makeup tutorial from the 60s and 70s, and the point of makeup was to highlight your best features but stay &quot;natural.&quot; Today you can literally contour the entire shape of your face into an entirely new face. You can become an entirely different person through fake eyelashes, hair extensions, and even plastic surgery. I do not know how many things I have read about men feeling betrayed after a women takes off all of her &quot;stuff.&quot; People in the comments usually call the men assholes, but it <em>is</em> deceiving.</p>

<p>The thing is, I am not technically against beauty products. I use them myself. What I am against is the feeling that no matter what women do, they will never be good or beautiful enough - and no amount of beauty products, selfies, and likes will validate them.</p>

<p>I also want to argue something. I think most women really are beautiful. If women maintain a healthy weight, take care of themselves, and maybe dress nicely and accentuate their best features, I believe that is really all they need. </p>

<p>Of course, though, this affects men, too. When men are only seeing images of women at their best and completely done up all of the time (in the media and porn), then they too either consciously or unconsciously start to expect women to really look like those images. Even in the magazines where they have celebrities &quot;not wearing makeup&quot;, well they are wearing makeup 99% of the time.</p>

<p>There are really no realistic standards of women&#39;s beauty, and women&#39;s minds begin to warp.</p>

<p><strong>So, What&#39;s the Conspiracy?</strong></p>

<p>To me this is all intentional, and, there are reasons for this type of programming. </p>

<p>1) When a women can never feel good about herself, how can she find a proper relationship? This also impacts sex. So many women I know won&#39;t have sex with the lights on because they are so ashamed of themselves. They won&#39;t take off their shirts in bed. Instead of all of this beauty bombardment empowering women, it actually makes them feel weaker and more insecure. While there are many factors that have contributed to the decline of marriage, I truly believe that feminism is one of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865629093/US-marriage-rate-hits-new-low-and-may-continue-to-decline.html">http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865629093/US-marriage-rate-hits-new-low-and-may-continue-to-decline.html</a></p>

<p>(Decline of marriage article)</p>

<p>Feminism is telling women to focus on vapid things - not on transforming one&#39;s inner self. Feminism is telling women to feel great about themselves all of the time no matter what - they are beautiful and they are great and every man should love them! At the same time, the media is subtely telling women they can never be good enough, and the only way to feel better is to buy a specific product. </p>

<p>Sometimes I peek at my friends as they browse their phones. They spend hours looking at images of other women, comparing themselves incessantly. Instead of using the power of technology to read or learn something, they are spent obsessing on meaningless, fleeting things.</p>

<p>While I do not necessarily agree with all the viewpoints of  the Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) movement, is it any surprise that men do not want to fall into a relationship with these types of women?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdwyx/inside-the-global-collective-of-straight-male-separatists">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7bdwyx/inside-the-global-collective-of-straight-male-separatists</a></p>

<p>I know this post was not specifically about feminism, but to me there is no way to separate feminism and beauty anymore. Anyway, secure women make for good relationships. Insecure, image-obsessed women do not. How can a man love a woman who is only in love with herself? Or rather, how can a man love a woman who secretly hates herself?</p>

<p><strong>MK Ultra Programming</strong></p>

<p>Since this is a conspiracy sub, we should get to the deeper conspiracy. Mk Ultra isn&#39;t just for crazy celebrities. I believe the programming is inherently built into television programming and other forms of media. </p>

<p>Beta sex kitten programming is part of this mk ultra, and I feel it is directly intertwined with media for young girls intentionally.</p>

<p>&quot;Beta is referred to as ‚Äúsexual‚Äù programming (slaves). This
programming eliminates all learned moral convictions and stimulates the
primitive instinct, devoid of inhibitions. ‚ÄúCat‚Äù alters may come out at this
level. Known as Kitten programming, it is the most visible kind of programming
as some female celebrities, models, actresses and singers have been subjected to
this kind of programming. In popular culture, clothing with feline prints often
denote Kitten programming.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nicholson1968.com/nicholson1968s-post/sex-kitten-programming-occult-symbolism-katy-perry">http://www.nicholson1968.com/nicholson1968s-post/sex-kitten-programming-occult-symbolism-katy-perry</a></p>

<p>A woman&#39;s identity becomes completely intertwined with her sexual identity. Nothing else matters but validating her sexual appetite, making her a slave to her own desires. </p>

<p>Sex positivity is strong on Reddit, where every aspect of sex is seen as inherently good. &quot;Slut-shaming&quot; is a terrible thing, and women should feel proud for &quot;empowering&quot; themselves through sex. Again, this is always masqueraded as a way to uplift women, but in reality they are broken down further.</p>

<p>More women are sex positive and hooking up, but is that going against their natural instincts? This article explains why women really do get attached after sex:</p>

<p><a href="http://elitedaily.com/women/oxytocin-science-makes-harder-women-casual-sex/">http://elitedaily.com/women/oxytocin-science-makes-harder-women-casual-sex/</a></p>

<p>And well, isn&#39;t attachment part of building long-term relationships? Attachment is not inherently a bad thing, but women are being told that they should exist in a world where love and sex do not need to coexist.</p>

<p>Sex becomes the primary goal of a woman&#39;s life, and she tries to validate her existence that way. </p>

<p>The programming is in the media, by the way. Think of all the television shows where they have normalized having hundreds of sex partners. That is normal, right?</p>

<p>I always go back to Brave New World, but it is startingly accurate of what our society is or is in the process of becoming.</p>

<p><em>You can&#39;t consume much if you sit still and read books.</em></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I wrote this because I had a student this year who came to me. She asked me why God made her fat and ugly. She is in the 8th grade, and she has already had numerous partners (gossip spreads). She is addicted to snapchat and constantly taking selfies. She wants nothing more than to feel beautiful and validated.</p>

<p>She is beautiful, but she will never see that. But even if she wasn&#39;t, isn&#39;t that OK, too? I told her she was beautiful, but I also told her she needed to find different role models than Kim Kardashian. I told her about her other great qualities and how she can build them throughout her life. I tried to serve as a role model myself.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s sad is that I look in the mirror, even now, and I see everything &#39;wrong&#39; with me. I then snap out of my programming and realize that I am beautiful, and even if I was not, there is more to life. I am 27 years old and it is taking a lot to break the programming that told me I could never be good enough.</p>

<p>&#39;They&#39; want women to feel this way. They want them to be distracted by materialism, consumerism, and vanity - not anything deeper or spiritual.</p>

<p>Whether you are religious or not, this verse is telling.</p>

<p>Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised (Proverbs 31:30)</p>

<p>We have women focusing on the fleetingness of beauty, not their inner-selves.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that studies show that women tend to be more spiritual than men:</p>

<p>So &#39;they&#39; must corrupt that in the end.</p>

<p>As always it takes me along time to write these posts. Please don&#39;t downvote because you disgree, but rather let&#39;s discuss!</p>

<p>&#39;They&#39; want women to feel this way</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They want everyone to feel this way. People of any gender are being told that being overweight/ugly/bald/whatever it is, is unattractive. So people are always chasing after this &quot;perfection&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist on the surface. What people don&#39;t realize is that we are perfect when we assert our values, live by them, and don&#39;t let any one or any thing change those values. Some people don&#39;t do things for moral reasons. Other do them because they don&#39;t have those same reasons. But we should all be able to communicate with each other in a way that each party can know about the benefits of either side without labels coming up. The only real beauty is inwards - the realization that you have always been perfect because you&#39;ve always been trying to accomplish things. We don&#39;t need the things we buy or do, but we choose them. And those choices define who we are and the type of world we live in. Which is why I choose to give myself a strong moral code. But it is done for myself, not to impress any other</p>
