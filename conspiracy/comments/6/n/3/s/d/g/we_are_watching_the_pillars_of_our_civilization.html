       Trump Jr releases damning evidence of collusion and conspiracy to rig the election with Russia.  Just in time to distract from the battle for Net neutrality, which should more accurately be called the battle to preserve humanity's greatest ever forum for freedom of speech and the press.  Just in time to distract from the plan to cut Medicare, which covers half of all births.   The teeming masses (AKA we) are under attack.   Distracted by information overload.  Divided by race,  religion, nationality, and wealth status.  Made to feel helpless by the enormity of the issues.   Made to feel justified because: Foreign countries are taking our jobs; Foreign religions are attacking our way of life; Foreign governments are attacking our democracy; the other political "side" is totally unreasonable; the other socioeconomic "side" is taking our money/ health care (i.e. security).
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple truth is that it's the powerful vs the weak.   The few vs the many.  The wealthy vs the poor.  The violent vs the meek.  The secret vs the public.  We the people,  the teeming masses, stand to lose everything.  The ability to communicate is perhaps the most important because without communication we will again be isolated from one another within our little communities.   We won't hear about the next Arab Spring because it will be censored.   We won't hear about the next Flint Michigan,  or even Wikileaks.  We are headed back to the dear old dark ages where the holy word is spoken in a language we don't understand,  the information we need encoded behind the firewalls of wealth.  It's not a coincidence that Latin was the language of the wealthy and educated back in Luther's day.
      </p>

       We deserve it for our inaction.   Our laziness,  our apathy.   We have watched as the levees broke,  one by one,  never lifting a finger to help those caught in the flood.   Now the wave is here,  looming over us and most will still not see the danger.   The worst part is that when we live in a state where all information is censored,  yet still "feels" free,  most will never realize the true state of things.   Skyrocketing poverty or even the deaths of women who can't find care for their pregnancy won't even be a news item,  so we won't know.   Welcome to the start of the new dark age.
