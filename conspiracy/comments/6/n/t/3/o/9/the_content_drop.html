        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I could not source scans of the documents or photographs. The documents are still there. I <em>can</em> give you more information about what is included BEYOND what I included in my original post (i.e. the death of two journalists)</p>

<p><strong>What Happened</strong></p>

<p>Rape of 2 x 16 year old girls in 1975. This was at a fundraising event. They were passed around like &#39;cheap cattle&#39; (actual quote). Some people abused them severely. While the age of consent in Sweden is 15, neither consented to this. They were taken off the streets.</p>

<p>The girls were paid &#39;handsomly&#39; for their time. Each received 250,000kr and were asked to leave the area where the fundraiser happened (VÃ¤stervik). They did not return.</p>

<p><strong>What the documents detail</strong></p>

<p>Photographs of the two girls PLUS what they looked like in 2001. There is no updated photograph of them. I have no idea if they are still alive.</p>

<p>Journalist 1 tracked down the girls based on a tip-off from somebody at the event. Journalist 2 had this information shared with them.</p>

<p>There is a third person involved who had written at the bottom of the documents:</p>

<p>&quot;Case Closed. Deceased&quot;. It gave details of the deaths of each of the journalists. One was shot in the back. Was classed as a murder by her husband. The second one fell off a boat. Was classed as an accident. They were anything but.</p>

<p>I am able to answer questions about this for the next 30 minutes. Then I will be travelling.</p>
