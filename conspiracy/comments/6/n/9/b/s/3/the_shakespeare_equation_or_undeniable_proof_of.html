        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A man named Alan Green (unrelated - he was the music director of Davy Jones of The Monkees for over a decade), has spent over 12 years attempting to crack a code that Shakespeare has left for us.</p>

<h1><a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/">Alan</a> will be doing an IAMA in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the near future.</h1>

<p>The best introduction to his work is an incredible elucidation of sacred geometry, mathematical constants, and geodesy on the Shakespeare Sonnets cover page.</p>

<p>The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">here</a>. I <em>highly</em> recommend watching the video, but if not, there are four dots and two lines placed serruptiously on the page. When they are connected, they make multiple right angle triangles, a pythagoraen triangle, and their ratios encode <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bNImI">12 fundamental constants.</a> The constants are encoded by simply ratios of the triangle lengths, and all to an accuracy of at least 3 decimals. Golden sections, squaring the circle, and more are all present as well.</p>

<p>For those who want to check the math, the measurements, and the possibility that this could come about by chance, <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/math">here</a> are PDFs for you.</p>

<p>The end of the video is astounding, and I don&#39;t want to spoil it, so spoiler alert.</p>

<p>The cover has properties laid out similarly to old maps, with a G signifying the Earth, and NE for coordinates.</p>

<p>When you measure two of the angles in the triangles, by N and e respectively, for north and east, you get the Great Pyramid <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8R7by">coordinates within 300m</a>. Longitude is 99.99%, Latitude is just about 99.999% accurate, while longitude <em>which hadn&#39;t been yet been &#39;discovered&#39; [actually hadn&#39;t been released, the Empire had military superiority to keep after all]</em> is about 300m off, or 99.9999% accurate.</p>

<p>This pointing to the pyramid on the cover is important for the next part, what Alan dubbs the Shakespeare Equation.</p>

<h1>The Shakespeare Equation</h1>

<p>Encoded inside the same sonnets are physical measurements of things that wouldn&#39;t be &#39;publically&#39; measured/released for many, many years. Things like the speed of light, the earth moon distance, the earth sun distance, etc.</p>

<p>The equation works like this. It takes a bit of pondering, but it&#39;s very simple. </p>

<p>Find all the sonnet numbers that contain the word of the thing you&#39;re trying to lookup. For example Earth, or Distance, or Moon, or Sun, or Speed, or Light. Use these numbers in their correct ratio, <em>always</em> multiply by the Sonnet that contains Pyramid (only one, Sonnet 123). This will give you the answer in cubits. The next part is * pi/6 - converting out of cubits.</p>

<p>To reiterate, (pyramid sonnet# * pi/6) is the constant part of the equation.</p>

<h1>Speed of Light in the Shakespeare Equation</h1>

<p>For example, the word speed is in sonnets 51 twice, and 50 once. </p>

<p>Light is in sonnets 7, 38, 43, 60, 88, and 100.</p>

<p>If we want the speed of light, we want to multiply the light sonnets, and divide by the speed sonnets. Light/speed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(7 * 38 * 43 * 60 * 88 * 100)
/ 
(51 * 51 * 50)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, as par the Shakespeare equation we multiply by the only passage that contains the word &#39;pyramid&#39; - passage 123. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then to convert to meters, multiply pi/6.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(7*38*43*60*88*100+%2F+(51*50*51))+*+123+*+(.524)">Here it is on wolfram</a> accurate to 99.84%</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-speed-of-light-also-the-coordinates-for-the-great-pyramid-at-Giza">Remember, the latitude of The Great Pyramid is the speed of light</a></p>

<p>Surely this is coincidence?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try a few more...how about Earth  Moon Distance? How about Earth sun distance?</p>

<p>Well, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/aaZBR">here they are</a></p>

<p>Earth/Moon Distance Equation</p>

<p>(Earth Sonnets + Moon Sonnets) * (Distance Sonnets) * [Shakespeare Equation Pyramid Sonnet # * pi/6] = 238,498.181, 99.9% accurate in miles.</p>

<p>There is tons more to this work, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQUYOQ0BV_I">distilling precession of the equinoxes</a>, 5/6 penta/hexa sacred geometry relationships (for example, the &#39;bent&#39; pyramid wasn&#39;t a mistake, but instead changes from penta angle (72) to hexa angle (60), perhaps symbolizing the as above so below principle).</p>

<p>Another <strong>astonishing</strong> deduction is figuring out the harmonics between the foot, cubit, and meter via eulers constant, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7qQEJW8K_U">here</a></p>

<h1>Implications</h1>

<p>This practically <em>proves</em> that advanced esoteric information was given to Shakespeare, and most likely passed down - it pretty much points out that the source of this knowledge was ancient egypt.</p>

<p>Remember, the most influential western thinkers that basically birthed western thought spent time learning in Egypt.</p>

<p>Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.</p>

<p>I run <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> - the work of Nassim Haramein which essentially proves an ancient unified global civilization had also intimate knowledge of physics - sacred geometry such as the flower of life literally symbolizing the structure of space at the planck scale. </p>

<p>It&#39;s looking more and more like Graham Hancock is completely correct - there was an ancient, advanced, globe-spanning civilization that had high knowledge, and perhaps after catastrophe, encoded their knowledge in stone monuments and passed down secrets in mystery schools for millenia. </p>

<p>Remember, Alan Greene will be doing an IAMA, so if this is interesting, dig in and see what you can find!</p>
