       A man named Alan Green (unrelated - he was the music director of Davy Jones of The Monkees for over a decade), has spent over 12 years attempting to crack a code that Shakespeare has left for us.
      </p>
      <h1>
       <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/">
        Alan
       </a>
       will be doing an IAMA in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       in the near future.
      </h1>
      <p>
       The best introduction to his work is an incredible elucidation of sacred geometry, mathematical constants, and geodesy on the Shakespeare Sonnets cover page.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">
        here
       </a>
       . I
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       recommend watching the video, but if not, there are four dots and two lines placed serruptiously on the page. When they are connected, they make multiple right angle triangles, a pythagoraen triangle, and their ratios encode
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bNImI">
        12 fundamental constants.
       </a>
       The constants are encoded by simply ratios of the triangle lengths, and all to an accuracy of at least 3 decimals. Golden sections, squaring the circle, and more are all present as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who want to check the math, the measurements, and the possibility that this could come about by chance,
       <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/math">
        here
       </a>
       are PDFs for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end of the video is astounding, and I don't want to spoil it, so spoiler alert.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cover has properties laid out similarly to old maps, with a G signifying the Earth, and NE for coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you measure two of the angles in the triangles, by N and e respectively, for north and east, you get the Great Pyramid
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8R7by">
        coordinates within 300m
       </a>
       . Longitude is 99.99%, Latitude is just about 99.999% accurate, while longitude
       <em>
        which hadn't been yet been 'discovered' [actually hadn't been released, the Empire had military superiority to keep after all]
       </em>
       is about 300m off, or 99.9999% accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pointing to the pyramid on the cover is important for the next part, what Alan dubbs the Shakespeare Equation.
      </p>
      <h1>
       The Shakespeare Equation
      </h1>
      <p>
       Encoded inside the same sonnets are physical measurements of things that wouldn't be 'publically' measured/released for many, many years. Things like the speed of light, the earth moon distance, the earth sun distance, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The equation works like this. It takes a bit of pondering, but it's very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find all the sonnet numbers that contain the word of the thing you're trying to lookup. For example Earth, or Distance, or Moon, or Sun, or Speed, or Light. Use these numbers in their correct ratio,
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       multiply by the Sonnet that contains Pyramid (only one, Sonnet 123). This will give you the answer in cubits. The next part is * pi/6 - converting out of cubits.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, (pyramid sonnet# * pi/6) is the constant part of the equation.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Speed of Light in the Shakespeare Equation
      </h1>
      <p>
       For example, the word speed is in sonnets 51 twice, and 50 once.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light is in sonnets 7, 38, 43, 60, 88, and 100.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want the speed of light, we want to multiply the light sonnets, and divide by the speed sonnets. Light/speed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (7 * 38 * 43 * 60 * 88 * 100)
/ 
(51 * 51 * 50)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then, as par the Shakespeare equation we multiply by the only passage that contains the word 'pyramid' - passage 123.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then to convert to meters, multiply pi/6.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(7*38*43*60*88*100+%2F+(51*50*51))+*+123+*+(.524)">
         Here it is on wolfram
        </a>
        accurate to 99.84%
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-speed-of-light-also-the-coordinates-for-the-great-pyramid-at-Giza">
        Remember, the latitude of The Great Pyramid is the speed of light
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely this is coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's try a few more...how about Earth  Moon Distance? How about Earth sun distance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well,
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/aaZBR">
        here they are
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth/Moon Distance Equation
      </p>
      <p>
       (Earth Sonnets + Moon Sonnets) * (Distance Sonnets) * [Shakespeare Equation Pyramid Sonnet # * pi/6] = 238,498.181, 99.9% accurate in miles.
      </p>

       There is tons more to this work, including
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQUYOQ0BV_I">
        distilling precession of the equinoxes
       </a>
       , 5/6 penta/hexa sacred geometry relationships (for example, the 'bent' pyramid wasn't a mistake, but instead changes from penta angle (72) to hexa angle (60), perhaps symbolizing the as above so below principle).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another
       <strong>
        astonishing

       deduction is figuring out the harmonics between the foot, cubit, and meter via eulers constant,

       Implications
      </h1>
      <p>
       This practically
       <em>
        proves
       </em>
       that advanced esoteric information was given to Shakespeare, and most likely passed down - it pretty much points out that the source of this knowledge was ancient egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the most influential western thinkers that basically birthed western thought spent time learning in Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I run
       <a href="/r/holofractal">
        /r/holofractal
       </a>
       - the work of Nassim Haramein which essentially proves an ancient unified global civilization had also intimate knowledge of physics - sacred geometry such as the flower of life literally symbolizing the structure of space at the planck scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's looking more and more like Graham Hancock is completely correct - there was an ancient, advanced, globe-spanning civilization that had high knowledge, and perhaps after catastrophe, encoded their knowledge in stone monuments and passed down secrets in mystery schools for millenia.
      </p>

       Remember, Alan Greene will be doing an IAMA, so if this is interesting, dig in and see what you can find!
