        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think all of us on this subreddit who have been here for any length of time will notice the almost constant stream of new accounts complaining about a &quot;Pro-Trump&quot; bias on this subreddit. Let me humbly submit for your consideration that <strong>at least some of this is an operation to D&amp;C <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</strong> Here is the strategy as I see it, let me know if any of you notice this shit or I&#39;m just crazy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In every single comment thread, when someone expresses skepticism or doubt about the &quot;Oh my fucking God! Trump colluded with the Russians!&quot; narrative, <em>immediately accuse them of being from <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> or having a political bias.</em> Speak of the collusion as if the only possible conclusion you could draw from the evidence is that Trump is corrupt; discredit anyone who expresses doubt in that narrative by ad-hominem accusations.</p></li>
<li><p>At least once per day, post a text thread bitching about the &quot;Pro-Trump bias&quot; that exists on this sub. Anyone and everyone who tells you to get lost or questions the validity of that accusation is a Trump supporter and should go back to <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any discussion related to John Podesta, Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, or others from the former Administration is &quot;what-aboutism.&quot; You are not to allow <em>any</em> discussion of the Obama Administration&#39;s flagrant corruption without making it about Trump/Russia. Every single thread that relates to Pedogate is to be derailed by &quot;Dude...this is just a pro-Trump distraction from the Russia collusion.&quot; Do not allow the userbase of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to have a discussion about <em>anything other than Russia collusion.</em> Anything even remotely related to DNC politics is a distraction from Russia.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m not accusing <em>every single poster</em> who is anti-Trump of being a shill...that&#39;s fucking ridiculous. <strong>There are plenty of great reasons to distrust Trump. There are absolutely reasons to discuss Trump/Russia collusion on this subreddit - it&#39;s shady and I&#39;m not trying to dismiss your legitimate concerns.</strong> But let&#39;s not kid ourselves here - there&#39;s something else happening here, beyond &quot;the userbase of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is naturally divided along political lines.&quot; </p>

<p>We know that certain organizations who have explicit ties to David Brock/the DNC <em>absolutely do astroturf places like this.</em> I think there is an Operation going on here, and it&#39;s a brilliant one at that. Mods are backed into a corner where they either ban the astroturfers and their D&amp;C threads and look political in the process, or allow it to continue and have this sub degenerate into <a href="/r/politicaldiscussion">/r/politicaldiscussion</a> 2.0 where we constantly rehash the fucking Russia thing over and over and over again in every single thread. I think the mods are doing a good job of handling this by taking a hands-off approach, but I&#39;d like to at least see what the community thinks about this. Anyone else think this shit is a bit suspicious? Anyone else think it&#39;s intentional?</p>
