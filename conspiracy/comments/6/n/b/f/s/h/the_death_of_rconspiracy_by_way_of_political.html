       I think all of us on this subreddit who have been here for any length of time will notice the almost constant stream of new accounts complaining about a "Pro-Trump" bias on this subreddit. Let me humbly submit for your consideration that
       <strong>
        at least some of this is an operation to D&amp;C
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        .
       </strong>
       Here is the strategy as I see it, let me know if any of you notice this shit or I'm just crazy:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         In every single comment thread, when someone expresses skepticism or doubt about the "Oh my fucking God! Trump colluded with the Russians!" narrative,
         <em>
          immediately accuse them of being from
          <a href="/r/The_Donald">
           /r/The_Donald
          </a>
          or having a political bias.
         </em>
         Speak of the collusion as if the only possible conclusion you could draw from the evidence is that Trump is corrupt; discredit anyone who expresses doubt in that narrative by ad-hominem accusations.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At least once per day, post a text thread bitching about the "Pro-Trump bias" that exists on this sub. Anyone and everyone who tells you to get lost or questions the validity of that accusation is a Trump supporter and should go back to
         <a href="/r/The_Donald">
          /r/The_Donald
         </a>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Any discussion related to John Podesta, Loretta Lynch, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, or others from the former Administration is "what-aboutism." You are not to allow
         <em>
          any
         </em>
         discussion of the Obama Administration's flagrant corruption without making it about Trump/Russia. Every single thread that relates to Pedogate is to be derailed by "Dude...this is just a pro-Trump distraction from the Russia collusion." Do not allow the userbase of
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         to have a discussion about
         <em>
          anything other than Russia collusion.
         </em>
         Anything even remotely related to DNC politics is a distraction from Russia.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Of course, I'm not accusing
       <em>
        every single poster
       </em>
       who is anti-Trump of being a shill...that's fucking ridiculous.
       <strong>
        There are plenty of great reasons to distrust Trump. There are absolutely reasons to discuss Trump/Russia collusion on this subreddit - it's shady and I'm not trying to dismiss your legitimate concerns.
       </strong>
       But let's not kid ourselves here - there's something else happening here, beyond "the userbase of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is naturally divided along political lines."
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that certain organizations who have explicit ties to David Brock/the DNC
       <em>
        absolutely do astroturf places like this.
       </em>
       I think there is an Operation going on here, and it's a brilliant one at that. Mods are backed into a corner where they either ban the astroturfers and their D&amp;C threads and look political in the process, or allow it to continue and have this sub degenerate into
       <a href="/r/politicaldiscussion">
        /r/politicaldiscussion
       </a>
       2.0 where we constantly rehash the fucking Russia thing over and over and over again in every single thread. I think the mods are doing a good job of handling this by taking a hands-off approach, but I'd like to at least see what the community thinks about this. Anyone else think this shit is a bit suspicious? Anyone else think it's intentional?
