        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The media&#39;s standard explanation of the Russia connection has never felt right. Forget my anti-MSM bias, which is strong, I just never drew the same conclusions from any of their supposed bombshells. Seems like a Dem operative or Obama crony is always lurking just around the corner on these stories, and remember, always remember, Evil Ben Rhodes has bragged about their ability to create a false echo chamber to reinforce the mainstream consensus around their goals. Here are some things that never sat right:</p>

<p>1) Obama admin refused to interfere with Russian interference despite claiming to have evidence from way before the election. They instead blasted Trump&#39;s questions of electoral integrity and said there was no doubting the integrity of the elections.</p>

<p>2) Democrats have refused to turn over electoral data to the commission looking into voter fraud, simply screaming TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP rather than give data that a naive person would think would reinforce their narrative that the Russians interfered. Perhaps there was massive Democrat fraud in urban areas (LIKE ALWAYS???).</p>

<p>3) Loretta Lynch gave special permission in extraordinary circumstances to let this Veselnitskaya, lady lawyer and Kremlin associate, into the country. Did she know and or want her to come and make discredible offers to the Republicans?</p>

<p>4) Veselnitskaya hits up Don Jr, and Dana Rohrabacher. Don Jr. says the meeting was ridiculous and he took nothing away from it. If it was &quot;massive collusion&quot; then he probably would have not been so rude to her. If it was an informational honeypot, then it&#39;s not evidence of Trump collusion, it&#39;s evidence of Lynch malfeasance.</p>

<p>5) Loretta Lynch meets with Bill Clinton on the tarmac to discuss &quot;Grandchildren&quot;. </p>

<p>6) The much-ballyhooed meeting between Sessions and Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, was revealed to be a big mingling session organized by the Obama Administration - perhaps for the purposes of having him in the room at a minor function so they could trip up Sessions under oath.</p>

<p>7) The government was listening in on Michael Flynn, the closest to Russia of anyone in Trump&#39;s orbit besides Manafort, and they outed his first Russia inconsistently at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>8) The FBI, and Republicans like John McCain, and some Dems, have hired that Christopher Steele, who drafted a widely discredited by unanimously believed (in DC circles) dossier alleging Trump pees on hookers.</p>

<p>9) Trump&#39;s phone calls to foreign leaders are monitored and leaked from the get-go, monitored and leaked by our own intelligence services. Our own spies are spying on the President, and trying to embarrass him.</p>

<p>10) DNC server containing any evidence there would be of a Russian hack, or perhaps of Seth Rich downloading information, STILL has not been turned over to the FBI. STILL! The only firm to look at it proclaimed immediately &quot;RUSSIAN HACKING&quot; but released no evidence to say russian hacking.</p>

<p>11) The 17 intelligence agencies claim turned out to be a lie, an orchestrated lie that suggests there&#39;s big deep-state investment in maintaining the Russian hacking narrative.</p>

<p>12) Is there any evidence anywhere of voting machines being tampered with? If there was really a hacking of the election, you would think this the main point of the investigation.</p>

<p>13) Why still no resolution to the Seth Rich story? Why does him leaking to wikileaks seem by deduction to be the more likely than a Russian hack? We still have, nor does the government, evidence of that hack, because the Dems, who have the most to gain by proving the hack, STILL HAVE NOT RELEASED THE SERVER.</p>

<p>14) This guy to tried to find copies of Hillary&#39;s emails through meetings with hackers, &quot;Killed himself&quot;. </p>

<p>Lots of killings, not a lot of evidence. Lots of claims of smoking guns, no smoke and no guns. Don Jr dismissed almost immediately the one Kremlin-connected person we have seen evidence of trying to help the campaign. If there was a collusion, would he not have at least humored her some more?</p>

<p>I think that some time around Q2 2016, the Obama admin decided that a Russian connection to Trump (Manafort and Flynn) could be a weapon to use, in case Hillary was not going to win. Everyone said she was going to win, but high-up Dems had polls and voter data suggesting early on she was in big trouble and her strategy was weak. It became the way to undermine the incoming administration after the loss, thus all the phone convos leaked.</p>

<p>If there was not a big government conspiracy to slime Trump and build up a weak case into a &quot;collusion-treason&quot;, then why did evil stooges like Susan Rice demand unmasking of names of Trump connections, and why did they relax the information sharing rules to spread their weak information all around the government?</p>

<p>I welcome any responses/corrections, and can provide links for all of this.</p>

<p>Bottom line: the Russian conspiracy is a government conspiracy.</p>
