       I was watching this video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peYrSP8cke8">

       (you can have your own opinions about many of the things that are said, I don't believe all of it) but one of the things that intrigued me is that post-2012 we have entered a different part of our galaxy and has increased the energy flow to our planet.  This has been a recurring bit of info I've read in the past few years.  Now in this video he says that the toroidal energy flow of the Earth is actually expanding.  Now with the recent abnormalities in the Schumann Resonance as well as the recent solar flares, do you think this is accurate?  Also, if there is more energy being output by the Sun, wouldn't that be reflected on Earth in the form of ... heat? Was this information available to the elite before the beginning of the global warming clusterfuck that has occupied some of our brilliant minds (on top of being another political view to divide rather than unite)?
      </p>

       I can relate to many of the things said in the video including love and interacting with other beings (through entheogen enhanced meditation on the latter).  Is there a possibility that these higher-dimensional light beings are the ones attempting to guide us in a non physical plane rather than a physical? Which is why our pineal glands are being calcified, to remove us from our higher selves/higher dimensions and bind us to the material world? It seems that our entire planet is being held hostage and probably still comparably in the stone age of possible technology because of the suppression of ancient and alien knowledge for power rather than for prosperity of all.  And businesses (who are the true globalists) are running the show and trying to suck up every last bit of oil in the ground, and getting the taxpayers to fund wars to secure it through our governments.  As these people are so materialistic and backwards on the concept of love, they are greedy and money hungry, causing millions of deaths every year in the form of... everything (pharmaceuticals, what they feed our food, how our crops are grown, carcinogens in every day products, the list goes on forever to keep people sick). Are things such as pedophilia and violence inevitabilities of materialistic corruption?

       I figured this would be the best place to post this as there has been a lot of discussion on these topics recently on this sub in between the political nonsense.

       The only thing I can encourage you to do is spread love when you're off of the computer.  That is where the magic is. Take care of your body. Exercise. Meditate. Bring out the divine that is within you and we can win back the planet.  More and more people are opening their eyes and doing something about it themselves rather than watching the world pass by. I'm not saying that I'm perfect but I do my best every day.  It starts with your choice.
