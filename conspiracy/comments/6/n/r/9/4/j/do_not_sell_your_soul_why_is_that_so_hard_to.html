       There is a rising thread trying to convince people to literally sell their souls. I'm desperate to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are bank accounts that people are accessing because they think they are being woke. They aren't. In fact, some of them are trying to put you back to sleep for another earth cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want more of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have these accounts in your name. That's true. They are tied to your birth certificate and your social security card. That's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is what they are not saying: These accounts are in your name because TPTB view you like cattle.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a commodity to be bought and traded. This is so much deeper than the Federal Reserve. This is literally the system that owns you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't think you are buying your soul back. The minute you consent to being sold you are consenting to being a slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       God, there is so much more. This is dangerous. And for what? We aren't that broke yet. You are on the internet. You have food and shelter. You don't have to sell your soul yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scheme is being promoted by none other than youtuber Harvey Dent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvey Dent, ffs. Have you noticed the weirdness to names right now? Trump trumped Hillary. Weiner's weiner got him busted. Reality Winner - whatever happened to her? Edward Snowed-them. James Alefantis (loves babies) of pizza fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, check my username. Not a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is right in front of you right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvey Dent/Two Face: He was a good person who experienced a trauma became a criminal went to the dark side and became obsessed with duality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Google "end of duality." Tons of different messengers. One message.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single end time prophecy from Abrahamic religions to the Hopi Prophecy to Dolores Cannon to The Law of One - every messenger in every form is screaming from the roof tops.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the message:
      </p>
      <p>
       The harvest is not far off. Your time on this plane is just seconds of your eternal life. This time is almost over. This is the final inning. You are being offered choices. Choose wisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research soul contract revocation and do not consent statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then research how to live in harmony with the people and planet. Be self sufficient. Help your neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is right in front of you. Look:

       According to Julian Assange, his surname is a romanticization of the Cantonese name Sang.

      <p>
       Jullian Assange - sang. He sang like a bird in a...
      </p>
      <p>
       Sang is Cantonese for Mulberry tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The mulberry is also a symbol of the archer, because legend tells how the first bow was made by Emperor Huang di to defeat a tiger who had chased him into a mulberry tree."

      <p>
       Mr. Sang was chased by a tiger into a tree.

       What about Julian? From Julian the Apostate, known for purging "the top-heavy state bureaucracy" in the 4th century. Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all been done before.
