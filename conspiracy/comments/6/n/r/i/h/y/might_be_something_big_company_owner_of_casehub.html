       The more ive looked into it, the weirder this has got.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldnt find any playable versions of the documentary, other than its trailer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unplayable Reddit post of documentary from last year -
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4f1ny3/watch_the_dvlas_dirty_little_secret_full/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/4f1ny3/watch_the_dvlas_dirty_little_secret_full/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So i looked into who was behind making it, it was a legal outfit called CaseHub, they stand up for the underdog and fight (fought) big, class action legal cases.
They have a facebook page (CaseHubUK) and have been quiet since early september last year. Which is strange considering the momentum they'd been gathering after some of their cases were publicised in mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire casehub.com website has also been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found an archive with way back machine -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8Ba28Dc38">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8Ba28Dc38
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I tracked the owner down and im pretty sure hes also the guy in the documentary's trailer, his name is Michael Green. He founded CaseHub and not only has the company gone quiet but so has Green.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets even stranger because he went quiet around the same time, towards the end of last year.
      </p>

       JimmyTename's video, noticing the web page had vanished (which is what made me look into it) -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uc2_fKV9vig&amp;t=0s">

       If anyone has information which can disprove anything ive said, or can shed light on this, please share﻿
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just also add, that greens last twitter post was a picture of an envolope which red "surrender or youll die" ? 
Might not be related but though it was worth mentioning, considering it was his last post
      </p>
      <p>
       Also now found michael green on facebook and same story as before, all went quite at the same time, the more i research the harder this is to find and its making me more concerned about that final threatening tweet he posted 
Last tweet -
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/G1rfO">
        http://imgur.com/a/G1rfO
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way he's used question marks in the description of the picture implies to me that he thought this was just a bizarre prank. It is a weird message to say the least

       last email from case hub
      </p>
      <p>
       Update
      </p>
      <p>
       Hello there!
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael from ChallengeTheFine here. This is my final email, so I write to say goodbye :(
       <br/>
       • The parking 'fine' situation continues to get worse – DVLA forecasted to give out 5m driver details this year. A few years ago this was 3m, and a few years before that under 1m. Each year the number of tickets increases by around 15-20%
• ----
• In light of this I have made a free tool to help people appeal their ticket – you can access it here. Send it to any friends affected in the future. Remember it only works for private tickets. 
• ----
• I've taken my first full-time job helping to run a company that sells natural pet food and supplements across the UK, hand produced from Germany. It is called Aniforte. This does mean my time at ChallengeTheFine has come to an end (each newsletter costs around £200 to send, so it has been v. expensive to maintain personally).
• ----
• If you want to try Aniforte out, take a look here. You can even use the code HELLO-MICHAEL to get 13% off – no I do not make commission or any money from this.
• ----
• Aniforte have generously funded this final email, so I can let you know of the free appeals tool I have made. Hopefully some of you can spread the appeals tool with affected friends / family to try and lessen the parking problem. I just hope some readers with a cat or dog now go and try some of our products! 
• ----
• Given this is the last email, and 99.99% of you never got to meet me, here's a picture with me and my dog. Isn't he a looker?

       Hi, I know that this is an old thread but thought I should update you. Michael is a good friend of mine, (awesome dude,) he's alive and well. He deleted facebook a little while ago and I assume gave social media in general a break. Not sure what that tweet was about because I don't follow him on Twitter but I've spoken to him tonight by text tonight, and he sent me a picture of himself with a mutual friend the other night. So he is confirmed as alive and well.
