        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What I can tell you so far without scanning the documents in, and with only a minute or so to look over them. Sorry for the sketchy details, my Swedish is not the best and it was hard to translate in my brain.</p>

<ol>
<li>These documents were mixed up with documents related to &#39;rape&#39;. I study rape in Sweden, I was looking for another document.</li>
<li>Both journalists killed were NEVER reported in the media as journalists.</li>
<li>Journalist 1 died in Stockholm in 2004.</li>
<li>Journalist 2 died in Lund in 2009.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these journalists were ACTIVELY researching the same case. Rape allegations from 1975. These allegations were made by 2 x 16 year olds who were exposed to a Bill Clinton relative but NOT Bill Clinton himself.</p>

<p>Journalist 1 was talking to one of the 16 year olds at the time. Journalist 2 was following up on a lead.</p>

<p>The notes in the document were from journalist 2. I do NOT know the name of Journalist 1 beyond the fact that they were researching but not making it known that they were a journalist at the time.</p>

<p>Any questions. Ask.</p>
