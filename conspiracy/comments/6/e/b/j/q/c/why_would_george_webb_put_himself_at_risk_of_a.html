    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re just making shit up basically. Jones didn&#39;t even say &quot;it&#39;s satire&quot;, he just said that he puts on a performance when he does those videos. What the top level commenter did was the equivalent of seeing zombies in pro wrestling and decided to say &quot;Wow, their athletic moves are so fake, obviously CGI.&quot; Jones is putting on a performance with his ridiculous antics, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s satire. Everyone who creates content like he does is a performer. HA Goodman is a performer, Tim Black is a performer, Rachel Maddow is a performer, Bill O&#39;Reilly was a performer. They all put on performances for their shows, the only difference is that Alex Jones does a bunch of coke or something and raves wildly as part of his performance. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a liar or satire or anything necessarily, just that he&#39;s intentionally putting on a performance for his audience who expects that level of energy. </p>

<p>You touched on one of my biggest gripes with the whole DNC scandal and that is the way it&#39;s been seemingly twisted and turned into a much different issue than it started out.

    <div class="md"><p>Attention. Those slandered are already rich and have nothing to gain by filing a lawsuit. It would actually harm them by only bringing more attention to the issue. Webb, on the other hand, has everything to gain in regards to publicity. If this blows up he can even build a following to purchase future books, listen to a conspiracy podcast he can start, or any other game based endeavor.</p>

<p>Or, he could truly and honestly believe he&#39;s right, and just be wrong, not having all the facts. Or he could be ignoring the facts that disagree with him. Confirmation bias can sway even the brightest. Think of the most confident idiot you know. Give him superb speaking skills and confidence and he&#39;s still an idiot, regardless of how much risk he takes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also surprised people are being so unimaginative when it comes to their attempts to discredit him. Why not at least claim he&#39;s a Trump operative working to implode the democrats, or that this is true, but won&#39;t come to light because it&#39;s detente against Trump impeachment? Or... that intelligence communities are aligning themselves to fracture the US population to weaken it. Something.</p>

<p>He recently gave his motive for doing this and it&#39;s one I believe: he has beef with FBI director Andrew McCabe because he called out one of his operations of entrapping a young guy to make his office look better, and McCabe has been threatening his family ever since. So, now he&#39;s blowing the lid on him facilitating things like money laundering, fraudulent businesses, etc. </p>

<p>What I do know is that there&#39;s serious fuckery about this story, case in point the fact that any mention of it is missing from the_donald. If Webb is so fake, why is there so much censorship from this story being covered? Why is periscope feeds getting wiped? Why are tweets being deleted? </p>

<p>The whole, &quot;George Webb is LARPing&quot; story cannot coexist with the censorship that we&#39;re seeing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just comical that a typo goes viral but men visibly and seemingly-
genuinely fearing their lives is considered LARP</p>
