<p>So, somebody noticed that comments are being duplicated to generate the appearance of organic conversation that doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e7ajo/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/">original post</a>. Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e7nx7/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/">duplicate post</a> on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, posted about an hour after the original.</p>

<p>Sorry for the crazy language, clearly this forum is being subverted and I&#39;m trying to blend in.</p>

<p>A list of duplicate comments:
1. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e7ajo/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di842df/">Original</a> vs. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e7nx7/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di86o33/">here</a>

<p>There is some really weird stufff going down with those duplicate commments.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> duplicate comments here are made by accounts made either 24 or 26 days ago. The original comments are made by accounts ranging from 10 months to 24 days.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the accounts used to duplicate comments do not further participate in conversation. One duplicater (delta-bomb) copies thinkmaga from the original thread both as a top-level reply and as a responder. So, not only are they pasting top-level comments over, they are also pasting over replies and other comments. Delta-bomb <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e7nx7/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di8a7ga/">copies</a> thinkmaga&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e7ajo/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di85xr6/">reply</a>. Delta-bomb <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e7nx7/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di89x6u/">copies</a> thinkmaga&#39;s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e7ajo/crowdstrike_who_claimed_evidence_putin_hacked/di84km3/">top-level post</a></p></li>
<li><p>One of the commenters later participates in organic conversation in this thread, the rest seem to only post the duplicate comments. All of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> duplicate commenters seem to be heavily pushing the Rich conspiracy, including the George Webb stuff, as well as pushing Trump&#39;s tweets, posts and comments targeting the Paris agreement, pizzagate, and even pushing the idea that the Macron emails are being stifled to prevent something legit getting out.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m leaving the stuff below, but it is completely unproven conjecture on my part based on some of the other topics pushed by the duplicating accounts. Original credit to <a href="/u/ArchonFall4All">/u/ArchonFall4All</a></p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying this is a Russian botnet, but damned if it doesn&#39;t look like a Russian botnet. It makes sense: generate seemingly organic threads by copying comments and posts from other subs you control, use some of the accounts to participate organically, and one person can generate what looks like 5-10x as many people supporting their position with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Check out the section of Dugin&#39;s book proposing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">Russian geopolitical strategy</a> that deals with the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s actually three. Took me a while but I found the least popular. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n90h5/slug/dc9qdxe">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5n90h5/slug/dc9qdxe</a></p>

<p>(Sorry, I can&#39;t link to the direct top level url). </p>

<p>There was 2 others. Mods added similar flairs like &quot;confirmed hoax&quot; and &quot;unverified&quot; when they were clearly not. </p>

<p>These three threads will not show up in top for all time. They&#39;re removed from public view. </p>

<p>Mods still won&#39;t explain why they&#39;re censoring the most popular anti Trump conspiracies in the subs history. It&#39;s also quite likely I&#39;ll get banned for mentioning it. There&#39;s a serious Trump infestation in the mod team. I reckon they&#39;re laying low right now but it would certainly explain a lot of the Seth Rich stuff. </p>

<p>If I find the other threads, I&#39;ll link them. I&#39;m on a mission now. </p>

<p>The post you&#39;re lying about still exists in my post history.  No need to argue about it.  Just have a look and recognize that you&#39;re either being intellectually dishonest or someone is feeding you misinformation and you accept it as fact without the slightest scrutiny.</p>

<p>How are you going to try as lambast me for insulting you when all I did was describe the logical fallacy you used to insult me?  You can&#39;t have it both ways chap.  You either play nice and get treated nice or you take the gloves off and accept responsibility for your actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think T_D shills/trolls/bots are all making us a little paranoid, no need to go threw the history of every single person on this sub. I will tell you now My account is like 4 months old, I have been here for about 3, and I commonly post here, askreddit, showerthouhts, and a few misc like CFL, XCOM, Fallout, steam, Vita Hacks, Cemu, although I dont post much their, mostly just read and look at intresting stuff.
Ever read the Great gatsby, my teacher in high school explained that gatsby hid his history in a shroud of rumors and half truths that were vauge as possible never attempting to dispell the rumors, that way if anyone ever stumbled upon his real backstory it would just end up as another rumor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just noticed something similar in another thread. 2 different names 1st was a 26 day account the other was like a 5 day account. (Not sure I can explain this well enough)  The two comments weren&#39;t exact but they were structured very close, used a few of the same words, and basically had the same exact agenda. I screencaped to possibly do a post later but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll do it. I feel like I&#39;m pretty close to being banned because the other day I got one comment deleted for calling out account age then about an hour later I got a final warning for calling out account age. I only said like this &quot;25 day account and 100 karma&quot; thats it and mod gave me a final warning. </p>

<p>Anyway its 100% going on here and very nice post! </p>

<p>1) someone&#39;s pet bot designed to farm highly-upvoted comments, repost them, and gain karma. <a href="https://medium.com/@Rob79/what-i-learned-selling-my-reddit-accounts-c5e9f6348005">Reddit accounts with high karma can go for hundreds of dollars</a> (I have no idea why anyone would buy one but....)</p>

<p>2) They are trolling us. I mean why would they post in r/conspiracy, the one subreddit that is paranoid above all other subreddits. People are fucked up. I made a comment about cuddling a cat or something that </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna see if I could make a script for easier analysis of these comments, gotta look into the API, but the fact that the bot accounts are being deleted is a good sign.</p>

It probably isnt the Russians, may be T_D mods are trying to make themselves look bigger, by having bots automaticaly creating comments and posts on their sub, then maybe they are trying to take us over while they are at it. We did kind of welcome them in with open arms when there sub went down, now maybe they think that they can take over.</p>

<p>You know why? Because T_D users have both openly admitted to vote brigading in r/conspiracy using discord to coordinate in r/conspiracy threads, AND</p>

<p>T_D users have been outed for calling for vote brigading of r/conspiracy in T_D threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I doubt that Russia would waste resources on r/conspiracy. Seriously. The importance of this sub is overstated imo. It&#39;s important to individuals, but the impact of this sub is much less than I think users would like to realize. As of me making this post, there are 450k users subscribed, 2000 active. </p>

<p>If every poster subscribed was able to be influenced to vote a certain way, it would have a negligible impact on elections. </p>

<p>But many of those 450k are users who have more than one account, so shrink that number that&#39;s able to vote. Maybe by as much as a third, or more. </p>

<p>Of the total number of users here are less likely to vote than perhaps any other sub, so shrink that number farther.</p>

<p>And the users that remain will not all be convinced to vote the same way so shrink that number further.</p>

<p>And since this is an international community, you can divide that number further.</p>

<p>That&#39;s if we stick to the 450k subscribed. Now consider that of those  450k subscribed, perhaps 2% of them are actually active. Apply the same math.</p>

<p>What you end up with is a negligible population in any given country.</p>

<p>But, consider a group of hundreds of people with scripting tools tasked with spreading disinformation and propaganda. You&#39;re going to come up with strategies for forum manipulation and try to apply them in as many places as you can. Reddit is a popular site, Facebook is more so, who knows what other popular sites they might target.</p>

<p>And, of course, it&#39;s not just Russians. There&#39;s Cambridge Analytica, Correct the Record, potentially there are just mercenary groups for hire that can be used for these sorts of things.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that one person can be working multiple forums or subreddits at a time. Some blatant liberal disinformation makes it to the top of politics from time to time, it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s also pushed by the same groups seeking to destabilize our country.</p>

<p>I half expect some sort of law to lock down our internet in the name of reducing foreign influence at this point, regardless of whether we&#39;re observing foreign, American corporate, organic, or Deep State false flag forum manipulation.</p>

<p>The point of bots is to automate the process so you can spam on a massive scale with modest human resources.</p>

<p>The bots Russia (or any other actor) create will be reusable across reddit if not most social media. They set it up to spam one subreddit (e.g. the_donald) with a large user base and since the technology is already in place expand it to others with little effort.</p>

<p>For them it doesn&#39;t matter if their bots are caught, the majority of redditors won&#39;t have read the comments debunking them, they will just see a headline the actor wants to push and it will reinforce their views on that narrative.</p>

I&#39;m sincerely asking because I don&#39;t know, and I&#39;m not sure how to best word my thoughts.</p>

<p>To me, it seems like such a mass scale network of bots would have some sort of effect like a DDoS attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s non undetectable, countries disrupting social media has been known about for years, China in particular <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/20/china_caught_astroturfing_political_posts/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/20/china_caught_astroturfing_political_posts/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>sort of effect like a DDoS attack</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not DDoS, timing and placement of a comment is more important than quantity (in my opinion). For example if you visit somewhere like the Guardian, it&#39;s comments used to be completely flat and order by time. When a story about global warming came out, within seconds a well written but flame baiting comment appears. It completely derails any conversation about the actual topic, this is done across multiple news sites concurrently and won&#39;t look like a big attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>presence originating from a source (or even a regional source</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to route your traffic through a VPN to hide the source but actually we&#39;ve seen Russian attacks being so brazen as to not bother. When they commit online fraud they know Russia has no extradition treaties and Russia doesn&#39;t give a shit about it citizens scamming westerners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if they made bots that would always copy each other it would be to odvious, but if they have say 100 accounts that alternate which from which bot from the other sub they copy it would be much harder to detect. They probably have a thousand or so accounts, if you look at them they all seem to only comment and post to a single Sub. 
Maybe the bot is smarter than we think and is actually creating the comments on it own and any duplicates are pure coincidence, although this is probably unlikly.
We need something to automate the detection of these suspect bots, like finding posts and comments that are duplicates in both subs and are posted within min of each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well seeing as the accounts never post on both subs, they could have it so that one list of accounts posts to conspiracy and they probably have a program that automaticaly fixes the capitals so that it isnt as noticable.
If they stright up copyed out of T_D we probably would have noticed sooner as the weird way they make all their posts with the capitals would be a dead giveaway.</p>

They would vary the dates each account was created (or buy old accounts), they would slowly trickle the bots into action, and they would try to run scripts that can alter the copied posts somewhat.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely plausible to think that, of all of the forces attempting to influence online discourse through astroturfing and bot manipulations, the Russian gov&#39;t could be one of them. Given how much pushback the idea of Russian influence gets in r/conspiracy, this would be a great place for pushing the global confusion outlined in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fny99f8amM">Hypernormalisation.</a> That is, that Putin&#39;s government has promoted so many fringe and anti-Russian groups that outsiders (and Russian citizens) cannot ever be sure what is true and what is false, who can be trusted and who can&#39;t, and what their ultimate goals are.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not drawing any conclusions as to who is behind this particular bit of bottfuckery. I&#39;m just suggesting that the culture of division and distrust that we find here is one that a lot of groups could have been putting in a lot of man hours to nurture, with the end goal of nobody ever knowing what&#39;s true and what&#39;s false (beyond the ideologues, who are often the tools of these people). </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Somebody is experimenting with bot creation or just isn&#39;t very bright</p></li>
<li><p>These bots were intentionally made obvious so that people would find them and accuse a certain group (whether it be Trump supporters, Russians, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>The Trump supporters or Russians are playing 5d chess and created the bots to make it seem like people are trying to frame them</p></li>

<p>Someone didn&#39;t plan to smear Macron before the French elections so they didn&#39;t create a load of accounts in time to evade the 48 hour lockout. Nor did they then come back to push another load of BS.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s as you say then you can deal with them anyway right? Must something in the rules about having 20+ accounts to troll, manipulating the sub, vote manipulation (probably), commit a CTR false-flag etc?</p>

<p>I said I saw the comment history.  I didn&#39;t see him accusing you being an alt of jamescolepardon, only showing one person (that you were arguing with) the search history of your activities.</p>

<p>Now you are threatening to ban me.  What rule would I be breaking?  Attacking you?  You are the one that is implying that I belong in the &quot;trash bin&quot;.... (you&#39;ve got to be kidding)</p>

<p>I was honestly just curious but you&#39;ve been nothing but dismissive and defensive.</p>

<p>You just randomly banned a user that was on my thread that was actually participating productively, of course I&#39;m going to ask why.</p>

<p>So you should either provide the material evidence that stonetear2016 accused you of being jamescolespardon, because without that you sound like you are just justifying the fact that you&#39;ve abused your role.</p>

<p>Or prove my point and put me in the &quot;trash bin.&quot;  That would most definitely clear cut case of abuse as I&#39;ve not broken any rules.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I shouldn&#39;t even have attempted to explain his ban to you.  Regardless of how much information I give you, you&#39;re not going to be satisfied.</p>

<p>At this point you are harassing me about it, this is your final warning to drop it an move on.</p>

<p>To be clear, these are your choices </p>

<p>A) keep harassing me, one more comment about his ban or me as a mod and you&#39;re banned.</p>

<p>B) move the fuck on and continue to participate in Conspiracy without talking about me or stonetear.</p>

<p>There is no option C, so you best move is to not reply and go bother someone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asking why you banned a user without actual proof of rule violation is not harassment.</p>

<p>You really shouldn&#39;t be a mod if you equate accountability with harassment.</p>

<p>If you ban me you only prove my point.  It would not bother me, would not hurt me in anyway, you only show what kind of person you are.  So why don&#39;t you make the choice?</p>

<p>A) Show the proof of the rule violation – so far you are banning people just on speculation, which would not be the right thing to do.  If you are doing this, you are making this a shitty place for everyone– several people have already voiced this concern.</p>

<p>B) Ban me for absolutely violating nothing what so ever.  </p>

<p>You would ban me because I&#39;m asking for accountability?  I would have not pushed with followup questions if you were upfront and transparent.  I absolutely did not want to make a big deal, but you&#39;ve only incentivized me to do the opposite.</p>

<p>Be a moderator that makes this community better for everyone or be the abusive mod that bans people for holding them accountable.  Your choice.</p>

<p>Pretty much anyone who calls out the mods for defending this behavior and for their deflection, like <a href="/u/flytape">/u/flytape</a> has been engaged in all over this thread. </p>

<p>It seems like calling out the mods for their behavior is banworthy even though it&#39;s not listed under the rules. Not only that, but then they go through the threads and scrub every comment they made in a blatant show of censorship and abuse of power. </p>

<p>I&#39;m expecting my ban to come through soon for making this post. </p>

<p>People post insane shit that makes no sense to readers with any sort of logical thinking left and as a result get a large amount of downvotes from sane people and upvotes from the crazies who really want to believe.

During the election we saw a huge uptick on twitter/facebook with a smaller force on some subreddits/forums. It is highly targeted at specific demographics, and supported by a handful technology companies out of eastern Europe (some of which were highlighted during the campaign, some quiet &#39;defamation&#39; lawsuits came out of it). This is what a modern military PSYOPS campaign looks like.</p>

<p>IMO I feel like this could be 1 of 2 things: </p>

<p>1) someone&#39;s pet bot designed to farm highly-upvoted comments, repost them, and gain karma. <a href="https://medium.com/@Rob79/what-i-learned-selling-my-reddit-accounts-c5e9f6348005">Reddit accounts with high karma can go for hundreds of dollars</a> (I have no idea why anyone would buy one but....)</p>

<p>2) They are trolling us.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna see if I could make a script for easier analysis of these comments, gotta look into the API, but the fact that the bot accounts are being deleted is a good sign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These bots were specifically pushing seth rich conspiracy, Macron email conspiracy, and anti-Paris agreement conspiracy, for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Quick question: Is karma subreddit-specific?</p>

<p>My thoughts: The script/bot farm we saw in action could have easily been managed by a single person with the right software. Click a post to duplicate, hit the button, hang out and answer a few questions here and there from whatever account. Do it a half-dozen times a day with some upvote support from bots and you can easily flood a lower-traffic subreddit like conspiracy, which may hit thousands of people who will then go out and spread some of the ideas elsewhere. Then, multiply this by 100 people all working in other forums and in other locations (4chan, Facebook through viral news posts, other places), and you can generate conspiracies whole cloth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that Seth Rich wasn&#39;t murdered by the DNC, but I think it&#39;s entirely possible that these sorts of campaigns are being run right now. I also think that there has been relatively little attention paid to them because nobody with power wants to talk about it. The DNC and the GOP use these sorts of operations, Facebook was experimenting on humans, CIA has been testing public manipulation programs for decades... the fact that maybe we got manipulated by Russia doesn&#39;t mean that anyone wants an open discussion of this manipulation with the intent to stop it.</p>

<p>The flip side is that any attempt to stop this sort of influence requires stripping some degree of anonymity away from the web, which is an entirely different realm of scary.</p>

Ever read the Great gatsby, my teacher in high school explained that gatsby hid his history in a shroud of rumors and half truths that were vauge as possible never attempting to dispell the rumors, that way if anyone ever stumbled upon his real backstory it would just end up as another rumor. </p>
