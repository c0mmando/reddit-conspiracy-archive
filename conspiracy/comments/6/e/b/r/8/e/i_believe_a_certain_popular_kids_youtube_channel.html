        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Exploring some of the videos and comments in the /pol thread from earlier today, I came upon the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/3uptheyingyang">Toy Freaks</a>, hosted by this (<a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/3uptheyingyang">https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/3uptheyingyang</a>) user, and its affiliated channels Freak World and Freak Family vlogs all consisting of role-playing &quot;episodes&quot; featuring two young girls and &quot;Freak daddy&quot;, their middle-aged single father. For the following purely observational reasons, I implore you to check out the videos for yourselves and determine whether they are worthy of further scrutiny. </p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>First and foremost, the content of the videos is strongly sexual. I won&#39;t get into too much detail for sake of keeping my lunch down, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48L8UaQIFZ8">this</a> video, the first one I clicked on, is just one example that doesn&#39;t need much imagination to view sexually. Seriously, just check them out. You&#39;ll see many common sexual motifs from the sidebar thumbnails alone. Sorry to put the thought in your head but it&#39;s undeniable really.   </p></li>
<li><p>The channel popularity. Now I get that some dumb shit is popular on YouTube, but the Freak Family (his words, not mine) channels have a combined 11 million subscribers and <strong>8 billion</strong> views, with some individual videos in the hundreds of millions. Toy Freaks alone generates over $1 million/year in revenue, making the user one of the top 100 earners on YouTube. I just can&#39;t wrap my head around an audience of that size for these videos and I think you&#39;ll feel the same when you check them out.</p></li>
<li><p>The username of the Toy Freaks channel owner: 3uptheyingyang. For starters, &quot;ying yang&quot; is a fairly common reference to ass or anus in this context. Secondly, the triple ying yang or triskelion is a prominent motif of the BDSM community. And lastly, the user also has a reddit account with the same name, with which he linked to his own video about adult braces (pretending to be another user who stumbled across the vid), and also a link to a random youtube video that is not himself. Weird, but whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>The video quality. Aside from being high definition, the videos are usually shot in a close-range PoV style that is (sorry to say it) highly reminiscent of pornography and leads to some very disturbing still frames and video clips. </p></li>
<li><p>The comment section. It&#39;s bizarre, even by YouTube standards. Just check it out.      </p></li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not connecting this to any other pedogate stuff but for what it is, I think this channel warrants serious examination. If I had to put on my tin foil and make a guess, I would say this guy makes money off his kids by posting public videos of them in intentionally suggestive scenarios, which is not technically illegal. However, I&#39;d be very curious to learn more about the guy and also cross-reference the viewing preferences of his subscribers to determine the type of people watching his videos.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess it was the level of popularity with this stuff that caught me off guard. This isn&#39;t just some niche channel, the guy is literally up there with official music and TV show channels. If he combined his content instead of dividing it into separate accounts/users for no apparent reason, he would breach the top 70 in subs and the top 30 in views.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the parents just assume it&#39;s fine because it&#39;s just toys and cartoons. They probably aren&#39;t too familiar with youtube and don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s not like TV where the content is regulated.</p>

<p>The theory that these videos are simultaneously targeted at children and fetishists seems very likely to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done a lot of informal research into these because they confounded me as well. I think there are a number of factors in play that result in their &quot;popularity&quot;. </p>

<p>First and foremost, the creators are buying views and subscribers in an effort to prime the pump. Thats why they all have between 1 and 2 millions views without their first week of existence. </p>

<p>Second, all of these videos are in pantomime with little to no English. This might make them popular in non-English speaking countries. </p>

<p>You need to factor in the fact that spiderman, frozen, etc content isn&#39;t available on youtube in every country. These videos may well be high ranked results when searching for &quot;iron man&quot; in Turkey.</p>

<p>There are also people who give their kids tablets, search for &quot;paw patrol&quot; and then let youtube play forever. Eventually these videos sneak into the rotation. </p>

<p>A lot of these videos feature stuff that actually does appeal to toddlers: familiar characters, farting, pooping, babies, pregnancy, the concept of boyfriends and girlfriends, having to pee and then wetting yourself, villains being sneaky, etc. </p>

<p>A lot of these concepts also appeal to adults who jerk off to these videos.</p>

<p>You also have your ironic watchers, memers and people who seek out weird shit on youtube.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s one specific reason why these videos are popular and I also don&#39;t think they&#39;re there to groom kids either. I think they exist because they get ad revenue and are easy to make (rent or buy some super hero costumes and you could probably crank out 30 of these videos per day). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the first video linked and couldn&#39;t see anything sexual at all, maybe my imagination isn&#39;t good enough. It&#39;s just two young girls goofing about, one pretending to be a cat and the other a dog. What am I missing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would need to know about BDSM culture and fetish culture to understand that a lot of what is going on in these videos is very very similar to fetish flicks. These videos of the kids are shot very similar to the fetish videos while trying to make it look like children&#39;s content. If you look up fetish shit then watch one of these videos it makes it sooooo much worse </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a google search for &quot;toy freaks h3h3&quot; because I know the h3h3 folks have done a bunch of coverage on these weird type of videos.  If you don&#39;t know, h3h3 is a YouTube channel that does comedic commentary on YouTube culture and other stuff like that. They also have a popular subreddit here on this site. Seems like you might be able to find out more by seeing what those people have turned up though. Looks like there&#39;s multiple threads in the h3h3 subreddit that came up on Google too relating to this stuff in particular. </p>

<p>But yeah, this shit is weird as fuck. </p>

And what is going on in these comments? There is not one reasonable or &#39;normal&#39; comment to be found on these videos. In fact, on the facebook page of this group people seem to be asking for phone numbers and wanting to meet with &quot;Toy Freaks&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your blunt opinion, but can you really discern nothing different about these videos compared to other popular kids shows/videos? Thanks to young cousins I&#39;ve watched all kinds of cartoon and live-acted kids shows and while they are all most certainly bizarre, I don&#39;t think I could pick out sexual themes from any of them if I tried. Moreover, the creators have a strict responsibility to remove any remotely questionable content. Freak Daddy is, at the very least, guilty of leaving suggestive content in his videos which I believe is intentional on his part.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are videos where the dad grabs one of his daughter&#39;s ass with a toy shark.</p>

<p>Lots of videos focus on messy eating, just watching his daughters eat a lot of food in a messy way. </p>

<p>From the few videos I&#39;ve seen it seems like he is intentionally angling the camera towards their butt when visible (ex. in the snake in car video, straight up shoves camera at daughter&#39;s ass when she gets out of car).</p>

<p>LOTS of videos of them playing in pools/in bathing suits. </p>

<p>I genuinely think this guy is doing exactly what you&#39;re saying and a decent amount of people in this PG facebook group I&#39;m in also think there&#39;s something up here.</p>

<p>Odds are we can&#39;t do anything about it though. Not technically illegal and it&#39;s making him (and youtube) a bunch of money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had watched one of these videos before and was disturbed by the weirdness of them. It just felt wrong. These videos aren&#39;t allowed in our home.  However, I didn&#39;t think they were sexual per se, until I began to look at them from a fetish point of view. Holy shit. After that, my radar exploded. There&#39;s  a preteen girl, using a pacifier, taking a bottle, wetting herself, crawling around and spitting out food...this is beyond &quot;normal&quot;. I&#39;m not well versed in BDSM, but I know crawling is used to humiliate. I know there&#39;s a decent number of adults with a baby fetish in this world. There&#39;s more fetish stuff than this, but you guys already know and don&#39;t need me to elaborate. The younger girl is small enough, and young enough, that some may think her acting like a baby could be normal. Throw in the older girl and that explanation Falls all to hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing illegal going on that I can tell. I&#39;ve never had kids, so I don&#39;t know what is creepy and what is okay. It feels creepy to me, and has an underlying weird factor I cannot quite put my finger on. If you look at the channel and it&#39;s views over the years, you can tell they started getting tons of views once the girls started to become prominent. Is the dad taking advantage of his daughters by making money from pedo views? I think so, although it&#39;s not easy to prove.</p>

Sounds like they convinced him to do kids videos when they noticed that people responded to his children on camera.  They have an agenda I would bet, it may be nefarious or it may be as benign as knowing that kids get locked into viewing certain videos and are good for advertisers and view counts.</p>

I dare any of you to make a video not related to kids using Disney characters it will get axed due to copyright violations, but yet these &quot;kid&#39; videos are left untouched while Susan Wojcicki stays silent. They know kids will flock to youtube because most parents are oblivious to what they do on a tablet or phone. This goes much deeper it just has not been confirmed yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing people proffer this theory and I have to give my input. </p>

<p>I used to watch this guy when he had a lawn care channel.  He called his subscribers Freaks and himself the Lawn Freak.  His channel was dedicated to teaching lawn cutting and business ownership philosophy on a one man scale.  Many of his viewers, an active commenting and viewership, were also individual lawn care startups.  He had a very compelling video format, showing him working with stock edm music and voiceover.  </p>

<p>During the course of his videos his marriage broke up and his wife, in the earliest videos he made regarding adult braces, was gone.  He made some really personal vlogs talking about the subject of marriage and single fatherhood and how anybody could do lawn care and make a decent living for himself and his family, just like his father did in lawn care and who was living into his 90s making appearances in the vlog.  Sometimes Freak would have his daughters with him on his work days in the truck while he cut.  It was about this point he started to make less lawn care videos and the viewers assumed it was because he was just too busy during the cutting season and some YouTube drama had come up with another Tuber over lawncare vids (really)</p>

<p>About towards the end his daughters seem more comfortable around the camera in the vlog style so he made a Toy Freaks video where he opens and plays with some Frozen Toys. Then he makes a final video and statement on his lawn care channel that after talking to YouTube and working with a team, who contacted him, about how to increase their marketability.  He deletes his lawn care channel and then, based on what I&#39;m finding out recently, he made Toy Freaks into an empire.  I&#39;ve watched a few of their videos and it is creeping toward conditioning but I feel like YouTube steered him into making it into what it is.  He really was a genuine family guy who bought a camera and thought it was cool, showed people on the internet how he ran his one man operation, told stories about his dad teaching him, and was open about his personal struggles as a single dad making ends meat working for himself.</p>

<p>YouTube has an agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A LOT of spitting/drooling out liquids just consumed. </p>

<p>Yes he has written it for fetish clicks. I watched 3 of the most popular videos and they all have this spitting up/drooling fluids shit. the younger girl, in one, drinks a baby&#39;s bottle filled with chocolate milk, rolls her eyes in prolonged ecstacy, then &quot;throws it up&quot; all over the adult female babysitter. Yeah that&#39;s in like the 2nd most popular video I think.</p>

<p>The inflatable swimming pool + kids circuit on Youtube is a MASSIVE pedo draw. This guy knows it. Another of his most popular videos the &quot;plot&quot; is that his &quot;naughty&quot; daughters, this time at their actual age, not baby-role-playing, set up not one but two inflatable pools indoors and fill them up, much to Dad&#39;s chagrin. Indoor splashing ensues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some people on this board nowadays are way too quick to watch a video that includes children and start pointing fingers saying it contains sexual reference towards children and all that crap. I think the issue is, that some people watch these sort of videos with the view even before watching them that it is gonna be some sort of pedophile aimed material and then whilst watching it are picking bits out here and there, and twist it all to fit to some of the known pedophile references etc. You know it may seem a bit creepy some of the content in the videos but you know maybe it is as simple as a dad and his two kids having a bit of innocent fun. I am in no way taking sides, but I think in order to investigate this sort of content people need to proceed with an unbias view on the content in order to get a more accurate outcome. It is too easy nowadays for somebody to watch a video featuring children and analyse every little thing and say &#39;well that could be a pedophile reference&#39; just because something that they say or do in the video is slightly similiar to one of the pedophile reference / signs we know about. We&#39;ve got to realise the pedophile signs and codes etc that we know about don&#39;t mean that absolutely all content showing one of those signs is pedophile material. As I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not taking sides I have no opinion on this particular YouTube channel because I don&#39;t think there is enough evidence for us to confidently say it is definitely pedo content</p>
