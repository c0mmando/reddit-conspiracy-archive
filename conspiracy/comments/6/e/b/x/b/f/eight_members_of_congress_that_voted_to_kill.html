      <p>
       FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is
       <strong>
        toxic
       </strong>
       so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a
       <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement">
        statement of support
       </a>
       or expressed their support in a
       <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html">
        document of anti-net neutrality talking points
       </a>
       to show that Pai has some congressional backing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:

      <p>
       All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/">
        u/pperca rightly points out
       </a>
       that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

       Exactly. These Net Neutrality advocates need to realize that this was always a solution in absense of a problem.

       It resulted in taking power from the FTC and giving it to the FCC who then took two years to formulate their edge provider (Google) "privacy bill" handout that Obama signed in Dec. 2016 after the election in a curious media silence. Why wouldn't they want to include it in his legacy??? Hmmmmmmm

       You are confusing Internet Privacy, which we lost with Net Neutrality. Your about to lose a right. Why don't you educate yourself before taking sides, possibly against your own self-interest?

       You are spreading disinformation. The BS privacy bill wouldn't have been put forth without "Net Neutrality". Maybe if you read my comment "resulted in" rather than parroting disinformation agent tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you respond to my original comment? No one else can. Because maybe you know that i exposed a major logical fallacy in your "grassroots" anti-Net Neutrality argument. What problem was fixed by the Net Neutrality framework?

       <p>
        What did we have before Net Neutrality framework was adopted?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A multitude of Internet-based service and content providers (think Google, Twitter, Netflix, Reddit, Amazon, CNN, Microsoft, Facebook, Spotify, 4chan, ...) which compete freely with each other because users who don't like any given service can simply type a different URL into their browser and use another one.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has been changing in the last years is that broadband providers are now trying to take money not only from their own customers, but also from content providers whose content these customers consume, under the threat of cutting or limiting customers' access to this content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside of such situation is an increased barrier to entry for service and content providers, which will reduce competition on this market. And a possibility of shady backroom deals: content providers paying broadband providers for hindering of their competitors, including but not limited to large mainstream media ganging up against smaller players. Paradoxically, removal of Net Neutrality may increase the amount of regulatory oversight required on these markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upside - broadband bills will be cheaper. But Netflix will get more expensive. It's fair that users of bandwidth hog services pay more, but this would be better enforced by per-customer bandwidth limits and data metering. This way users could still choose their content providers freely without being limited to companies who negotiated deals with broadband provider available in their area.

       Net neutrality is declaring ISPs public utilities. You're being brainwashed into believing there was any benefit to net neutrality but for a handful of corporate content providers (and Comcast subscribers, those unlucky folks).
      </p>
      <p>
       Scaling pricing (and/or bandwidth throttling) is merely the "scary consequence" being fear-mongered by net neutrality advocates.
      </p>
      <p>
       When content providers want to start laying cable, they're free to do so. Just ask Google. It's cheaper to sway public opinion and have the other guy's network be declared a public utility than it is to build an ISP.

       I only have the choice between shitty Comcast and shittier AT&amp;T. The whole point of net neutrality is that many Americans only have one or a few shitty options, so without regulation, these people will be screwed by Comcast or Time Warner or whoever has the monopoly in their local environment. You even acknowledge this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's precisely the opposite with regards to who benefits. Now that Netflix is a big corporation, it no longer cares about Net Neutrality because it can afford to pay for access. It's the small companies that can't afford to pay for access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google's entire business model relies on finding, indexing, organizing, and providing whatever content users desire. They do best when the internet is open and free with many small content providers, because then people are more likely to use a google search rather than going directly to one of a few large content providers and using their search instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Google has an entire business devoted to building out an ISP. It has stopped rolling out fiber and started acquiring wireless broadband companies, presumably with expectation that most consumers don't need the bandwidth that fiber provides and that wireless broadband will be drastically less capital intensive to deploy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think you're wrong on every front except your first sentence, where you're not even disagreeing with me.

       Apologies I was away out of town for the last few days. 
I mainly posted this as a means to share with other people who are concerned with the further tampering (even beyond as bad as it is now) of the last truly "wild west"-type bastion of free speech and the ability to share information that we do now, and so for others who care about maintaining as close to free and open of an internet as possible, and less severely monopolistic regarding the providers like Comcast that itself in turn owns a lot of companies that provide information to the many, and so as media conglomeration and thus information conglomeration (from Phone/text, data, internet, cable, communications with the world around you etc etc) becomes more and more of an absolute powerhouse of control over not only what goes to the peoples eyes and minds and lessens the variety and ultimately the freedoms and liberties of the people when this type of information control gets too out of hand. So that's why I wanted to share such information to other potentially understanding critical thinkers to perhaps help make a difference, even if it's just better awareness for what's going on in that regard.

        Net Neutrality

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers and governments regulating the Internet should treat all data on the Internet the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, website, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication. The term was coined by Columbia University media law professor Tim Wu in 2003,
        <strong>
         as an extension of the longstanding concept of a common carrier,
        </strong>
        which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.

        A common carrier in common law countries (corresponding to a public carrier in civil law systems,[1] usually called simply a carrier) is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and that is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport.[2] A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body.
        <strong>
         The regulatory body has usually been granted "ministerial authority" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier
        </strong>
        (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.

      <p>
       So they gave themselves the authority to create, interpret, and enforce regulations on the internet. Do you think they will not use this power after just one regulation? How about 2? They will make hundreds of regulations a year..
      </p>
      <p>
       And you want to give this kind of power over the media platform that is dominating the opinions of the masses....All because you are afraid of having to close a targeted ad, or install an ad blocker, or are to stupid to change internet carriers if one is not doing right?

       You are promoting the same bullshit libertarians and republicans spout about some how companys being able to save us all from government despite them already showing they don't give two fucks. Across much of the US ISPs  hold monopolies, there is no real competition. In areas where it is with the death of net neutrality they can just deny access to their competition. It's not as simple as "just switch companies" when killing NN sets the ground work to kill competition. You really think these officials who jumped on destroying your privacy have your best interests at heart? You're just regurgitating talking points they where given by the companies. Regulations can be necessary and useful, or would you rather have companies regulate themselves across all industries?

       So shock conservatives are pushing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their version of the US is to remove all government power (so that us voting in people won't matter, kill the voice of the people) and let private companies take control of everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       From roads to the air you breath they want a few rich people to own the country and make the decisions. And they get plenty of backing from those people in their effort to sell out the USA. When a conservative tells you they are patriotic - laugh in their face. All they do is lie ("Hey, I am patriot and love our troops - let's send them off to endless wars!

       Something that never gets talked about in these Net Neutrality astroturf threads (look at the upvote to comment ratios) is that Title II Net Neutrality applies censorship laws to the internet. Notice how the pro-Net Neutrality posters always talk about the possibility that Comcast or Verizon will "censor" certain content. What they fail to mention is that the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Timeline_of_significant_events">
        Law that the FCC reinterpreted and applied ISPs in 2015
       </a>
       and called "Net Neutrality" actually contains obscenity laws and speech codes. What the FCC is calling "Net Neutrality" is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the (until now) open internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The censorship portion of the Law is under Section 223.
       <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf">
        But don't take my word on it, read the Law itself.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        (a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;

      <blockquote>

       Let's get something else straight: it's not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       ISPs that have a dog in this fight. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Conde Nast,
       <strong>
        all of whom censor content,
       </strong>
       are pro-Net Neutrality.
       <strong>
        The idea that Title II will somehow prevent censorship is insane - we already have censorship on the internet and Title II will do absolutely nothing to stop Google/Facebook/Twatter/Conde Nast from censoring whatever they feel like censoring.

       I'm aware that Verizon vs. FCC did potentially limit the FCC's ability to enforce Net Neutrality on ISPs, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       My larger point is that Title II isn't the only way to get Net Neutrality, and has some severe drawbacks with regard to freedom of speech from my understanding of the Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you on the "new legislation" angle. Net Neutrality itself isn't a bad idea - I just don't think we should depend on the FCC to give it to us - their role in censoring speech in media is well established.

       Sure, but it's our only option right now, as the republicans have made clear they have no interest in it. I think people want to prevent whatever damage they can so in 2-4 years it won't already be ingrained into how our internet is served, and harder to get people onboard with undoing it.

       Yeah, they're already violating net neutrality, and they're getting sued for it. Now you're saying it should be legal for ISPs to throttle bandwidth to whoever they want, or even just cut off access to whoever they want, and charge customers and content providers specifically to avoid this throttling. Or, maybe Comcast just permanently throttles Netflix while promoting its own XFINITY service, and there's nothing we can do about it.

       I live in TN, and here the commercial ISP's have to deal with local cities running their own High Speed Fiber optic "community" owned ISP's. This is something They have, in general,  struggled a great deal to compete with. To top that, the Gov just passed the Rural Broadband Initiative allowing cities to expand their fiber networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charter/comcast/whatever will never lay new fiber optic lines to compete, So its all about Gov ISP's and big data centers bringing in jobs, we have great cheap bandwidth though. You may think they have no interest, but maybe republicans have interests, here in TN anyway.

       First, the language is very clear: it requires
       <strong>
        intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person
       </strong>
       . You repeatedly chop this language up to claim that it censors obscene language, or that it censors annoying language, or any combination thereof, when it specifically requires intent to harass an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, you don't bother distinguishing between censorship by Google or Facebook and censorship by ISPs. They are two separate issues. Censorship by a search engine is deeply troubling, but it's different than censorship by an ISP, where it literally becomes impossible to access content.

       Censorship laws are still censorship laws. Even if they require a prosecutor to prove "intent to annoy" in order to censor you. Nothing in my post is the least bit disingenuous. I literally included the text of the law that mentions "intent to annoy..." in my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling what I say "disinformation" and accusing me of "hating net neutrality" is missing my point entirely. I do not oppose net neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do oppose, are censorship laws being applied to the internet, no matter the justification. Protecting freedom of speech should always come first when it comes to your rights on the internet.

       It's
       <strong>
        intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass
       </strong>
       . You can't just chop up sentences in a law. This isn't a censorship law, it's not being used to censor obscene language, you're just making shit up with absolutely no justification. Not only are you not a lawyer, but you were horrifically ignorant of the law

       Net neutrality is toxic. Comcast should be dismantled if it's really that bad. Google doesn't need a competitive advantage.

       The internet was plenty free before this regulatory push. More free than it is under net neutrality. If anything, net neutrality is Orwellian double speak for imposing widespread restrictions on internet usage.

       Net neutrality lets the government censor the internet. No need to pay ISPs, because they would already be owned by the government.

       You're mixing up nationalising ISPs with net neutrality.
Net neutrality=ISPs have to treat all internet traffic the same, and cannot censor the internet.
Nationalising ISPs=Government owns and controls internet access.
