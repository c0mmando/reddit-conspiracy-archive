    <div class="md"><p>Yes I see. I have a hard time understanding the implications of being labeled an Anti-Semite, but now I see that if you are a rock star or someone in the public eye that has a lot to lose, being labeled anti-Semitic could really &quot;damage your brand.&quot; 
I guess that only reinforces the notion that they are in total control of our media and largely in control of simple political discourse.<br/>
This comes back to the adage &quot;if you want to know who rules over you, find out who you can&#39;t criticize.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>That Is what I hoped to understand since the word seems to be used as a synonym for Jewish. </p>

<p>Keep in mind guys, (not calling op a shill), but the shills seek to be trying to flood the sub with questions like this...stupid shit, the general premise is,</p>

<p>&quot;Ok, so Jews run the world and I hate them, so am I anti Semite?&quot;</p>

<p>Or the classic</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s time to call a spade a spade&quot;.</p>

<p>Enough of the obsession over the Jewish faction of the New World Order.</p>

<p>There are black, white, Asian, Latina, Christian, Saudi, Koran, Russian entities within the new world order as well guys. It&#39;s not &quot;Jews run the world&quot;, that shit is so goofy and counter intuitive.</p>

<p>We already know how to bring down these people. Spreading mass awareness, new currency, new system. Arguing over what the hell color or religion the elite are is the stupidest shit I&#39;ve ever heard...just drop it already.</p>

<p>Yes. There is a powerful Zionist faction within this global scheme for a world gov. But they are not the ruling entity. Let this stuff go man....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Don&#39;t give me so much credit (to be a shill.). The reason I posed the question was because I heard the Italian Mafia pales in comparison to the Jewish Mafia. 
As a matter of fact someone wrote a book about the never talked about Jewish mob, once the book was taken to the press the Jewish owner told him to change the name of the book to something that didn&#39;t implicate Jews. 
So, I wonder if they have a crime ring. </p>

Yet, no one talks about how they were kicked out of nearly every country for practices such as Jewish Ritual murder. Very closely related to Satnic Ritual Abuse.

    <div class="md"><p>LMAO yes, because they murdered 70-80,000,000 Russians unknown numbers of Chinese, over the last 2,000 years of their occupation of Northern Europe estimates that they have murdered over 100,000,000 Native Europeans through their &#39;roman state religion&#39; and HAHA they aren&#39;t going to stop with you...if you dive deep into the Occult do it for ONE PURPOSE only and that is to learn EVERYTHING you can for your own personal edification...no other reason...because the stakes for learning what is really happening are higher than most people want to pay and truly beyond most people&#39;s reckoning.  </p>

<p>If we took all their murders and machinations into account you would see over 1 BILLION SOULS EASY have been murdered in the most horrific ways someone can think (depending on how far back you want to go we may be looking at a global genocide too)...so you might want to make up your mind about how deep you want to go with this...just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im more worried about the really sensitive &quot;SJW&quot; types, that could potentially be redpilled here, but might be pushed away by an influx of anti-zionist/jewish discussion all over the feed. Doesn&#39;t that make sense?</p>
