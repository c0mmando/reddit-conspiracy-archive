       I think the difference here is that most people hear "Zionist" and assume that either:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         All Jews are Zionists
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're saying all Jews are Zionists
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think this is part conspiracy and part useful idiocy, people aren't willing to educate themselves to understand the difference.

       It's a political front backed by a religious doctrine. Call it whatever you want but you even said it in your own title, if zionism is simply political, then how can criticizing it be anti semitic?

       Yes I see. I have a hard time understanding the implications of being labeled an Anti-Semite, but now I see that if you are a rock star or someone in the public eye that has a lot to lose, being labeled anti-Semitic could really "damage your brand." 
I guess that only reinforces the notion that they are in total control of our media and largely in control of simple political discourse.
       <br/>
       This comes back to the adage "if you want to know who rules over you, find out who you can't criticize." 
And over an honest earnestly presented question... 
Whoever has a problem with my post feel free to fuck right off.

       That Is what I hoped to understand since the word seems to be used as a synonym for Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in fact as far as I can tell is Zionist means someone who supports and promotes the idea that the Jewish people should have a nation of their own.

       Stop with this shit...Jesus
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind guys, (not calling op a shill), but the shills seek to be trying to flood the sub with questions like this...stupid shit, the general premise is,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ok, so Jews run the world and I hate them, so am I anti Semite?"
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       "It's time to call a spade a spade".
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough of the obsession over the Jewish faction of the New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are black, white, Asian, Latina, Christian, Saudi, Koran, Russian entities within the new world order as well guys. It's not "Jews run the world", that shit is so goofy and counter intuitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know how to bring down these people. Spreading mass awareness, new currency, new system. Arguing over what the hell color or religion the elite are is the stupidest shit I've ever heard...just drop it already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. There is a powerful Zionist faction within this global scheme for a world gov. But they are not the ruling entity. Let this stuff go man....

       Im more worried about the really sensitive "SJW" types, that could potentially be redpilled here, but might be pushed away by an influx of anti-zionist/jewish discussion all over the feed. Doesn't that make sense?

       If you have influence and can possibly sway people to think for themselves and question the narrative?  Then assassination may be a viable option.  Likely, first would be character assassination and career destruction.  Until you fall back in line, if you ever do.

       The problem is, though, that it's not just average folks who fail to distinguish the many intricacies regarding Judaism/Zionism/Israel, it's that governments and resulting legal standards have taken stances that completely disregard the separation as well, and so misinformation has become enforced in many countries in the process.

       Haha. Don't give me so much credit (to be a shill.). The reason I posed the question was because I heard the Italian Mafia pales in comparison to the Jewish Mafia. 
As a matter of fact someone wrote a book about the never talked about Jewish mob, once the book was taken to the press the Jewish owner told him to change the name of the book to something that didn't implicate Jews. 
So, I wonder if they have a crime ring.

       It doesn't take much.  They don't want people talking about how Israel is a powerful nation that drags the US around like a donkey.  They don't want people to question the holocaust.  They don't want people to notice that they are an apartheid state, and murder Palestinians at a whim.  They are sore subjects, and they can't yet completely control peoples thoughts.

       Yes, I suppose their occupation of Palestine is a taboo subject for us to discuss. Yet, no one talks about how they were kicked out of nearly every country for practices such as Jewish Ritual murder. Very closely related to Satnic Ritual Abuse. Where they kidnap a young baby and drain its blood, then drink it on Passover... they will tell us all about 6 million. But they won't mention the 10 million Yagoda ordered to be killed.

       Nice try to frame Israel as "powerful" - they're a laughing stock in terms of "power" - however they are deceitful, corrupt, without morality to the HILT.
      </p>
      <p>
       USA wouldn't have to do anything - just stop funding and arming Israel and the rest of the world would have them under control immediately.

       The true statement is no one wants to talk about how Israel is a parasite.

       LMAO yes, because they murdered 70-80,000,000 Russians unknown numbers of Chinese, over the last 2,000 years of their occupation of Northern Europe estimates that they have murdered over 100,000,000 Native Europeans through their 'roman state religion' and HAHA they aren't going to stop with you...if you dive deep into the Occult do it for ONE PURPOSE only and that is to learn EVERYTHING you can for your own personal edification...no other reason...because the stakes for learning what is really happening are higher than most people want to pay and truly beyond most people's reckoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we took all their murders and machinations into account you would see over 1 BILLION SOULS EASY have been murdered in the most horrific ways someone can think (depending on how far back you want to go we may be looking at a global genocide too)...so you might want to make up your mind about how deep you want to go with this...just saying.
