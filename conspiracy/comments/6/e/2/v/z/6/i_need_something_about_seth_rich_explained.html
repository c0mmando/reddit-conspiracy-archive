       Today i was reading a newspaper from a few days ago and it had a article from the washington post in it and it was supposedly wrote by Seths parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had mentioned "fake news" and "conspiracy theories" in it and they also mentioned how they wait everyday for a phone call on who killed their son.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a parent and i just cant comprehend why they are against the idea that their son might of been a leaker? Why does it seem so offensive to them? Shouldnt their main priority be to find out why their son was killed and who did it? The whole thing just doesnt add up to me. If i were in his parents shoes i would be thankful and happy that other people are digging into my childs murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this has nothing to do with the right, left, etc. I think all parties are corrupt.

       Thats what i was thinking. For them to throw out some of those words just threw me off. No one has said anything negative about Seth...matter of fact if it ever gets proved he was behind the leaks that would make him a hero to many people.

       When the response went out, my BS meter was through the roof when I heard the terms "fake news" and "
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       ". I hate that term these days, gets thrown around implying facts are only validated by MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I later learned the guy handling their statements was a Crisis management PR firm guy. It makes sense when you take context this fact.

       Prediction time, right before being approached by DNC connected PR pros (who were hiding their true affiliations) Seth's family was harassed in a false flag operation to make sure they would be compliant with the PR person.  I'm sure the DNC's plans for the Rich family were more complex than "send them a PR guy".

Knowing this as a parent, and having to watch a bunch of right-wing shitheads turn your son's murder into a baseless partisan attack against the very political party that your son held so dear must fill his parents with a sense of disgust that I doubt many of us could imagine.

       I do believe this Seth Rich disinformation campaign is being orchestrated by the right-wing, but plenty of Trumpists and Bernie bros are blindly running with it too. I'm sure some Jill Stein supporters believe it was well. There are lots of gullible people from all political backgrounds.

       You're right, and most of them seem to naively believe it was Russia who supplied the leaks, despite a

        dearth of evidence and numerous contradictions

        numerous issues with the assertion that he is Russian in origin
       </a>
       . That's not even going into the fact that his leaks were entirely insubstantial, and the media so very, very obviously worked to conflate his dumps with Wikileaks's.

       Asserting that it's primarily a right-wing conspiracy theory results in there being only an arbitrary distinction in your statement between right wingers and those "gullible enough to fall for their propaganda" and is ignorant as well of the fact that the theory originated on the non-partisan DNCLeaks sub. It wasn't a strawman and saying it is doesn't make it so nor does it change the intent of your original statement to denigrate those who believe in it. You're propagating the idea that it's a right-wing theory and if you disagree on that point you're either an idiot or being intentionally disingenuous with your posts.

       Because the entire media narrative focuses on the poorly supported assertion that it was Russia, not an insider,  which supplied the leaks to Wikileaks. Read my previous post. I said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Seth

        was the source of the DNCLeaks
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is one of these three options which were the source of the leaks. Russia as the source is poorly supported, there's no evidence of any kind of an alternate insider to Seth, and Wikileaks and Assange's numerous references to Seth Rich add credence to the idea that it was him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       You seem awfully certain that what corporate media is telling you is true is actually true. Maybe Seth wasn't the source, but you're
       <em>
        awfully sure
       </em>
       when you really have no reason to be. But go ahead and keep denigrating those who entertain the possibility, continue believing we're all being misled by Sean Hannity and his ilk when the Seth Rich theory predates all involvement of the right and 'alt-right'.

       I have no reason to believe he was the source. There is no evidence he had any kind of access to get the emails to begin with, no less any evidence of him leaking them. Every claim of real evidence has been debunked or walked back from the source.

       Yes, like Sean Hannity and the other right-wing mouthpieces that are pushing this "story".

       You can't just make any claim you want to and expect other people to prove it's false. If you make a claim the responsibility falls on you to prove it's true.

       It's only been framed as a "right wing" theory since the likes of Uber-shill Sean Hannity started making a big fucking deal out of it. Prior to that it was actual leftists, you know, real "liberals" and notbthe fake brainwashed Hillbot types, who were all over this. But now it's considered a "right wing" and "Fox News" conspiracy theory so that it can be discredited. Just Deep State Hannity doing his job.

       Here's the actual timeline of the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first mention of it was a tweet trying to
       <a href="https://twitter.com/relombardo3/status/752697104003264514">
        tie the Rich murder with the DNC lawsuit
       </a>
       . That was posted less than 24 hours after the murder (with zero evidence btw). Two days later (July 13th) we see the right-wing media pushing their own version of the Seth Rich conspiracy via
       <a href="http://archive.is/RxXMb#selection-243.0-255.7">
        WhatDoesItMean.com
       </a>
       who ran a story claiming Rich was on his way to meet with the FBI about the Clinton Foundation when he was gunned down by a Clinton hit squad.
       <strong>
        Pretty telling that the first actual Seth Rich article pushing a conspiracy literally came from the Kremlin.

       No an investor in the WaPo also was invested in Amazon. One of Amazon's services was used by the CIA. By you shit logic, I am the CIA, since my company also uses Amazon Cloud services for our website and sales.

       WaPo was CIA long before Amazon was created. The deal with Amazon and he CIA just illustrate the cozy relationship between the WaPo's owner and the CIA. Operation Mockingbird, Carl Bernstein, etc etc etc. this is conspiracy 101. It's like arguing over 2 plus 2 equals 4.

       Funny how I see these comments at the top of every front page post. I think people just start freaking out when they see any downvotes before it gets upvoted and are like "wahhh you shills are downvoting me! The MSM is out in full force." This post is relatively young and it's not being downvoted.

       Because it's tired old rehashing of a batshit crazy conspiracy. People are worried we'll have a repeat of the Pizzagate shooter where someone goes paranoid and insane and starts committing violence thinking the DC police or the FBI are squashing the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your post, no, authorities investigating it is NOT THE SAME as random vigilantes. And you can't call a mix of 4chan LARPing, twitter attention-whores, and maybe some legitimate journalism from hobbyists anything more than vigilante justice. Take it off the damn reddit pages, contact and give interviews with the FBI and put your money where your mouth it. Going to RT or Fox and having TV shows about it
       <em>
        is disrespectful
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        politicization.
       </em>
       You might find that weird and too harsh because you're filtering it through your partisan lens, but Seth's parents were Democrats. They don't see the Trump-Russia connection as a hoax. It appears much more crass to them.

       "But, you're probably knee deep in Russia schizophrenia and believe Putin is the boogeyman." - You, just eight days ago. Funny how anyone who argues against the Seth Rich investigation is "extremely suspicious", but you don't hesitate to argue against the idea that Russia may have helped elect our current President.

       And then, of course, we keep seeing all sorts of Trump/Russia connections. The Attorney General meets with the Russian ambassador. The Secretary of State does business with Rosneft and Gazprom. The (former) National Security advisor quits after appearing on the Kremlin-funded propaganda network, lies about working with the Russian ambassador, and visits the Russian military intelligence agency. Oh, and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, tries to set up a secret "back-channel" communication with the Kremlin-
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       Trump even wins the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone who supposedly isn't working with the Russians, Trump certainly seems to be working with the Russians.

       By the way, installing a secret backchannel isn't diplomacy- it's hiding communications you don't want anyone else to see. It's funny how a conspiracy subreddit is suddenly fine with that sort of thing. Apparently you don't trust the government... until you do.

       Feel free to actually address any of his arguments. Coincidences are not evidence. There is zero actual evidence. Their son is fucking dead. They want real investigators figuring out what happened. They don't want to be harassed by keyboard jockeys with an agenda because they've been circle-jerked into believing there are "too many coincidences".

       I mean, wasn't that the entire point of hiring Rod Wheeler to investigate Seth Rich's murder? A real investigator looking into their son's murder? No sooner then Wheeler reports that Seth Rich was in contact with Wikileaks, and that DC Metro failed to thoroughly investigate the murder case then Brad Bauman stepped in as the spokesman for the Rich family. The same Brad Bauman with ties as a PR crisis manager for the DNC and ties to David Brock of CTR/Share blue notoriety.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, any statement made on the behalf of the Rich family at this point has been put in their mouths by the same people who are desperate to make this entire investigation go away. Rather than pitching in for the reward (over $500k now), helping investigators find the culprits who murdered their own employee and simultaneously exonerating themselves by helping to find the murderer(s) of Seth Rich, we instead see a steady stream of denials with appeals to decency. If the Rich family truly wanted to put the entire matter to rest, and was satisifed with the lack of answers from DC Metro, why hire Wheeler in the first place?

       But the long and the short of it is they hired this guy Wheeler. I'm sure they hired him with the best of intentions, maybe this guy could help? By he summarily goes on TV saying this stuff, creates a shitstorm for the family
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       has to retract within days because there's not one shred of evidence backing it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the family supposed to be grateful? And are they not supposed to deal with the fact that this guy put a shitstorm on their hands, and are being harassed? Are they supposed to invite more of this into their lives when 99.9% of the people coming forward are nuts who take as their bedrock the same baseless horseshit that Wheeler had to walk back in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure they would love a sincere and faithful independent investigation and amongst the din of noise, I'm not sure you can even say for certain they're not doing it. I think you'd have to be completely intellectually dishonest to believe what's happening now is such an independent investigation fully faithful to the truth. This is a fucking circus and a family with a murdered son are in the middle of it.

       As a PI his reputation is everything.  To think he went on MSM and committed career suicide all willy-nilly is ridiculous.

       Speculation:

      <p>
       -FBI knows and sources did confirm to Wheeler that contact had been made.  Given that it's an ongoing investigation they are involved in on more than one front the FBI visited Wheeler and told him to STFU.  That's my best guess.  The parameters of this entire investigation are very very abnormal.

       This is pretty absurd reasoning on this sub of all places. This board routinely tears apart people who's "reputations are everything." Journalists, federal investigators, politicians etc. - and not in a "they fucked up and made bigger claims than they had" way- in a "they're all baby-rapist aliens covering up for the elites" way. I don't know when we grew some unbounded reverence for private investigators of all people....
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I'm sorry, this is blind faith. The man made a ridiculous claim backed up by not one piece of evidence and then walked it back within days. This is also a man who'd previously peddled a ridiculous "national network of roving lesbian gangs" theory also supported by nothing. If you want to do mental gymnastics to prop up a clear bullshitter, be my guest.

       Seriously? How are you going to trash LARPing?! A bunch of kids getting out of the house, going down to the park for pretend sword fights. There is some seriously something wrong with our culture when idiots like yourself trash out a perfectly healthy hobby, and label it an insult. I hope all the perfectly healthy kids in your neiborhood put down their foam swords, and pick up the needle, and then push it on your kids. For the record I'm not into LARPing myself, you just need to get a grip you toxic shit stain.

       Because whatever "newspaper" you were reading was lying to you. They were not upset about the possibility of their son being the leaker. That is a lie.

       It's typical in arkancides for the Clintons to get to the family before the family gets suspicious about a murder. They offer a job promotion before killing a person, which was what happened to seth rich. Larry Nichols explained it perfectly

       George Webb says the same thing. Explains the fingerprints on Seth Rich are the same as all previous Clinton victims like Vince Foster. Which makes sense because they (all deep state operations, really) never change the playbook. The good thing about this is you can analyze something from, say, 30 years ago and use that same analysis to something of suspicion today to get a lot of answers and leads.

       I don't see how anyone can understand what the Riches are going through unless you've had a child murdered, and honestly, it's really offensive to them when people tell them what their priorities should be.  Would you really want strangers harassing you and acting like vigilantes who view your dead son as a pawn in their game?

       All these people have already decided that Hillary had him killed.  It seems to be some weird unholy alliance of Trump supporters trying to distract from the Russia investigation and bitter Bernie people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just as likely that the Russians had him killed, but nobody wants to talk about that.  Nobody.  All they want to do is destroy the DNC and to hell with anyone that gets in their way.

       One thing that I don't think has been addressed in this thread yet involves the legalities related to evidence. I'm sure they do want to know who killed their son but when you've got random Internet Sleuthers and media personalities looking to find the links to solve the murder, it can sometimes backfire when it comes to prosecution. Knowing who is responsible is one thing and getting justice is another.

       Brad Baum is a handler hired by the DNC, likely he wrote statements they are now reading. It would be pretty scary to have your son's murderers send some to your house and tell you to read a script.

       They and their words are completely manipulated, most likely through threats/coercion, but maybe worse. We can't even know if they were scripted (if on video) – or never said anything like that and it's just reported (if in print).
      </p>
      <p>
       Another darker explanation is that if SR were truly a victim of SatRitAbuse (the "panda" references in his identity), then his parents probably knew about it either after-the-fact  – or (shudder) were in on it for the money, or (double-shudder) card-carrying members of the same group. Very easily controlled and blackmailed if so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry to even suggest that because (of course) they come off as nice people, but the panda theme is strange, and their video interviews are doubly strange.

       If indeed their son was the leaker they want proof, not just people thinking out loud. Otherwise it has the appearance of using his death to push a political agenda.
      </p>

       Can't blame them, I would ask for proof as well if I was in their position. People can investigate and make it known that an investigation is needed without speculating through the media.

       They would simply reach out to Assange if that were the case.  I believe he may not confirm it publicly but if SR's parents wanted to know I would think he would tell them?  They may already know...they may not.
