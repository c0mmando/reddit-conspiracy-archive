       Mods, obviously someone is loading botnets into the forums. Please help us out and come up with a way to clean this mess up.

       But it really only lends credence to the Seth Rich story. I mean, if we're all a bunch of crazy conspiracy kooks, they certainly would have nothing to be afraid of.

       Check this out reddit insights proving the bot net mass downvoted my post. A Mod shows up to do damage control with a bs answer and doesnt reply to further questions.

       My post was that shills are likely controlling entire posts and the comment chains within to show a false narrative and consensus to lurkers which out number posters 10 to 1

       Yeah I saw your thread earlier today. Not really sure what to make of it. To me it's pretty obvious that there's vote bots here. I think that's obvious to you as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the mods, don't trust them. But then again, don't trust me either. Trust yourself, and make up your own mind.

       Either way im troubled by the apparent lack of concern that discussion is being suppressed. 
Free discussion should be a cornerstone of a transparency focused sub such as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not saying every mod is compromised or even any of them are im simply putting forth a concern regarding very sketchy voting behavior and basically getting stonewalled by the people who are supposed to ensure the sub is running smoothly.

And when they did find him the government didn't want to admit to his existence so they covered the whole thing up.

       Why couldnt I have been here when the conversation was less political, I think a conspiracy sub is a stupid place to screw around with. Most of us are a little paranoid as it is, eveantually people will really start to notice, unlike if you were on news or politics subs.

       There's a chance the mods might have deleted it because we both kinda posted the same thing at the same time. I'm not really sure how they run things yet. (Or maybe the bot army downvoted it into oblivion?) Regardless, I'm 100% down for forming another subreddit.

       I wounder how many Subs are basically run by bots now, like how many have the core members left and bots prop them up. Like to the point in which the sub is basically only mods and bots, with other people joining in when it makes it to all.

       He did! I just recently learned that too! I used to think America was just bullying Russia until they shot down a fucking airliner. That made me reassess and start looking at Russia differently. I did some research and Putin seems to have come into power via false-flag attacks on his own people. Very bad hombre. Scary!

       Your viewpoint is based on an extreme Christian world view. Many of us are agnostics who don't believe in God or Satan and thus don't believe in fairy tale satanic rings. The minute you mention that stuff your argument goes out the window. Here's the response to the "spirit cooking" shit from the people themselves:

       Man, you are a CLICHE. From Putin bashing, we quickly move into defense of the satanic pedophiles! They get you in central casting?

      <p>
       So many trigger words! "Extreme Christian worldview"...."fairy tale satanic rings"....."your argument goes out the window"....
      </p>
      <p>
       See, those knee-jerk responses USED to have traction, but as the years and facts have piled up, they really just don't anymore. People are seeing with their own eyes, not believing the brainwashing. Anyone who's been paying attention for years knows about SRA and the pedophile rings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's pretty funny that this is the second time I've seen this cut'n'paste and/or bot response! Nearly word for word, though it didn't have the Snopes link [Snopes has been discredited a ton, too, most recently with their Monsanto payoff, but there are many other examples. Nobody on r/conspiracy with any validity is using Snopes as a defense to make their point, for goodness sake!

       Well it's just been obvious to me since I read the Bible cover to cover as a kid that it's bullshit. There are so many issues, from bad science, to god-fallacies, to the fact that you'd have to consider the Bible says that half the worlds population will burn in hell for believing in the religions of the region they were born into. That just is not a loving God and furthermore, as a conspiracy theorist I don't see how you can't understand that religion is just another control tool by those that rule the world.

       Exactly. As I mentioned in that thread, I feel like there's an effort to spread false evidence and discredit the investigation. The noise is making it much harder to get to the bottom of this, but at the same time it's making it clearer that something stinks

       They are purposely upvoting the more ridiculous Seth Rich claims and brigading the threads with top comment chains that make the OP look like a fucking idiot and also makes it seem like those actually out there trying to find information are pushing a political agenda of sorts.

       Wouldn't this be evidence that the bots are upvoting thew Seth Rich stories, since they've been basically the only stories to gain any traction for weeks, and the stuff that used to make it to the top of r/conspiracy gets constantly buried? Confirmation bias is a helluva thing, huh. That and projection, you guys are great at that too. Oh, and stupid headlines, no one does better stupid hyperbole filled headlines.

       A lot of people have begun to realize that they need to diversify their news sources... As such, many of those people will visit multiple sites/subs/etc in order to form a complete picture of what's happening in the world. /R/conspiracy is one aspect of that picture, and as such, there is likely a war going on between the right and left to take it over for the purpose of pushing their narratives on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad, but it's the inevitable outcome of any "open" forum that gathers credibility and attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep that in mind when you're browsing this sub. It doesn't necessarily mean that we are "close to something huge" (although it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       mean that from time to time) - a more down-to-earth read of the situation is that these spikes occur not to cover up a story, but to
       <em>
        push
       </em>
       one... Meaning, the bots could just as likely be Trump-bots looking to advance the Seth Rich story rather than DNC-bots seeking to squash it. The agenda pushing can come from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, readers should be wary and take everything with a grain of salt. There's a lot at stake when discussing these sorts of stories online (as evidenced by the election) and it's all the reason for political organizations to use this off-election cycle as practice for the next big event in 2018.

       As a possible explanation l, it could have something to do with that tied up woman on livestream today. The times it picked up steam seem to match up and the countdown ended as the numbers fell. The streams got up to about 20k that I saw and I checked here to see if anyone was talking about it, so it's possible others did too.

       They actually posted to T_D, that does seem kind of something that should not be done. I do get the welcome note, as I belive it also had information on rules of the sub, and its not like anyone was going to force  them to leave. Banning people that slightly disagree is their thing not ours.

       Yes it did hit all, funny thing about the guy who posted that, one he also posted it on T_D, and two everything he has posted in the past 8 has gotten thousands of upvotes on every single post. Seems that he spends almost all his time on T_D with a few on other subs like ours.
I should stop wasting time on this, I have stuff to do, and reading that guys history dosnt seem to be usefull at all.

       You could be right. Something often feels "off" here to me. I'd have to look into exactly how reddit tabulates the "currently online" stat. From what I remember, it's anyone who has viewed a page in the sub in the last 15 minutes with some small fuzz factor (0-5 is randomly added), but I don't know if it counts mobile and other API clients.

       The active user number here sits between 900-2,500 normally during week days during day hours. Sometimes 3,000.

       But i've been seeing the normal number of 4,000 every day. And at the "wee hours" (when im surfing here, on patrol for shills) there are usually maybe 1,000 at best (1-5am ET).

       You're right - a never-ending stream of highly-upvoted Seth Rich-related shit with heavy hostility in the comment sections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, why is that? Wouldn't you expect the supposed organic popularity of these posts to be reflected more obviously in the comments?

      <p>
       It's not likely that brigaders and botnets who're controlling the comment sections aren't able to control the topics hitting the front page as well... it is likely that topics being received with hostility by the userbase are being pushed to the fore by botnets and brigading though.

       No, not really. There are thousands of unsolved murders every year in America. Just like this. Someone gets smoked, there are no leads, end of the line.

       <p>
        Police sources close to the investigation also said that there have been seven arrests linked to armed robberies in the Bloomingdale neighborhood that happened just days before Rich was killed.

       This isn't the first time the numbers did something off the wall. A few months back people began to call out the number of users to determine when shills were very active. Like magic that number suddenly began to hover around the "normal" user base (about 1500) on clearly active days and then fall well below it when things were settled down (around 900).  Now 7000 + ? That's outrageous.
      </p>

       Watch that number folks, it's going to tell you a story.

       I'll be the first to say that if it turns out the fluctuation in numbers is the result of a post hitting /all on a holiday, then my original assertion was wrong.

       At the same time though, I maintain that my gut is telling me there's fuckery afoot. There's more users online in the last few weeks than is normal, and the level of discord I'm seeing in conversation is different from what I've normally seen. But that's a different topic for a different thread. Again, thanks for being pro-active on this.

       Yeah, and I'd agree with you that there probably is some fuckery afoot. The problem is that as mods we really don't have the tools or data to combat vote manipulation. Reddit doesn't provide us real, usable numbers, we can't view IPs, or who's upvoting what.

       You can check out flytape's sticky post to see some of the steps we're considering taking, and hopefully we begin rolling some of these out very soon on a trial basis to see how they work. I'm pushing for it.

       Meh, if it happens it happens. It's not like we can't just start another sub or forum somewhere. Efforts to control information usually result in stubborn bastards like us figuring out a way of sharing it more securely. They shut down Napster, and now we have Torrents.

       Yeah.  We had to exit Digg.com after that was taken over.  Ended up here.  It's worked out well so far.  Hopefully these mods keep this place protected, but the patterns don't look good from what I can tell.

       There's enough fire under this smoke to make it worthwhile,  and the alternative is fake news with no company calling BS.    At least here,  the BS gets exposed,  not without noise,  but it gets exposed.   Of course,   good researchers will also dig into credible sources that are also on the trail.
      </p>

       Its pretty chaotic right now,  and the number of consistently credible sources (Stephen Cohen level experts

       Yeah I saw your thread earlier today. Not really sure what to make of it. To me it's pretty obvious that there's vote bots here. I think that's obvious to you as well.

       Regarding the mods, don't trust them. But then again, don't trust me either. Trust yourself, and make up your own mind.

       I'm totally weirded out by it, and not seeing anything either way that would justify the presence. I mean, I'm seeing the voting patterns do what I would expect. But there is no story that seems especially huge to warrant the interest here today.

       Solid points, but at the same time something feels off aside from all that. The numbers here don't feel right lately. Neither do the discussions, or the votes.

       Now you're thinkin'. Watching the flow of information is just as important as the information it's self. That's a whole other layer that we need to understand and pay attention to.

       @CelineHagbard Thanks for being proactive on this. That's really appreciated.

       I'll be the first to say that if it turns out the fluctuation in numbers is the result of a post hitting /all on a holiday, then my original assertion was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time though, I maintain that my gut is telling me there's fuckery afoot. There's more users online in the last few weeks than is normal, and the level of discord I'm seeing in conversation is different from what I've normally seen. But that's a different topic for a different thread. Again, thanks for being pro-active on this.

       because a lot of people shifted from /politics to alternative subs. I now frequent this sub and wayofthebern. Both are brigaded regularly. The shills want only their narrative sung on reddit. And are pouring many resources into it.

        Seems like there is more interest now than there was during the election. It's too weird.

       I think it's because of Seth Rich, all of the recent interest in his unsolved murder, and all of the corroborating claims pointing to him having been a Wikileaks source.
