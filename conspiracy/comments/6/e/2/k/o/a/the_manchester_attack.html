        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why do people buy this bullshit? People are so easily manipulated that it&#39;s honestly pathetic. Maybe it&#39;s just easy for me from watching so many videos of people actually being blown up, shot, stabbed, or in actual life threatening situations that instinctually I can tell if something doesn&#39;t &quot;look right&quot;. Or maybe a majority of people are just stupid? I mean the behavior of many of these crisis actors in the interviews should be a dead giveaway alone. Or the lack of urgency at the site of the &#39;explosion&#39;. Or the fact that there&#39;s never video footage of these &#39;suicide bombers&#39; and they&#39;re always outside the main event. Or the fact that there&#39;s always these high quality, pretty pictures of the &quot;injured&quot;. I saw no gashes, no holes, broken limbs, just fake blood and bandages. The footage of the &#39;explosion&#39; site shows no dead bodies, nothing.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even bother me as much that they orchestrate these false flags as much as the people who believe they&#39;re real without question. If people weren&#39;t so damn gullible, these false flags would mean nothing. But the government uses these false flags to push laws and take away our rights, and people let them because they&#39;re scared and ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not that simple at all for a few reasons </p>

<p>Firstly the flaws in your statistics which include not limiting the data to the UK and this &#39;600  people&#39; thing considering Hett was very well known.</p>

<p>Secondly here we were are talking about friend of a friend. The person you were talking to is the friend of the friend so you need to look at degrees of separation. You also need to take into consideration the user base of this website, and also the fact that the person you&#39;re talking to is more likely to click on this thread because they&#39;re a friend of a friend. </p>

<p>The odds of someone on this thread being a friend of a friend of a victim can&#39;t be limited to the simple math you&#39;ve displayed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say it was that simple. I said it was vague because vague is the best we&#39;re going to get, but the general figures are quite simple to reach. I figured you would pull a straw man, though. And we&#39;re not limiting the data to the UK because the person who claimed it isn&#39;t even from the UK. If it&#39;s a friend of a friend, you could divide that number by however many people the person actually communicates with on a regular basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said these people staging the events are necessarily cold-blooded, but rather that they&#39;re trying to push political agendas which maybe they feel is for the greater good. With Sandy Hook it was gun control, with the Boston Bombing, it was the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. However if they were cold-blooded, I&#39;d assume it would draw too much attention from the families of the deceased.. similar to what happened with 9/11, but I&#39;m not going to comment on that because I don&#39;t know enough about it. I&#39;m not claiming to have all the answers, just a little common sense when it comes to reading people and the events taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s convenient isn&#39;t it, cunt? You didn&#39;t treat anyone that was supposedly injured by a bomb.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already demonstrated how easy it is for crisis actors to stage this kind of event and how emergency services and military services are dismissed for these events. And what the hell are you talking about, &quot;millions of damage&quot;. Lol? Because someone threw a firecracker on the ground and a bunch of trash? The site looks absolutely fine.</p>

<p>But yeah, it&#39;s easy to sit on <em>your</em> ass believing everything you hear on TV, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t demonstrated shit. You&#39;ve made ridiculous claims, that&#39;s it. No evidence to support this crap you&#39;ve concocted. </p>

<p>Emergency services were not dismissed. They were ready and waiting on scene for the injured. </p>

<p>Millions of damage - have you seen the arena it happened in? No of course you haven&#39;t, because you&#39;re thousands of miles away but seem to think you know better than us who live here. Have you also seen the railway that was damaged to? Nope. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe everything I see on TV. I believe my eyes and ears. I believe the people I know personally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, you must not be familiar with the phrase because that&#39;s not something I came up with personally and I&#39;m not the only person who uses it. It&#39;s actually a popular phrase started by Carl Sagan and often used to argue various topics, such as religion.</p>

<p>I am however intrigued that you claim not to have any intention of having a conversation with me, while simultaneously trying to have a conversation with me. You didn&#39;t only stop there, but you actually put in the effort by going through my profile.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually been more than willing to share my thoughts with people however, I show people the same respect they show me. So I also find it interesting that I&#39;m the only person being called out when I&#39;m not the only person who has been throwing insults. Clearly there&#39;s some bias and cognitive dissonance taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was brought up not far from tarleton where two of the dead are from. My step daughter knew one of the dead(An 18 year old) from a young age. Coincidentally, my cousin also knew her. Unless she&#39;s been a planted crisis actor since she was six, you&#39;re wrong. Unless you truly believe that twelve years ago, someone planted a young girl in a village and kept her there living a &quot;normal&quot; life until she was old enough to be blown up. </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s a nearby town where the eight year olds parents own a takeaway, there&#39;s literally thousands of flowers outside it. So many people knew the parents and the child. Were the whole family plants for a decade in your eyes??</p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes bombs blow up and people die. For the sake of the poor families who&#39;ve lost their loved ones, shut up. </p>

<p>I highly doubt all those flowers are from people that knew them. For all they knew, they could have never had a child. You can easily claim you lost a child in an attack, whether it be real or fake, you best believe there&#39;s going to be a bunch of flowers showing up at the doorstep.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes people knew the young girl. She&#39;s not some fictional person. She existed. Her primary school put out a statement as well, or do you believe a school with a couple of hundred kids could make someone up to and no one would notice?? </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, I can&#39;t name the young girl. I was brought up round there but now live 75 miles away. But I can name gina. She was a member of the youth council, so there&#39;s loads of people right there that knew her. She went to the same college two of my cousins are currently at, one of them knew her personally and she&#39;s  been out on nights out with my step daughter. Gina was a real person.

When there&#39;s no actual footage of the bombing, it&#39;s like proving God and unicorns don&#39;t exist. That&#39;s exactly why they don&#39;t provide footage of the &#39;bombing&#39;.</p>

<p>I do however have explicit evidence of crisis actors telling inconsistent stories. So why don&#39;t you go ahead and explain to me why these people would lie.</p>

<p>Show me the birth records of the little girl that supposedly died. I already explained how easy it is for someone to change their name and live elsewhere, and this happens all the time. I suppose in your perfect little world this is impossible, and everyone is perfectly honest.

    <div class="md"><p>You could say the same thing about the supposed victims of Sandy Hook, which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have been staged. You have no explicit evidence to suggest that this girl existed or that a couple hundred kids knew she existed.</p>

<p>As for the 18 year old, that&#39;s the perfect age to change your name, move, and live on a huge chunk of cash. Hell, I would even find that tempting.</p>

<p>You can believe what you want and have your heart strings pulled, but I have no hard evidence to believe anyone actually died, and neither do you.</p>
