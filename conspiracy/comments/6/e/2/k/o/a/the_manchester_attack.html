       Why do people buy this bullshit? People are so easily manipulated that it's honestly pathetic. Maybe it's just easy for me from watching so many videos of people actually being blown up, shot, stabbed, or in actual life threatening situations that instinctually I can tell if something doesn't "look right". Or maybe a majority of people are just stupid? I mean the behavior of many of these crisis actors in the interviews should be a dead giveaway alone. Or the lack of urgency at the site of the 'explosion'. Or the fact that there's never video footage of these 'suicide bombers' and they're always outside the main event. Or the fact that there's always these high quality, pretty pictures of the "injured". I saw no gashes, no holes, broken limbs, just fake blood and bandages. The footage of the 'explosion' site shows no dead bodies, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't even bother me as much that they orchestrate these false flags as much as the people who believe they're real without question. If people weren't so damn gullible, these false flags would mean nothing. But the government uses these false flags to push laws and take away our rights, and people let them because they're scared and ignorant.

       I actually found that pretty interesting, but after watching the interview with his parents (if those are his parents) I'm back to my initial interpretation that it was faked. For one he could easily change his name and live elsewhere. But the reaction of his parents is very unconvincing. They don't even care.

       You think it's odd that in all of the developed world (far less than the 7 billion in the world as a whole), on a site predominantly American and British, someone knows a person connected to a victim of an attack that killed 22?

       It is not that simple at all for a few reasons
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly the flaws in your statistics which include not limiting the data to the UK and this '600  people' thing considering Hett was very well known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly here we were are talking about friend of a friend. The person you were talking to is the friend of the friend so you need to look at degrees of separation. You also need to take into consideration the user base of this website, and also the fact that the person you're talking to is more likely to click on this thread because they're a friend of a friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds of someone on this thread being a friend of a friend of a victim can't be limited to the simple math you've displayed.

       I didn't say it was that simple. I said it was vague because vague is the best we're going to get, but the general figures are quite simple to reach. I figured you would pull a straw man, though. And we're not limiting the data to the UK because the person who claimed it isn't even from the UK. If it's a friend of a friend, you could divide that number by however many people the person actually communicates with on a regular basis.

       I never said these people staging the events are necessarily cold-blooded, but rather that they're trying to push political agendas which maybe they feel is for the greater good. With Sandy Hook it was gun control, with the Boston Bombing, it was the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. However if they were cold-blooded, I'd assume it would draw too much attention from the families of the deceased.. similar to what happened with 9/11, but I'm not going to comment on that because I don't know enough about it. I'm not claiming to have all the answers, just a little common sense when it comes to reading people and the events taking place.

       I've found no damning evidence that anyone died.

       What about the Scottish island where someone died? Unless you're claiming sturgeon was also complicit by sending specialists to help children on the island get through the grief? Surely a smaller event just with mancurians would have been far simpler

       Also they've provided quite a bit of bullshit photos and 'evidence' but not related to actual injuries because that's too hard to fake, so by your own reasoning it is staged.

       They blocked it off because it's bloody procedure to do so. We had PLENTY of walking wounded brought to the hospital with the people stuck inside coming later. We diverted to neighbouring hospitals who got not as emergent walking wounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how would showing actual injuries be too hard to fake yet a huge conspiracy involving destroying a train line, hiring hundreds of actors, destroying a centre piece of Manchester is easy peasy?

       I've already demonstrated how easy it is for crisis actors to stage this kind of event and how emergency services and military services are dismissed for these events. And what the hell are you talking about, "millions of damage". Lol? Because someone threw a firecracker on the ground and a bunch of trash? The site looks absolutely fine.

       I didn't mean seen it post damage, I meant if you knew what it looked like you'd understand that damage to it would be costly and the revenue they've lost from having to cancel acts. The railway will probably be the most expensive and it's taking a while to fix.

       I have fallen into that trap too many times myself from getting so angry I could explode... so I certainly understand. It's particularly aggravating when some asshole with a twisted agenda (and serious need for attention) defames people who lost their lives...but you are right and I would delete the posts...If you respond to this I will also delete this as it is not worth getting into a useless conversation with an unhinged jerk.

       If you look at separate images you'll see that the logo on the cap would have very likely been identifiable in the first image so was edited out - you can see a slight patch where it's supposed to be that doesn't look right. On the second image the logo cannot be seen properly so left.

       That makes more sense than your ridiculous theory.

       An identifiable logo edited out - since the first image  (if you look at the larger ones) has a strange patch where the logo should be. That's one thing that makes more sense than your assertions

       You're not being disrespectful now but the whole assertion is. You've already called me a liar because you seem to think I didn't help take care of those poor people. It's traumatic for all involved and I just won't discuss it anymore.

       I don't believe you helped anyone that was injured by a bomb because I've seen no evidence of an actual explosion. Maybe you assisted someone who was trampled or fell leaving the stadium.

       I've actually provided you solid evidence of a crisis actor with a very inconsistent story and now suddenly you're refusing to acknowledge it.

       All things considered there is no reason to respond. You attack anyone who questions your absurd theories, you have been insulting and highly defensive with anyone who thinks, like most everyone here does, that your accusations are, to be polite, absurd.

       Either you're being dishonest or ignorant, but the only people I have attacked were those who personally attacked me. I'm completely open to people holding opposing beliefs. I think they're silly and baseless, but I'm not going to attack them for just for that. Go ahead, look through all the comments and show me a single person I attacked personally who did not personally attack me first.
      </p>
      <p>
       You simply hold a bias, because anyone who is defensive, disrespectful, or insulting towards me is acceptable, but when I show the very same behavior, I'm a terrible person not worth having a discussion with. You've got to find some reason to dismiss my claims, right?

       Bit of advice, take it or leave it:  If you want people to wake up, you can't be an ass.  Some of us lived many decades with this indoctrination and it's difficult to come out of that slumber. If someone is a total asshat about "the truth," people will just go back into their shells rather than being berated for simply being human.

       Dude, we're ALL douped on something. Just because he's brainwashed on something different than you doesn't give you a license to be an asshole.

       Also, I saw a video of the actual "bomb site" and there was a complete lack of emergency within the site. People casually talking and walking around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there are thousands upon thousands of videos and photos online of actual crime scenes, terrorist events, injured people and dead bodies. Taking these photos is actually required by police. In fact, my neighbor used to do it himself and he'd tell me all kinds of fucked up stories.

       Just because you haven't seen them doesn't mean they don't exist. Who are you to think you'd be automatically privy to all the crime scene photos? The only reason you have seen the ones of inside with the backpack etc is because the US managed to bloody leak them.

       As for photos taken by bystanders, itwas inside a building. People inside weren't in any fit state to be taking photos.

       Apparently they were because someone took a video of it and monetized it when they put it online for money. People were in no state of emergency whatsoever. No actual wounds. Nothing. Absolute joke, and you eat it up. It's idiots like you that are the reason our rights are being taken away one by one.

       In order for it to be an extraordinary claim, it would have to be an extraordinary event. Seeing as how this isn't an extraordinary event, it's up to you to demonstrate that it really took place. You've already demonstrated you're young by way of projection, so who knows, maybe you'll inadvertently figure something out.

       Lol, you must not be familiar with the phrase because that's not something I came up with personally and I'm not the only person who uses it. It's actually a popular phrase started by Carl Sagan and often used to argue various topics, such as religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am however intrigued that you claim not to have any intention of having a conversation with me, while simultaneously trying to have a conversation with me. You didn't only stop there, but you actually put in the effort by going through my profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually been more than willing to share my thoughts with people however, I show people the same respect they show me. So I also find it interesting that I'm the only person being called out when I'm not the only person who has been throwing insults. Clearly there's some bias and cognitive dissonance taking place.

       I was brought up not far from tarleton where two of the dead are from. My step daughter knew one of the dead(An 18 year old) from a young age. Coincidentally, my cousin also knew her. Unless she's been a planted crisis actor since she was six, you're wrong. Unless you truly believe that twelve years ago, someone planted a young girl in a village and kept her there living a "normal" life until she was old enough to be blown up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there's a nearby town where the eight year olds parents own a takeaway, there's literally thousands of flowers outside it. So many people knew the parents and the child. Were the whole family plants for a decade in your eyes??
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everything is a conspiracy. Sometimes bombs blow up and people die. For the sake of the poor families who've lost their loved ones, shut up.

       I'll give you time to look it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly doubt all those flowers are from people that knew them. For all they knew, they could have never had a child. You can easily claim you lost a child in an attack, whether it be real or fake, you best believe there's going to be a bunch of flowers showing up at the doorstep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm well aware not everything is a conspiracy and people are actually blown up and killed. Brilliant straw man, it doesn't support your point in any way.

       Yes people knew the young girl. She's not some fictional person. She existed. Her primary school put out a statement as well, or do you believe a school with a couple of hundred kids could make someone up to and no one would notice??
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're right, I can't name the young girl. I was brought up round there but now live 75 miles away. But I can name gina. She was a member of the youth council, so there's loads of people right there that knew her. She went to the same college two of my cousins are currently at, one of them knew her personally and she's  been out on nights out with my step daughter. Gina was a real person. You can believe this is all made up if you really want but there's real families mourning right now, at least have the decency to put some time between your inane ramblings and their losses.

       You could say the same thing about the supposed victims of Sandy Hook, which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have been staged. You have no explicit evidence to suggest that this girl existed or that a couple hundred kids knew she existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the 18 year old, that's the perfect age to change your name, move, and live on a huge chunk of cash. Hell, I would even find that tempting.

       You can believe what you want and have your heart strings pulled, but I have no hard evidence to believe anyone actually died, and neither do you.

       Yes but interestingly, you have no proof anyone didn't die.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for people not having existed, dude, look up birth records. Although I'm guessing you'll believe that documents from decades ago have been forged or the people died and have no registered death so people could assume their identities... why let cold hard facts get in the way of your need to believe this didn't happen??

       You're the one making the positive claim that they did die, so the burden of proof lies on you. When there's no actual footage of the bombing, it's like proving God and unicorns don't exist. That's exactly why they don't provide footage of the 'bombing'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do however have explicit evidence of crisis actors telling inconsistent stories. So why don't you go ahead and explain to me why these people would lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me the birth records of the little girl that supposedly died. I already explained how easy it is for someone to change their name and live elsewhere, and this happens all the time. I suppose in your perfect little world this is impossible, and everyone is perfectly honest. So go ahead and compare real events with whacky conspiracy theories because it's clear that you have nothing to go by.
