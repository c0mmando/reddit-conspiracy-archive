<p>Republicans can then side with Dems in &quot;protecting America&quot;. Once united, they will seek to impeach Trump and have Pence take the helm.</p>

<p>Dems will not let Reps get off easy. They will suggest that Pence is also accountable and should not be trusted. That will once again put the line on the sand where each party holds their ground. The media will ask the question and pundits will beat it to death. </p>

<p>The divide will be re-established, Pence will take over, and we continue on with the same Red vs Blue dynamic between establishment politicians.</p>

<p>Despite having little power right now, they&#39;ll still be able to attack Republicans through media channels and get their base riled up to make the transition from Trump to Pence difficult. Dems won&#39;t let Pence just step in without battering the GOP for nominating Trump. </p>

<p>Pence has held extreme views on women&#39;s health and uses religion to justify his views on climate change, marriage, and other social issues. Once they&#39;re done dragging the GOP through the mud for Trump, they&#39;ll move on to attack Pence&#39;s prospect of becoming President. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make it sound like he&#39;s a friend to the Republicans.  He&#39;s created enough enemies that most of them are not making it &quot;easy&quot; on him because they like him like they did for Bush (and boy did they pay for it).  To answer your question, it depends on Trump&#39;s approval rating among Republicans and voters overall.  If he starts to falter to around the 40% mark with Republicans, they&#39;ll impeach to save the seats because the loyalty order goes self&gt;party&gt;country.  </p>

I expect that trend will continue.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, yes, it couldn&#39;t <em>possibly</em> be that the Russian collusion story is just a bullshit excuse as to why HRC lost the election, it can <em>only</em> be that the Republicans are after the Democrats.  Even though multiple Democratic congressmen have come to say there is <em>no</em> evidence of collusion, along with DNI clapper and former FBI head Comey.  </p>

<p>If no Republicans are found guilty of Russian collusion it can <em>only</em> mean partisanship.</p>

<p>Forget the UraniumOne deal, forget Podesta&#39;s stock in JuleEnergy before the trade, forget the Podesta Group&#39;s dealings in Russia.  Forget Obama went around UN <em>and</em> US sanctions and gave Iran $1.7 BILLION in cash.  Forget that Obama illegally spied on his political opponents (and thousands of other Americans).  Forget that DWS brought in the Awan brothers who completely FUCKED our Capitol security.  </p>

<p>We can only focus on Trump and Russia, and if we don&#39;t get our desired outcome then it <em>has</em> to be corruption.</p>
