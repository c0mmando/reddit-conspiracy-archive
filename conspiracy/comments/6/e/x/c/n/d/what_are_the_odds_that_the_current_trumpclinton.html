       In all seriousness, nothing happened when photos and evidence of american soldiers torturing prisoners came out.  No one went after the Bush administration for 9/11, even with all of the evidence in the world.  The only way Trump will be impeached is if Netanyahu wants it.

       Yes. He did. Many of Trump's campaign staff were part of the team that got Clinton impeached (Kellyanne Conway).
David Brock is a Republican mole (read his Wikipedia).

       Pence would be the  democrats favorite republican ever for just not being trump. any liberal that wants trump impeached is insane. pence would be a media darling, and while hes a religious nutjob, hes competent. i also dont see how the democrats take charge of either house of congress in 2018. so him as president would be terrible if you calue liberal ideals, because he with full support of congress, would be very effective at getting shit done

       The only way I see it fathomable is if a narrative forms that suggests that Republicans were mislead and lied to by Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans can then side with Dems in "protecting America". Once united, they will seek to impeach Trump and have Pence take the helm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dems will not let Reps get off easy. They will suggest that Pence is also accountable and should not be trusted. That will once again put the line on the sand where each party holds their ground. The media will ask the question and pundits will beat it to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The divide will be re-established, Pence will take over, and we continue on with the same Red vs Blue dynamic between establishment politicians.

       Hypothetically speaking, if impeachment is on the table it will likely take some time to manifest. 2018 is just around the corner. Who knows how many seats will flip blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite having little power right now, they'll still be able to attack Republicans through media channels and get their base riled up to make the transition from Trump to Pence difficult. Dems won't let Pence just step in without battering the GOP for nominating Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pence has held extreme views on women's health and uses religion to justify his views on climate change, marriage, and other social issues. Once they're done dragging the GOP through the mud for Trump, they'll move on to attack Pence's prospect of becoming President.

       You make it sound like he's a friend to the Republicans.  He's created enough enemies that most of them are not making it "easy" on him because they like him like they did for Bush (and boy did they pay for it).  To answer your question, it depends on Trump's approval rating among Republicans and voters overall.  If he starts to falter to around the 40% mark with Republicans, they'll impeach to save the seats because the loyalty order goes self&gt;party&gt;country.

       Obama won 2 terms and when they were slaughtered in 2006, it took years to recover.  I'm not sure how old you are but this is pretty much par for the course.  Every 8 years the pendulum swings left, right, left right unless POTUS really fucks up and then it's 4 years.  The voting public is fickle and has a short memory.

       Obama was less popular than Nixon. do you think the pendulum has stopped swinging right?

       I predict they likely will win back more seats than they'll lose but not enough to take back control.  Keep in mind in 2016 the Republicans started losing power, not gaining it.  They lost 2 senate seats and 6 house seats (though they did make progress with +3 governors).  I expect that trend will continue.

       Actually it's more popular than it has ever been and my guess is it's because people see what is going to be offered in its place (assuming the Senate will fix it before it passes).

       I get your point there, but it was down to 70% by the time it came to election day.
       <br/>
       Also, other factors contributed to the false numbers like people being embarrassed to admit they were voting for Trump.

       Ah, yes, it couldn't
       <em>
        possibly
       </em>
       be that the Russian collusion story is just a bullshit excuse as to why HRC lost the election, it can
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       be that the Republicans are after the Democrats.  Even though multiple Democratic congressmen have come to say there is
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence of collusion, along with DNI clapper and former FBI head Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       If no Republicans are found guilty of Russian collusion it can
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       mean partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget the UraniumOne deal, forget Podesta's stock in JuleEnergy before the trade, forget the Podesta Group's dealings in Russia.  Forget Obama went around UN
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       US sanctions and gave Iran $1.7 BILLION in cash.  Forget that Obama illegally spied on his political opponents (and thousands of other Americans).  Forget that DWS brought in the Awan brothers who completely FUCKED our Capitol security.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can only focus on Trump and Russia, and if we don't get our desired outcome then it
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       to be corruption.
