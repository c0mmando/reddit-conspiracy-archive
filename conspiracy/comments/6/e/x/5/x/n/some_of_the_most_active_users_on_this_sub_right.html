<p>I mean, when we have people parroting and pushing the narratives that you see on the nightly news, you know that this place is being gamed like never before. I mean christ, a conspiracy sub where users agree with mainstream television. That&#39;s actually hilarious when you think about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, for me personally, a browse through my comments and posts will reveal that I have never posted anything directly supporting the Trump admin. Because fuck the US government and it&#39;s system. However, I do call bullshit when I see it, and I&#39;m seeing a toooooon of MSM parroting. And that&#39;s all bullshit. The MSM is 100% against the Trump admin.</p>

<p>Anything TV wants us to believe is bullshit. That&#39;s not defending the current admin, that&#39;s just calling a spade a spade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, there&#39;s definitely some of those folks here from both camps. Which is why I like to ask people who they voted for. Any answer other than &quot;No one&quot; means they&#39;re prone to having a political bias. </p>

<p>But most of us are. Can&#39;t fault people for that. I&#39;d really like to see a movement of us rejecting the current system though. Stop voting. Stop enlisting. Let this shitfest burn it&#39;s self out. After a decade of violent anarchy and suffering we can reorganize ourselves into something far better. It&#39;s not like humanity hasn&#39;t done it before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing wrong with having political bias it is normal. It is wrong to support trump unless one  believes in elite global control and Russian imperialism.
 However I see trump as a positive as his failures and incompetence will bring down his party and expose them and the people who control them with their money. It isn&#39;t what trump intends to do but his failure is red piling the country on how much big money can buy politics and fuck over normal people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gotta disagree with you there. I do think that there&#39;s something wrong with political bias.</p>

<p>See, our current system has gotten us here. It&#39;s gonna keep us here unless we start thinking of new ways to do things. I for one want to start developing systems of organization that aren&#39;t so prone to corruption and deceit. We gotta start pulling away from the whole divide and rule thing. You and I are both on this planet together, and for some reason, there&#39;s a huge effort being made to make you and I hate each other if we disagree on certain things.</p>

<p>And where does that get us? Nowhere productive, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah I can&#39;t jump on board with that Russia narrative. Completely aside from that though, human nature is what we make it to be. We&#39;re creative beings. Some might say that it&#39;s human nature to be chaotic and violent. Others might say that it&#39;s human nature to be organized and kind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and you have bias which is why you deny the overwhelming evidence that trump committed treason. Not due to logic but bias. And I&#39;m not criticizing you for that. </p>

<p>The real problem with your argument is it is mostly always <em>we should all agree on everything and everyone should agree with me</em>. But maybe I&#39;m wrong let&#39;s say you have a disagreement with someone. Are you willing to drop your biases and agree with them for purposes of unity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on though, if you say I have a bias, and said bias leads me to a specific conclusion, you need to define what that bias is. Saying &quot;you have a bias that does X&quot; doesn&#39;t actually mean anything.

<p>you can keep going NA NA NA NA CANT HEAR YOU NO RUSSIA PUPPET with your hands in your ears all you want but it doesnt change the fact that there is an ONGOING investigation into POTUS and his staff. that is a fact that you cannot obfuscate and deny offhand. </p>

<p>but since you want evidence... (of a classified investigation) here is some public info copy n pasted: </p>

<p>Trump, during his campaign, publicly encourages Russian hackers to find Hillary&#39;s missing emails.</p>

<p>Trump has refused to fully divest from investments, both foreign and domestic, some of which have ties to Russian oligarchs.</p>

<p>A tape of the Speaker of the House demanding his colleagues keep secret a conversation that happened in which Republicans implicate Trump as being on the payroll of Russia.</p>

<p>18 undisclosed meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials</p>

<p>Flynn, being paid by foreign countries including Russia, is hired by Trump even though Trump was warned by several people not to hire Flynn because of his Russia connections.</p>

<p>Trump refusing to fire Flynn even after he lied about meeting with Russian officials.</p>

<p>A computer being used by the Trump campaign has been found to have &quot;odd&quot; ties to a Russian bank.</p>

<p>Trump met in the oval office with Russian officials while banning American press from the meeting.</p>

<p>The Trump team, before Trump became president, had a secret meeting with Russian officials in the Seychelles.</p>

<p>Trump gave classified information to the Russians.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s AG met with Russians officials during the campaign and lied about it.</p>

<p>Trump fired the director of the FBI because, in the words of the President, he wanted to ease the pressure that was on him because of the Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Trump pressured the head of the CIA to publicly state that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s son-in-law and top advisors Jared Kushner had undisclosed meetings with Russian bankers.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s son-in-law and top advisor, Jared Kushner, set up a secret back channel communication with the Kremlin before Trump was president.</p>

<p>Trump could clear up any financial ties to Russia if he would just release his tax returns (which he promised to do), yet he now refuses to do so.</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions did not disclose meetings to the Senate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmfao, that&#39;s a whooole lotta propaganda you got there.</p>

<p>Mueller was brought in because McCabe is a Clintonista.  And oh, whadya know, in the process of his investigation there is evidence that some in the Obama admin were illegally spying on US citizens.</p>

<p>ONGOING investigation doesn&#39;t mean shit, just ask Hillary Clinton, James Comey, and Loretta Lynch.</p>

<p>You use a lot of speculation as <em>fact</em>.  He joked about asking the Russians to provide more emails!!!  He must be Russian!!!  He wont show us his taxes!!!  He must be Russian!!!  I heard an unnamed source on TV say that Trump said something, it <em>must</em> be true!!!  He must be Russian!!!  He only allowed one American and one Russian photog in one meating!!!  He must be Russian!!!  Members of a presidential team were meating with foreign diplomats!!!  He must be Russian!!!  I&#39;m going to regurgitate everything I hear from CNN and read from WaPo and Salon!!!  He must be Russian!!!  The media discredited and active investigation into high level paedophilia but claiming it all had to do with a single man and single establishment!!!  It&#39;s all bullshit!!!</p>

<p>You people are funny.  Seriously delusional and brainwashed, possibly dangerous, but funny.</p>

<p>Would you like to talk about his strikes on Syria, his trip to SA, Sessions&#39; war on drugs?  You know like, actual facts?  Or do you just want to keep pushing your singular narrative that he&#39;s a Russian agent?</p>

<p>I know, you only want to convince people Trump is a Russian agent so please, show me all of this new evidence that is coming out daily to support your claims.  Oh, you don&#39;t have any actual evidence to back up your claims?  What&#39;s that?  The only real evidence you have of anything is just how politics works and you&#39;re unaware of that?  </p>

<p>Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia...  See, no matter how many times someone says it, it doesn&#39;t change bullshit to fact.  Why did Diane Feinstein, Adam Schiff, James Clapper, Jim Comey, and more, all say there was <em>zero</em> ecidence of collusion?  Oh that&#39;s right, because there is no collusion.  It&#39;s a bullshit story being pushed by people who are butthurt the most corrupt politician in history lost to a brash billionaire reality TV star.  </p>

<p>Hahahahahahaha Donald John Trump is duely elected president of the United States and leftists can&#39;t handle it!  </p>

<p>Oh no!  How many scoops of ice cream did he get?  He misspelled a word in a tweet!  His skin color and hair are funny looking!  Impeach, impeach, impeach!!!   LMFAO!!!</p>

<p>Seriously though, no one&#39;s buying that utter horseshit.  Even MSM talking heads are starting to concede Russia is a made up story to cover HRC&#39;s terrible loss and corruption.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, are they not discussing any of that on /Politics, /esist, /enoughtrumpspam?  You poor poor thing.  Where will you <em>ever</em> get the chance to shit on Trump?  Oh no, is no one replying to your hourly spam posts about the same bullshit over and over?  I&#39;m so sorry for you.

<p>How exactly have I mischaracterized your post history? At the time of my original comment your recent history was full,still is,of rants against shills and other low effort arguments.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Why bother? Regardless. Antagonize may not be the right word. Several comments I&#39;ve seem are blatantly attacking. It&#39;s fine if that&#39;s how you know to argue. I&#39;m here saying there are better ways. Imo your tactics against the red scare folk do more harm than good. And flat earthers? I can&#39;t see why you&#39;d waste a second of your time on them. </p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to try, but you&#39;d fail. I rarely call people out as I am to you, ironically you&#39;re not willing to try against me despite how often you do just this. Funny. Generally speaking my comments are on topic, pointed, and sourced. I generally refrain from attacking users in favor of attacking their arguments, and in this case rationalizations. I haven&#39;t always done this,but my comment history dies show improvement over time,which I tried to afford to you as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>respect is not love, but there is a contradiction there. I can understand enjoying a character more than seeing the finished result in real terms... I think what he&#39;s saying is he appreciates the theatre and psychology of it all, despite abhorring the message he delivers.</p>

<p>At some point, you gotta accept some things while you are still hopping mad. I don&#39;t think the two things you bring up are mutually exclusive. All you are working off to make your accusation is his post title - how is that fair? According to you, he &#39;hates people who parrot mainstream media&#39;... really? Hate? That&#39;s some strong emotion you are applying to him without much cause for it - I don&#39;t see any hateful speech here. What are you projecting onto this? Why so defensive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you love the guy who was the highest-rated bullshit spewer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you think he was the highest rated? He clearly is appreciating Bill O&#39;Reilly for the entertainment factor he brings - he&#39;s not affirming Bill&#39;s incendiary hot takes, especially when he&#39;s openly calling him a &#39;professional troll&#39;.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s your issue again? He&#39;s clearly talking about this as if he understands that &#39;news&#39; is entertainment first, so why are you conflating that with people&#39;s actual political opinions? It&#39;s two completely different contexts.</p>
