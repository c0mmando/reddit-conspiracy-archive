The first two episodes detail how DNC party bosses and oligarchs conspired, successfully, to give him the 1944 Vice Presidency. They tried to do the same in 1940 until FDR put his dick down and refused to go along with it, threatening to resign the presidency over it. </p>

<p>The man who should have been president was Henry Wallace, an incredibly popular progressive and labor advocate. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll suggest this to you since I know you can handle it, the fact that &#39;snopes is good&#39; on some things is what makes them as dangerous as the MSM. If you can build up credibility with a bunch of lay-ups then it will be easier to obscure and misrepresent when it&#39;s time to push the propaganda. </p>

<p>Do I have sympathy for the people involved?   Nobody was involved, really.  The only people affected were conspiracy theorists.  And I am naturally sympathetic to them.</p>

<p>Do I feel responsible for mob aggression to victims of the Nibiru/Elenin false alarm?  I&#39;m not sure there were instances of mob aggression in this case.  Perhaps Leonid Elenin got more FB friend requests than usual.  Do I feel responsible for his FB friend requests?  Only very slightly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The duality conspiracy. Bought into it most of my life. Only in these past couple dozen months have I come out of the fog. It&#39;s all one giant construct. God and satan are one in the same. It&#39;s so difficult to wrap your brain around the fact it&#39;s all a construct, a master plan to remove divinity from humanity, no savior required. Keep us fighting eachother for our &quot;one true god&quot; when in reality it&#39;s all just hogwash. </p>

<p>All you need is a belief in <em>yourself</em> as a divine creator. We are masters of reality who have given up the power of creation in exchange for a fear based duality system that keeps us fearful and fighting. </p>

<p>I am feeling less and less sympathy as the truth becomes clearer to me. If folks want to live in duality, that&#39;s on them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the other option is to stay quiet and accept everything one is told. Even if you just have the niggling feeling that something is wrong.
It was easy in the old days to manage the populace with Newspapers and TV news. Now, when something doesn&#39;t feel right, you know you are not mad when there are others thinking the same.</p>

<p>If no wrong was ever done, if everyone ever suspected were always innocent, I can understand what you are trying to say; but humans are humans and incredible shit has happened before and will happen again.
Please also keep in mind that we don&#39;t always get suspicious, only when things don&#39;t add up. when stories make no sense.</p>

<p>Jeez, look what happens when officials [police] ignore gut feelings, circumstantial evidence and dodgy stories. You&#39;ll get suicide bombers they suspected killing innocent people.</p>

<p>I once left a child in the hands of a molester after hearing them scream &#39;no stop it&#39;, in pain. Knocking on their door revealed the child telling me that all was fine [which is typical]. 
I had no evidence nut everything was wrong about the situation.</p>

<p>It haunts me to this day that I didn&#39;t do more. And so does the child probably. </p>

<p>You or the families don&#39;t have to read what we write. But on the offchance that something is really sinister and being covered up, I comment the &#39;internet people&#39; for their persistance. In this case and in PG. 
I am rather wrong and have tried than a mug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. Okay, it sounds like you are asking if people feel bad for wrongly accusing people of being involved in nefarious conspiracies.</p>

<p>Have you ever played the game Clue? Someone murdered the host of the party and you&#39;re wandering around the mansion, trying to figure out who/what/where. When looking for clues you announce &quot;I suspect so-and-so...&quot; Everyone is a suspect. Everyone is scrutinized. Now, when you think you&#39;ve figured it out then you ACCUSE someone.</p>

<p>If your accusation is correct, you win. If it&#39;s incorrect, you&#39;re out and you lose.</p>

<p>When digging through the web of conspiracies that create our modern reality everyone is a suspect. We&#39;re all here, we are all connected and none of us is likely to survive unless we work together to figure out who among us is the predator.</p>

<p>As far as accusations - none of the conspirators have been accused in a court of law. No honest investigations of any crimes has been allowed to happen. No one can open the evidence envelope and even find out if we are right or wrong.</p>

<p>The truth will out and you are being disingenuous by asking us to NOT suspect everyone and NOT be vigilant. I hope you find peace in this life and enjoy your own company.</p>

<p>Not so much accusing people, nothing wrong there if it&#39;s based on real grounds but more the aggressive behaviour that comes along with the accusations before they are in anyway investigated. </p>

<p>Much as I think it&#39;s silly to tell people to Google something to prove my point, I&#39;ll do it here haha.   Choose an accused conspirator whether you believe the conspiracy or not.<br/>
Google: &quot;[Accused] recieves death threats&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s unlikely to come up empty.</p>

<p>Really though I&#39;m not judging. We&#39;re all human. I&#39;m just interested to see what people have to say on the subject.</p>
