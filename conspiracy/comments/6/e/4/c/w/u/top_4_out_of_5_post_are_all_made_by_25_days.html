       A lot of the threads are just stupid and the top comments prove them wrong. I don't see the point if everyone is going to hate "Trump supporters" for spamming obviously wrong posts. Could be black propaganda I guess. That's what's I would do if I ran the organization.

       Why actual Trump supporters would post tone-deaf transparently pro-Trump propaganda on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is beyond me. Seems like a very convenient narrative tool for shills to use to condemn those evil
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       hooligans and excuse for they themselves to be increasingly partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal of any shill is to divide and conquer - first one must divide. The way they are going about it in this sub is to manufacture a political fight - pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump - that consumes every single thread and stifles productive discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aim is to give the mods the excuse they need to crack down on the userbase of the sub (such as Rule 10.) Ultimately, mods will be "forced" to "respond" to the shill problem by shutting down everyone who tries to bring attention to it in the first place. When that happens, you'll have another dead subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem from a shill's perspective with
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is that the userbase is politically independent and largely doesn't actually care very much if a story hurts Trump/helps Trump or hurts the DNC/helps the DNC. That cannot happen on reddit anymore, or at least, isn't supposed to. This website is supposed to be about propaganda now, God knows they paid to have it that way and God knows they'll make sure it turns out that way.

       That's a fair assessment. Sometimes I just wonder if what I'm thinking is by my own logical design, or something convoluted among well-orchestrated  info and disinfo. I think its important that I keep reminding myself of this possibility.

       Cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         story is organic, response is organic: no foul.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         story is organic, response is astroturf: they piss off more people than they deceive by at least an order of magnitude.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         story is astroturf, response is organic: they unite the sub against them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         story is astroturf, response is astroturf: they piss off more people than they deceive by at least an order of magnitude AND unite the sub against them.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In the case of the one story I looked into (r/conspiracy/comments/6e1c5e/all_3_investigating_or_exposing_dnc_voter_fraud/), it would be astroturf/astroturf if it were anything. I'm not reading that from the thread, I'm reading it from our reaction to the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happens to be a particularly dumb play even for astroturfers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The claim is immaterial. Confirming that Seth Rich leaked the DNC e-mails is beyond sufficient to flip the table. Complicating the story with weak claims is no worse than a distraction that we will grind through because it's fun. (Look, I'm doing it now!)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Setting up strawmen then instantly knocking them down burns both the source and the posters.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It doesn't really matter who's fucking up or why they're fucking up. What matters is the identity of Seth Rich's murderer. Eyes on the prize.

       Shit I misread, apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I am coming from is a non-American, with a strong distain for my own two major parties (that are almost identical in ideologies and action), seeing this board filled with US politics either skewed in favor of Dems or Republicans. I feel it is equal, could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that left v right is pointless. Ultimately this is exactly why parties were put there in the first place. An illusion of choice while the elite broaden the gap between us and them further. I think we all recognise the deep state and the concerted efforts to disrupt demorcracy, dominate wealth, control resources and essentially own the world. When it comes to that, left and right major parties don't mean shit. Both sides bow down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So back to bias, I think it is silly, left v right is and old ideology that should have died long ago, but is a useful tool that separates people. I wish this sub would move on, or at least had dedicated discussions per talking point. But whenever anything happens from both sides we get 50 threads about it clogging up the sub. And it is either shills, or people with their own bias thoughts to push.

       Idk. Wish we could all get along and fight TPTB.

       It certainly is a useful tool when it's abused and when reactionaries take control of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the "left vs right" divide is really about a disagreement on the fundamental social contract of society and how to advance forward. It doesn't need to be a dangerous division as long as we don't let it become one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy for Republicans and Democrats to get along. Hell, MSNBC's Morning Joe has their two anchors, a Democrat and an actual Republican politician, are getting married. Never mind that they've been working together for years.

       In the days when the US government was functional, making compromise and deals was fundamental to governing. Not like today where you have people pushing "party loyalty" over country.

       I don't think you understand what I mean when I say meaningless. The two party system itself should be obsolete. These two parties have always been corrupt, always propagated war and always sided with the rich against the poor. Any compromise or deal has been on their terms and knowingly broadened the inequality gap.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to left v right the social idea, it is obsolete and a trap. Life is more complex than that. It is a trap because right wing people get stuck on their way of thinking when it comes to every issue and left wing people do the same. Team picking.

       That's because you posted in like 9 different Syria gas story topics like it was your day job. Shills can call shills shills to make themselves seem legit. Shills don't all work together, some work for say Israel and oppose LePen because she is an "antisemite".

       This post has ~3000 upvotes, zero evidence.  It's just a picture of 3 people.  The top discussion on it is pointing this out, yet it's the 6th top post for the past week (4th is the same story, same top comments pointing out how it's unrelated to voter fraud).

       r/conspiracy mods need to decide if they're happy with propaganda being manipulated to the top on this sub.  So far it seems like they're fine with it.

       Don't feel so bad. I have just recently been openly called a shill and the mods actually reinstated the post after originally deleting it. My post arguing that it was a blatant rule 10 violation was obviously ignored.

       Have you considered the possibility that shit posts like this one are artificially elevated to the FP here, in order to discredit the quality of the content provided here, and to have all the top comments easily debunk it or call it out as being partisan?
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who doesn't subscribe to a left or right ideology, it seems to me like this kind of thing has been going on a lot more recently. Blatantly shit posts, that typically wouldn't make it out of /New, are sitting atop the FP for way longer than they should, with all the top comments calling bullshit, and blaming T_D trolls for vote manipulation.

       I disagree. It really lowers the level of discourse because people inevitable overuse accusations of shilling. During the 2016 primaries, anything pro-Hillary that I wrote in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was immediately hit with shill accusations. No attempt at discussion. The same happened when I politely called out a few WikiLeaks excerpts that were clearly being taken out of context in
       <a href="/r/WikiLeaks">
        /r/WikiLeaks
       </a>
       . It just lets accusers derail and stifle meaningful debate.

       That's what I mean to some degree. I think calling people out as shills is a tactic most effectively used by the shills themselves rather than the people trying to call them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think ironically that banning shill accusations is probably the best way to take some of the advantage away from shills.

       nearly every comment says the posts is fake / garbage. Seems like bots upvote and real people are commenting.

       Also, since when are hardcore neoliberals/neocons/party defenders/bootlickers/partisans suddenly so seemingly interested in conspiracy and non-mainstream media?

       Except for the fact that these posts you guys are talking about are all pro-Seth rich conspiracy. So it's not like these fresh accounts are trying to do anything but push the narrative that the DNC killed him.

       They're all shitty posts without sources and questionable material. Any posts directly discrediting the conspiracy are too out of place at this point, they'd stick out like a sore thumb and theres far too many coincidences. SO now they're posting badly sourced stuff that can be easily debunked so everyone can say "see this is shit, nothing to see here". All the while the other half are in the comments saying "OH SURE LETS DISRESPECT HIS PARENTS STOP LOOKING INTO THIS.

       So this hilarious theory of yours is pretty dumb. Makes 10000x more sense that the shill accounts pushing a narrative are the ones you agree with. Maybe you should open your mind a little too.

       Most people only read the headline, fewer people read the comments, and few even click on the link.  The first argument people see is the most effective one, fewer will see that the first argument is a lie, and even others will refuse to believe that first argument is a lie after being presented proof.

       I had this thought too. I wouldn't rule it out as a tactic. The counter argument makes sense. I doubt that many people read much past the headline, but the more bullshit headlines, the more people turn it off. Anyway, thanks for taking the bullets on this.

       Why not just use these shill accounts to push the opposite narrative instead? That's seems to me like that would be 100× more effective then pushing a muddy narrative from the other side.

       Except they aren't using every trick because absolutely none of the posts on the front page are ever about how the Seth Rich conspiracy is bullshit. So you're really reaching here.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it is with you guys. When ever the conspiracy doesn't work out for you guys, you just take the conspiracy one step deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever something you believe is debunked, your new conspiracy is that this was the plan all along. To make you guys look bad by believing in bullshit. It's fuckin hilarious man.

       The reason they're so quick to call "shill" is because they're not used to opposing views. In their safe space, dissent is deleted and banned. When this many people disagree with them, then there
       <em>
        must

       This was a bit harsh. I don't know that these people are shills. Most of them are probably just ideologues.

       .  I counted a total of 18 accounts, that had the same pattern.  A Pro-Russian, Pro-Trump, fuck everybody else narrative, doesn't appeared to be linked directly to the alt-right.  Creation around the May 5, when Macron's emails were leaked.

       On April 24 Macron was hacked, evidence suggests it was APT 28/Fancy Bear/Pawn Storm.

       Oh, I get it. I've been trying to explain this for weeks (months probably, honestly), but it's either ignored or downvoted when I say this sub is being manipulated. Seems that only one side's conspiracies are worth paying attention to for a lot of this sub.

       There's nothing that's stopping progressives from being interested (though I don't know if that's the word I'd use, just seems morbid) in Seth Rich, but generally it's a story pushed almost exclusively in alt-right circles.

       It was in progressive (fringe) outlets when animosity was still high. The far left was still on the kick of vilifying Clinton before settling down. And it's not like we don't know that the right was trying to sneak in and keep that pot boiling so people wouldn't vote.

       You're right.
Right wing NEOliberals and NEOconservatives are basically on the same team.
Neither are left wing or even close to centrist. (Bernie was a little left of center but he's a rare politician. FDR was somewhat centrist.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton/CNN are very right wing and ALWAYS have been.
What the corporate right wing media calls "liberal" is NEOliberal
which is literally just very right wing sprinkled with "LGBT rights" and all that easy stuff.
But workers' rights? Hahahaha, the establishment don't give a damn about us.
Two party system = (NEO)conservative (which is even worse than normal conservativism) VS NEOliberalism which is nowhere near left wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO has never been a left wing (or even "communist") conspiracy.
It's always been a fascist conspiracy.
Hence this place has the Roman fasces symbol
(fascism)

It makes me believe the Vatican really does own the world
along with elite bankers and maybe royalty.

       I posted this comment to you in the thread u/DavidBernheart posted a few days ago regarding evidence of the polling station issue and it got deleted but here it is again in case you missed it. With the part where i violated rule 10 removed ....
      </p>
      <p>
       And shadowmind, most people who can think for themselves can see through all this bullshit and can see the blatant news narrative manipulation thats currently going on. I don't have any more evidence of my claim than you or anyone else has of Trump colluding with Russia, but that hasn't stopped every media outlet from peddling that narrative.
       <strong>
        I encourage everyone reading this to look at both sides of every political argument, do their own research and form their own opinions.

       Here are some sources which led me to my claim about Sanders voters being sent to fake or faulty polling stations:

       Or just google search in r/SandersForPresident with the date range set from like 4/1/16 to 7/1/16 and you can find plenty more sources to support my claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I have no concrete proof. But i have a brain and can read between the lines and draw my own conclusion without needing an 'authority' figure, be it a politician, tv news analyst, or heavily upvoted reddit comment or post telling me what happened and what I should think happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I can't verify Seth Rich's entire timeline and all of the other details and connections posted on reddit/4chan. But I can see the absurd response to people trying to investigate an unsolved murder, and the suppression of any information related to his case or the DNC lawsuit (one in the same if you ask me).

       I find it interesting that the Russian strategy to get the USA to destroy itself, is to get a Republican elected. That's hilarious in itself, and an incitement on that whole NWO/OWO party called The Republicans.

       On the top page alone, the mode of users with the most posts are 25-27 day accounts, with lots of variation that is much beyond that fixed date range. You're onto something here! It looks like they post the more innocuous 'obvious' stuff, so that less material will hit the front page.

       man.. my two favorite subs are being flooded with fucking shills atm..
      </p>
      <p>
       we need to do something about this guys.. we need to get a movement going to get laws passed to make this type of stuff illegal. where people need to identify themselves as paid promoters and if they don't the companies they work for and the shill will face fines.
      </p>
      <p>
       you know what would be beautiful? if we crowd sourced money and then paid shills to astroturf this campaign.. ahaha a man can dream

       Now I know that I'm probably going to get downvoted or that people aren't going to believe me but that's okay because this is the truth. I fully believe that some of these 25-day old accounts are shill accounts but some of us have been working on this sub for over a year or more and have felt very uncomfortable with posting anything. I think with the rising tensions and the closer that people are getting to what they perceive to be the truth, the more likely they are to want to interact. That's what I did. I created this account solely to be on the conspiracy sub so I could for once voice my opinion. I was scared that people who would figure out who I really am from my other account and due to the nature of this sub, I just don't want to be put on any more lists than I have to be. I hope that makes sense. We aren't all bought accounts.

       Shit I misread, apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I am coming from is a non-American, with a strong distain for my own two major parties (that are almost identical in ideologies and action), seeing this board filled with US politics either skewed in favor of Dems or Republicans. I feel it is equal, could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that left v right is pointless. Ultimately this is exactly why parties were put there in the first place. An illusion of choice while the elite broaden the gap between us and them further. I think we all recognise the deep state and the concerted efforts to disrupt demorcracy, dominate wealth, control resources and essentially own the world. When it comes to that, left and right major parties don't mean shit. Both sides bow down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So back to bias, I think it is silly, left v right is and old ideology that should have died long ago, but is a useful tool that separates people. I wish this sub would move on, or at least had dedicated discussions per talking point. But whenever anything happens from both sides we get 50 threads about it clogging up the sub. And it is either shills, or people with their own bias thoughts to push.

       Idk. Wish we could all get along and fight TPTB.
