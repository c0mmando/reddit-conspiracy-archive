<li>This invention <em>has been peer reviewed</em> and <strong>proven to work</strong>! </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://rexresearch.com/tewari/tewari.htm">full plans, diagrams, explanations etc Can be found HERE</a></p>

<p>Last week I posted some info on the &quot;Joe Cell&quot; which is a unique method of &#39;obtaining energy&#39; from the &#39;universal source&#39; of energy that Nikola Tesla <em>had found</em> and wanted to &#39;share with the people&#39;  BUT people (and their companies) like Westinghouse refused to support such ideas becoz, to paraphrase George Westinghouse, one of Tesla&#39;s main and longterm financiers said; &quot;How can I sell such a product when <em>I can&#39;t put a meter on it</em>?!&quot;</p>

<p>Many people argue that such &#39;overunity&#39; devices break the second law of thermodynamics, BUT the &#39;second law of thermodynamics&#39; is <em>wrong</em>! </p>

<p>It <em>always has been</em> BUT the majority of people <em><del>taught</del>told to believe such things</em>  at school rarely &#39;think outside the box&#39; and realize that; this is explained <a href="http://rexresearch.com/tewari/tewari.htm">in great detail this link here</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not just that &quot;The Universe <em>is not</em> a <em>closed</em> system&quot; ,, it goes all the way doen to the <em>basic structures</em> of the essence of nature, or as Tesla put it;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>“All perceptible matter comes from a primary substance, or tenuity beyond conception, filling all space, the akasha or luminiferous ether, which is acted upon by the life giving Prana or creative force, calling into existence, in never ending cycles all things and phenomena.”</strong><br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Nikola Tesla,“Man’s Greatest Achievement,” 1907</p>

<p>Or, in Tewari’s words:</p>

<p><strong>“The universal matter is created out of prana since prana is aakaash in motion, and aakaash is the primordial superfluid substratum of the universe.”</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The concept that efficiency cannot be greater than 100% is due to an incomplete understanding of the properties of space. <strong>The second law of thermodynamics must be modified to account for the fact that space is not empty, as has been taught for the last 150 years</strong>. </p>

<p>The RLG operates at what has been called “over unity.” </p>

<p><strong>Many experienced electrical engineers engaged in the manufacture of AC generators have independently tested the RLG and confirmed the efficiency ratings</strong> that I have observed. It’s time for the physicists to get out of the way and modify their theories while the engineers go about the business of design and production.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many may laugh at these terms <em>they&#39;ve never heard of</em> and say things like &quot;what a load of BS&quot; </p>

<p>But wise men already <em>know</em> that &quot;empty vessels make the most noise&quot; ...</p>

<p>These guys <em>have made and PROVEN</em> their; Reactionless AC Synchronous Generator (RLG) </p>

<p>A generator which was invented by Paramahamsa Tewari, electrical engineer and former Executive Director of Nuclear Power Corporation of India. His background includes engineering project management for construction of nuclear  power stations. </p>

<p><strong>The efficiency of models he has built, which have also been independently built and tested, is as high as 250%</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In November 2014, I made one of many visits to the laboratory of Paramahamsa Tewari. I had seen the basis for the RLG design in September of 2010. Mr. Tewari showed me a stiff conductor about a foot long which was allowed to rotate at the center and connected at each end with small gauge wire. A magnetic circuit was placed under the conductor. </p>

<p>When a current was allowed to flow through the conductor it rotated, due to a torque induced on the conductor according to Flemings Left Hand Rule and standard theory, verified by experiments at the dawn of the electrical age. With a simple rearrangement of the magnetic circuit, the same current produced no rotation – the torque was cancelled. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I later duplicated the setup and experiment on my workbench. It is ingenious and lead to his breakthrough, the invention of a reaction less generator with greatly improved efficiency</strong>.</p>

<p>These devices once started <em>can run continuously</em> and <strong>power themselves</strong> ... <em>indefinitely</em>!</p>

<p>I believe, as do the engineers in India, that this is the biggest breakthrough in rotating electrical machine design since Faraday’s invention of the electrical motor in 1832. </p>

<ul>
<li>The elimination of back torque allows all the energy generated to pass through the machine. Power output is determined by the strength of the excitation magnets and the synchronous reactance (resistance at 50/60 Hz) of the stator windings. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Current models can be cascaded for higher output. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Each machine can produce at least 2.38 times the input and can be configured in a self-running mode</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to concentration on efficiency and design improvements the machine has not yet been configured in this manner.</p>

<p>During a visit to witness tests in December of 2012, we were guests of the engineering director of a large utility company, and we toured a generation facility which the director pointed out was ready for RLG systems as soon as they are scaled to the required size. </p>

<p><strong>In March 2015 we returned to India for licensing discussions. Current plans call for introductory models to be marketed at 10 KVA and 25 KVA.</strong></p>

<p>A second company is involved in manufacturing discussions and the Karnataka Power Corporation, which supplies Bangalore, is investigating the use of 200 KVA units in a wind farm application as described in the April 7th edition of Asia Times.</p>

<p>TPTB have <em>tried their hardest to supress</em> such inventions BUT it being India, as they say;</p>

<p>INDIA WON’T SUPPRESS TEWARI’S FREE ENERGY GENERATOR</p>

<p><strong>India considers its own free energy program a matter of national pride, and is very much willing to risk antagonizing Petrodollar countries with its support on Reactionless AC Synchronous Generator (RLG) invented by its own Paramahamsa Tewari, an electrical engineer and former Executive Director of Nuclear Power Corporation of India.</strong></p>

<p>And about time too! It&#39;s Not like this idea hasn&#39;t been utilized by other inventors and their &quot;overunity devices&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s things like this idea which, by <em>giving</em> people access to free energy <em>will change the world!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, yes, you are <em>absolutely correct</em> ,, and he&#39;s not alone! The guy is a Legend in India and <em>finally</em> a person of his staus has come out to support such ideas <em>and</em> his country <em>is behind him</em>!</p>

<p>In fact, the whole Electric/Holographic Universe concept (<a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message565667/pg1?disclaimer=1">Nassim Haremein&#39;s</a>  is based on these same concepts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fundamentals of physics attracted Tewari’s imaginations right from the early school and college days. Over the last four decades his new ideas on the basic nature of space, energy, and matter have solidified into definite shape from which a new theory (Space Vortex Theory) has emerged. </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory reveals the most basic issue of relationship between space and matter precisely pinpointing that space is a more fundamental entity than matter. </p>

<p>The physical significance of mass, inertia, gravitation, charge and light are revealed by extending the analysis in the theory beyond material properties and into the substratum of space, which again is broken down into fieldless voids, thus showing the limit to which a physical theory can possibly reach. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The real universe is shown to be opposite to the current concepts of concrete-matter and empty space</strong>. </p>

<p>The books that he has authored on Space Vortex Theory are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Substantial Space and Void Nature of Elementary Material Particles (1977)</p></li>
<li><p>Space Vortices of Energy and Matter (1978)</p></li>
<li><p>The Origin of Electron’s Mass, Charge Gravitational and Electromagnetic Fields from “Empty Space” (1982)</p></li>
<li><p>Beyond Matter (1984)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many people who <em>have succeeded</em> in making &quot;overunity&quot; devices </p>

<p>BUT</p>

<p>they <em>always get shut down</em> (by those Co&#39;s with &#39;vested interests&#39; in <em>other</em> &#39;energy sources&#39;) one way or another!</p>

<p>SO, <strong>This is the first time the goverment of a Huge country <em>has supported</em> the development of such ideas!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude.. If &#39;free energy&#39; devices existed, or had ever been created, all the creator had to do was publish it on the Internet. This idea that they &#39;all get shut down&#39; is so impossible in the Internet age. Unless you think that not only did they all get shut down but that every single person shut down was a greedy asshole unwilling to give the world the solution to almost all problems without making some money. </p>

<p>and this is the <em>exact reason &#39;why</em> India&#39; has &#39;broken the rules&#39; of the &#39;agreement&#39; by TPTB to <em>supress</em> such inventions</p>

<p>And you can bet your balls that IF people in the US were <em>suffering from</em> <del>the same</del> <em>any major</em> power shortage they would raise all sorts of hell!</p>

<p>BUT ... for the moment, that&#39;s not the case and <em>most people in the US can afford</em> to pay for petrol and electricity</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the case in India, which <em>is why</em> the Indian <em>goverment</em> has come out backing this guy. He&#39;s known how to do this for 30+ YEARS</p>

<p>But, <em>wasn&#39;t allowed to</em> make them <em>until now</em></p>

<p>People keep <em>wanting changes</em> but when they come, the masses have been <em>so well indoctrinated to believe</em> Bullshit that they can&#39;t even get their collective heads around the <em>possibility</em> they haven&#39;t been told the &quot;whole story&quot; by TPTB!</p>

<p>The &quot;sheeple&quot; have <em>such faith</em> in &quot;their political representatives&quot; that <em>they will believe whatever shit gets spun</em> their way! It&#39;s beyond sad.</p>

<p>I can  honestly understand how TPTB think that there would be chaos IF &quot;the Truth <em>were</em> told&quot; to such people.</p>

<p>Not unlike how &quot;magic tricks&quot; are no longer &#39;magical&#39; <em>once you know how it&#39;s done</em> ,, IF the PTB were to tell the sheeple &quot;how they do the tricks&quot; ,, the sheeple would rise up and have the PTB&#39;s balls for breakfast ... and they know it!  </p>

Also the current government has much more grave problems to solve like farmers committing suicide due to debt. Or maybe the Kashmir issue.

Or maybe after effects of noteban.

    <div class="md"><p>Paramahamsa Tewari was born on June 1, 1937, and graduated in Electrical Engineering in 1958 from Banaras Engineering College, India, and held responsible positions in large engineering construction organizations, mostly in nuclear projects of the Department of Atomic Energy, India. He was also deputed abroad for a year at Douglas Point Nuclear Project, Canada. He is presently the retired Executive Nuclear Director, Nuclear Power Corporation, Department of Atomic Energy, India, and is the former Project Director of the Kaiga Atomic Power Project.</p>

<p>Yes, this idea <em>has been around for a long time</em> and was <em>always shut down</em> by Big Oil interests</p>

<p>Alas, <em>they know</em> their days are numbered ... and they <em>can&#39;t stop</em> countries like India from supporting them!</p>

<p>This is more about this guy having the support of the Indian Government, which is an <em>unprecedented</em> action <em>never done</em> before this</p>

<p>To maximize profits, you develop (and keep secret) any free-energy systems, but you do not put them into use until you have pumped/mined/fracked all the existing energy sources dry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A return of 2.38 times the currently supplied amount of energy is not too much. If you calculate the amount of energy and resources used to produce the device, you will most likely end up below the factor one which makes it completely useless. Even bio-ethanol at a factor of 1.3 is useless and factors of about 10 to 20 for wind and solar are still pretty bad. A molten salt reactor has a factor of 2000. This are technology we have to pay attention to.</p>

<p>apparently a return of 1.000000001% is <em>impossible</em>! So I reckon 2.38x <em>is</em> quite impressive! </p>

<p>Colonel Bearden is a leading conceptualist in alternate energy technologies, electromagnetic bio-effects, unified field theory concepts, and other related areas. He is a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the US Army and holds a Ph.D. and an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. At the time of this interview, he was CEO of CTEC, Inc., Director of the Association of Distinguished American Scientists, and Fellow Emeritus of the Alpha Foundation&#39;s Institute for Advanced Study. In Colonel Bearden&#39;s testimony he speaks extensively about how it is possible to derive useable energy from the vacuum without violating any currently known laws of physics. He and others have built electromechanical devices which actually demonstrate this technology. He also explains how certain powers would rather keep this technology from becoming widely known outside of small esoteric circles. Time is running out however because our Earth does not have enough oil and coal reserves to last even for this generation. He explains how our top minds and scientists must first recognize then rally around an effort to solve this energy problem before 2004.</p>
