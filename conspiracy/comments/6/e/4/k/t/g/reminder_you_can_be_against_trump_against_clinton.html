       Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian hacking group. It has nothing in common with  Guccifer, who is a real person. The only thing they have in common is the word of the name. This was a clever nomenclature, as it confuses people like you, which is exactly what a hacker group would want.

       Ironically, much like the other theories against the DNC constantly gaining viral status, this one is designed to do exactly that - divide the progressive Left againstâ itself.

       It's not divisive to say that Republicans and Democrats are fundamentally the same party if you've been paying any sort of attention and not getting caught up in wedge politics and political theater.  That's just you clinging stubbornly to 'your team', ignorant of the fact that 70 to 80% of your politicians
       <em>
        on all sides
       </em>
       are corrupted and in on the take from various countries and agendas.  Ralph Nader said it best - "the only difference between Republicans and Democrats is which knees hit the floor faster for corporate interests."

       Nah, there is such a thing as a civil society doctrine where democratic leaders believe in a strong, healthy, educated middle class earning good wages and reigning in corporate power.
      </p>
      <p>
       To suggest it's all the same is the nihilistic view that aims to take down the true civil democracy and replace it with a corporate oligarchy you supposedly hate so much.

       Sorry but I think you have entirely too much faith in your government, or that the people who work in it are actually good people.  There's some, but the vast majority of our politicians are where they are because they are blackmailed and controlled.  I suggest it is all the same because history has shown this to be true, you're just letting bullshit get in the way of the big picture.  Both parties love war, both parties love their corporate kickbacks, both parties hate the poor and middle class, both parties are ultimately controlled by the same people, and they have almost universal contempt for all of us.  Just because they have the same color patch or the same color skin as you doesn't mean they have anywhere near the same objectives or goals, you literally have more in common with a poor beggar in Bangladesh than you do any politician in this country.  The left-right divide is just window-dressing to mask the fact that it has
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       been a class war and we lost it a long time ago.

       This whole situation strikes me as an argument between two pig farmers over who stinks the most - they're working their asses off to convince everyone that the other smells awful - they may even have some great points - but at the end of the day they're both covered in shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical response that any observing citizen should take right now is that
       <em>
        neither
       </em>
       of the parties running this country are even remotely concerned about the common people. They may pander to us when it's politically expedient, but the moment they get to DC, it's all about obtaining power and keeping others from it once they have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The knee-jerk reaction of politically active people has been to rush go the defense of ideology... Very few people have been observant enough to recognize that both prevailing ideologies in this country are being represented by corrupt assholes that are only as attached to those ideologies as their gerrymandered districts reward them for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day they all serve the same god: power. Trump may be the most blatantly obvious example of this sort of shit, but his sin isn't his corruption, it's that
       <em>
        he lacks the tact to hide it.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there's real change in Washington (I won't hold my breath, but I will hope), there almost isn't a reason to debate about differing policy positions because the people that represent those positions don't actually give a shit and will drop them the moment it is obvious that they'll do better on the other side of the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       We NEED to stop defending our own party's politicians. We need to start holding them to account - if change is going to happen, it has to be from within these parties, not by attacking the other one.

       respectfully, jettisoning republican "democracy" for direct democracy is the only way to change everything regardless of political party.
      </p>
      <p>
       direct democracy makes political parties and politics moot. it cuts their heads off with the precision and permanace of the guillotine, but without the blood and hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at the 25 states that have democracy (27 officially, but 2 are very weak), they show how without excessive, and astronomically expensive, intermedling trying to influence their votes, citizens are not divided, are fairly practical and levelheaded, and are remarkably fair. in FL, pretty much everyone i know but those actively working in the parties, only really go to the polls to vote for the props. they also show that all you have to do to win, is to stop giving up--med marijuana died in FL repeatedly and repeatedly it was put back on the ballot, and ladt year it passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       in 2002, over 60% of voters gave sows and piglets the constitutional right to be able to stand, turn, and lie down to nurse in their pens. when i was a rising 3L interning for the summer in the southern circuit for the district of miami, i was harranged by the city atty of miami about how it was a ridiculous vote and proved that people should not be allowed to vote directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       i asked him why he cared that pigs now hard marginally better lives. he said he didn't, but that he didn't believe it belonged in the constitution  (voters can't vote for or against statutes here, we can only amend our constitution, so we have no choice but to treat the constitution as if it were the statues). i said it seemed to me that the constituion was the most appropriate place to grant rights that seek to protect someone's  dignity and self-autonomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       guess most normal people do too.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw, that 60% was made up of predominantly repub voters,  if the results from the midterms that year are any i dication. just to get in on the ballot required signatures from every county.

       400 years ago, people finally decided they didn't need intermediaries to speak with invisible beings in the sky.

      <p>
       200 years ago, people finally decided they didn't need people picked by those invisible beings to govern their affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       now it's time for people to finally decide that they needn't be governed at all.

       Do you really see the same blind allegiance in democrats as you do republicans? (Let's say, trump supporters, because it's a subgroup of republican.)

       Have you heard them defending that sociopath in Montana? Supporting every rotten thing trump says?

       Yes actually. I'm not taking out a measuring rod or anything, but the Democrats have their own faction within themselves that represent that same sort of extremist, "party first" mentality. That movement may not get as much press at the moment, but they're every bit as much a part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that both parties have a majority of level headed voters that don't swear allegiance to anyone. It's a bell curve as with many things in life.

       Is there a way to go around government? Some type of grass roots? They can't throw us all in jail right? Kind of what Colorado is doing.

       Speaking of, i think the best chance we have is if states take more control. Won't eliminate corruption but will at least contain it to each state.

       The only honest motive is to ultimately know the real truth about anything in a world that is filled with lies and deceit. Without the truth, there can be no justice for all the innocent and hapless people who are preyed upon and used or abused by those who perpetuate all those lies and deceits.

       No, people were point his mob connections, potential loans with Russian banks, and Manafort's shadiness (and then the weirdness of the Page pick). Most of what we're talking about now hadn't even happened yet.

       When you think you have learned the truth, go back to this question.
"Is the truth that you have received somehow helping The Power That Be?"
As long as you are kept busy fighting other members of the 99%, the one-percenters keep winning. Get it?

       The problem with the top 1% wealthy people is not that they have most of the wealth, the problem is is that I have a disproportionate amount of power over our media and political systems.  They use that power to create a situation where members of the 99% continue to fight each other, while they continue to consolidate their power money and wealth. Eventually, they will have to get rid of 99%.

       Most of the 1% are unconnected to any power, and earned it through hard work, like my daughter the workaholic with no advantages.
       <br/>
       I immediately dismiss the ramblings of anyone choosing to group the 1% together, when it is the 0.001% that have power.
       <br/>
       You are inspiring the modern Robespierre to lop the heads off of hard working people with no security forces, as they will be easy targets, sparing the truly powerful. This is part of the FBI created Ocuupy movement, started by the government to fool dullards. Most of the 1% who were blamed ideologically, have nothing to do with power structures.

       You have a point. I am really talking mostly about the .1 percent .01 percent, who are the ones who control  the systems. However there are a lot of 1% who work at pretty shitty companies. If you are a insurance or pharmacy executive, you are living your great life based off the suffering of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also don't give me the "working hard" argument. A guy who has to dig ditches for an underground line works pretty hard. You can't convince me that the CEO of the telephone company should make 300 times more than he makes. A guy who works in an office is not working 300 times harder than someone working outside. And he doesn't deserve 300 times more because he had a high SAT score.  Fuck that kind of shitty "we are holier than stupid people" logic.  The CEO makes 300 times more because he was able to convince his buddies on the Board of Directors to give him that money. Legalized theft.

       I was talking about my hard working daughter who came up from ground level to making 6 figures, by working 70 hours a week.
       <br/>
       She is not an argument, but rather an actual person, unconnected to the power elite.
       <br/>
       Bringing inaccurate numbers in to blame uninvolved people is fucking stupid. There's no nice way to say it.
       <br/>
       I have no idea where your weird cable company story came from in response to me. I want more money for hard labor workers, as well.
       <br/>
       I think hard working sweaty men deserve more than those who type in cubicles, on $500 comfort chairs.
       <br/>
       BTW, I found a black woman cable company CEO.
       <br/>
       '' Ms. Funke Opeke serves as the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Main One Cable. Ms. Opeke founded Main Street Technologies. She served as Chief Operating Officer at Nitel. Subsequent to MTN, she advised Transcorp on the acquisition of NITEL and briefly served as the interim Chief Operating Officer. She returned to Nigeria in 2005 as the Chief Technical Officer at MTN Nigeria Communications (MTN) after a twenty-year career in the United States. She served as Executive ...''
       <br/>
       Stop blaming men, when clearly most publicly traded stocks are owned by women. They rule the board rooms, and decide compnay policies with their ''put your money where your mouth is'' investments.
       <br/>
       Most people over 65 are female, and they have lots of investments, controlling more money than any other demographic in the US.
       <br/>
       If you spend 5 minutes researching the amount of female Execs in the mass media, you will be surprised as fuck.
       <br/>
       TV, Film, and advertising are certainly not male run, now.

       Remind me how many white people the BLM has killed?  How many cops, judges, senators, prosecutors are secretly BLM using their influence to ruin white people's lives?  Comparing an ideology to a terrorist group is irresponsible and pathetic (and a little covertly white supremacist)... the enemy is govt and power structures... Not each other...

       BLM isn't a centralized organization. Period. It's just a heading under which some protests had been formed. They're more like pedes... loose knit, gathered online, etc...

       Why would anyone be against holding the police accountable for their actions and having them not murder unarmed citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's literally what BLM is. It's named that because black people are disproportionately affected by this. If you have a problem with that, it's probably because you're a little racist at the minimum.

       BLM is now just a puppet organization funded by george soros to fuel both sides of racial tension. How anyone could be in support of BLM is beyond me.

       None of the BLM people in Los Angeles that I work with have been getting any george Soros paychecks. I also protested the Trump election and didn't get a paycheck for that either.

       Did you bother looking at the numerous amount of donations different BLM chapters have received? It's not some big organized movement it's just separate groups connecting with each other through social media using BLM as a hashtag to their actions.

       I say it was started by them, just like Occupy was. Starting a ''dissent'' group is the easiest way to watch them. Very simple.

       DeRay gets TONS of donations all the time, and couchsurfs a ton. He's slept on my couch before. Surprise surprise, but not all black people are poor and live in the projects eating government cheese waiting for their handouts, and a lot of us organize and donate to causes and people we believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep trying to go along with the racist rhetoric that everything black people do somehow has to be funded or controlled by white people because black people are incapable of doing anything without you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might really get angry when you realize that black people have invented pretty much every modern music form for the past 100 years in America, but I'm sure you'll give credit to Elvis instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, FYI, the FBI and CIA hate black movements. Look into the MOVE Bombing in Philly in 1985.

       Black people make up 13% of the population yet are fatally killed by police at 3 times the rate the population numbers should measure out, with the majority not being in possession of any deadly weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, white men are the biggest threat to their lives yet they seem to get killed by police the least.
      </p>

       Funny that. Care to explain how white men are the biggest threat to an officers life (outside of police driving like crazy people), and yet their bullets somehow end up in black men?

       You don't seem to understand how funding and organization of these groups works. Obviously, after a certain traction is gained there is plenty of grassroots involvement. Nobody believes everyone involved is getting a check from George Soros... BLM, whether intentionally or not has been a huge contributing factor in racial division. A quick search on YouTube and you can find people treating white people with the same hate and ignorance as the KKK has towards black people... Obviously, not every branch of local BLM groups is going to have that mentality and there are plenty of groups within BLM that have no intention of division, and are actually inclusive and willing to build bridges. The problem comes when sticking BLM next to your name leads people to believe that person shares the same values as they do... Thats where you find some voices being pushed that do have ties to Soros. The same type of situation arises with feminism. The few trying to start chants like "we want dead cops" etc. Are the ones people have issue with and i think the problem is that there didnt appear to be any noticeable call to put down those type of people. Another problem is that the media tends to focus more on the extreme, for all i know there had been people standing up and disagreeing with those statements, they just don't get on the nationwide stage. Plus, you're on r/conspiracy where many people believe if its on the MSM it had an agenda that it's against the common good.

       No, you don't seem to understand that I know most of the senior leadership and he founders personally and none of them are getting these George Soros checks you speak of. In fact, a couple aren't doing so well financially at all, so that makes the accusation even more absurd, and just another way white people want to discredit black people sick and tired of being murdered by the fuckin state.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to be funded by some rich white dude none of us have even heard of to be rightfully pissed the fuck off over having to worry about being murdered by a cop your incompressible jizztrumpet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly don't realize how racist and stupid and disrespectful your conspiracy is. You're basically saying that black people don't give a fuck about their lives and the school to prison pipeline, and actually enjoy being murdered by the police and being turned into hashtags, but here come these paid protestors to upset the nice prison slavery apple cart those blacks surely enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sound like a whole ass idiot. Black people are sick and tired of racism and being killed over it. No one that's affected by this needs to get cut a check to be rightfully pissed off and march about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All your conspiracy does is expose the fact that the only way you could possibly be assed to give a shit about someone's life (and specifically a black life) being taken by the state for no reason is if someone paid you to do so, which surprise, means you're racist as shit there famalam.

       And there is the divisiveness i speak of. Good luck getting anywhere with that. You can support the end of instituations that disporportionately affect minorites and poor people without turning things into "white people____" because ive got news for.... In poor white areas where there are little to no black people, they are treated like shit as well. Speak on principles not colors.... End the drug wars, end the prison industrial complex, limit pooice rights and permissions, etc... Fuck off with your assumptions of me.

       And it matters so so much whether i am or not. Again, good luck with your methods. If that ends the things i mentioned, we will all be better for it. I personally think youre just kicking yourself in the ass and hurting your own end goals while dividing this country further. Can you even imagine how ignorant this conversation would come across if i was suggesting your blackness is the basis for all of your opinions...youre dividing common people for the 1% and making it easier for them to conquer us all.... Have a good night.

       Why do people think that mentioning race is racist?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible to address racism without using the construct of race (the tool of oppression) to describe patterns and practices which are harmful. In an ideal world minorities would love to never have to mention race, but as long as racism exists so must identification of those racist patterns through racialized lens.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point being color blind is a part of racism because you're denying clear global patterns of preference and respect for one race over others. Covering your eyes and saying I don't see race, doesn't help anyone.

       The thing you're not realizing is that we are already divided. The only way to move beyond that divide is acknowledging and admitting the great divide in the country (and the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       When in the US election every single ethnic, religious, sexual, and economic minority voted for one candidate and the group in power (white, rich,etc...) voted for the other, the divide is already there. No matter what your opinions on either of the candidates are, you can't deny that is noteworthy and important divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point being color blind is a part of racism because you're denying clear global patterns of preference and respect for one race over others. Covering your eyes and saying I don't see race, doesn't help anyone. You must acknowledge that we all see race and need to be vigilant for discrimination in our environments, and most importantly within ourselves. Subconscious racism isn't any better than overt racism.

       You can address racism without being racist yourself. You're comment is written in a way which a person could reasonably respond. I have a feeling no matter how I responded to the other poster the only response I would get would only have to do with my hypothetical skin color. I never stated racism isn't a part of it, but yelling "White people____" doesn't help anything.

       Look I understand that hearing people point out one  group as an oppressor or as having responsibility to do things differently. You should not dismiss the message itself because you don't agree with the tone. The same way I could have dismissed you, because of the tone you had against someone who was just pointing out patterns of racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anything that poster said as racist. He/she never once said anything that implied one race was superior to another or expressed opinions that reinforces the devaluations of an ethnic group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out that straight people perpetuate bigoted/sexist gender and sexual norms against gays is not a bigoted statement. It may be divisive, but in many ways it needs to be. Oppression can not be overcome unless we target our message to the audience it is intended for. While just saying we should just care for others and all be loving of all others is a great sentiment, it fails as a social movement or revolution because it motivates no change. Controversy is necessary to be heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't make change unless they are strongly motivated to do so. By saying we should all not be racist no change will ever happen. Everyone agrees or at least lies and says they agree. When white people are isolated as a perpetrator of racism it makes them in many ways go through the stages of grief. First there is anger and denial, but as we learn more the more that will change towards acceptance. The only way to address racism that is unspoken is to make it spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same complaints of divisiveness and separating people against each other were made verbatim against MLK when he fought to end segregation. I can link you if you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative."
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks have complained about their treatment in the US for as long as they've been here. The only times that change was ever enacted is when they acted in controversial and divisive ways that forced action. Would we ever hear about the issues that are on everyone's mind if BLM did not exist? The sad thing is change can only occur when the group who holds societal power ( white individuals) make the change happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       "First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season." Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, blacks and minorities may be angry, they may say things that are divisive, they may even say bombastic statements such as "kill all whites", but those actions only exist because nothing below those actions have motivated people to stop and listen. People are listening now, even if they disagree with every bone in their body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change requires motivation and motivation requires loss or sacrifice (voluntary or not).
      </p>
      <p>
       "I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality."
      </p>
      <p>
       MLK targeted his message to the group most responsible because to do anything else would be a disservice to the movement. I implore you to read the full letter from Birmingham Jail (and the history behind how he ended up there), because in this case history is repeating itself. His words and the words of his detractors (exactly the words spoken against BLM now) can pose a stronger argument than anything I said here.

       What if I told you that I'm not white?  Would your argument still hold water?  No, because it never did in the first place.  The truth is that one does not need to be of a certain race to hold certain ideologies.  And there can be plenty of reasons why someone would not choose to support your cause that does NOT have to do with racism.  You know what's a tired argument?  Writing off everyone else's argument as racist.

       How about you realize you actually haven't refuted any of my points at all.  I'd call this a argument, but this exchange was more you telling me my points are white supremacy than an actual argument.  You're right about one thing, this isn't worth discussing further, not when you don't have anything more to contribute than "LOL INTERNALIZED RACISM."

       That's your whole problem.  You can't say my argument is racist if you haven't proven it yet.  You claim it's racist from the get-go, but unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.  Still waiting for some form of reasoning, but you just love dragging it out, don't ya?

       But if you're not so inclined to, then fine.  Enjoy your black and white view of the world, enjoy your false dilemma, enjoy your oversimplifications and your generalizations.  I'd rather be sleeping.

       Because we've all seen BLM members preaching to kill cops and have killed cops, they also have rioted and destroyed entire communities in the past. If you want to hold the police to account for innocent people dying then use the judiciary and don't complain how the system is racist when it's not, maybe if you didn't have a culture of trying to be a 'gangster' these things wouldn't happen. Obey the Law and co-operate fully with the police force.

       No they can't because unfortunately to the majority of people they still think this is a fucking Mets vs. Yankees game and they gotta root for a team that couldn't care less for them.  They don't realize the entire thing is fully stacked with corruption that greases all the palms.

       I hate the Soros has funded Black Lives Matter, but I completely support the goals of the individuals involved. Police brutality is a VERY serious problem in the USA, and Black people, men in particular, are disproportionately hurt by this sort of crime. Being opposed to that Nazi sympathizer Soros shouldn't require me being against ending racial police brutality. Everyone should be in favor of ending police brutality.

       I agree with you, but Soros probably doesn't give a shit about the real issues in the black community, he just wants to install fear on everyone, black and white people.

       The Seth Rich story is a Republican fanfic that is not based on any reality at all, just like Pizzagate and the Washington DC lesbian gangs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weigh up the evidence and it is self evident that Seth Rich was killed during an attempted mugging. The evidence for a conspiracy only exists in the minds of fools.

       Your silly claim that "Seth Rich was killed during an attempted mugging" is supported, of course, by no evidence, and only dishonest shareblue shills pretend to claim otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       No worthless propaganda worshipper has ever provided any sane evidence why each of the following pieces of reality, unfortunately, exist.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Julian Assange offered a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of Seth Rich three weeks after his murder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the street camera footage of his pretend mugging has disappeared
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there is no body camera footage from the attending cops
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Debbie Wassserman Schultz's brother is the federal prosecutor in the Seth Rich case.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the retarded pretend-mugging did not take his wallet, cash, or rings
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         law enforcement officers arrived
         <strong>
          eight hours
         </strong>
         later and kicked nearly everyone out of the ICU and physically barred doctors and others from attending to him [related by the resident surgeon at Washington Hospital Center]
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the law enforcement officers prevented doctors from attending to him
         <strong>
          eight hours later
         </strong>
         when the official narrative is that Seth Rich was dead within two hours
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         rewards totalling $200,000 (?) have been posted for information about his unsolved murder. Why would anyone do that - oh, of course [I'm mocking you here] "The Seth Rich story is a Republican fanfic"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seth Rich's old reddit posts are being edited. By whom - oh, gotcha, his "muggers".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the police have not even asked for the survellience footage from the bar at which Seth Rich was last seen alive in public
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Wikileaks strongly hints twice (twitter hashtag and interview yesterday), and Kim Dotcom states, that Seth Rich was the wikileaks DNC mails leaker.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         corporations are removing advertising from a television channel because a talk show host talked about an unsolved murder.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         shills are trying to stop the sane section of the population from investigating an unsolved and suspicious-as-fuck murder
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the gun-control obsessed "Democratic" party did not cash in big time on the gun murder of their employee, be it for sympathy, gun control points, more media time, or to represent themselves as 'under attack'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         disgusting shills are supporting each other in "no, don't even discuss this suspicious-as-fuck murder... because &lt;insert moronic reason&gt;"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I know all this, and I'm not even interested in the Seth Rich murder - well, slightly, maybe. Those people who are actually interested in the Seth Rich assassination: Well, disgusting don't-think shills are never going to be able to convince them.

       Your moronic claim that the DNC may have murdered Seth Rich has zero basis in reality. Every single piece of "evidence" you provide has zero connection to the actual murder, while you conveniently ignore factual evidence that makes it clear that it was an attempted mugging.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Julian Assange offered a $20,000 reward for information on the murder of Seth Rich three weeks after the murder.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One month prior the DNC admitted that it had been hacked by Russian hackers, which was later confirmed by intelligence agencies. Wikileaks released the emails after receiving them from the Russians before the Seth Rich murder. Also this was after Trump had stated on live TV that Russia should release the emails. The only reason Assange offered a reward was because he needed a distraction from the heat he was getting regarding his links with Russia, and he wanted to promote himself, as well as try to hurt the Democrat Party,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the street camera footage of his pretend mugging has disappeared
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pretend mugging my ass. Seth Rich suffered bruises to his wrist, hands and knees, and the strap to his wristwatch was torn. Clear physical evidence of an attempted mugging and a struggle. Also what camera footage? The area where Seth Rich was murdered was in an area where there was no lighting, and no cameras. One week prior the community had a meeting with the police to express their concerns about this very issue, after which nothing was done until after the shooting.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there is no body camera footage from the attending cops
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It was not until Dec 2016 that the mayor of DC district made it mandatory for all officers to have a body cam and to have it turned on when responding to a call out. Prior to that it was common for body cams to be turned off.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Debbie Wassserman Schultz's brother is the federal prosecutor in the Seth Rich case.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       You have no idea what you are talking about. The case has not been handed to a prosecutor because the police are still investigating to find the murderer.  Once the police have finished investigating, then it gets handed off to a prosecutor.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the retarded pretend-mugging did not take his wallet, cash, or rings
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There were bruises on Seth's hands and wrists and his watch strap was broken, so it is clear there was an attempt to rob him, there were two guys surrounding Seth (just like every other robbery at that corner) and they shot him because he fought back, then they ran off because the Police could instantly detect the sound of gunfire in the district and dispatch police immediately to the scene.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        law enforcement officers arrived eight hours later and kicked nearly everyone out of the ICU and physically barred doctors and others from attending to him.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. Police found Seth Rich within 5mins of the gunshots, and he was treated at the scene by paramedics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the law enforcement officers prevented doctors from attending to him eight hours later when the official narrative is that Seth Rich was dead within two hours
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. He was shot at 4.19am. He was put on a stretcher, taken to hospital by ambulance and died at 6.05am (approx 2 hours after being shot).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        rewards totalling $200,000 (?) have been posted for information about his unsolved murder. Why would anyone do that - oh, of course [I'm mocking you here] "The Seth Rich story is a Republican fanfic"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The police offered a reward for information first. Then Julian Assange offered a reward (which he clearly has no intent on paying out) in order to promote himself and stay relevant after the revelation that he is working with hackers working for the Russian government.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Seth Rich's old reddit posts are being edited. By whom - oh, gotcha, his "muggers".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. There is zero evidence that Seth Rich had a reddit account. The accounts are Bernie supporters accounts, who stopped posting after Bernie lost the primary.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the police have not even asked for the survellience footage from the bar at which Seth Rich was last seen alive in public
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Irrelevant. He was no where near the bar when he was shot. How is it going to help the investigation?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wikileaks strongly hints twice (twitter hashtag and interview yesterday), and Kim Dotcom states, that Seth Rich was the wikileaks DNC mails leaker.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit. Seth Rich had no contact with Wikileaks, and Wikileaks clarified on twitter that Assange's comments should in no way be taken to mean that Seth Rich was the leaker or to imply that his murder was connected in any way to their organisation. In other words Seth Rich was NOT their source.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        corporations are removing advertising from a television channel because a talk show host talked about an unsolved murder.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They pulled their advertising from a show that persisted in pushing a debunked hoax conspiracy. They would have done the same if he had been pushing the Sandy Hook hoax conspiracy. Being insensitive to victims and spreading lies about them is a good way to lose advertisers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        shills are trying to stop the sane section of the population from investigating an unsolved and suspicious-as-fuck murder
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The only shills are the ones pushing the fake as fuck conspiracy(s), and they are always more active directly after Trump receives negative press. Much like they tried to during the French election when they tried to get Le Pen elected.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the gun-control obsessed "Democratic" party did not cash in big time on the gun murder of their employee, be it for sympathy, gun control points, more media time, or to represent themselves as 'under attack'
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They were trying to win a presidential election, so their focus was on the Hilary campaign, and did not want to be seen trying to score political points from the murder.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        disgusting shills are supporting each other in "no, don't even discuss this suspicious-as-fuck murder... because &lt;insert moronic reason&gt;"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only shills are the ones pushing this fake conspiracy, and they are always the ones who immediately bring out the shilling accusation. Projection much.

      <p>
       ** NOW FOR THE FACTS AND REAL EVIDENCE**
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Prior to the murder there had been a spate of robberies 8 in 6 weeks in the same neighbourhood
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The area where Seth Rich was shot gad no cameras and no lighting, and there was construction of a tunnel going on in the area creating ample places for robbers to conceal themselves
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The community had a meeting with the police to discuss their concerns regarding the spate of robberies in the area
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The robberies all occurred in the same way, a group of 2-3 people aged approx 17-23 approached their victim wielding handguns, demanding that the victim disable their phone and hand over their wallet.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The victims reported the criminals were wielding silver handguns
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Police confirmed that Seth Rich was killed by a hand gun
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seth Rich had a torn wristwatch as well as bruises on his hands, wrist and face, consistent with an attempted robber trying to take his watch from him by force, a struggle ensuing and then one of the other robbers shooting him from behind.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The police arrived within 4-5 minutes of the shots being fired
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The robberies in the area stopped for 7-8 weeks, obviously the robbers panicked and opted to lie low until the heat died down from the police investigation.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       TL/DR: Seth Rich conspiracy is 100% fake and not based on reality.

       I saw a good quote the other day. It basically said that not one group of people can hold a monopoly on moral virtue, no one is so intellectually superior that they cannot stand to hear an opposing view. If you claim to be intellectually superior and cannot have a discussion about an opposing view without losing your mind...you are not intellectually superior.

       I think it's fair to be skeptical of everything. Nobody has a monopoly on truth, and narrative is a human construct anyways. It's only a problem when you get this partisan bullshit. Instead of people versus the powers that be, it turns into people vs. people. Seems directly antithetical to the founding of the nation, as Washington warned against.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, at some point we have to acknowledge that one set of policies can have a dramatically different impact on lives than another. There's still a choice to be made. Pretending there isn't is just another way for 'them' to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the major parties jointly owning a debate commission is kind of a weird example for this. I hear they also sit in the same rooms when voting on policy. So what? There's far worse out there.

       Everything is pretty cool except for equating BLM and KKK. One is a hate group that hates anyone who isn't white and another is fighting against the unfair killing of blacks by the police. One group is fighting for equal treatment, accountability of the police (as we here know they never admit wrongdoing), their rights and their lives. Other fighting for literally the exact opposite lol.

       Yet you're the one that keeps bringing color into the conversation.  I can't see either of you from where I'm standing, but I can definitely point out the racist.

       Remind me how many white people the BLM has killed?  How many cops, judges, senators, prosecutors are secretly BLM using their influence to ruin white people's lives?  Comparing an ideology to a terrorist group is irresponsible and pathetic (and a little covertly white supremacist)... the enemy is govt and power structures... Not each other...

       BLM isn't a centralized organization. Period. It's just a heading under which some protests had been formed. They're more like pedes... loose knit, gathered online, etc...

       How about you realize you actually haven't refuted any of my points at all.  I'd call this a argument, but this exchange was more you telling me my points are white supremacy than an actual argument.  You're right about one thing, this isn't worth discussing further, not when you don't have anything more to contribute than "LOL INTERNALIZED RACISM."
