        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bigelow-aerospace-founder-says-commercial-world-will-lead-in-space/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bigelow-aerospace-founder-says-commercial-world-will-lead-in-space/</a></p>

<p>A man like that doesn&#39;t put his reputation on the line in a national publication without some insider knowledge of ETI existence. You truly have no idea what has been kept from you. </p>

<p>Example: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/P790005-1028_e.html">Humanity never left the moon.</a></p>

<p>Both the USAF and USN have fleets which take personnel too and from lunar bases to the Earth with ease. These programs are classified above SAP (Special Access Program), but the truth and technology embargo is close to dropping.</p>

<p><a href="http://metro.co.uk/2017/03/07/ufo-fans-reckon-a-massive-alien-megaship-just-buzzed-the-space-station-6493638/">Live feed blackouts from the ISS are due to passing USN and USAF orbital ships passing by as they prepare to re-enter Earth&#39;s atmosphere.</a></p>

<p>That ship is a cruiser class and built on the same aerodynamic principles and anti-gravity technology as the TR-3B, the orbital and suborbital defense fighter commonly referred to as the &quot;Black Triangle UFO&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/05/tr-3b-flying-triangle-ufo-patent-now-available-to-the-public/">TR-3B patent was officially disclosed and released to the public last week.</a></p>

<p>As for why you&#39;ve never seen the &quot;ayyys&quot; up close or a ship up close?</p>

<p>Well, if the embargo drop goes according to plan, post-WWII history will be rewritten entirely. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kibbitzlaw/status/864332748067975168">JFK wanted to tell everyone the truth and it cost him his life.</a></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because the factions loyal to CIA Director Allan Dulles, whom JFK fired sfter the CIA went behind his back and tried to false flag a nuclear strike against US forces at Guantanamo to justify taking out Castro, were still seething about what JFK did. </p>

<p>All of these guys were WASPs from Yale and Princeton and they viewed JFK and RFK as nothing more than loud mouth, thick mic Irsih Catholics...and WASPs <strong><em>hated</em></strong> Irish-Catholics. It&#39;s a long story, but my family was involved in all this way back when and until Kennedy&#39;s death. We were the Irish Machine in New York.</p>

<p>Anyway, the Dulles faction was lead by a one George H.W. Bush. His father, Prescott Bush, was a Nazi sympathizer prior to U.S. entering WWII and was placing his bets on Hitler and The Reich. Prescott knew The Reich had been working with ETIs, particularly Draco Reptilians (from the constellation Draco) and The Greys (from Zeta Reticuli). Their observation has was on the far side of the moon and, as the Third Reich began to conduct A-Bomb tests near their Antarctic territory and base, New Schwabenlande, the Dracos stepped in. While not friendly to humanity, Earth has been a resource colony of theirs for millenia. So they intervened to prevent humanity&#39;s destruction via nuclear escalation in WWII. What? You really think the United States was the only country to have he A-Bomb. The reality is that the United States was the only one who used it.</p>

<p>When The Third Reich lost, the Draco and Greys along with the remnants of high level SS and its science division fled to New Schwabenland  on a fleet of Kriegsmarine U-Boats. Entry to inland Antarctic bases was achieved via natural passageways under the glaciers. </p>

<p>Operation High Jump and all subsequent operations were an attempt by the United States to root out these forces for Antarctica and secure the anti-gravity ships and ETI tech which U.S. Navy and OSS embedded in the SS science division learned of during WWII. High Jump was a failure, as were all subsequent operations, and high casualties were sustained (most were not publicly disclosed; mainly supply and craft loss were reported).</p>

<p>In 1952, over a course of three evenings, D.C. was buzzed by multiple UFOs. These were the Third Reich&#39;s anti-gravity craft (Die Glocke) signaling the U.S. government to either negotiate or face attack. Nazi scientists like Von Braun were used as mediatiors in the negotiations and, ultimately, Eisenhower signed what became known as The Greada Treaty.</p>

<p>In exchange for technology from The Draco and Greys (mainly Greys), the U.S. had to allow  Draco and Greys to abduct humans for DNA extraction (sperm and ovum eggs) and &quot;experiments&quot;. Now you know why Operation Paperclip ramped up and why MKUltra / Project Monarch and Project Mockingbird were just a continuation of Josef Mengele&#39;s work fromthe days of Nazi controlled Europe. </p>

<p>Eisenhower&#39;s signing of the treaty was the day the CIA became The Deep State and a continuation, more or less, of The Third Reich&#39;s high level R&amp;D operation in the SS.</p>

<p>When Kennedy scuttled Dulles&#39; false flag for Cuba, he fired him and then demanded the CIA turn over all information regarding their knowledge of and collaboration with ETIs.</p>

<p>H.W. Bush lead the faction loyal to Dulles and recruited LBJ for the assasssination of Kennedy. Bush and his faction did not want the technology getting out to the public. They wanted to keep it for themselves, farm it out to defense contractors, get filthy rich, and then eventually control the world. These guys may not have been wearing swastika arm bands, but this was an era where the Ivy League was churning out like candy graduates sympathetic to Hitler&#39;s ideas of a global fascist state.</p>

<p>Kennedy threatened that plan and...so...ka-boom.</p>

<p>Ever since then you&#39;ve lived under a shadow world government, but a resistance movement was created in the 1970s and has been operating ever since in a &quot;quiet war&quot;. </p>

<p>Trump was recruited to run for POTUS by ex-CIA agent and resistance member Dr. Steve Pieczenick. </p>

<p>Pieczenick and Trump knew each other from the time Trump&#39;s uncle was a tenured Professor of Physicis at MIT and Pieczenick was getting his PhD in International Relations there while simultaneously getting his MD from Harvard. Additionally, Trump&#39;s uncle had access to Tesla&#39;s work when Tesla died and the FBI called in Dr. Trump as a consultant. </p>

<p>The whole point of the Trump presidency is to end the truth/tech embargo and to cease withholding and suppressing Tesla&#39;s very correct understanding of the universe, which puts Einstein to shame. Einstein, while brilliant, has been used as a propaganda tool for decades. The purpose is to make you believe that you must be a genius and mathematical savant to begin even understanding how the universe works, thus discouraging you from trust what you yourself can observe and both your instinct and intuition.</p>

<p>Tesla was right that the secret to understanding the universe is a basic understanding of energy, frequency and vibration.</p>

<p><a href="https://squawker.org/analysis/magnetic-bridge-connecting-galaxies-observed-electric-universe-is-real/">There&#39;s a reason this was disclosed last week...and it&#39;s not because it&#39;s a new discovery.</a></p>

<p>The embargo is coming to an end soon.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/ai79cQcwpfE">94 year old William Tompkins opened up this year about his involvement in the design and development of the U.S. Military space fleet and how Draco Reptilians tie into child/human abduction, sacrifice and pedophilia.</a></p>

<p>The Draco are the &quot;Serprent Gods&quot; and &quot;Dragon Gods&quot; found in almost every culture across thousands of years on Earth. They had lived here for millenia. Inner Earth is, honestly, layer upon layer of honeycomb and Antarctica does have a large opening to the inner Earth. The heat from the opening is what causes nearby regions to be ice free and thriving with grasses, plants, misses, etc. and freshwater lakes which stay above freezing year round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been reading and researching for a very long time. The one thing that I always come to when you seem to be getting to the end of the rabbit hole is the Dracos, the new age religion galactic federation and all that. It&#39;s just so out there, such a thing to believe. You can see documents to other conspiracies with the government and technologies that were held back I get that stuff. But to believe the 5th dimension transition which they have been saying for some time now and it&#39;s always right around the corner and that disclosure is about to happen. I&#39;m beginning to believe it&#39;s all to get people&#39;s hopes up so that when nothing happens they will lose even more faith than before. But all I know is what I know and Ill always research and keep looking for the answers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only item of consolation I can offer is that the distilled message at the end of the day is this: you need to embody the light, be the light, and be in accordance with love. Act towards others with the same love as you muster for yourself. If you can do that, you can shape the world around you to conform with that energy. If you work on yourself and recognize that you are also the whole, the timeline will take care of itself. </p>

<p>Regarding 5th dimension transition, everyone who speaks of it projects their own fears, dreams, and hopes. They channel whatever energy they&#39;re putting out. Hence, why TPTB think it&#39;ll be catastrophic world-ending stuff, people who embody both emotions think it&#39;ll be violent transition before peace, people who are nothing but love think it&#39;ll be just turning into a rainbow body. Part of the lesson is not tuning into anyone but yourself, and your own voice. Try to do it from a place of higher frequencies to get the best signal. Don&#39;t try getting answers from a state of lower vibration.</p>

<p>Anyway, friend, I&#39;m typing this out as a message/reminder to myself as much as to you. We&#39;ll all be okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My take on the &quot;disclosure is around the corner&quot; is that no one actually knows for sure and it depends on how fast humanity wants to wake up. In the bigger picture disclosure is right around the corner even if it takes 20 years. From what I&#39;ve read, the apparent advanced and benevolent ET&#39;s are waiting for humanity to evolve as a whole spiritually/mentally before they come out and greet us lol.</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult for a lot of people to care or even have interest in this stuff. But if you take a bunch of psilocybin mushrooms and stare at the sky for a few hours you might be 100% convinced that a love imbued intelligence from another dimension definitely exists. The &quot;aliens&quot; might be a lot more mysterious and different than hollywood has portrayed for us. We need to decondition our minds and open our hearts further before we can jive with the intergalactic hippy people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;elite&quot; (I prefer assholes) were apparently seeded by them ages ago. In some ancient texts the Bible (old T) stems from Satan/the serpent banged eve too, producing Cain. That&#39;s why Cain could heartlessly kill his brother Able (they lack empathy etc, it&#39;s just in their blue blood). Cain was guided by his serpent/reptile father (blue bloods apparently have telekinesis etc come easier) and bred and bred and slowly spread and took leadership of places, resources etc as instructed to do, and eventually infiltrated the pharaohs, then became the Romans, then spit into all the European royalty, Kings, Queens etc. They obviously then branched out worldwide, it&#39;s been proven most US presidents and even a load of actors etc genealogy can all be traced back to one king of England. So basically, it&#39;s because they are tied together by blood, the Draco &amp; the assholes(elites). This is my finding/interpretation anyway :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A long time ago actually, I just forgot to add it in here but then realized it all ties in together. When I was still quite religiously (born into) inclined I was researching satanism coz I realized most people with fame and power were into it, so was puzzled how they had everything they wanted yet Christians had it rough. After a while I started to realize it&#39;s because religions were created or twisted by these older beings/bloodlines who possess the ancient knowledge (and knowledge is power), and eventually realized demons, Satan etc from religion are actually all simply ET&#39;s, they&#39;re the same thing. People like Theruiner777 (aka Shane) who was born into one of those families and left and started a blog to help others who had been through the same helped me piece a lot together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What convinced me about all of this, is how the &quot;elites&quot; believed it fanatically. They use the symbols of their ritual everywhere, in their music, in their buildings in the logos of their global conglomerates. That is a level of dedication most normal people don&#39;t have. It dawned on me one day who bands together under a belief system like that and dedicate their business home and family to those rituals? Not anyone i know. I would call that a religious fanatic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they are absolutely fanatical about it! The majority of their symbolism I&#39;ve found relates to either Saturn or a cube. On the North Pole of Saturn is a spinning cube, on the South Pole what looks to me like an all seeing eye (google it if you haven&#39;t seen it already). There&#39;s old texts, cave paintings, traditional stories which say Saturn used to be close to us, and our sun even until something happened, it was bound in rings and moved away. Who knows? Also as for the black cube, it&#39;s found everywhere. Could the one in Mecca be it&#39;s point of contact on earth? I don&#39;t know? Could it be an advanced alien artificial intelligence or technology assisting in holding together an illusion/control system, I don&#39;t know? It&#39;s also interesting how in 2001: A space odyssey it revolves heavily around a black monolith, the earth creatures were happy and got along, but as soon as the monolith landed here they became separated, started fighting and killing each other as if somehow influenced by it. There&#39;s still so much mystery I&#39;m trying to work out and piece together :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post.  You know your shit!  Yes, the Anglo-Roman Cult that runs the world today is of the very same group of hybrid Draco/human Bloodline Families that became the Houses of Orsini, Breakspeare, Aldobrandini, Somaglia and Farnese and many others that trace their origins from ancient Egypt, the Priesthood of Amun-Ra and the mystery schools.  They were also likely responsible for the destruction of Atlantis, and have covered up the history and existence of the civilization itself and the advanced / exotic tech they used.</p>

Do you have any books, websites, YouTube videos that really stood out to you and openef your eyes (further) you&#39;d like to recommend? You seem quite knowledgeable on the subject and I&#39;m always looking for good sources to learn more or cross reference. Btw I also think an important group of them moved to Switzerland back in the day and are in hiding/stealth mode there, if you look at loads or the Swiss buildings in the capitol many of them have Egyptian markings/symbols built in!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. I just spent about half a year digging into this subject. I get down the rabbit hole and we reach the Dracos. The thing is, while I&#39;ve seen/heard enough evidence for Nordic/Humanoid ETs and Greys (Tall/short), I have not seen anything to support the Dracos. So all this tied up story about them being behind it all, that H.W. Bush is a reptilian, as was Clinton and (every political leader of major country) except now the Donald. Come on. </p>

<p>The patent OP references here, I looked into that, and the guy submitted them like 10 years ago and abandoned them, so they are not patents, I think bogus. Check out his other patents he abandoned. The description of how the TR3B works is not the same the alleged who leaked it out first describes, so there is a conflict. It&#39;s uncomprehensible gibberish anyway. One ufologist thinks he&#39;s a schitzophreniac.</p>

<p>So back to what conclusions I found. I found Dr Steven Greer&#39;s &quot;connect the dot&quot; arguments most clear and backed up. The whole secrecy root is the alternative energy technology and it&#39;s threat to the established monetary system. This leads further to the big global warming debate. </p>

<p>I think people have a problem that there may exist another dimension besides this one, as that enters into the paranormal and the dreaded already debunked religion area.. they can&#39;t accept that. They rather accept the Draco story. It&#39;s interesting how religious people have to face the music and accept science, but equally ineresting how science people have to face the music as well and accept that there is a paranormal/other dimension that is behind this one. They are both in denial but the more &quot;science camp people&quot; are having a harder time looks like.</p>

<p>My conclusions: global warming by man made fossil fuel burning is (one) significant factor contributing to an unnatural and dire global warming <strong>rate</strong>. The people behind keeping fossil fuels as the main energy source, are part of a kabal keeping alternative energy sources (based on human innovation and augmented by ET technology) suppressed. At the same, this same group counters the man made fossil fuel warming via geoengineering in order to help cool the planet, thus in the process polluting the air, water, and planet on both ends to keep their petrodollar macroeconomy in place. They are able to accomplish this working behind the military industrial/security complex in covert operations that are deemed national security, funded by trillions of embezzled dollars.</p>

<p>&quot;The agendas within this group (against Disclosure), are separate and competing. One would be <strong>macroeconomical</strong> control - global domination- they want the oil system, their utility systems in place, it&#39;s all about macroeconomy for those guys. Those are more of the real political folk like Papa Bush. Then we have people, as I mentioned who are <strong>epistemological</strong>. They would love to see a final battle that would happen, that would result in the end of the world, so that their Messiah, or Christ, would return. They&#39;re religious nuts. They make the Taliban look like liberals.&quot; Then you have the <strong>sociopaths</strong> - who really love endless war. They love torture. They love destruction. They&#39;re addicted to it. And I met with some of these people, they are true psychopaths. (Dick Cheney, etc). Scary characters. They you have a group who don&#39;t know how to come clean without it being the biggest scandal.. imagine we learn that we have all these technologies to replace oil. There&#39;s an inertia that this secrecy has. They just want to retire and <strong>go fishing without the trouble</strong>.&quot; -Dr. Steven Greer</p>

<p>So. Groups that want secrecy/against disclosure are:
1. Business guys
2. Religious nuts
3. Sociopaths/psychopaths
4. Don&#39;t want to rock the boat/no trouble</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never believed the ET stories myself too, but then started to think a bit further.</p>

<p>that TPTB wanted power and money seem logical too me, but the one thing i did not understand is that they are ruling and using this world like there is a spare.</p>

<p>If you had power en welth, you would like to pass it on in your family, so all the power stays with your loved ones, right?</p>

<p>Well, if they continue like this there is no world to safely live on in the future, what is the purpose of getting all that welth and power without a future for your children and grandchildren?</p>

<p>Until i discoverd the stories about the ET&#39;s i could not make sence of it all, the ET&#39;s however made some connections clear for me.
It could explain why they don&#39;t seem to give a fu.k about this planet, they might not be human or are being influenced by non human entities.</p>

<p>Maybe if the state of the world is getting worse for humanity, the world is actualy getting better for them.</p>

<p>There seem to be connections between religion, spiritualiti, history, science, humanity and ET&#39;s and to me it seems we are all in this together, we might just not be playing for the same team.</p>

<p>But real evidence is hard to find, and i believe that will change soon, but until then it is more of a gut feeling i get while i look at all the connections, but i am also still  searching for answers, just like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool we are not alone in our search. </p>

<p>So here I replied to someone who was alleging Dr Greer is doing this for the money and asking why wasn&#39;t he killed yet by TPTB.</p>

<p>&quot;If he wanted to just make money he would have stayed in the medical profession. Are you seriously arguing that he makes more money now as a ufologist with his books/movies/talks then what he would have made with his medical degree as a trauma doctor? ?</p>

<p>The other thing here you bring up, why isn&#39;t he DEAD? Good question actually. According to him two of his close associates and himself got the same very rare and aggressive cancer, and both of them died while he was able to survive, he says by doing everything he could (nutrition, mantra meditation, and bicep workout duh). So allegedly there was that murder attempt. Blowing people&#39;s brains out like JFKs is an old method, covert way may be by stealth microwave weapons according to this article: Are UFO Researchers Being Targeted With Cancer Causing Microwave Weapons?</p>

<p>I thought about this and think there may be two reasons at least. One would be that the percentage of the ruthless really evil guys in the black projects are dwindling and the younger guys are like, &quot;um I still have to live on this planet for some time, and like maybe unnatural global warming rate due to use of fossil fuels and the subsequent poisoning of planet by geoengineering in order to mask the said warming might destroy my time here on Earth despite all the embezzled money I accumulated?&quot; They realize it&#39;s going to have to come out at some point, so let Greer start the ball rolling? No one else is doing it.</p>

<p>Reason two might be that if his contact protocols are legit, then they can watch/study how he does it, to use themselves, or to use as bait to try to lure the crafts in and shoot them down. Or most optimistic view, we will need to have positive diplomatic contact with ETs and we need to be able to communicate with them at will and not by chance. Dr Greer (supposedly) provides a method.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. yeah I didn&#39;t cover that here (another subject), instead focusing on the reptilian/alien/disclosure agenda. But okay..</p>

<p>A <a href="https://xkcd.com/1732/">timeline</a> of Earth&#39;s average temperature. </p>

<p>Where is this satellite data you talk of? I&#39;m referencing NASA site below. </p>

<p>&quot;According to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by about 0.8° Celsius (1.4° Fahrenheit) since 1880. Two-thirds of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15-0.20°C per decade.&quot; <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldOfChange/decadaltemp.php">more</a></p>

<p>We know about the natural Earth&#39;s warming and cooling cycles. Thus we know about sun activity affecting weather. We know there are various natural factors for warming or cooling. That&#39;s not in question. The question is, is man made activity a significant factor and if so, to what degree. We find that going <strong>rate</strong> is not natural and <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/sea-level-rise.htm">dire</a> if it continues.</p>

<p>I would imagine the geoengineering applied in the past two decades might be masking some of the man made warming. In the process excess aluminum used to help cool the planet is causing acidification of <a href="http://www.ccmaknowledgebase.vic.gov.au/brown_book/21_Aluminium.htm#Occur">soil</a> and <a href="http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralreef-climate.html">oceans</a>, killing natural wildlife, ie. Coral reefs., fish stock.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what part of this you are not getting. We know about natural factors. But you ignore the man made factor, like it doesn&#39;t exist. Then claim that we ignore the natural factors. So fucked up. </p>

<p>There is a scientific consensus that climate is changing and that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.[32] The scientific consensus is reflected in example, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) an international body which summarizes existing science, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program.[32]
The methods used to derive the principal estimates of global surface temperature trends — HadCRUT3, NOAA and NASA/GISS — are largely independent. -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record">wiki</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked for the instruments we can use to measure climate, and I replied to a wiki link Instrumental temperature record&quot; which you totally ignored. I guess that&#39;s &quot;clickbait&quot; for stupid people because it doesn&#39;t fit with your position. Of course the science guy is a fraud who knows nothing about science nor has any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye">background in science</a>, for the mass sheep to follow. </p>

<p>One of the first things I did was research geo-engineering, if it&#39;s real, and if so how much can be done to change the climate. </p>

<p>From a logistical perspective: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s real. Geoengineering – making large-scale changes to the environment – is no longer fringe science. </p></li>
<li><p>How it works. Aerosols reflect solar radiation back into space, lowering Earth surface temperatures. They can also provide &quot;seeds&quot; around which water droplets coalesce to form clouds, thus further increasing the planet&#39;s reflectivity. The particles are fairly long-lived in the stratosphere, a stable region of the atmosphere that begins five to six miles up. This makes the idea of aerosols&#39; use as a worldwide planet-cooler fairly attractive. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The &quot;18 year satellite measurements for link with Cruz&quot;... I am just learning of this firs time, reading the wiki version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_hiatus">Global warming hiatus</a> (I can&#39;t stand Lying Ted talking). A section seems to provide an answer for Lying Ted with this explanation, apparently the President of Sierra Club didn&#39;t know, pretty bad on his part to just plead the 5th.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the issues that has been raised in the media is the view that global warming &quot;stopped in 1998&quot;. This view ignores the presence of internal climate variability. Internal climate variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the coupling between the atmosphere and ocean. An example of internal climate variability is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The El Niño in 1998 was particularly strong, possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Cooling between 2006 and 2008, for instance, was likely driven by La Niña, the opposite of El Niño conditions.The area of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures that defines La Niña conditions can push global temperatures downward, if the phenomenon is strong enough.Even accounting for the presence of internal climate variability, recent years rank among the warmest on record. For example, every year of the 2000s was warmer than the 1990 average.&quot;</p>

<p>Climategate lol Wait, don&#39;t tell me you one of those who fell for the Pizzagate too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any link for said &quot;satellite data&quot;? Because pretty much every single agency on Earth that isn&#39;t funded by oil companies agrees that the Earth is warming at an <em>alarming</em> rate. Natural climate change takes thousands or usually millions of years to occur unless some kind of catastrophe happens. We are currently seeing it happen at an extremely fast rate. It is undeniable math that if the climate continues on it&#39;s current path a majority of the planet will be 15-20 degrees hotter in about 80 years. That is not natural in the slightest. We know for a fact that is an unnatural rate of change that has never happened without something big interfering with the natural flow of things. So unless you have strong, credible sources and links for the so called &quot;satellite data&quot; that apparently contradicts dozens upon dozens of climate researching organizations, you are greatly misinformed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The man made global warming denier with his head up his ass replies with a link to Ted Cruz in senate hearing citing the satellite data to the Sierra Club President who didn&#39;t know how to answer it. I looked it up on wiki and there is a hiatus on the global temperature and I found this reply to Cruz in same questioning. Head Up His Ass Guy avoids the explanation and simply says I parrot someone else and can&#39;t think for myself. Don&#39;t even waste your time with him here.</p>

<p>Personally from my own research I concluded their is geo-engineering done in the stratosphere to mask the global warming rate. They have to deny both because if they admit the latter then they have to admit the former. The extreme weather and some masking of global temperatures from above satellites. They still can&#39;t explain the oceans which are being destroyed by acidification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These &quot;Dracos&quot; that people keep talking about are non-corporeal and genetically linked to us. </p>

<p>Within Egyptian and Hindu mythology, you&#39;ll see this motif of the divine male and female. At their root, within the realm of dream, these two persons are serpentine--shedding skins, wearing many masks. </p>

<p>In Egypt, you see&#39;ll the male and female pharaohs each wearing a head-dress from which protrudes a serpent. Together, the pharaohs bring forth the will of Ma&#39;at/Truth into the world. When Jesus spoke of Truth/Veritas in Christianity, he meant the Egyptian concept of it (being a charismatic man, he undoubtedly had syncretic beliefs, like Mani after him).</p>

<p>When you see &quot;Dracos&quot;, the TPTB are trying to conflate serpentine imagery with Satanism. The Gnostic Genesis teaches that the snake in the Garden of Eden is in fact possessed by this feminine principle that we call Ma&#39;at in Egypt, Ma in Babylon, Satya/Rta in India, and Sophia/Gnosis in Christianity. </p>

<p>If you dig into our history as a civilization (as Graham Hancock has done, connecting back to Gnosticism), you&#39;ll find yourself running into our mythical dream of Atlantis. Though Plato is the philosopher we credit for the myth, the Greeks alluded to Atlantis hundreds of years before Socrates or Plato. The Titans are spoken of as the Old Gods. All this talk of Nephilim, Seraphs, Angels, and Demons seems to confirm a historical consensus that heroic humans are possessed and aided by non-corporeal entities (encountered in our dreaming, meditating, and consuming of psychedelics). Indra is able to defeat Vrtra, the Asura Prince, once he steals Soma (an Asura) and drinks it. In Greece, the Asuras are the Titans; Indra is Zeus; and Soma is the kykeon of the Mysteries. </p>

<p>In reality, the Greeks, Jews, and Indians were racist, misogynistic, imperialistic peoples who claimed themselves superior to serpents of the past. Reconstructing the culture of the Antediluvians, we find that (at their cultural height) they had an accord with other humans and nature itself (Ma&#39;at and Ayahuasca being summaries of this); judging by the Egyptians, Sumerians, Minoans, and the pre-IE Irish, they valued women as oracles and leaders and may have even been more matriarchal than patriarchal; psychedelics kept their princes and priests thinking like philosophers, ensuring a society that was wiser and happier. </p>

<p>TLDR:
All of this Draco BS is just disinformation from a morally bankrupt empire that wants us to forget our past and accept the hell of their technocratic dystopia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The transition has been happening for a while now as has disclosure. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t make sense to people to go from a 3D reality to a 5D reality overnight because so many things would be completely outside of the realm of comprehension for most. </p>

<p>As an example, how do people who, for the most part, believe themselves to be truthful while regularly telling countless &quot;little&quot; lies they believe are harmless deal with a reality where suddenly everyone knows if the person they&#39;re speaking with is lying to them in the moment; not just a general feeling of unease or something not being right, but they would know what the other person&#39;s words actually mean as they&#39;re being spoken and/or their intent if the person&#39;s not being truthful? Add in they can hear each other&#39;s thoughts, too, and it&#39;s a recipe for disaster. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t get moved to a completely different reality and learn how it works once they get there. They start by living it here and now and making it how they experience reality; it&#39;s quite possible to be in this world without being of it, too.</p>

<p>The universe is constantly rearranging itself to give someone more of what they make real which relates to whole thought/vibration/energy thing. Give some thought to what you want your reality to be; not things that are out of your realm of control, simply the things in your immediate bubble of experiences and then look at how much of that is dictated by outside authorities rather than yourself. Toss the stuff that isn&#39;t yours into the trash and then for the things that aren&#39;t how you want them, change your mind to change up what is being experienced.</p>

<p>As for the Draco and their role in things, it&#39;s a big pill to swallow yet once the dots connect, it becomes difficult to disregard their participation. There&#39;s a lot of misinfo/disinfo out there, so if something rings as false, find new sources of info. No one has the entire truth; the onus is on us to use discernment in determining what becomes part of our own truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the beauty of a simple theorie.</p>

<p>I am still puzzeling on my theorie, but the more i got my puzzle complete, the more i could see the picture without being able to calculate it for myself. But i still could see, know and understand that it is all connected and the math behind it is pritty basic, but just over my head.</p>

<p>For instance, cosmologie and science  have invented and/ or burried so much stuff to prove the bedtime story they are promoting that some of their theories are a complicated mess and you need a lot of complicated math to understand even the simpelest parts of the theorie. And mostly all those theories are building one assumption on the other and/ or  are shaved to fit the puzzle. 
When i saw documentaries on some of these topics i could not understand the calculations behind them, even after a few explanations.</p>

<p>A good theorie however, like the electric universe for example, is simple and pritty easy to understand if you have basic knowledge.</p>

<p>I have seen a couple of documentaries over the eu., and to me it is very easy to understand. I have a average schooling and am technical skilled, but just in the middelclass (MBO for the Dutch).</p>

<p>Past 6 months i have seen many docu&#39;s on many topics and theories and a lot of them are tied to each other and once i saw those connections there was no math neccecary to understand it and i could fit big parts in my puzzle.</p>

<p>Lately i have seen a couple of math doc&#39;s and even those i can fit in my puzzle without being able to reproduce their results myself. 
The most used math in this universe is basics for the educated, it is just over my head, but after some explanation i can understand and see the use of math everywhere.</p>

<p>I am still going true the rabbithole and while falling i have seen docu&#39;s many theories and have seen the many connections and interactions with each other.
Some feel wrong to me and some seem to tell the truth. But the most are a mix and after seeing alot of these docu&#39;s i was able to filter the info and fit smaller or bigger parts in my theorie, making it more clear instead of complicated.</p>

<p>The Coralcastle is a perfect example of something i can not reproduce myself, but i think i have a pritty good basic idea of how the castle was build.
This theorie comes from watching docu&#39;s on the pyramids and many more theories, not from watching just one over the castle itself.</p>

<p>I see it as a big puzzle and, like current science, i was to focused on a few small pieces and to far zoomed in on those to see the connections with the bigger parts of the puzzle.</p>

<p>And if you zoom in to far without knowing what you are looking at, it becomes very complicated on it&#39;s own becouse you took the parts out of their evironment.</p>

<p>But when you have seen parts of the bigger puzzle and the location of the small part you were zooming in on, you can see the connections and fit big parts of the puzzle together, forming a more clear picture.</p>

<p>After that you are more able to zoom in again and becouse the picture is more clear now and now you can locate and see the smaller parts in their evironment it is much easyer to see and understand the logic behind it all without being able to calculate and/ or reproduce some of the results yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I think I completely agree with you. The guy I replied to implied that &quot;they&quot; try to discourage you from learning by pretending the math is too complicated, but in reality I&#39;ve never seen a teacher or scientist say that. Everything is learn-able, and you will often find that learning smaller parts individually is rather simple, and is fundamental in being able to piece together the bigger picture. The problem is that a lot of people are not willing to put in the time required to go through this process</p>

Mostly they are just to occupied in the ratrace and are unable notice or to distracted to look deeper.</p>

<p>Who is willing to dig deep while you are working while struggeling with all the modern problems in this world?</p>

<p>Some won&#39;t look in becouse they are to fund off and/ or distracted by their toys, and they are not willing to give those up.</p>

<p>And some of them can&#39;t cope with the consequenses some theories imply that they are happy to stick their head back in the sand.</p>

<p>It is also a lot to take in, but once you started it is difficult to give up. The first step is the hardest and i believe that, for example, the Mandela effect is part of the proces of waking more and more people up.
I also believe this is why the conspiracy reddit is getting more attention lately.</p>

<p>In order to reinforce this psy op, they have built flying saucers, drugged, abducted, and sexually abused people while wearing alien suits (read about how the Assassins used to drug people and take them to a secret palace), created fake documents, and had their CIA operatives lie to everyone.</p>

<p>Of course. Many sources confirm this. </p>

<p>But St. Paul tells us that these traditions were all corrupted by dark occultists:</p>

<p>&quot;The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness...</p>

<p>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.&quot; -Romans 1</p>

<p>There is only one tradition that has accurately carried the truth about the antediluvian world down to today:</p>

<p>&quot;The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever&quot; -Isaiah 40:8, confirmed by 1 Peter 1:24-25</p>

<p>At times, the followers of true Mystery Schools have stepped in to protect this tradition, as when the Essenes saved the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest copies of the Old Testament we have left.  The dark occultists burned Hebrew documents at Alexandria, and across &quot;Christian&quot; Europe during the Middle Ages to hide the authentication they contained.</p>

<p>The Dead Sea Scrolls prove that the Old Testament Prophets predicted the rise and fall of major empires, centuries in advance. </p>

<p>Read Daniel&#39;s prophecy of the rise of Alexander, his death at the height of power, and division of his kingdom into 4. Read the prophecies of the Messiah, born in Bethlehem, of the tribe of Judah, betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.</p>

<p>No Mystery school can predict the future centuries in advance as Daniel did. And the only &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; that are coming to save us are the Rider on the White Horse of Revelation 19.</p>

<p>But we are not there, yet. Mystery Babylon must fall first. And we must do everything in our power to bring it down; telling people to wait on the good aliens keeps them out of the fight.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters.

<p>The prostitute that sits by the waters is probably the British Empire. The adulteries is probably sex blackmail, including with kids.</p>

<p>Some people do that. I generally counsel people not to use chemicals because it&#39;s too easy to have bad things happen, but we are given all of the plants in Genesis for our use. The concern I have with DMT is it seems to be way too fast and concentrated for the purpose God has for that molecule in our brains.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit lives inside all who repent of their sins, and call out to Jesus Christ for forgiveness.</p>

<p>Once the Holy Spirit dwells inside of us, he promises to guide us, and gives everyone at least one spiritual gift. The writings of St. Paul on spiritual gifts seem to imply that we can pursue these gifts, but it&#39;s important to remember that their purpose is always to help others.</p>

<p>While I never watched The X-Files, I do get the reference. Mulder has this suspicion about his family&#39;s past and the suspicion is rooted in instinct, intuition and observation (intuitive empath). Once he gets the evidence to validate and confirm the affoementioned, he re-examines many aspects and events of his life up until that point, sees them in a different light, and sees how this &quot;hidden history&quot; is the hidden hand which molded and guided him along.</p>

<p>I can relate to this part. Just a fucked up series of events has changed me from an atheist to believing in God. 4 Near death experiences, strange dreams where my consciousness left my body, visions, etc. All of this has led me to research mystery babylon and to start studying the Bible. Never thought I&#39;d ever study or even care about the Bible, I used to think it was nonsense to control the sheep. Now here I am. </p>

I am that one Revealtiom calls the Evangelist.
I cannot write to 6 of the 7 Churches of Asia, for they were destroyed in the Armenian Genocide.
But there is one still left. So to all my brothers in sisters of humanity, who find the One, the Force of Light, be it through Christ or Muhammad, to you I say this:
The false Israelites are those you think. Israel...the anti-Christ...6 points on the flag, 6 triangles on the flag, and the Pentagon (6) within the Star of David on the flag...are those who serve the Synagogue of Satan (Babylonian Talmudism)...and you, the people of Palestine, are rightful descendants of Abraham, one of the 12 tribes, and I acknowledge your suffering.
To all those Jews who still remain loyal to their belief, here I am to tell you that soon comes the one who brings the Messianic message of salvation for all.
To all the Christians, here I am. I bring the Spirit of the Word in preparation for the return of Christ.
To the Muslims of the world, I acknowledge your suffering at the hands of the false Israelites who serve the Synagogue of Satan....and so I now say this:
&quot;I am the Evangelist of Revelation, yet also the one who acknowledges your suffering, speaks of you for redemption, and looks from the west to the east asking that you prepare to bring for the one called Al-Mahdi for when Christ/Isa returns. You know that at that time, the two will join their forces as one.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decipher this for me; I beg you.</p>

<p>Christ is not a physical being who will return.
(Disregard the above statement. It is far too definitive regardless of what I&#39;ve received from first hand sources and documents which claim Christ was either actually a physical human like, benevolent ETI who came to Earth or a man who channeled a higher consciousness. My biggest point is that humanity needs to start focusing on the Spirit of Scriptures and just get away from the man made institution of that which was never to be an institution.)
Christ returns when all of humanity unites under the principles of nature...the Light...and stops feeding these intermediary 4th Dimension forces of darkness.
The idea of &quot;The Second Coming&quot; as taught and currently understood is a trick to make humanity surrender its Free Will and surrender creation of their reality to a false belief intentionally created by Darkness in a twisting of the original teaching&#39;s intent and lesson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem with honest discussion but you&#39;re basically just calling the guy a heretic and discounting the very real and verifiable information he is posting.  Your zealotry also ignores the fact that Christianity is a heavily controlled and falsified religion created by the very same Elites we are talking about as a system of control.  If Christ existed, he was likely a normal man who was able to &#39;see through the veil&#39; of our current density and manipulate it - something we are all capable of.  Him being the literal and only Son of God is a fiction created by the Council of Nice&#39;s in 325 AD and the story of his birth and Divinity is lifted almost wholesale from paganism, sun worship and the Persian god of Mithras.  The big secret of the monotheistic religions is that they are all Luciferian in nature, or were corrupted to be such.  The truth the elites do not want you to figure out is that <em>WE</em>, the human race, <em>IS</em> Yahweh, which is essentially a social memory complex, almost like a sentient plasma, where has the majority of them are of the Luciferian social-memory complex.  This planet is a sub-Logos of our Sun, which is a sub-Logos of the Milky Way Galaxy, and so on and so forth (think about the &#39;Russian doll&#39; analogy), all parts and pieces of the same Infinite Creator.  All is One.  One is All.  Christianity and the other religions are just simplifications of this concept, pared down for human understanding.  I suggest researching The Law of One and some of the concepts of syncretism to have a better understanding of what I&#39;m talking about but I&#39;m sure you understand the picture (and likely disagree, but w/e).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly something you have to take with a grain of salt, but a lot of the concepts he talks about are very real.  The political landscape is radically different now than it was when Seth Rich was still alive as well - the cabal was firmly in control of politics in the United States government in 2016, and it can be said that they certainly are <em>not</em> now, thanks to Trump&#39;s win and the Bush-Clinton factions bring ousted (who have essentially been running the country since JFK).  If he is legitimately tied to Steve Pieczenik&#39;s white hat coup like he claims he is, I think there&#39;s something to this.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not wrong in saying that inevitably it will have to come to violence to take the power back from them, but he&#39;s not advocating for violence itself - he is telling us very simply that under Constitutional law these people are criminals and should be arrested, in under the same Constitutional law <em>it is our right to do so</em>.  However I also agree that we would need the help of the intelligence community, military and law enforcement to achieve this.  Peaceful noncompliance is the order of the day in my opinion, but we have also never faced evil like this as a species collectively in our history.  These people were billionaires by the time of Christ, have spent millennia perfecting and tweaking their plan, and power never gives up power willingly.  The Roman/Anglo/Khazarian cabal has shown they will stoop to any level of depravity and evil to retain it as well, so like he said, do people just sit on their asses and expect a Savior, or are you going to take the power back with your own hands?</p>

<p>Pope Francis is an evil bastard.  It should be incredibly concerning to anybody that an actual Jesuit is now the Pope - they have always hid behind the scenes controlling the Vatican and the Popes in secret, preferring to hide the power they wield over almost every political institution and world leader.  They are a band of murderous, evil fanatics that has been extirpated and kicked out of virtually every European nation for subversion and political crime, and having one of them as the public head of the Catholic Church fulfills their very own prophecy of Petrus Romanus - the final Pope who would preside over the destruction of Christianity and the Catholic Church.  Interesting times that we live in for sure.</p>

<p>&quot;Rather than flatly rejecting Jesus altogether based on the biblical claims about Him, then, New Agers have incorporated the figure of Christ into their occultist beliefs. And by using Christian vocabulary and loosely reappropriating Christian concepts, they have pulled the wool over the eyes of an alarming number of Christians. This strategy of deception is an age-old ploy of Satan: high-jacking God&#39;s truth by using partial truths to lure people in and ultimately to dupe them altogether. Remember that Satan “disguises himself as an angel of light” and “his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness” (2 Cor. 11:3, 14-15). In the same way, the New Age Jesus masquerades as one who will lead us to our own inner light&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y&#39;know Cooper linked the Illuminati with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the United States government, but later retracted these claims. He accused Dwight D. Eisenhower of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public.</p>

<p>And this is the &#39;space program&#39; that is now called the &quot;Secret Space Program&quot; and is apparently a non govt &#39;private&#39; group, and according to Corey Goode, it&#39;s these guys who fly the big black triangles</p>

<p>It&#39;s all beginning to piece together from all the bits and pieces and deducting the signal from the noise -- and I&#39;m beginning to thing &quot;we&quot; humans have gone a lot further into space and sooner than &#39;they&#39; have said .. for a long time! i.e. since JFK and it&#39;s just crazy!</p>

<p>Stories like this might be an eye opener for those that are not aware of things like this or at least peak their curiosity.</p>

<p>Also this is only part of the story, there are a lot of other players and their hidden secrets like Russia, Great Britain, Vatican, Secret Societies, big Corporations and of course China... the next big player in decades to come. The world i will soon be at the crossroads and hopefully with luck the right moral choice for ALL will be made by the right moral people.</p>

<p>Lara Logan: Do you also believe that UFOs have come to Earth?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: There has been and is an existing presence, an ET presence. And I spent millions and millions and millions -- I probably spent more as an individual than anybody else in the United States has ever spent on this subject.  </p>

<p>Lara Logan: Is it risky for you to say in public that you believe in UFOs and aliens?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: I don&#39;t give a damn. I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Lara Logan: You don&#39;t worry that some people will say, &quot;Did you hear that guy, he sounds like he&#39;s crazy&quot;?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Lara Logan: Why not?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: It&#39;s not gonna make a difference. It&#39;s not gonna change reality of what I know.</p>

<p>Lara Logan: Do you imagine that in our space travels we will encounter other forms of intelligent life?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: You don&#39;t have to go anywhere.</p>

<p>Lara Logan: You can find it here? Where exactly?</p>

<p>Robert Bigelow: It&#39;s just like right under people&#39;s noses. Oh my gosh. Wow.</p>

<p>The FAA confirmed to us that for years, it referred reports of UFOs and other unexplained phenomena to a company Bigelow owns. He told us he&#39;s had his own close encounters, but declined to go into detail.   </p>

<p>Robert Bigelow&#39;s quirky and he knows it, but when you have as much money as he does, no one -- not even NASA -- seems to care.</p>

Sometimes I wonder how much of this world is real, and how much is an artifact of our flawed perception. There was a recent article about creative people having a fundamentally different perception of things. I was an artist at the time, so who knows?</p>

<p>&quot;I also got access to Excel spreadsheets. One was titled &quot;Non-Terrestrial Officers.&quot; It contained names and ranks of U.S. Air Force personnel who are not registered anywhere else. It also contained information about ship-to-ship transfers, but I&#39;ve never seen the names of these ships noted anywhere else.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, just trying to piece the puzzle together for the sake of my own sanity!! Do you have any books, websites, YouTube videos that really stood out to you and openef your eyes (further) you&#39;d like to recommend? You seem quite knowledgeable on the subject and I&#39;m always looking for good sources to learn more or cross reference. Btw I also think an important group of them moved to Switzerland back in the day and are in hiding/stealth mode there, if you look at loads or the Swiss buildings in the capitol many of them have Egyptian markings/symbols built in!</p>

Also, whatever you described is not Christianity, and amounts to little more than a belittling of my faith rather than an honest discussion, which is ironic given that you espouse those values in your very recent post history.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, ill admit, I have no shortage of sins to repent. Nothing inherently evil though,  might I add. </p>

<p>As for the drugs, I totally understand what you&#39;re saying. I did have a positive experience with psilocybin once though, where it seemed to have given my brain a reset, and pulled me out of a decade long depression. It also seemed to have given me a path to head down in life. I will take your advice though, and try a more natural approach. </p>
