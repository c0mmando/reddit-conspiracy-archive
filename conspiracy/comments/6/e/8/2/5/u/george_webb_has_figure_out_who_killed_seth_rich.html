       So George Webb has done some real interesting work on corruption.  Today he posts a video naming the killer of Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew">

      <p>
       Clearly there are issues with the official Seth Rich murder investigation.  I'm just not sold that all of a sudden there's a verified middleman and two dead MS-13 shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like it's a softball being thrown out for consumption.  Shooters are dead and the middleman may not be able to be connected to the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Webb has a number of videos.  In a prior video he was talking about the missing/stolen 40 caliber FBI handgun that was taken just before Seth's murder.  The story was that the bullet removed from Seth Rich was a special law enforcement round.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to hire a middleman, who then hires two MS-13 hitmen, who steal or meet someone for a FBI gun and then those two guys get whacked.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are two distinct and separate narratives that have no reason to intertwine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he becoming a limited hangout?  His story is becoming tangled.  To call out someone by name as the murderer should be based upon evidence.  George Webb doesn't have the access necessary to make this call.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this being said, I believe Seth Rich was murdered for the DNC email leak.  Seth Rich deserves a full honest investigation into his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Webb is jumping from dot to dot, which is fine.  However, he should not be naming a killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be careful.  If we support too many theories that end up being dead ends, we risk being ignored in the end as the boy who cried wolf.

       He is incredible at research. Look at the comments on his videos, he has a lot of people crowd sourcing with him. He's even mentioned retired fbi agents have been helping him too.

       He has let it slip a few times that he receives "insider" intelligence. My hunch was that it was FBI, but today he gave a personal thanks to French Intelligence. He also thanked a bunch of other intel communities, not sure what that was about. Perhaps his working background put him in contact with some of these types a while ago... In any case, I do think that he is the spearhead of the public aspect of the Deep State War concept.

       I think that this is supposed to play out for a long time. Russia narrative has to last thru the summer, IMO. I think that the hearings will be weaponized to destroy the DNC's political clout.

       So you dont think the SR case or pizzagate will result in anyone going to prison?  You dont think the truth will be accepted by the mainstream of what we already know (that the DNC rigged the primary, that SR was the leaker, that theirs massive pizzagate abuse going on, and that SR was murdered by the DNC)

       I think that mostly this stuff (minus PG) is going to get swept up into the Russia investigations. I project many arrests, when this thing finally comes down (in just under a year and a half). The Awan brothers story will be the one that really brings the house down, though.

       So you really think Hillary will be arrested?  I am hopeful that all of this stuff will see the day of light and will be exposed but this has been such a wild ride so far, so many twists and turns and each time we get let down.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on behind the scenes right now?  Why do you envision it taking about a year and half?  What has taken them so long to move on this?

       Are they aware of all that we know?  We seem to be closing in on the answers for what happened to Seth, George named the killer today, Corsi seems to have info, KDC stuff last week etc..

       The key to a good show is to "give the people what they want."  The Deep State War narrative is a weapon of mass distraction/division, IMO. There will be big things happening in major markets over the same period (like a severe downturn in equities and securities as the Federal Reserve "normalizes" its balance sheet, which will equal a whole lotta selling). I guess that some of the individual players might be real people who are invested in the outcome of these proceedings, but the winners and losers are already chosen. In some ways, it seems like a forgone conclusion because the Globalist intel network sprung out of Mossad, essentially. In this sense, they always had the key to taking them down, if they got too out of hand. Some people might argue that this is all payback for Barry being too friendly with the Palestinians... I think that this is because we are on the path to fulfilling Albert Pike's alleged envisioning of WW3.

       No. Let's call this for what it is: he busted a case wide open that he's been working on for over 200 days, with the assistance of the French intelligence, Serbs, Russians, and the Dutch. His facts line up beautifully and he points out exactly how any law enforcement agency can follow up exactly what he laid out. Only problem is, half of the bodies that would need to do so (FBI, DC police) have been called out for their corruption. Many of them are still sitting in their chairs in a position to quash this investigation, as has been the recurring theme with the Seth Rich case.

       George Webb's story is not tangled at all. It is crystal clear for anyone who has been paying attention since day 1. It is playing out in politics as we speak (for example, with DWS and the laptop).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do, however, encourage anyone interested in this story to listen to his series. If it is difficult to jump into any particular day, then there's no time like the present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's day 219. It's happening in real time and he's trying to make his way to the Russian embassy, in spite of seeing SEIU guys in the elevator of his hotel. He needs our attention.

       I find it interesting that a hoax site managed to be the first source online to publish a Seth Rich / DNC conspiracy based on a Russian intel report. Also note the same site seems to be providing the current narrative that people like George Webb are running with again via Russian intel reports.

       I'm already fairly certain the Rich Seth conspiracy is false, I'm just working on figuring out 1) where it came from to begin with and 2) who is still driving that false narrative.

       Huh? In the last video of his that I tried to watch, he rambled on about how the US Navy was using rail guns to fire fentanyl gas  into Syria so that ISIS could kidnap children.  WTF????
      </p>
      <p>
       And this was somehow connected to "fentanyl limousines" that were used to snatch people of the street (far-fetched but not as crazy as the rail gun idea), which had something to do with Seth Rich--even though Rich was shot, not gassed.
      </p>
      <p>
       He didn't present evidence for any of this and it was almost incoherent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has he ever come up with any statement that later proved to be true? That is, something that wasn't known before he said it?

You are currently commenting on a thread about a real investigator, so you're aware they exist. And yet you still push the BS evidence angle.

       Thats because you've already decided it wasnt a conspiracy.  I suspect there is no amount of legit evidence that could persuade you otherwise.

       If you want hard physical evidence, you'll be in for quite the wait. If you want strong circumstantial evidence (with documented connections), then George Webb is the best option.

       Other than that, there's nothing i can tell you.

       There is an area that exists between hard physical evidence and circumstantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance: if any of the fabricated bits of evidence that have come to light had been real that would have certainly caused me to be suspicious of the DNC.

       So find me one single piece of GW's evidence (that he hasnt personally amended), that you can prove to be fabricated.

       Without that, you're pitting your own uninformed opinion against his vast investigation. So forgive me if im unimpressed.

       Yeah, because I don't have a reason. No one has given me one. Why would I watch 200+ videos just to see if something is there? Based on how much fake evidence is circulating I think I have more than enough reason to be skeptical.

       You are reserved without personal experience. Thats a very different thing to being reserved because of personal experience.

       You have no legitimate reason to think GW is anything like the rest of them, only your own bias. Because as you've clearly said, you havent looked at all his videos. That's predetermined bias based upon absolutely nothing. Kinda like how the right assumes that all Muslims are terrorists.

       Yeah I do have a reason. The people in this very thread are stating he hasn't provided evidence to support his claims and no one has refuted that. What I'm seeing is more of the same.

       His videos are the evidence. You havent looked at them yet. And i'm off to have dinner.

       Ps. i apologise for calling you out if you arent a democrat. I can understand why that would be very offensive.  But in my defense, from the outside (not the US) looking in, you appear to tow their party line on the subject.

       This is one thing I take issue with. Rod Wheeler never retracted anything. I do believe he is sincere with his investigation (Although he might be wrong, might be being played, or might be a total dumbass)
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a NDA with the family which prohibits him from talking to the media. He risked getting sued to come out with his statements and I do believe he felt that it was worth it. The MSM of course descended on him and discredited various strawman versions of what he was saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I'm not saying he is correct in his findings, however he has not been "debunked" as the entire media has claimed (how could they debunk something that no one outside the DC police knows?)
      </p>
      <p>
       And he has spoken a few times since the Fox story and has made comments expressing his hope that the family will let him release the report that he has put together and is so far cooperating with their request

       So you think he just made the whole thing up? Why throw away your career over something that has nothing to do with you? Fox retracted the story.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       That's the only quote we have of Rod "retracting" his story and the crucial part of the statement is in brackets. Look I'm not saying his findings are correct but the dude isn't crazy.

      <p>
       Fox retracted the story because they were getting murdered with negative press and threats of boycott.

       Also, Wheeler is trying to not get sued.

       I think he was told by the Fox 5 reporter that called him up that the information was already known and they just wanted him to act as an expert for them. It seems clear with his statement since then that he never intended to be cited as the source for the claim, and he has failed to stand behind anything he initially said.

       Im sorry but I just don't trust George Webb. He posted a video saying he secretly roots for the Mossad (cuz he's Jewish) and that seemed odd.
      </p>

       On one of his earlier videos he claimed he had all the info contained in a file in the comments, but when I clicked it there were no sources- just graphics.

       I've watched the entire series, and a lot of it feels like the disinfo technique of mixing about 20% constructed narrative into about 80% truth. I stuck around for the truth (which I think is the ratlines, blackberry, 'school play' and assorted spycraft,) but there were always red flags, like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the way he kept referring to the Seth Rich medical info as a "report" without disclosing that it was an anonymous 4Chan post. So much for transparency.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the slippage and blurring when he spoke about Muslim organizations, eg claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah were trading intel, without explaining why in the world that would be, since they are antagonists without common ideology. But I also knew he had connections to Israel, which would explain the less rational info about Hezbollah. Then he started talking about Saudis, while pointing to a photo that was clearly an Afghan tribesman. I know all Muslims are interchangeable to many US viewers, but it was as ridiculous as talking about Chinese people and pointing to an Indian as evidence. I couldn't tell if he was that ignorant, or if he was exploiting the assumed ignorance of the audience to sell his narrative.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His obsession with McCabe. McCabe was hacking his computer, deleting stuff that GW now admits he deleted himself, McCabe issued immunity deals, the way he flubbed when asked why he was sure McCabe did so, but Comey wasn't involved, etc. Not defending McCabe, but it felt fishy.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -Doxxing that Marine in the rented house, including even mentioning where he had originally come from (which is the type of info that's useful if you want to track down someone's family.)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The revelation of the killer, with such flimsy evidence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The biggest WTF?? was when he'd had a bit of wine and started saying how he wanted to return the IC to the old days, where instead of these out of control ratlines, there was just a little organ harvesting, just a little trafficking, just a little compromising people with children. What?? I expected him to post something the next morning taking it back and explaining what he really meant, but no.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Today he's been waxing nostalgic about the early IC again, and basically admitted he's affiliated with Mossad, qualifying that there are 2 Mossads, the new one involved in the milieu around Clinton, and the old one, the great Mossad that made Israel what it is today.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's it. I'm out. Still watching, but don't trust him at all.

We're just in this kind of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah open compromise right now, and I think everyone -even the Hillacrats- want to get back to this quiet network of subtle compromise and subtle ratlines and subtle organ donation.

       The entire video is interesting because he's a bit tipsy and totally exhausted and more honest than I've seen him elsewhere in the series. He says that he is a "flawed messenger" with no illusions about how he got where he is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wonder what his background is. He's pretty transparent about a lot of personal details (the hospital he was born in, where he grew up, his son's graduation, even very personal things like appreciation for sex workers. I was surprised when he first started showing his face in his videos.) but I don't think he's ever said what his real name is, or what he did for a living.

       He has given his full name, it's easy to google, and it leads to a linkedin page with his picture on it and  what he does for a living.  I won't give it here because of reddit's doxxing rules.

       I just started watching him last week, and was wondering the same thing.  He seems to have quite a bit of free time on his hands and money to spend on travel, hotels, restaurants etc.  He says some interesting stuff, but his "rooting for Mossad" made me a little suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       His videos are also kind of rambling.  I think he has a coherent vision of what he thinks is going on, but it would be nice if he would publish a summary somewhere that was a little more understandable without having to watch 500 videos.

       Yeah, I started watching when he was posting about DynCorp, and so much of the information in those was gold, but going back and trying to find the bits I want to revisit without watching every video is so difficult, with just the numbered titles. Wish I had bookmarked or taken notes or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel so torn saying anything against him, since even though I'm skeptical about his motivations, I've grown to really like the guy and am concerned about what's going on for him right now. Ambivalent, suspicious, but still rooting for him.

       I used to be super careful about privacy, so my account was tied to a temporary email and I made sure not to post any personal info., &amp; etc. Now I'm past caring, and have this tied it to an actual email, so at least I won't have to make another baby account when I invariably lose this password too, haha :)

       I saw George Webb on Tim Black's progressive news YouTube Channel. Tim Black is so far left that he voted for Jill Stein. I also recently listened to a discussion that included both HA Goodman and George Webb. HA Goodman also is so far left that he voted for Jill Stein.

       Most everyone hates the Democratic Party's corruption. It's not just idiots who like Fox News or Breitbart, it's also a LARGE portion of the left. Like the ones who know that the DNC rigged the primary to install a hated criminal as the candidate for president. Like the millions who left the party since Clinton's embarrassing defeat last year.

       The democratic party is so corrupt that it does not need anyone to smear them. I am very leery of George Webb, but I do listen to the guy. Some of what he is talking about (Awan bros...) is pretty much spot on. I have heard folks say he may not be what he appears, but still ALWAYS listen to any kind of info you can. Listen to independent journalism, MSM, and even the propaganda (a great tool in finding out the mindset of the propagandist and to hear the dirt they have on their enemies). Democrats are helplessly corrupt, same with the RNC.

       yeah, well you won't see much about the RNC here - and for a reason. Those discussions are shut down.

       How many threads have we seen here that turned out to be bullshit when it comes to seth? A lot. People talk about the MSM pushing something and then turn around and suck up to the other part of the MSM (conservative side) that is pushing a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, that is a conspiracy in and of itself (oh, and side note, I don't trust the MSM a lot either but respect some major papers who have a verifiable history over someplace like 4chan/etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       When people are racing to post the latest on this case, with no care about whether it is true or not, and when those lies get upvoted you start to get suspicious of things.

       Bullshit. I see the way you are sliding a rational desire for more integrity, transparency and honesty, and a very legitimate fight against corruption, and portraying it as irrational, personalized, aggressive and petty ("pissed off", "attack someone", "hate", "smear", "agenda", "someone you don't like".) We all deserve better than this greed and corruption masquerading as democracy. That shouldn't be partisan.

       Look at how no one wants to talk about republicans and trump around here. Net neutrality, net privacy, etc - republicans are freaking scum but they get a pass. Why? Because bots and the_donald are working hard here to prop up one old man.
      </p>
      <p>
       We literally have one party in power right now and no one is talking about that and calling them out. This is basic shit when it comes to conspiracies. When the dems were in power in 2009 people talked a lot about it (and how Obama sold out single payer, etc - and they were right to call em all out on it).

       Why on earth are republicans getting a pass right now on here when they are literally TPTB?

       I hear so often 'follow the money' and in this case we have sponsors (money) and him maybe wanting to jump the ship at fox or put on a show to make himself look like a victim to get more people tuning in.

       Make no mistake, hannity is all in for himself (not saying others aren't, am sure they are).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hannity and others have existed solely to make money and they know their audience. He isn't interested in a real investigation, he is interested in a narrative (as is his audience).

      <p>
       There is a way to do this, his way isn't the right one.

       It was in one of the hundreds of videos he's made. It would take too long to find it. But you can see there's no commercials or ads to buy anything in his videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's said in the past that he worked in the tech industry, I forget the details. Either he is self funding all of this or someone is funding him behind the scenes.  It wouldn't take much money to do what he's doing since there is no production costs involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also said that years ago, there was a Muslim kid that was framed and arrested by McCabe(now current interim director of the fbi) and the JTTF. He protested and was outspoken about it and McCabe targeted him for it and put him on a list. That's what he said his motivation was at the very beginning of the series, to help root out the corruption. Because if the corruption isn't exposed and ended, it will just continue and get worse and worse..

       I think he is retired and this is all he is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you were researching a conspiracy or something of your interests and made several videos a day on what you've found and your conclusions, you'd run into the same problems too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get why people are skeptical and people should be for any source of info. I'm a bit skeptical of his funding and motivations. But overall I think he's trying to do the right thing. But I'm open minded enough to realize I could be wrong.

       I saw the video where he named the alleged killer. Was not impressed by his "evidence". All he proved was that if it could be that person. I can agree with that, it could be, but I did not see proof at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's making bold statements though, and I appreciate that. He's alleged that some guy is a murderer, should be interesting to see if anything happens as a result of that. You can't just make allegations like that.

       If only people used your critical thinking faculties for the Seth Rich "robbery" claims [which have no evidence backing them up]. Or the Russian Collusion fairytale [also: no evidence].

       It's curious to me how people demand evidence from the alternative media, but don't demand it from the mainstream media.

       Here's what actually happens with the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Unnamed source says Trump accidentally gave info to the russians which endangered an allies IC"
      </p>
      <p>
       then, the WH puts out a statement saying
      </p>
      <p>
       "We never told the Russians who gave us the info".
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how that doesn't deny what the story actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, Trump says later that day
      </p>
      <p>
       "If I did it it wouldn't have been a big deal. I can give anyone any information I want"
      </p>
      <p>
       Which isn't the point. We know he can give information away to whoever. The point is he did it accidentally and didn't even realize it, and he gave info that our allies told us not to give away.
      </p>
      <p>
       A day later, Trump will go on twitter and all but admit to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how unnamed sources in the MSM work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how it works in conspiracyland.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm a blogger who works independently but I have a ton of super secret sources from the FBA who say Clinton is fleeing to Canada. I know I said she was being arrested a month ago, but this time it's totally happening. Smash that like button and don't forget to buy my t shirts".

       Your scenario would make sense except for one fact: The Mainstream media is dying. Every major story from the last ten years has been broken by bloggers . . . not by the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the mainstream media have an embarrassing paper trail of outright bullshit and debunked propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investigative journalism is dead in the mainstream media. The only people keeping it alive are the bloggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The independents are the ones driving the news cycle now. You have people like Mike Cernovich breaking the story about the Susan Rice unmasking scandal. He gets the scoop, the mainstream media denies it, and then two weeks later admit its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with what Wikileaks is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the independent media breaking the biggest stories, with the mainstream media crying and kicking all the way. Then the stories are verified and the MSM tries to take credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not used to disseminate information, but to suppress it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when the alternative press kept talking about Hillary's health, and the MSM denied it aggressively . . . all until video of her stroking out emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again: Mainstream media debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about their fake story about Trump removing the bust of MLK from the Oval office?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again: Mainstream media debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're delusional if you think that the bloggers aren't having an effect and that the mainstream media is breaking the "real stories". The opposite is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bloggers are busting out documents on Obama's illegal Nixonian spying on Americans and CNN's top story is: "Trump Gets Two Scoops of Ice Cream and Everybody Else Only Gets One".

       Whats a mult? So a missed keystroke and grammatical error makes me a forum spy eh? I have another theory, I just don't give a shit and had no reason to believe my post would make #1 or gain the attention of sleuth's such as yourself.

       no need for such anger, friend. I just thought it was odd that the same grammatical error occurred in two posts about the same topic. it could be a coincidence, but I don't think it was.

        a Jall

       could have  obtained such a weapon.  And why he would have used it.

       I would hire a middleman, such as the one referenced, just so that person could be the fall guy. No questions asked if a gang member does it. Also, no one would ever suspect a person involved in the government either that way. Hard to tie a gang member to a government employee, but easy to bribe, pay off, and eventually off the gang member.

       For me, the main value of George Webb''s work is that he is stirring the pot, and it might result in more intelligence coming in from more sources.  I've watched all his videos, and it looks as though he is reaching out to those who are still un-corrupted in the various security agencies in the hope that they will be encouraged to come forward with the truth.  In any case, the guy has balls of steel -- he''s messing around in some very dangerous waters.

       Most everyone hates the Democratic Party's corruption. It's not just idiots who like Fox News or Breitbart, it's also a LARGE portion of the left. Like the ones who know that the DNC rigged the primary to install a hated criminal as the candidate for president. Like the millions who left the party since Clinton's embarrassing defeat last year.

       How many threads have we seen here that turned out to be bullshit when it comes to seth? A lot. People talk about the MSM pushing something and then turn around and suck up to the other part of the MSM (conservative side) that is pushing a narrative.
      </p>

       Hell, that is a conspiracy in and of itself (oh, and side note, I don't trust the MSM a lot either but respect some major papers who have a verifiable history over someplace like 4chan/etc).

       When people are racing to post the latest on this case, with no care about whether it is true or not, and when those lies get upvoted you start to get suspicious of things.

        Rod Wheeler's now fully retracted statements

      <p>
       This is one thing I take issue with. Rod Wheeler never retracted anything. I do believe he is sincere with his investigation (Although he might be wrong, might be being played, or might be a total dumbass)
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a NDA with the family which prohibits him from talking to the media. He risked getting sued to come out with his statements and I do believe he felt that it was worth it. The MSM of course descended on him and discredited various strawman versions of what he was saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I'm not saying he is correct in his findings, however he has not been "debunked" as the entire media has claimed (how could they debunk something that no one outside the DC police knows?)
      </p>
      <p>
       And he has spoken a few times since the Fox story and has made comments expressing his hope that the family will let him release the report that he has put together and is so far cooperating with their request
