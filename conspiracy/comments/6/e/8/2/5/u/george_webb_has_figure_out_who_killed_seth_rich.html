        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So George Webb has done some real interesting work on corruption.  Today he posts a video naming the killer of Seth Rich.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrQ-wHKVi0JDWjQGcuoYnew</a></p>

<p>Clearly there are issues with the official Seth Rich murder investigation.  I&#39;m just not sold that all of a sudden there&#39;s a verified middleman and two dead MS-13 shooters.</p>

<p>I feel like it&#39;s a softball being thrown out for consumption.  Shooters are dead and the middleman may not be able to be connected to the shooting.</p>

<p>George Webb has a number of videos.  In a prior video he was talking about the missing/stolen 40 caliber FBI handgun that was taken just before Seth&#39;s murder.  The story was that the bullet removed from Seth Rich was a special law enforcement round.</p>

<p>There is no reason to hire a middleman, who then hires two MS-13 hitmen, who steal or meet someone for a FBI gun and then those two guys get whacked.</p>

<p>These are two distinct and separate narratives that have no reason to intertwine.  </p>

<p>Is he becoming a limited hangout?  His story is becoming tangled.  To call out someone by name as the murderer should be based upon evidence.  George Webb doesn&#39;t have the access necessary to make this call.</p>

<p>All this being said, I believe Seth Rich was murdered for the DNC email leak.  Seth Rich deserves a full honest investigation into his death.</p>

<p>George Webb is jumping from dot to dot, which is fine.  However, he should not be naming a killer.  </p>

<p>We should be careful.  If we support too many theories that end up being dead ends, we risk being ignored in the end as the boy who cried wolf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has let it slip a few times that he receives &quot;insider&quot; intelligence. My hunch was that it was FBI, but today he gave a personal thanks to French Intelligence.

    <div class="md"><p>The key to a good show is to &quot;give the people what they want.&quot;  The Deep State War narrative is a weapon of mass distraction/division, IMO. There will be big things happening in major markets over the same period (like a severe downturn in equities and securities as the Federal Reserve &quot;normalizes&quot; its balance sheet, which will equal a whole lotta selling). I guess that some of the individual players might be real people who are invested in the outcome of these proceedings, but the winners and losers are already chosen. In some ways, it seems like a forgone conclusion because the Globalist intel network sprung out of Mossad, essentially. In this sense, they always had the key to taking them down, if they got too out of hand. Some people might argue that this is all payback for Barry being too friendly with the Palestinians... I think that this is because we are on the path to fulfilling Albert Pike&#39;s alleged envisioning of WW3.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Let&#39;s call this for what it is: he busted a case wide open that he&#39;s been working on for over 200 days, with the assistance of the French intelligence, Serbs, Russians, and the Dutch. His facts line up beautifully and he points out exactly how any law enforcement agency can follow up exactly what he laid out. Only problem is, half of the bodies that would need to do so (FBI, DC police) have been called out for their corruption. Many of them are still sitting in their chairs in a position to quash this investigation, as has been the recurring theme with the Seth Rich case.</p>

<p>George Webb&#39;s story is not tangled at all. It is crystal clear for anyone who has been paying attention since day 1. It is playing out in politics as we speak (for example, with DWS and the laptop).</p>

<p>I do, however, encourage anyone interested in this story to listen to his series. If it is difficult to jump into any particular day, then there&#39;s no time like the present. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s day 219. It&#39;s happening in real time and he&#39;s trying to make his way to the Russian embassy, in spite of seeing SEIU guys in the elevator of his hotel. He needs our attention. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that a hoax site managed to be the first source online to publish a Seth Rich / DNC conspiracy based on a Russian intel report. Also note the same site seems to be providing the current narrative that people like George Webb are running with again via Russian intel reports. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6eayd6/the_origins_of_the_seth_rich_conspiracy_theory/">More here</a>.</p>

<p>Why do you believe that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His facts line up beautifully </p>

<p>Huh? In the last video of his that I tried to watch, he rambled on about how the US Navy was using rail guns to fire fentanyl gas  into Syria so that ISIS could kidnap children.  WTF????</p>

<p>And this was somehow connected to &quot;fentanyl limousines&quot; that were used to snatch people of the street (far-fetched but not as crazy as the rail gun idea), which had something to do with Seth Rich--even though Rich was shot, not gassed.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t present evidence for any of this and it was almost incoherent. </p>

<p>Has he ever come up with any statement that later proved to be true? That is, something that wasn&#39;t known before he said it?</p>

<p>How has he <em>earned</em> anybody&#39;s trust?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, because I don&#39;t have a reason. No one has given me one. Why would I watch 200+ videos just to see if something is there? Based on how much fake evidence is circulating I think I have more than enough reason to be skeptical.</p>

<p>Also, is that really your idea of calling someone out? All I did was state my reservations.</p>

<p>You have no legitimate reason to think GW is anything like the rest of them, only your own bias. Because as you&#39;ve clearly said, you havent looked at all his videos.

<p>Rod Wheeler&#39;s now fully retracted statements</p>

<p>This is one thing I take issue with. Rod Wheeler never retracted anything. I do believe he is sincere with his investigation (Although he might be wrong, might be being played, or might be a total dumbass)</p>

<p>He has a NDA with the family which prohibits him from talking to the media. He risked getting sued to come out with his statements and I do believe he felt that it was worth it. The MSM of course descended on him and discredited various strawman versions of what he was saying.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not saying he is correct in his findings, however he has not been &quot;debunked&quot; as the entire media has claimed (how could they debunk something that no one outside the DC police knows?)</p>

<p>And he has spoken a few times since the Fox story and has made comments expressing his hope that the family will let him release the report that he has put together and is so far cooperating with their request</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only quote we have of Rod &quot;retracting&quot; his story and the crucial part of the statement is in brackets. Look I&#39;m not saying his findings are correct but the dude isn&#39;t crazy.</p>

<p>Fox retracted the story because they were getting murdered with negative press and threats of boycott. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve watched the entire series, and a lot of it feels like the disinfo technique of mixing about 20% constructed narrative into about 80% truth. I stuck around for the truth (which I think is the ratlines, blackberry, &#39;school play&#39; and assorted spycraft,) but there were always red flags, like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the way he kept referring to the Seth Rich medical info as a &quot;report&quot; without disclosing that it was an anonymous 4Chan post. So much for transparency. </p></li>
<li><p>the slippage and blurring when he spoke about Muslim organizations, eg claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood and Hezbollah were trading intel, without explaining why in the world that would be, since they are antagonists without common ideology. But I also knew he had connections to Israel, which would explain the less rational info about Hezbollah. Then he started talking about Saudis, while pointing to a photo that was clearly an Afghan tribesman. I know all Muslims are interchangeable to many US viewers, but it was as ridiculous as talking about Chinese people and pointing to an Indian as evidence. I couldn&#39;t tell if he was that ignorant, or if he was exploiting the assumed ignorance of the audience to sell his narrative. </p></li>
<li><p>His obsession with McCabe. McCabe was hacking his computer, deleting stuff that GW now admits he deleted himself, McCabe issued immunity deals, the way he flubbed when asked why he was sure McCabe did so, but Comey wasn&#39;t involved, etc. Not defending McCabe, but it felt fishy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-Doxxing that Marine in the rented house, including even mentioning where he had originally come from (which is the type of info that&#39;s useful if you want to track down someone&#39;s family.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The revelation of the killer, with such flimsy evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>The biggest WTF?? was when he&#39;d had a bit of wine and started saying how he wanted to return the IC to the old days, where instead of these out of control ratlines, there was just a little organ harvesting, just a little trafficking, just a little compromising people with children. What?? I expected him to post something the next morning taking it back and explaining what he really meant, but no.</p></li>
<li><p>Today he&#39;s been waxing nostalgic about the early IC again, and basically admitted he&#39;s affiliated with Mossad, qualifying that there are 2 Mossads, the new one involved in the milieu around Clinton, and the old one, the great Mossad that made Israel what it is today. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it. I&#39;m out. Still watching, but don&#39;t trust him at all.</p>

<p>&quot;A quiet bridge network of drugs, and organ harvesting and child child compromise of the members is where we need to get back to. We&#39;re just in this kind of Sodom &amp; Gomorrah open compromise right now, and I think everyone -even the Hillacrats- want to get back to this quiet network of subtle compromise and subtle ratlines and subtle organ donation.

<p>The entire video is interesting because he&#39;s a bit tipsy and totally exhausted and more honest than I&#39;ve seen him elsewhere in the series. He says that he is a &quot;flawed messenger&quot; with no illusions about how he got where he is.</p>

<p>I really wonder what his background is. He&#39;s pretty transparent about a lot of personal details (the hospital he was born in, where he grew up, his son&#39;s graduation, even very personal things like appreciation for sex workers. I was surprised when he first started showing his face in his videos.) but I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever said what his real name is, or what he did for a living. </p>

He seems to have quite a bit of free time on his hands and money to spend on travel, hotels, restaurants etc.  He says some interesting stuff, but his &quot;rooting for Mossad&quot; made me a little suspicious.  </p>

<p>I feel so torn saying anything against him, since even though I&#39;m skeptical about his motivations, I&#39;ve grown to really like the guy and am concerned about what&#39;s going on for him right now. Ambivalent, suspicious, but still rooting for him.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about truth, it is about an agenda. Bernie people are pissed off (and see you post in bernie and the_donald) and they want to push an idea and attack someone they hate.</p>

<p>I never voted for Bill or Hillary, been an independent since 1984. Voted for Reagan, both bushes (but on W once, regret that) and Obama.</p>

<p>When you are just looking at a situation like this through one lens it is easy to just rush to people who tell you what you want to hear.  Just like we hear others here do with trump and the MSM.</p>

Some of what he is talking about (Awan bros...) is pretty much spot on. I have heard folks say he may not be what he appears, but still ALWAYS listen to any kind of info you can. Listen to independent journalism, MSM, and even the propaganda (a great tool in finding out the mindset of the propagandist and to hear the dirt they have on their enemies).

<p>yeah, well you won&#39;t see much about the RNC here - and for a reason. Those discussions are shut down.</p>

<p>I like real information, not the shit I have been seeing that just smears someone (DNC in this case). </p>

<p>How many threads have we seen here that turned out to be bullshit when it comes to seth? A lot. People talk about the MSM pushing something and then turn around and suck up to the other part of the MSM (conservative side) that is pushing a narrative.</p>

<p>Hell, that is a conspiracy in and of itself (oh, and side note, I don&#39;t trust the MSM a lot either but respect some major papers who have a verifiable history over someplace like 4chan/etc).</p>

<p>When people are racing to post the latest on this case, with no care about whether it is true or not, and when those lies get upvoted you start to get suspicious of things.</p>

<p>Bullshit. I see the way you are sliding a rational desire for more integrity, transparency and honesty, and a very legitimate fight against corruption, and portraying it as irrational, personalized, aggressive and petty (&quot;pissed off&quot;, &quot;attack someone&quot;, &quot;hate&quot;, &quot;smear&quot;, &quot;agenda&quot;, &quot;someone you don&#39;t like&quot;.)

<p>Look at how no one wants to talk about republicans and trump around here. Net neutrality, net privacy, etc - republicans are freaking scum but they get a pass. Why? Because bots and the_donald are working hard here to prop up one old man.</p>

<p>We literally have one party in power right now and no one is talking about that and calling them out. This is basic shit when it comes to conspiracies. When the dems were in power in 2009 people talked a lot about it (and how Obama sold out single payer, etc - and they were right to call em all out on it). </p>

<p>He&#39;s said in the past that he worked in the tech industry, I forget the details. Either he is self funding all of this or someone is funding him behind the scenes.  It wouldn&#39;t take much money to do what he&#39;s doing since there is no production costs involved. </p>

<p>He&#39;s also said that years ago, there was a Muslim kid that was framed and arrested by McCabe(now current interim director of the fbi) and the JTTF. He protested and was outspoken about it and McCabe targeted him for it and put him on a list. That&#39;s what he said his motivation was at the very beginning of the series, to help root out the corruption. Because if the corruption isn&#39;t exposed and ended, it will just continue and get worse and worse..</p>

<p>He&#39;s making bold statements though, and I appreciate that. He&#39;s alleged that some guy is a murderer, should be interesting to see if anything happens as a result of that. You can&#39;t just make allegations like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only people used your critical thinking faculties for the Seth Rich &quot;robbery&quot; claims [which have no evidence backing them up]. Or the Russian Collusion fairytale [also: no evidence].</p>

<p>It&#39;s curious to me how people demand evidence from the alternative media, but don&#39;t demand it from the mainstream media.</p>

<p>Their entire methodology is: &quot;A Hillary Clinton embed inside the Deep St---- er . . . uh . . . I mean, a unnamed former State Department official confirms that Trump rapes kittens.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what actually happens with the MSM.</p>

<p>&quot;Unnamed source says Trump accidentally gave info to the russians which endangered an allies IC&quot;</p>

<p>then, the WH puts out a statement saying</p>

<p>&quot;We never told the Russians who gave us the info&quot;.</p>

<p>Notice how that doesn&#39;t deny what the story actually is.</p>

<p>Then, Trump says later that day</p>

<p>&quot;If I did it it wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal. I can give anyone any information I want&quot;</p>

<p>Which isn&#39;t the point. We know he can give information away to whoever. The point is he did it accidentally and didn&#39;t even realize it, and he gave info that our allies told us not to give away.</p>

<p>A day later, Trump will go on twitter and all but admit to it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how unnamed sources in the MSM work.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works in conspiracyland.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m a blogger who works independently but I have a ton of super secret sources from the FBA who say Clinton is fleeing to Canada. I know I said she was being arrested a month ago, but this time it&#39;s totally happening. Smash that like button and don&#39;t forget to buy my t shirts&quot;.</p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>Crickets. Nothing happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your scenario would make sense except for one fact: The Mainstream media is dying. Every major story from the last ten years has been broken by bloggers . . . not by the mainstream media.</p>

<p>In fact, the mainstream media have an embarrassing paper trail of outright bullshit and debunked propaganda.</p>

<p>Investigative journalism is dead in the mainstream media. The only people keeping it alive are the bloggers.</p>

<p>The independents are the ones driving the news cycle now. You have people like Mike Cernovich breaking the story about the Susan Rice unmasking scandal. He gets the scoop, the mainstream media denies it, and then two weeks later admit its true.</p>

<p>Same thing with what Wikileaks is doing.</p>

<p>You have the independent media breaking the biggest stories, with the mainstream media crying and kicking all the way. Then the stories are verified and the MSM tries to take credit.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not used to disseminate information, but to suppress it.</p>

<p>Like when the alternative press kept talking about Hillary&#39;s health, and the MSM denied it aggressively . . . all until video of her stroking out emerged.</p>

<p>Once again: Mainstream media debunked.</p>

<p>Or how about their fake story about Trump removing the bust of MLK from the Oval office?</p>

<p>Once again: Mainstream media debunked.</p>

<p>You&#39;re delusional if you think that the bloggers aren&#39;t having an effect and that the mainstream media is breaking the &quot;real stories&quot;. The opposite is true.</p>

<p>The bloggers are busting out documents on Obama&#39;s illegal Nixonian spying on Americans and CNN&#39;s top story is: &quot;Trump Gets Two Scoops of Ice Cream and Everybody Else Only Gets One&quot;.</p>

<p>Rod Wheeler&#39;s now fully retracted statements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one thing I take issue with. Rod Wheeler never retracted anything. I do believe he is sincere with his investigation (Although he might be wrong, might be being played, or might be a total dumbass)</p>

<p>He has a NDA with the family which prohibits him from talking to the media. He risked getting sued to come out with his statements and I do believe he felt that it was worth it. The MSM of course descended on him and discredited various strawman versions of what he was saying.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m not saying he is correct in his findings, however he has not been &quot;debunked&quot; as the entire media has claimed (how could they debunk something that no one outside the DC police knows?)</p>

<p>And he has spoken a few times since the Fox story and has made comments expressing his hope that the family will let him release the report that he has put together and is so far cooperating with their request</p>
