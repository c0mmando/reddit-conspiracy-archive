<h1>FSA #MaT spox: coming battle against regime forces w/ Coalition support in al-#Suwayda, #Badia &amp; #EasternQalamoun</h1>

<p>Four days later this shows up:</p>

<h1>FSA #MaT spox: &quot;when it comes to fighting the regime and its foreign militias, [the coalition] is not our partner&quot; (link: <a href="http://syriadirect.org/news/us-backs-off-battling-pro-assad-forces-in-east-syrian-desert/">http://syriadirect.org/news/us-backs-off-battling-pro-assad-forces-in-east-syrian-desert/</a>) syriadirect.org/news/us-backs-…</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-south-idUSKBN18Q1R4">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-south-idUSKBN18Q1R4</a></p>

<p>From article:</p>

<p>&quot;A senior commander of a Pentagon-backed group, Maghawir al-Thawra, told Reuters a steady flow of weapons had arrived at their base near the Iraqi border since the pro-Damascus forces began deploying this month.</p>

<p>He said efforts to recruit and train local fighters from Deir al-Zor had accelerated at their garrison at Tanf, on the highway some 20 km (12 miles) from the Iraqi border.</p>

<p>&quot;The equipment and reinforcements come and go daily ... but in the last few weeks they have brought in more heavy military vehicles, TOW (missiles), and armored vehicles,&quot; he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.&quot;</p>

<p>OK..FULL STOP: He says &quot;recruit and train local fighters from Deir al-Zor.&quot;</p>

<p>Compare that to this RT news article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/385731-isis-moves-out-raqqa-deir-ezzor/">https://www.rt.com/news/385731-isis-moves-out-raqqa-deir-ezzor/</a></p>

<p>ISIS ‘essentially moved’ its Syria HQ from Raqqa to Deir ez-Zor province – report  April 23, 2017</p>

<p>So, basically it looks like they are using the Al-Tanf coalition garrison to rearm ISIS fighters that fled Raqqa. To fight the Syrian government forces. </p>

<p>They&#39;re just giving them new names when they leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In the past two years, the goal of the CIA’s mission in Syria has shifted from ousting Assad to countering the rise of extremist groups including al-Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra and the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I think that ISIS, al-Nusra and some of the other radical Islamic factions are the best positioned to capi­tal­ize on the chaos that might accompany a rapid decline of the regime,” Schiff said.</p>

<p>Even defenders of the CIA program acknowledge that moderate factions in Syria have often performed poorly and are likely to be overwhelmed in any direct showdown with the Islamic State.</p>

<p>Still, officials said U.S.-backed fighters have made significant gains in recent weeks — including the seizure of a government army base — and represent the only meaningful prospect for the United States and its allies to maintain a foothold in the country if Assad falls.</p>

<p>“This is especially true in southern Syria, where [the U.S.-backed coalition] is emerging as a significant force capable of capturing key regime bases,” the U.S. intelligence official said. “Slowly but surely, U.S. government support to the moderate opposition forces has paid off.”</p>

<p>For context to help you understand:</p>

<p>Fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have gained control of a major military base in Syria, according to multiple reports.</p>

<p>The extremist group ISIS now effectively controls all of Raqqa province, which borders Turkey and the province of Aleppo. The capital city of Raqqa has served as the group’s headquarters. </p>

<p>Tabqa air base was the last stronghold for Syrian President Bashar Assad in the Raqqa province and marks the third military base militants have recently captured. </p>

<p>Sen. John McCain made an unannounced trip to northern Syria last week to meet with U.S. forces stationed there, his office announced on Wednesday.</p>

<p>McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, went to discuss the campaign for defeating militants from the Islamic State.</p>

<p>&quot;Militants from the Islamic State&quot;.</p>

<p>We have never declared war on Syria. Therefore, we cannot officially support rebels who are fighting Syrian forces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but I am suggesting the strong possibility that the 300 ISIS &quot;bureaucrats&quot; that left Raqqa and went to Deir al Zor then went to the Al-Tanf US coalition garrison to get rearmed.</p>

<p>Think about it. They are supplying these supposedly &quot;newly trained&quot; recruits from Deir al Zor with armored vehicles, tanks, technical, serious weaponry.</p>

<p>The area has been a war zone for years. What are the chances there are still civilians of military training age still in the area that have never been in the fighting?</p>

<p>As he&#39;s at the Al-Tanf garrison arming and supposedly training them.</p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t believe any of the recruits he talks about need any training.</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re all battle-hardened ISIS veterans who escaped from Raqqa.</p>
