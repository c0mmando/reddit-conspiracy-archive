<p>It&#39;s like a ritual. Soon after being elected, they all have to do this. </p>

<p>AFAIK, none of them ever has to fly to India/China/Thailand to touch and kiss a cult symbol of buddhism, nor to Vatican to worship a symbol of christianity, nor to Mecca, nor to worship a symbol of libertarians, anarchists, Amish, hobos, whatever.</p>

<p>Why do political leaders of India, China, Africa, South America, South East Asia, not have to follow this ritual ?</p>

<p>PS : forgive my ignorance on this subject matter</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asia has long been under the control of western monarchs, Russian aristocracy is the same lineages as all of Europe, the royals in all countries are related. Cold war was just such theatre, no real conflict between us and Russia just both countries populations held in a hostage situations, erosion of freedoms and furthermore what goes out of the window when you are at &#39;war&#39;?  The constitution for one thing, the red scare was all propaganda.</p>

<p>Every country was forced to pick a side and be basically controlled from either moscow or washington or be invaded. Two world government made into a one world government is a lot easier than hundreds of countries being asked to kneel. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In 1973, Sutton published a popularized, condensed version of the sections of the forthcoming third volume relevant to military technology called National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union after which he was forced out of the Hoover Institution.[1] His conclusion from his research on the issue was that the conflicts of the Cold War were &quot;not fought to restrain communism&quot; since the United States, through financing the Soviet Union &quot;directly or indirectly armed both sides in at least Korea and Vietnam&quot; but the wars were organised in order &quot;to generate multibillion-dollar armaments contracts.&quot;[2]</p>

<p>The update to the text, The Best Enemy Money Can Buy, looked at the role of military technology transfers up to the 1980s.[3] Appendix B of that text contained the text of his 1972 testimony before Subcommittee VII of the Platform Committee of the Republican Party in which he summarized the essential aspects of his overall research:</p>

<p>“    In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet technology. Almost all — perhaps 90–95 percent — came directly or indirectly from the United States and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries have built the Soviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive construction job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been carried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance.</p>

<p>In his book Between Two Ages: America&#39;s Role in the Technetronic Era (New York: Viking Press;1970), Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote:</p>

<p>For impressive evidence of Western participation in the early phase of Soviet economic growth, see Antony C. Sutton&#39;s Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development: 1917–1930, which argues that &#39;Soviet economic development for 1917–1930 was essentially dependent on Western technological aid&#39; (p.283), and that &#39;at least 95 per cent of the industrial structure received this assistance.&#39; (p. 348).</p>

<p>Professor Richard Pipes, of Harvard, said in his book, Survival Is Not Enough: Soviet Realities and America&#39;s Future (Simon &amp; Schuster;1984):</p>

<p>In his three-volume detailed account of Soviet Purchases of Western Equipment and Technology ... Sutton comes to conclusions that are uncomfortable for many businessmen and economists. For this reason his work tends to be either dismissed out of hand as &#39;extreme&#39; or, more often, simply ignored. (p. 290) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometime around the 1960&#39;s there was a real change in america.  A subversion from within.  One that is not openly spoken about, but it quite obvious to all those who pay attention.  Israel has taken over this government.  The only thing that hasn&#39;t gone Israel&#39;s way was the recent peace deal with Iran, in which the Israeli&#39;s squealed, complained and moaned about until supplicated with a larger &quot;aid package&quot; payment by the US by Obama.  That is the reason why Obama is so vilified by the Israelis.  Netanyahu and Obama butted heads too often.  When Netanyahu came and spoke <em>uninvited</em> in front of the congress, he showed exactly who really runs things.  Our congress stood up and barked like trained seals, dozens of times.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you are that ignorant in what&#39;s really going on, in fact, you&#39;re seeing much more than most stupid americans see and should be praised for noticing that its wrong.  “In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act”.</p>

<p>Our country is a whore for Israel.  We are Israel&#39;s slave colony.  </p>

They are successful people as a whole and I honestly think it&#39;s Darwinian competition at its finest. They get to the top and the &quot;goyim&quot; are intentionally kept stupid, fat, and lazy so they stay at the bottom. You don&#39;t even have to be anti-semitic to recognize this. Notice how at least one holocaust/anti-Nazi movie comes out every year and how kids are constantly remindedo of 9/11 and the Holocaust while barely knowing anything about the genocide of Native Americans. I don&#39;t think that is a coincidence.</p>

Now people don&#39;t even question that to have a decent home one must work for over 30 years, and be a model citizen.  One must do everything they can to shine up a &quot;credit score&quot;, which is really a sign of how good a slave you&#39;ve been for the system.  Only then can you <em>maybe</em> have a small bit of security, and a tiny piece of the now almost impossible american dream.</p>

To truly understand the meaning of Israel you need to go back and research its creation, who founded it, etc.  This is not some situation where over time they crept into US politics, US was there from the beginning pledging support and alliance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re forgetting the Federal Reserve. Rothschild owns the Fed, and the entire country of Israel. The Fed is where the government gets most of it&#39;s money, who else would &quot;loan&quot; our gov <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">20 trillion dollars?</a> Why do you think the gov can spend way more money every year than it receives from tax revenue? The Fed creates it out of thin air. When the US gives Israel a boatload of money every year for defense, we&#39;re laundering the money created by the Federal Reserve bank that they(Rothschild) own and giving it back to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a non-christian, non-jew heathen, I did the same thing. You go out into the plaza after going through a slew of metal detectors and body searches. You are given a yarmulke or kippah. You must wear it. Then, if you are so inclined, you may write a prayer on a piece of paper and insert it into the cracks of the wall. I did all of these things because I was in Israel and it would have been a waste not to experience it. Likewise, I wrote a damned good prayer and if anyone is listenening, I did my best.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange said it better than i could ever in a recent article; </p>

<p>&quot;Russian actions on its own doorstep in Eastern Europe do not in fact threaten the United States or any actual vital interest. Nor does Moscow threaten the U.S. through its intervention on behalf of the Syrian government in the Middle East. That Russia is described incessantly as a threat in those areas is largely a contrivance arranged by the media, the Democratic and Republican National Committees and by the White House. Candidate Donald Trump appeared to recognize that fact before he began listening to Michael Flynn, who has a rather different view. Hopefully the old Trump will prevail,there is, however, another country that has interfered in U.S. elections, has endangered Americans living or working overseas and has corrupted America’s legislative and executive branches. It has exploited that corruption to initiate legislation favorable to itself, has promoted unnecessary and unwinnable wars and has stolen American technology and military secrets. Its ready access to the mainstream media to spread its own propaganda provides it with cover for its actions and it accomplishes all that and more through the agency of a powerful and well-funded domestic lobby that oddly is not subject to the accountability afforded by the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) of 1938 even though it manifestly works on behalf of a foreign government. That country is, of course, Israel&quot; Said Assange.</p>
