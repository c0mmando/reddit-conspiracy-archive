<p>This sub actually used to care about sourcing nearly everything, now you can be downvoted for providing a source, or even asking for one. It feels like i&#39;m going utterly insane when i spend time here, this is the real conspiracy - we&#39;ve gone from evidence based circlejerking to wish fulfillment circlejerking and no one is talking about it, anyone who mentions it get&#39;s downvoted and you just continue on as if it&#39;s always been like this.</p>
