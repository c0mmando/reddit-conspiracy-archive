<a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3004.html">http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3004.html</a></p>

<p>From a quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25.</p>

<p>An international team of 32 authors from 24 institutions in eight countries led the effort, which involved using satellite data from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer instruments to help determine the leaf area index, or amount of leaf cover, over the planet’s vegetated regions. The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States.</p>

<p><strong>Results showed that carbon dioxide fertilization explains 70 percent of the greening effect</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>isms are religions. Your belief that CO2, which comprises .05% of the total mass of the atmosphere, is the primary vector of it&#39;s heating is not scientific at all. In the sciences of physics and chemistry, the transfer of heat is <em>directly related to mass.</em> <em>Always.</em> The fact that you immediately pointed to the number of people who corroborate your beliefs is also quite religious in appearance.

    <div class="md"><p>The temperature difference between the interior of white and black cars is negligible... This is because the <em>transfer</em> of heat is related to the mass of objects giving and receiving warmth. A good description of the phenomenon can be found <a href="http://www.tom-morrow-land.com/tests/cartemp/">here</a>...

<p>But CO2&#39;s effect on temps is not due to heat transfer. It&#39;s due to heat trapping - you know, the greenhouse effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Warming trends are related to mass, as well as many other factors. In this case the ability to absorb thermal infrared radiation is pretty important, which CO2 does quite well. 400 ppm of carbon dioxide or ~ 0.04% of the atmosphere is still a substantial amount of gas, so I am not sure what your argument is. If we are putting more stuff in the air that does a good job of absorbing the infrared radiation coming off of the earth&#39;s surface, than one can naturally expect that the earth&#39;s atmosphere will rise in temperature with the shifting radiation budget. Skepticism is fun and often important, but please apply that same level of scrutiny to your own views, as you apply to others. And yes, a lot of uninformed people treat science as the gospel in some ways, despite their lack of familiarity with the principles and topics, but that should reflect on those individuals and not the legitimacy of the works being discussed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your response better than the pornbot&#39;s, but the reality is that water vapor is the most powerful of all the greenhouse gases, and it is multiples of times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2... beyond that, it is also many times more abundant in the atmosphere than CO2... The problem with this truth, of course, is that water vapor is not useful for taxing developing countries through increased petroleum prices. The global economic slowdown is actually <em>decreasing</em> petroleum consumption around the world, but go ahead and grab a sign if it makes you feel better. My whole point was that people treat <em>consensus</em> as scientific truth, which it obviously is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water vapor and albedo effects are really important, I am not going to deny that and think you are right there. But reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions is something humans could tangibly do, whereas water vapor concentrations are largely out of our control.</p>

<p>Consensus does not always equate to scientific truth, but it often does align and this case there is a lot more evidence to support the hypothesis, than there is against it. And why fight this in the first place? We are going to have to abandon petroleum fuels at some point in the future, why not work towards it now? Even if there were only a slight chance that global warming is primarily due to anthropogenic emissions, there are such huge consequences that it would be naive and short-sighted to not try to change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In normal, natural caused climate change. That&#39;s why the drastic changes we are experiencing now are so alarming. </p>

<p>Even so, it&#39;s a much narrower time gap. The time difference is mostly due to the bubbles rising in the ice slowly over time, meaning older CO2 rises into younger ice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The wide margin of error in the EPICA core data is due to the way air gets trapped in layers of ice. Snowpack becomes progressively denser from the surface down to around 100 meters, where it forms solid ice. Scientists use air trapped in the ice to determine the CO2 levels of past climates, whereas they use the ice itself to determine temperature. But because air diffuses rapidly through the ice pack, those air bubbles are younger than the ice surrounding them. This means that in places with little snowfall—like the Dome C ice core—the age difference between gas and ice can be thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Dr. Spencer.</p>

<p><strong>Are Global Temperatures Rising Now?</strong> There is no way to know, because natural year-to-year variability in global temperature is so large, with warming and cooling occurring all the time. What we can say is that surface and lower atmospheric temperature have risen in the last 30 to 50 years, with most of that warming in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the magnitude of recent warming is somewhat uncertain, due to problems in making long-term temperature measurements with thermometers without those measurements being corrupted by a variety of non-climate effects. But there is no way to know if temperatures are continuing to rise now…we only see warming (or cooling) in the rearview mirror, when we look back in time.</p>

<p><strong>Is Atmospheric CO2 Increasing?</strong> Yes, and most strongly in the last 50 years…which is why “most” climate researchers think the CO2 rise is the cause of the warming. Our site measurements of CO2 increase from around the world are possibly the most accurate long-term, climate-related, measurements in existence.</p>

<p><strong>Is Increasing CO2 Even Capable of Causing Warming?</strong> There are some very intelligent people out there who claim that adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere can’t cause warming anyway. They claim things like, “the atmospheric CO2 absorption bands are already saturated”, or something else very technical. [And for those more technically-minded persons, yes, I agree that the effective radiating temperature of the Earth in the infrared is determined by how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth. But that doesn’t mean the lower atmosphere cannot warm from adding more greenhouse gases, because at the same time they also cool the upper atmosphere]. While it is true that most of the CO2-caused warming in the atmosphere was there before humans ever started burning coal and driving SUVs, this is all taken into account by computerized climate models that predict global warming. Adding more “should” cause warming, with the magnitude of that warming being the real question. But I’m still open to the possibility that a major error has been made on this fundamental point. Stranger things have happened in science before.</p>

Khilyuk</em>:  &quot;<a href="http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?139430-Profs-Chilingar-and-Khilyuk-warn-Leaders-about-Global-Warming">Science Secretary of Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (US Branch)</a>&quot; but - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Natural_Sciences">The Russian Academy of Natural Sciences does not have any association with the Russian Academy of Sciences and is criticized for the fact that many of its members do not have any scientific credentials and some of them peddle pseudoscience</a>.  Does this matter that Khilyuk is not a scientist? How about the fact that the president of this institution known for peddling pseudocience was .... <a href="http://pwp4.pintdev.com/sites/40141_civilenvironmentalengineering1152302600/assets/024/84630.pdf">G.V. Chilinagr</a>. So it appears he is not only is Khilyuk not a scientist, just some dude who Chilingar hired. I wonder what their relationship is. Interesting. Let&#39;s continue....</p>

<p><em>O. G. Sorokhtin</em>: <a href="https://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/oleg-sorokhtin-the-adiabatic-theory-of-greenhouse-effect/">a graduate of the Leningrad Mining Institute in 1951</a> - so a civil engineer of some sort. </p>

<p>So a coal engineer, a civil engineer, and a Science secretary wrote this paper. None of them climate scientists - ok. But let&#39;s not have that disqualify the paper off the bat - let&#39;s now review the paper and the journal</p>

<p><strong>Journal:</strong> Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;amp;journalCode=ueso20">Founding Editor: George Chilingar</a> </p>

<p>He published in his own Journal. And who&#39;s on the board? Filled with guys like this &quot;Dr. Nour Shafik El-Gendy - Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute (EPRI), Cairo, Egypt&quot; </p>

<p>Ok - continuing</p>

<p><a href="http://www.drjamesspeight.qpg.com/page3.html">Editor in Chief: Dr. James G. Speight</a> lists on his resume &quot;Exxon Research and Engineering Company&quot; </p>

<p>Continuing. </p>

<p>The journal <em>claims</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The journal is peer reviewed by international experts in the scientific and engineering areas that are relevant to the subject matter of the manuscript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true.  Someone wrote a critique of what Chilingar wrote </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://wah-realitycheck.blogspot.com/2008/09/khilyuk-and-chilingar.html">I found this article, because Environmental Geology (EG) sometimes has papers about groundwater that may be useful for me. As I read it, I was shocked about the complete nonsense that it contained - .... </a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And noted that no peer-review was done in their paper.  So what about the type of journal? Let&#39;s review the current articles: </p>

<p>Latest articles: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Prediction of grinding behavior of low-grade <strong>coal</strong> based on its moisture loss by neural networks</p></li>
<li><p>Effects of high-temperature zones of <strong>coal</strong> in large silos</p></li>
<li><p>Relationship between trace elements and macerals in Huanglong Jurassic <strong>coal</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Interaction of fine, medium, and coarse particles in <strong>coal</strong> fines flotation </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So this Journal is basically a geology/coal/groundwater journal </p>

<p>Now does this mean Chilingar&#39;s paper is bad? No - let&#39;s continue ... </p>

<p>So in a review of the paper, it&#39;s SO bad that the earth would be a frozen ice ball according to Chiligar. You can see a devastating critique of his  <a href="http://rabett.blogspot.com/2008/08/life-is-too-short-to-occupy-oneself_21.html">adiabatic theory of heating the earth</a>.  Chilingar basically ignores the basics of gravity and messes up the basics of EM radiation and absorption (Not a field he&#39;s an expert in, in Chilingar&#39;s defense) </p>

<p>OK so TLDR time: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Chilingar (a petrolium/coal engineer) founded a Geology Journal </p></li>
<li><p>Was president of The Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (known for members pushing pseudoscience and not associated with The Russian Academy of Sciences) and hired a &quot;Science Secretary&quot; as a co-author. </p></li>
<li><p>They published a paper with a civil engineer in this journal Chilingar founded </p></li>
<li><p>No peer review or fact checking done as tested</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So this fails the test: Not scientists, not a peer-reviewed fact-checked science journal, and we see this in the devastating take down of the failure of basic physics in Chilingar&#39;s paper. </p>

<p>But kudo&#39;s to you for finding the closest one so far!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lindzen, R. S., Can increasing carbon dioxide cause climate change?, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., Vol 94, no 16, 1997</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this paper the author looks at whether increases in CO2 will cause the predicted climate change. From the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The realistic physical functioning of the greenhouse effect is reviewed, and the role of dynamic transport and water vapor is identified. Model errors and uncertainties are quantitatively compared with the forcing due to doubling CO2, and they are shown to be too large for reliable model evaluations of climate sensitivities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the conclusion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indirect estimates, based on response to volcanos, suggest sensitivity may be as small as 0.3–0.5°C for a doubling of CO2, which is well within the range of natural variability. This is not to suggest that such change cannot be detected; rather, it is a statement that the anticipated change is well within the range of what the earth regularly deals with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e., We cannot determine whether increased CO2 causes warming or is caused by natural processes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is increasing, and yes it will cause a bunch of problems.</p>

<p>If the oceans die, we lose about 1/3 of the populations food supply (possibly more), and if algae is unable to survive we will see a major dip in our oxygen supply, and slower co2 to oxygen conversion. It won&#39;t be the end of humanity, but it will thin the herd.</p>

<p>See how short inter-glacial periods are in comparison? If anything we should be trying to increase the temperature in anticipation for the possible 2-10 degree drop of a glacial period. </p>

<p>Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today&#39;s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles.</p>

History of Atmospheric CO2 through geological time (past 550 million years: from Berner, Science, 1997). The parameter RCO2 is defined as the ratio of the mass of CO2 in the atmosphere at some time in the past to that at present (with a pre-industrial value of 300 parts per million). The heavier line joining small squares represents the best estimate of past atmospheric CO2 levels based on geochemical modeling and updated to have the effect of land plants on weathering introduced 380 to 350 million years ago. The shaded area encloses the approximate range of error of the modeling based on sensitivity analysis. Vertical bars represent independent estimates of CO2 level based on the study of ancient soils.</p>

<p>I think that sounds about right. And this net flux accounts for nearly all of the measured rise in CO2.

</blockquote>

<p>Good question. </p>

<p>1) Equilibrium: It takes hundreds of thousands (to millions) of years to come to a new equilibrium once a major CO2 altering event has happened.</p>

<p>2) Why Ups and downs: Major CO2 altering events have happened like massive asteroids, worldwide massive extinction events, massive and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJ6Z04VJDco&amp;amp;list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP&amp;amp;index=29">worldwide volcano activities to bring the earth out of it&#39;s ice-ball phase.</a>. </p>

<p>3) Since we can measure CO2&#39;s warming effect caused in the past we can expect the CO2 released by humans to have the same effect as the CO2 released back then (although we have to note that the sun is 4% more powerful today than it was back then so the warming effect will be much larger). </p>

<p>Not my bucket analogy. Your bucket analogy. A very good one too.  I agreed with you on that one. </p>

<p>No need for perfect equilibrium. Just that one existed at time=X where the water level of the bucket changed slowly relative to the height of the bucket. To go to the Earth ... there was an equilibrium where the earth was a giant ice ball, but then massive and worldwide volcanoes spiked CO2 and the earth warmed up. Then a new equilibrium eventually happened and then ..... another event (there was a giant asteroid, massive extinction events, etc.)  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Ok I was confused by you using &quot;negative feedbacks.&quot; Apologies for the confusion. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s see if I can restate: </p>

<p>Humans add X tons of CO2
Nature adds Y tons of CO2
Nature removes Z tons of CO2. </p>

<p>You want evidence that Y-Z is negligible relative to X. Right? Or that (Measured Increases of CO2) = X + Y - Z. </p>

<p>Ok - let&#39;s look at <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_one_year.png">one year of the Keeling Curve.</a> See the down in Oct/Nov and up May/June? That&#39;s because there&#39;s more land in the northern hemisphere and that&#39;s the increased uptake of CO2 by trees in summer in the northern hemisphere. So if X was 0 and the system was roughly in equilibrium every year, you&#39;d get that same &quot;breathing&quot; in and out of the Earth. So yes - nature releases a lot of carbon into the atmosphere and then it also removes nearly all the CO2 that it put into it over that same year. </p>

<p>But look at that &quot;tiny&quot; rise from June to June. That rise is <strong>measurable.</strong> Although it seems that this &quot;tiny&quot; bit is insignificant, over the years it has added up. Let&#39;s <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/wp-content/plugins/sio-bluemoon/graphs/mlo_full_record.png">look at the full record measured at Mauna Loa</a>. This is exactly equivalent to your excellent observation that </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/xeJVs">Sure if you got a bucket in perfect equilibrium and somebody adds a cup of water a day, then it will fill up.</a></p>

<p>We are measuring that &quot;rise in the bucket.&quot; Since we can measure it, let&#39;s make this more precise now with the science.  </p>

<p>The output of humans (X) is measurable (measuring isotopes signatures from fossil fuel burning which is different than signatures from volcanoes, fires, animals breathing) and also by measuring actual emissions at coal plants, and measuring energy output from plants, etc. There are lots of ways to cross check this measurement and they all give a consistent value. </p>

<p>So all we have to do show that what is measured for humans (X) and see if that matches what&#39;s measured in the increase from the June-to-June in CO2 rise (or over longer periods).  <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2017/04/Mauna-Loa-CO2-rev.jpg">It does.</a> <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/human-contribution-to-gw-faq.html">source</a>. The source link goes into more detail about how we know it&#39;s not the ocean and temperature  - but the key part is the measurements which show that the rise in CO2 we measure is from humans. </p>

<p>So there you have it. Equilibrium, measured rise, measured output from humans. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>1) Humans&#39; CO2 contributions is not compound interest. We measure how much humans&#39; produce and <a href="https://skepticalscience.com/human-co2-smaller-than-natural-emissions.htm">so if you have 29 Gigatons from humans vs 790 from natural sources</a>. So that&#39;s  3.7%. That doesn&#39;t mean that the amount released next year will be 3.7% more. </p>

<p>2) It&#39;s not a 1:1 relation between what&#39;s released and what goes into the atmospheric CO2 ppm value.  Another supporting fact that humans are the cause of the increase in CO2 is that much of that released carbon has gone into the ocean and causing ocean acidification. So you&#39;ve got some going into the air but some also being driven into the ocean. </p>

<p>Cool. How about instead of &quot;only&quot; we say &quot;nearly all?&quot;  Dr. Spencer agrees with that statement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is CO2 the driver of climate? No.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well I&#39;d agree with that too!  CO2 is not <strong>the</strong> driver, there are others. The scientific evidence shows that if you just look at <em>only</em> CO2 it&#39;s not a perfect correlation between climate and CO2. Also if you look at just the sun it&#39;s not a perfect correlation between the sun and CO2 .... but when combine BOTH Solar <strong>and</strong> CO2 then the correlation is excellent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is higher CO2 detrimental to the planet? Looks like no. </p>

<p>A good topic to discuss too - let&#39;s do so after we close off the &quot;Are humans the source of nearly all the CO2 added recently?&quot; topic. </p>

<p>If they  cared about greenhouse effect how come sulfur-hexaflouride is being ignored despite being much much worse for Greenhouse effect? How come companies can release a massive amount of greenhouse gases but we are worrying about Carbon?</p>

<p>*Earliest start since 1938</p>

<p>*Record for earliest formation of 3rd and 4th storm</p>

<p>*Tied (with 2012) for most active season before July</p>

<p>*Includes southernmost Category 5 on record, and the first since 2007.</p>

<p>*First hurricane in 20 years to cross Central America into the Eastern Pacific Basin.</p>

<p>2016 was VERY active for hurricanes.</p>

<p>Second link is also old data. Wildfires in the US have been getting larger and burning more land. The <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm">source</a> for this one is the source in the link you posted. It clearly shows that fire are not at all time lows as your link claims.</p>

<p>Your third link is also old data (only goes up to 2012). Droughts are in fact getting worse and more extreme. <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/significantfigures/index.php/2016/04/27/global-droughts-a-bad-year/">Source</a></p>

<p>As for your last link, I don&#39;t see the point you&#39;re trying to make. Are you saying we shouldnt care about climate change in America since some wildfires are emitting more CO2 than us? That doesnt make any sense.</p>

<p>Anyway next time please check your sources and data before you so flippantly dismiss &quot;science indeed&quot;.</p>

<p>Even with this type of shenanigans there is no doubt that the climate is changing.  The ability of humans to effect the climate is where we disagree.</p>

<p>I expect that the study of solar flares being done now will show that climate models are so often wrong because they didn&#39;t account for the sun&#39;s effect on the climate.  The other glaring problem is sample size.  The rate of change so often cited by &quot;Science Guys&quot; is also shaky.  </p>

<p>We need equal funding for differing opinions regarding the climate because the difference between alarmist study funding and skeptics funding are insane.</p>

<p>Along with adding insulation (CO2) to the atmosphere there are other effects. Ocean Acidification, increased heat at night, changing from temperate rainfall patterns to monsoon style. The net effect is that it is showing a measured decrease in crop yields per acre. And this you&#39;ll find in actual science papers, not the hyped media stuff you like to quote. </p>

<p>&quot;What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin.

<p>Find the scientist who published in a peer-reviewed, fact-checked journal were they called CO2 a deadly poison. I bet you can&#39;t, just like you couldn&#39;t find Lindzen&#39;s quote and admitted he was wrong there too. I&#39;d stop quoting the guy you can&#39;t defend if I were you. </p>
