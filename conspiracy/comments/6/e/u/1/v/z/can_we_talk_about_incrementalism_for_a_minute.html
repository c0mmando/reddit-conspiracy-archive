       The globalists know that any MAJOR change in policy would be immediately rejected by the masses. All great dictatorships and totalitarian states knew this...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, TPTB are very skilled at inching us toward a New World Order with stealth and distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       authoritarian Bills and important executive orders regarding civil liberties like the NDAA and the Patriot Act are signed before/during/after major sporting events,holidays, and high rated tv programs. There is always a bullshit "pretext" or reasoning for the signing of these bills and propositions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phony and made up "terrorism" boogeyman seems to be their most recent social hysteria they are using against us, along with "War on Drugs" and the "Russia" scare...These social hysterias are used by the state, as an excuse to start taking away our basic freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are usurping our constitution and eroding our freedoms under the guise of "protecting us".
      </p>
      <p>
       They key is, they do things in
       <strong>
        Increments
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The March toward tyranny and the militarization of police isn't done swiftly. People would REJECT a major change like that. TPTB understand this, our psychology. These things are done
       <em>
        SLOWLY
       </em>
       over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they distract us with the usual television shows, mainstream media narratives, staged events, left right paradigm, divide and conquer politics, and racial issues as they always do.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS is how they "lull" us into this little trance. Everyone's working 9-5, busy all day, working several jobs, bills and taxes to pay and kids to feed. We're all too busy to keep up with the current events. This is done by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       This slow incremental March towards a tyrannical World Government is what's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware of
       <strong>
        "Incrementalism"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Together we can reverse this artificial world these people have forced upon us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stick together.

       "Erosion" really is a great word for it.

       We're likely nearing the end game. Things seem to be really lining up.

       Here's hoping we can get out of this somehow, or that it won't be quite as bad as we think.

       Right.

       Only they know what the plan is. We can only react. However, there are way more of us than them. And we know their general strategy of divide and conquer, staged events, media manipulation.

       With so much of our media inspiring "revolution", who's to say that there isn't someone on our side? Getting people desensitized to fighting for our rights. Or possibly getting us desensitized to killing family and friends in a bogus civil war.

       This movie never got the attention it deserved/s:

       Overly publicized facts are fabrications drilled into the many to distort actual reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone not see that social media is one of their tools to distract people?  To desensitize young minds from caring or even realizing much of what's going on in the world, not even the force-fed deceptions by the media?  People's success is literally measured by their number of followers; so one can only imagine how low people will continue to go year after year to gain global attention within a single medium.  This is what the majority of young people either strive for or idolize, oblivious of anything with substance.  Skewed reality is quickly taking over the younger generations.

       I really just wanted to note the movie, but my digits took over.

       If you want proof of incrementalism and it's effectiveness, imagine what would happen if 18 years ago the government announce they were going to spy on every single person without a warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government would have probably been overthrown. Today, it's common knowledge and business as usual.

       This is why people don't trust new accounts.  Legit or not, the ignorance is used as cover for those who truely want to keep people ignorant and asking the wrong questions.
