       That seems to be the early talking point with no credence whatsoever. For anybody to say these are all old files less than two hours after being released are either an actual robot such as IBMs Watson or are full of bs.

       Either that or they ran a diff on the files and could see that they were the same extracted ones from the Guccifer 2.0 7z torrent, but were re-archived into a zip file.

       I think if there is anything new then that's the most likely possibility. As in a lot of the same DNC emails, but a little bit more than what we saw with "Guccifer 2.0". I've always had the thought that Guccifer 2.0 was a fake hack when the DNC first tried to cover it all up. They got intel along the way that there was a leak within the DNC, possibly multiple, from a bunch of pissed off Bernie supporters. They possibly unmasked some of these people, such as Seth Rich and Gavin Mcfadyen. Both who ended up dead before the election was over. And we now know that the DNC was not against unmasking even Donald Trump and his campaign. Whose to say they didn't unmask the lesser known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other pissed off Bernie supporters instead went for a lawsuit, which is where I believe Shawn Lucas comes into the picture with him serving the DNC with a
       <a href="https://youtu.be/D3FMgZruOXE">
        Lawsuit.
       </a>
       Now why would a class action lawsuit already be drawn up at the end of June? There's definitely reason to believe that there might have been correspondence between the DNC leakers and Bernie supporters within the DNC. I mean they rigged their primary after all and supporters of Bernie have every right to be angry. The DNC had a mess on their hands and the way Shawn Lucas publicized the lawsuit, must have pissed off a ton of people. The DNC is still trying to hide the lawsuit to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my working theory for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that George Webb is not a conservative at all, at least that's the vibe I'm getting from him. He also has mentioned that he at some point worked with Wikileaks early on, way before all this so he has an inkling of how the data is passed around.

       Here's a theory - the donald wants this pushed out and the bots are helping that here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Simple. If you repeat something enough people will simply believe it. And most people don't have the time to read through everything. so push a headline that says what you want people to believe, keep pushing, give it a break, push it again. Then add more - the threads here being dnc/dem bashing truth or not.

       Yeah this one is so obvious, I see them everywhere pushing the same MSM narrative. It's kind of hilariously idiotic that they come to a conspiracy forum where most legitimate users know for a fact that the MSM lies constantly to push narratives, then try to push the same narrative. Once you've woken up to the illusion the same old tricks can't fool you anymore. Just seems like a waste of money and energy to do that shit here where many see straight through it. Anyways, good day!

       It's not necessarily geared toward the everyday conspiracy guys. It's for those who are curious, but have not got to the same point of breaking the MSM illusion that not all that's being said is true. They are easier to herd back into the same mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that set me on the path of seeing through the MSM, is seeing what other countries are saying. To believe that only truth comes from America is short-sighted. You'd be surprised how some world events are covered very differently than they are here. You'd also be surprised what American media doesn't even discuss in world politics (like South Korea's own occult scandal).
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppression and manipulation of facts seems to be American media's bread and butter.

       I am currently trying to determine the same. I did not download the files. I am just trying to summarize what has been suggested and hopefully more people can weigh in.

       I can't argue with anything you've said. I agree. However I don't feel comfortable potentially compromising my devices as I can't easily replace them financially at this time.

       I want to at least give it a day to play out before I explore possibly doing my own verification.

       You didn't read the files, but you've formulated opinions and a theory behind them, and you're waiting for some posts on a public forum or clickbait article to be posted to confirm this theory, because those who will confirm anything definitely read through the files and wouldn't have any reason to be misleading/bullshitting?

       Sounds about right. I kept telling them to look for themselves, but they George Webb supporters either don't see smart enough to check anything themselves or they know his content is take and they are Watson bots trying to spread disinformation in an attempt to help Trump's campaign.

       I honestly have no idea what could happen. I don't know if George Webb and these other people are spooks or not. I don't know what kind of files could potentially make their way into my computer. I don't know how it works. I was hoping someone else with more knowledge and experience with this stuff could help out.
