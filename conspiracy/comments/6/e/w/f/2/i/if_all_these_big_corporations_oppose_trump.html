<p>I think you found the answer. Trump is gonna whip out new technologies when there&#39;s nothing left in the way. If he&#39;s willing to negotiate to help the planet but refuses this deal, it&#39;s based from the ground up on shit.</p>

<p>Other two topics could be debated for hours, they&#39;re very controversial topics, and using &quot;you made it more polluted so we have to do less&quot; isnt a good start to a peaceful agreement, considering a whole new population of people are in both areas.</p>

<p>So it makes me wonder if these countries will attempt to negotiate with the US, make a &quot;concession&quot; if you will to gain our cooperation as well.  There&#39;s no good being the shining light of democracy if the light is shining over ruins.  </p>

<p>Sorry that is exactly has been done since the days of European colonization. </p>

<p>And what has been done via the World Bank and the U.S. Military on behalf of our wealthiest since the assassination of Allende in Chile and included returning all the Central American nations to Banana Republic Status and now Mexico as well as Haiti, the Philippines, and a very long list of developing nations whose status was changed during the 80s from developing democracies to developing economies, developing economies being a clever name for the theft of their resources and the oppression of the populations. </p>

<p>Because if that scenario was between two people, it would incredibly logical, you took it, give it back.

<p>I believe that having a few extremely strong countries could push science to such extremes all of these questions would be questions of the past.  If the playing field was leveled, it would be extremely difficult for anyone in any country to have access to high level technologies because we simply aren&#39;t advanced enough yet to sustain that.

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone working to slow global warming is pushing for leveling the playing field. And I have to guess you mean the economic playing field.

<p>Because the people who accuse the globalists of this are called nut cases, because it &quot;isn&#39;t true.&quot; We are literally selling the stabbing our nation and selling the wealth (of the middle class not the rich) so other countries can catch up because white privilege stopped them. White people succeed first so they need to pay reparations. hey need to be impoverished to pay for white privilege. Corporations will still profit from the cheap labor. Accusations of colonization inhibiting growth outside of a select few countries is a complete joke. When people realize you impovershed them because you hate white skin and supported a wealth redistribution agreement that didn&#39;t help the climate. They will guillotine you. Reconsider your insanity. If you want to help, go to one of these countries and help the poor non-whites , so you can stop associating with white people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But amid the outrage, the aggrieved still haven’t gotten around to resolving the central Paris contradiction, which is that it promises to be Earth-saving but fails on its own terms. It is a pledge of phony progress.
The 195 signatory nations volunteered their own carbon emission-reduction pledges, known as “intended nationally determined contributions,” or INDCs. China and the other developing nations account for 63% of annual global CO 2 emissions, and their share is rising. They submitted INDCs that pledged to peak the carbon status quo “around” 2030, and maybe later, or never, since Paris included no enforcement mechanisms to prevent cheating.
Meanwhile, the developed OECD nations—responsible for 55% of world CO 2 as recently as 2000—made unrealistic assurances that even they knew they could not achieve. As central-planning prone as the Obama Administration was, it never identified a tax-and-regulation program that came close to meeting its own emissions pledge of 26% to 28% reductions from 2005 levels by 2025.
Paris is thus an exercise in moral and social signaling that is likely to exert little if any influence on atmospheric CO 2 , much less on global temperatures.

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you need to do a little more research.</p>

<p>&quot;And therein lies the sticking point on which negotiations actually center: “climate finance.” Climate finance is the term for wealth transferred from developed to developing nations based on a vague and shifting set of rationales including repayment of the “ecological debt” created by past emissions, “reparations” for natural disasters, and funding of renewable energy initiatives.</p>

<p>The issue will dominate the Paris talks. The INDCs covering actual emissions reductions are subjective, discretionary, and thus essentially unnegotiable. Not so the cash. Developing countries are expecting more than $100 billion in annual funds from this agreement or they will walk away. (For scale, that’s roughly equivalent to the entire OECD budget for foreign development assistance.)&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it comes at the environment’s expense. A system of voluntary, unenforceable pledges relies on peer pressure for ambitious commitments and the “naming and shaming” of countries that drag their feet. In this context, true U.S. leadership and environmental activism require the condemnation of countries manipulating the process. Instead, the desperation to sign a piece of paper in Paris has taken precedence over an honest accounting. And once the paper is signed, any leverage or standing to demand actual change in the developing world will be weakened further.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>It gets skipped over a lot because there is just so much wrong with the agreement at every level that it&#39;s hard to get to them all lol</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like reparations or something. Punishing USA and EU because we industrialized (thus emitted more shit historically) and developed our economies before everyone else. If it were about saving the world they would do something, anything, about the globe&#39;s top polluter that is still growing industrially and economically with a population 3 times that of EU and USA. India will be right behind them too. </p>

Aren&#39;t capitalists, they&#39;re monopoly men (to say nothing of surviving rubber baron families).They love things like the Paris Accord because the compliance cost puts their smaller competition out of business. That&#39;s the secret behind the Elite supporting socialism, because they exempt themselves and use it to keep down their potential competition. Of course, climate change is really ultimately about Global Government, where the entire economy will be destroyed so the monopoly men can just depopulate the planet and rule over the leftovers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;But amid the outrage, the aggrieved still haven’t gotten around to resolving the central Paris contradiction, which is that it promises to be Earth-saving but fails on its own terms. It is a pledge of phony progress.
The 195 signatory nations volunteered their own carbon emission-reduction pledges, known as “intended nationally determined contributions,” or INDCs. China and the other developing nations account for 63% of annual global CO 2 emissions, and their share is rising. They submitted INDCs that pledged to peak the carbon status quo “around” 2030, and maybe later, or never, since Paris included no enforcement mechanisms to prevent cheating.
Meanwhile, the developed OECD nations—responsible for 55% of world CO 2 as recently as 2000—made unrealistic assurances that even they knew they could not achieve. As central-planning prone as the Obama Administration was, it never identified a tax-and-regulation program that came close to meeting its own emissions pledge of 26% to 28% reductions from 2005 levels by 2025.
Paris is thus an exercise in moral and social signaling that is likely to exert little if any influence on atmospheric CO 2 , much less on global temperatures.
