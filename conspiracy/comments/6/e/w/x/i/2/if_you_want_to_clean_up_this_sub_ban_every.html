    <div class="md"><p>No he didnt! I read that piece of propaganda you are talking about. Putin was talking about the upcoming German elections and Putin was being a sneaky creep and saying if certain Russian patriots happen to do something it is not his fault. The &quot;journalist&quot; then used some of these quotes and extrapolated the connections to the DNC leaks! How fucking flagrant can you get???</p>

<p>Stop manipulating people with twisted facts. Shit if only those fact checking websites were not bought and paid for by the corporate elites, then maybe they would be a help and not a propaganda piece against the truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can and are discussed here frequently be you folks. There have been plenty of very reasonable answers to you guys and the holes in the Russian narrative are pretty clear for all to see. The MSM is so blatantly manipulative these days. The headings on their articles are always extremely twisted extrapolations of events, and when you read the WHOLE article you see this to be the case. Now the new right is doing the same shit and that pisses me off. </p>

<p>They should be discussed here, but do not be surprised if your in the minority, as you are on the same team as the MSM.</p>

<p>A lot of the Russia stuff seems to be disregarded out of hand because it&#39;s getting reported by msm, but that&#39;s also because it&#39;s a massive fucking story that is getting leaked by some very inside sources.  Sources the average reporter probably doesn&#39;t have.  So why wouldn&#39;t they cover it?  Would you accept it more of it was pushed by some random YouTuber?</p>

<p>Character attack ... by stating an overarching empirical fact?</p>

<p>This place <em>is</em> controlled by Republican oligarchs and their minions in pure unquestioning support of the Current Government.</p>

<p>Character attack ... I don&#39;t even go to r/politics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Use common sense, man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Common sense says 80 percent pro-Republican and anti-Democrat <em>is</em> Republican partisan. Common sense says Republicans control the House, Senate, White House, and thanks to novel judicial activist fabrication, the Supreme Court too. Common sense says Republicans today are more powerful than at any time since the 1920&#39;s when they screwed up the peace and guaranteed World War 2 and destroyed the economy causing the Great Depression. This is where we are. Facts.</p>

<p>Common sense says that we got here by a mostly Republican government for the past 23 years, and a Republican Supreme Court for 47 years straight.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t get more Establishment than that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you not seen how much shit the MSM is flinging at Trump,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MSM promoted Donald Trump nonstop for 16 months. Now that he is in office and it&#39;s too late, they smear him. How convenient that is, huh? It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t done this before either. Names like Nixon, Christie and Walker come to mind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>just seeing if something will stick?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, actually I think they are trying to defer mostly to bluster to crowd out stuff that fits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember the Republicans doing that to Clinton and Obama, and how infuriating that was?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is pretty much what the TV is doing. It&#39;s too late, but now we can notice this and pretend it matters. But, in reality, those same people who did that to Obama are supporting Trump now. Those same oligarchs -- that same cabal of organized crime -- and somehow it&#39;s different because Donald Trump pretends to be an outsider. The stock market rally after the election and the continuing <em>near unanimous</em> Republican support for the substantive Trump agenda screams out &quot;ESTABLISHMENT.&quot;</p>

<p>Donald Trump is no outsider. He was propped up by MSM, and lied constantly for the specific purpose of winning the &quot;outsider&quot; vote. Interestingly, the biggest lies Donald Trump committed were those relating to things that go against the Koch brothers agenda. The areas where he opposed the Republican agenda -- and particular health insurance and ending war -- are the ones he completely backed away from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Trump is most definitely NOT an outsider. The MSM did NOT promote Trump. They marveled at him like many marvel at a person for being stupid. They were constantly playing him on the television in order to make fun of him. Remember all the liberals saying how desperate they were for him to run against Clinton, thinking they had it in the bag? Why are you liberals so damn prideful, and full of hubris? You guys can never reflect on your own failings and shortcomings.<br/>
The Republicans are largely to blame for many of the wrongs in our country. The Democrats sold their soul, though, and especially beginning with Clinton have become just as corporate and evil as the Republicans! 
This place is not controlled by Republican oligarchs. This place is purely against the neocon/neolib continuum and will always fight it. This place is against the wars for profit, against the toying of foreign nations for their own benefit, against the military industrial complex and the intelligence apparatus completely dominating our nation.</p>

<p>Also I am sorry but I have to say it. Why is it that all of you guys argue the same bullet points and the same critiquing? It reeks of a bland application of a liberal arts education, and a lack of creativity. I love a good logical fallacy if it helps to get a message across, and sometimes it is great to conscientiously paint with a broad brush if such a method is useful in the context. </p>

<p>Uh, yes it did. 23 times the coverage of Bernie Sanders and 70 percent positive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They marveled at him like many marvel at a person for being stupid. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To the extent this happened they literally covered up his policy agenda, discouraging people from voting -- which is well known to help establishment Republicans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember all the liberals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word &quot;liberal&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything anymore, and here&#39;s why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>saying how desperate they were for him to run against Clinton,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those would be establishment Democratic partisans. That&#39;s who gets on TV most of the time. That&#39;s why in 2003, most Democrats on TV were for the Iraq war even though most Democrats <em>in reality</em> were against it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>thinking they had it in the bag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everyone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you liberals so damn prideful, and full of hubris? You guys can never reflect on your own failings and shortcomings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Refer to above for details. Republicans are in power. If anyone has any complaints about DEMOCRATS now, please ask the Republicans in power to investigate. It seems like rhetorical spin to just cry about Democrats all day long. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALREADY. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Republicans are largely to blame for many of the wrongs in our country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, that&#39;s nice concern trolling BUT.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Democrats sold their soul, though, and especially beginning with Clinton have become just as corporate and evil as the Republicans! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe this would have fooled people before the election, but thanks to the Republicans in power, we have a 5-4 Supreme Court that will uphold unlimited corporate money in politics -- that was the biggest difference between Democrats and Republicans in 2016. We also have in process a major attempt to cut people off of health benefits and cut taxes for the rich, a proposal for a separate and larger tax cut for the rich, the end of net neutrality, the disabling of US agencies that protect people ...</p>

<p>And even on the worst thing about HRC, her warmongering, we see no end to that in site -- a direct turnaround from Donald Trump&#39;s promises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This place is not controlled by Republican oligarchs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, not oligarchs per se, but certainly by Republican partisans as the 80 percent hot page made clear. Someone is still denying the obvious.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This place is purely against the neocon/neolib continuum and will always fight it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOT with the 80 percent Republican partisan establishment filler, it&#39;s not. :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that all of you guys argue the same bullet points and the same critiquing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projection. Regardless, commenting to one person about how &quot;all of you guys&quot; do is trash talk. It&#39;s familiar though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It reeks of a bland application of a liberal arts education, and a lack of creativity.</p>

<p>Look at that. The partisan gloats about his own derisive comments. IT would have been easier to just say something like this:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do you think Trump is supposedly flinging shit at the world? </p>

<p>There are liberal journalists too who are exposing the globalist plots. </p>

<p>Eva Bartlett, Seymour Hersh, Glenn Greenwald, and others. Right now a the global corporate elites are pulling the strings of everything right now. Hillary was their first choice because she was a known quantity. Trump is no outsider and is totally corrupt, but he is facing the wrath of the establishment insiders, and right now I feel like they are trying to manipulate the people into hating him more and more. I do not trust the MSM one little bit. The articles are at times flagrant pieces of propaganda. You read the heading of the article and are clearly meant to get a certain perception from it, but then when you read the article you see how they play fast and loose with the truth.</p>

This site has swung on the conservative end of things for awhile because a majority of posters here are libertarians, moderates, traditionalists, and eccentrics of all sorts.

But lately the only liberals coming in large numbers are those from Universities, or from liberal chans, or from shilling fronts. They are acting in a concerted effort to destabilize threats and subvert them. I will give the liberals some credit in the community activism. Problem is they do it in such underhanded ways.

    <div class="md"><p>They did meddle directly in U.S. Politics. As for the DNC leaks, and those were leaks not hacks, no one knows  for certain except the people in this sub who say Seth Rich did it. </p>

<p>Here is why there is no clear evidence of the DNC and Podesta leaks. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hack:</strong> When someone in a remote location electronically penetrates operating systems, firewalls or other cyber-protection systems and then extracts data. Our own considerable experience, plus the rich detail revealed by Edward Snowden, persuades us that, with NSAâ€™s formidable trace capability, it can identify both sender and recipient of any and all data crossing the network.</p>

<p><strong>Leak:</strong> When someone physically takes data out of an organization â€” on a thumb drive, for example â€” and gives it to someone else, as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning did. Leaking is the only way such data can be copied and removed with no electronic trace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why it is so hard to provide evidence.</p>

<p>From here:
<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/01/06/why-the-dnc-emails-were-leaked-not-hacked/">http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/01/06/why-the-dnc-emails-were-leaked-not-hacked/</a></p>

<p>That is a set in stone conservative media that the DNC is blaming Russia.  Mostly made up and used for attacking and discrediting the real meddling Russia did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is ridiculous. Your answer to all those who fear rogue intelligence agents and corrupt politicians in the US is to question their patriotism and call them Russian. You are completely in your rights to say this, but your gaslighting tactics will not work. People here at r/conspiracy know when they are being screwed with. </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you try and empathize with us for a change? I try to do that with you guys sometimes. Dont you see why we would be so cynical of the MSM and powerful insiders who seem to have it in for Trump? What would you think when you see all the University types fomenting revolution, the desire of the destruction of free market economies, and the abolition of traditional values? Do you not see that there are certain points that many of us will not cross, and that you will have to accept that we will not change? Do you want to destroy us? Why can&#39;t we live together peacefully?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Triggered meaning frustrated? Yeah you totally frustrated me. I never said Russia was not dangerous. Of course they are dangerous. Right now Russia and the west are in a cold war with each other. We attempt to destabilize them (color revolutions) and they try to destabilize us (Ukraine). There are two sides to this story, and so far you seem to be naively willing to trust the mainstream media as solid sources of info. Have you tried reading some of their articles concerning the Russian narrative? Have you not seen how they are spinning the narrative?</p>

<p>Remember that article that came out not too long ago by some new right paper that was saying Crowdstrike was pulling back what they said concerning the Russian hacking business? When you read the article you saw that the heading of the article totally twisted the truth. Crowdstrike was making a correction on flawed Ukrainian military data. That shit pissed me off to no end. It was sneaky. That is the same crap the MSM is doing with the Russian narrative. It is a tool the elites are using to shut up their opponents. If someone opposes you, you just call them traitors and Russian shills. That is sloppy thinking, and you must know that. There is propaganda on all sides, and sometimes the horrible corruption is harder to see in your own back yard. It is easy to see how monstrous Putin is, but it is harder to see the monsters that lurk in your own government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the electoral college for a reason, and no the three million could not threaten me with force for my choices because we have laws. Of course it isnt just the MSM and powerful insiders who are parroting these narratives, but it is the MSM and those powerful insiders who are the gatekeepers,  the insiders who control the context of the information. Sadly people are easily fooled by the corporate elites and are buying into the Russian narrative. This narrative was crafted so that their opposition could be ridiculed and their patriotism could be called into question. The use of a powerful and dangerous enemy of the state can be used as a pretext to stifle and even silence all opposition, and it has been done frequently throughout history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say we should straight up trust them, always fact check. It is important to remember that the MSM has much more at stake when spinning stories and pushing an agenda too hard. The sketchy online sources we all love don&#39;t have an obligation for truth, they post what they want and that&#39;s it. The MSM has a definite slant to all of it&#39;s publishings, but if they are wrong or pushing an agenda too hard or lying they get hit and get hit hard by backlash. </p>
