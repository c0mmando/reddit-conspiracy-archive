    <div class="md"><p>This is, in my completely uneducated on the topic opinion, impossible unless we go back to a few isolated villages and communities population level.  Maybe not in the form of bills and coins, but there will most likely be some kind of monetary system based around the concept of trade.  I recall reading a sci-fi story that contained a civilization that had mastered nanotechnology, and with the ability to fabricate anything out of anything there was little point in tracking material possessions.  That society instead traded in time, because that was the only precious commodity left.  It was basically a system of favors with people placing value on their time and doing stuff for other people in exchange for them doing stuff for them.</p>

<p>Maybe in the far future if we get to the point of immortality and perfected nanotechnology we could go beyond a system of trade, but I&#39;m thinking that the first people to reach that level are more likely to wipe everyone else out and start over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been living in a constitutional republic in which we elect officials to represent us. Recently it has become more exploited and you start to see some resemblance of dynasties such as the Clintons and Bushes but it is nowhere close to exclusive rule of the elites. Many of these problems can be fixed by &quot;refreshing the fountain of liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants&quot; as Thomas Jefferson said this country will inevitably have to do. At some point in the future there needs to be another Revolution and out of it needs to come an updated Constitution with modern clarifications, such as no lobbying; terms limits on Congressmen; fair taxes; provisions that require government to balance budget over time rather than perpetually rack up deficits even in times of growth; legalization of drugs; regulations on media outlets that prevent oligopoly of information in which the elite can push a certain agenda; no foreign entanglements unless attacked ourselves; and most important of all a provision to prohibit us from ever becoming a welfare state again, only benefits for those who truly cannot work and people like veterans. Anarchy is certainly not the solution, government is necessary and can be structured to work for the better of the country and its people. What we need is a government overthrow (preferably peaceful, if possible) and an updated Constitution that covers a lot of loopholes and biased interpretation that TPTB have been exploiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve repeated it before and shall again:</p>

<p>Welcome to the machine... </p>

<p>It&#39;s a machine that requires your energy and consent. You don&#39;t have to be part of it per say but withdrawing from it can cost you the ultimate price and the first step is to stop using their &quot;money&quot; which is a tricky proposition. </p>

<p>The biggest lie to an American is that we are free. You never actually own the land you &quot;purchase&quot;. Every year taxes are due. How do you withdraw from that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You people live in a fantasy, man.  You imagine that in some dog eat dog world where you can only keep what you can physically protect, that the Pakastani steel katanas you bought from a shop in the mall will make you some kind of god.  It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read Hobbes, but I believe he described man in the state of nature as &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;  A long ass time ago people realized that it&#39;s better to consolidate power and forfeit a good amount of personal sovereignty in order to impose some sense of law and order into the world.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, governments protect your rights through rule of law.  The police and courts make sure I can&#39;t take what&#39;s yours just because I&#39;m stronger or otherwise infringe on your life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness.  Additionally governments provide education, infrastructure, defense,  health and safety, and a huge array of things that are meant to ensure you live a long and comfortable life where you don&#39;t have to worry that someone bigger and stronger will simply take what&#39;s yours because he can.</p>

<p>Now, in exchange for this, we give up a few things.  We give up sovereignty.  There&#39;s no rule of nature preventing me from walking into your mom&#39;s basement, slapping you upside your head, and taking what&#39;s yours (though I have no use for a semen stained anime body pillow, so likely your prize possessions are relatively safe).  Nasty, brutish, and short.  But in order to live in a society, I need to accept the rule of law, and accept that even though in nature I am free to break you and everything you love, in a civilization consequences are imposed on such an action.  I forfeit that sovereignty, I relinquish unbridled free will for the security that someone stronger than me won&#39;t come along and take what&#39;s mine.  Now, this protection: the law, the courts, the police, and all the other services: roads, schools, clean water, safe food, it all costs money.  So we also give up resources.  In the past this meant maybe a portion of the harvest.  Today it means money.  We pay the government in order to ensure that we don&#39;t have to live life in a state of nature, because a lot of us wouldn&#39;t survive very long, and I can really guarantee that a lot of people who agree with you wouldn&#39;t last a goddamn day.</p>

<p>Taxes are necessary.  Deal with it.</p>

<p>Taxes are collective action not theft. The problem is collective actions require good stewardship and that involves mass participation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, it&#39;s a corporation, like a huge human farm, with different parts of the farm serving different purposes for the main purpose of farming people, and maintaining cultures. </p>

<p>Why the fuck does the CIA fund music and movies? Because they are guiding culture. Why would a government do a false flag attack to be able to kill other parts of the world? Because they are guiding culture. </p>

<p>Guiding the lambs to slaughter, to consume until death and to keep the cogs of society functioning so that the ones on top can benefit from a society meant to serve them. </p>

<p>Socialism and nepotism at the top, cut throat capitalism at the bottom. </p>
