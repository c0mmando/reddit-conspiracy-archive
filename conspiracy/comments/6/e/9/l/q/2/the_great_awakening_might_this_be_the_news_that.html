        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TL;DR: Currently and generally speaking, mankind is existing through the lens of illusion. Experientially, we feel separation because we believe we are an identity, which separates us from the experiential union of being consciousness, itself. I hear more and more often of people going through spiritual awakenings (aka, <em>reality</em> awakenings). This awakening process happens when consciousness, or the space in which each of our thoughts has ever arisen, becomes aware of itself, rather than consciousness believing itself to be an illusory, individual identity. I theorize that this realization will soon begin to be experienced on a massive scale, resulting in complete and widespread unity within humanity -- a bonding of love resulting in an entirely new, fresh, loving reality.</p>

<p>Hi guys. About a year ago, without a religious or spiritual bone in my body, I underwent a &#39;sudden spiritual awakening&#39;. I hate the term &#39;spiritual&#39; because a spiritual awakening is really just an awakening to reality. What is an awakening? Experientially, an awakening is when consciousness (which fundamentally assumes no identity) becomes conscious that it is conscious. Currently, the majority of mankind believes it is the identity that the mind creates over time and through memories of experiences. By attaching itself to experiences outside of its own self, consciousness then limits its human experience because, from then on, life is lived through the lens of being a &#39;somebody&#39;. In truth, the experiential sensation of being an individual is an illusion that is created in the mind. And I have a theory that, soon enough, consciousness is going to recognize that it has been cleverly tricked into believing it is its thoughts, rather than holding no beliefs at all and remaining as its pure, loving, peaceful, present, and unconditioned self.</p>

<p>To steal from the wise words of the enlightened Adyashanti, &quot;To begin with, we have to make a simple, yet very powerful observation: All thoughts -- good thoughts, bad thoughts, lovely thoughts, evil thoughts -- happen <em>within</em> something. All thoughts arise and disappear into a vast space. If you watch your mind, you&#39;ll see that a thought simply occurs on its own -- it arises without any intention on your part. In response to this, we&#39;re taught to grab and identify with them. But if we can, just for a moment, relinquish this anxious tendency to grab our thoughts, we begin to notice something very profound: that thoughts arise and play out, spontaneously and on their own, within a vast space; the noisy mind actually occurs within a very, very deep sense of quiet.&quot;</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced a moment of awe, or a moment when you haven&#39;t had to &#39;do&#39; anything at all in order to be deeply, deeply satisfied? What <em>actually</em> happens in moments like those?</p>

<p>Very likely (if you aren&#39;t on opioids or something...), your mind has dissipated for that instant, and the real you -- which is consciousness/awareness, and which has absolutely no identity whatsoever -- observes purely and without grabbing at anything. When your child is born, &#39;you&#39; disappear so as to most intimately experience that moment. When you see a gorgeous sunset, &#39;you&#39; disappear, because consciousness shines through and the ego-lens dissipates. </p>

<p>When we look out at the world today, we witness massive suffering, which just <em>feels</em> wrong to us. We want it to change, but we tend to not know how to go about making the change. Beyond that, some of us might not even care for change to happen, as we are so internally &#39;lost&#39; that we have forgotten our love for humanity. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone out of my way to introduce certain friends to truth (both external and internal truth; politics and spirit), and they almost always believe what I have to say. Yet, they don&#39;t do <em>anything</em> about it because they are so content with &#39;Netflix &amp; Chilling&#39;. But <em>why</em>? <em>Why</em> do we either not know how to make change, or not care to make the change? </p>

<p>My theory is that the majority of humanity continues to live through the mind, through the ego, through something that is inherently selfish. We believe that there is a &#39;self&#39; within the body, for whom we live. But, through honest contemplation, it&#39;s really quite easy to see, as fact, that &#39;you&#39; do not exist and never have. What makes it &#39;hard&#39; to see is that the majority of people around us refuse to observe this blatant fact, so those of us who discover this truth about our own existence are often lead to disbelieving our discovery. Why? &quot;Because none of my friends think this way!&quot; and therein lies the problem. </p>

<p>Mankind is, generally speaking, suffering from internal insanity. The majority suffers from narcissism, to some degree or another, because almost all of us wake up each morning and put energy into believing we are an identity, which disallows consciousness (which inherently experiences life as the heart of our being, because consciousness understands that life <em>is</em> itself, so there is nothing to fear and everything to be grateful for) from remembering what <em>really</em> matters. </p>

<p>This clever illusion that has kept humanity within a dream state of existence for an unfathomably long time and is what has limited us from extending beyond the veils of selfish desire. Extending beyond that veil would result in widespread unification, and when mankind unites, it releases outrageously potent love, and thus a loving, energetic response ensues. If we were to unite, our world would become the loving place that each of us naturally intuits the world <em>should</em> already be. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so obvious, yet so hard to see. The experiential sense of individuality -- of being an individual within your skin, for whom you live, and whose life you have been living since birth -- is absolutely an illusion. </p>

<p>Now, I should add that the ego/dream-state is &#39;real&#39; in the sense that, to someone who has never experienced oneness/total unison with and as consciousness, separation is the only thing they have ever known. When he or she look at a chair, that chair is &#39;other than&#39; him or her. When he or she looks at another person, that person is &#39;other than&#39; him or her. To continue thinking that way is to continue perceiving through the lens of separation. And I theorize that we are about to &#39;evolve&#39; in such a way that consciousness becomes conscious of itself, rather than being conscious of itself as an identity.</p>

<p>By believing we are our thoughts, we&#39;ve lost our once-loving state of being. Sex is everywhere, war is everywhere, hatred is everywhere, separation is everywhere, terror is everywhere. Our world is currently existing as an incredibly low and dense frequency of being. Thus, our thinking is incredibly dense. We don&#39;t see what really matters, and we all live for the self, rather than for the other. </p>

<p>But once we recognize that none of us, as individuals, are special because none of us, as individuals, even exist.. <em>that</em> is when real change will come. <em>That</em> is when humanity will begin living through the heart, rather than through the mind. <em>That</em> is when love, which is the fabric and glue of all things within this universe, will overcome all else and our reality will rise in frequency, resulting in the most beautiful, loving, united world we have ever known. </p>

<p>Does anyone else feel this way? I&#39;d also like to add: I feel that this is going to be the realization that leads to massive, widespread change because we live in the age of information, while also living in an age of ego. So, to continue obtaining more and more information, while also attaching one&#39;s self to <em>all</em> that information, is to overload the ego with guidelines on how to live. </p>

<p>To exist with an outrageously rigid guideline on how to experience life is to inevitably set one&#39;s self on a road to &#39;spiritual&#39; awakening because, eventually, the mind will become so confused and depressed that it will ever take its own life, or it will start asking, &quot;What&#39;s <em>actually</em> true? What am &#39;I&#39; <em>actually</em>?&quot; Beyond that, we millennials (maybe you older folks, too!) spend so much time on our phones in order to use applications like tinder, instagram, or snapchat. In each of these applications, we might find ourselves incessantly judging. We look at friends&#39; photos and judge them for what they post, we look at potential hook ups&#39; photos on tinder and judge them based on &#39;my&#39; guideline for who &#39;I&#39; deserve and desire, and the like. </p>

<p>We judge, judge, judge. We incessantly judge throughout the course of our day (generally speaking about the Western World, where I am from), <em>but the fundamental truth of existence is that the thing for which we judge all things is actually an illusion</em>. And I just cannot fathom the ego-mind continuing finding much more success in hiding itself from consciousness through the paradox of being itself (the funny paradox of spirituality tends to be that gurus send their students on the cognitive journey of trying to find themselves with their mind, but they can&#39;t because their ego <em>is</em> the mind, and to try to find it is like the snake biting its own tail). </p>

<p>Anyway, I am just curious if anyone else has gone through a sudden awakening and if you feel that this theory might hold some weight. This theory is what I believe is going to be the real start to widespread, massive change. &#39;The Great Awakening&#39;, I&#39;ve heard it called in the past. Now, what&#39;s going to ignite the awakening? No idea. But I guess that&#39;s why I spend time on r/conspiracy, haha. Thanks guys. Positive vibes to each and every one of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I am aware. Thank you :)</p>

<p>I do think it&#39;s worth it to consider pumping the breaks on introducing &#39;those not in the know&#39; to the internal illusion first, rather than trying to first open minds with theories regarding alien stuff. When someone is told that they can live a more peaceful life by simply dropping their beliefs, they&#39;re more inclined to pursue that journey. When someone is told, on the other hand, that our entire understanding of the world outside the self is a manufactured reality, done so in such a way that illusion is perpetuated as a means of imprisoning humanity in a lower, denser, more-easily-manipulated frequency of being, they tend to become fearful and, then, put on Netflix and chill. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just something I&#39;ve come to recognize in my experiences of trying to open friends&#39; minds to this sort of foreign, esoteric thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Starseeds = wtf?</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t aware of this, researched it and seriously questioning reality now. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve studied other theories on other beings, aliens, etc. but this is an interesting concept to ponder. It&#39;s almost a hybridization of reincarnation, and soul seeding from another dimension or alien. </p>

<p>I fit the description of a Starseed perfectly, and also recently had several awakenings in the past year (hell even the past few months). </p>

<p>My western ego likes to explain my difference from humanity due to the fact my DNA test results indicate I&#39;m 84% less Neanderthal than the average human being, nearly .5% less than the average person (which is usually enough DNA to indicate a different species). However, now my awakened being is questioning why my consciousness selected this body. Am I some kind of ancient Starseed? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve truly found my purpose yet but I&#39;m frustrated with my reach to be able to help others. I want so badly to spread truth, and awareness that can help humanity but yet I&#39;m on this incredible journey at that same time that I&#39;m unaware of how to communicate to others.</p>

<p>Anyhow, who knows how much truth there is to any of this, but it&#39;s exciting to think about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much the same at the moment, waiting for The Event, which should trigger all dormant Starseeds from my understanding. My guess for our high numbers (it seems, and was told in what I read) is that to effectively combat what&#39;s illogic we&#39;re gonna need some heavy resistance. See what&#39;s happening in Evergreen College? How did it ever get to that point? MLK is rolling in his grave mate. Some cite Jesus, MLK and Malcolm X as examples of starseeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Define what &quot;The Event&quot; means to you?</p>

<p>I mean lets say for a moment this feeling I&#39;ve felt my entire life of &quot;not being of this world&quot;, a lot of strange and unusual and rare circumstances that have presented themselves in my life, and a number of other coincidences are all indicators that I am some kind of Starseed, what does that actually mean?</p>

<p>I mean aside from the I&#39;m some kind of reincarnation of some ancient being, I get that much, but what is the practical application of this knowledge?</p>

<p>From what it sounds like Starseeds are healers, leaders, and visionaries which are all things I relate to, and have many experiences with. Are we truly here to help humanity? Is there some kind of collective of Starseeds working together to combat the evils of this universe?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt an overwhelming responsibility to help others, and only recently as I&#39;ve had several awakenings has this desire become stronger and stronger and lead to some serious lifestyle improvements, and much research. I&#39;m trying to figure out how to have a greater impact on the universe in a positive manifestation but also burdened with the nature of being an empath and being weighed down by others negative energy. I&#39;ve been very focused on improving myself and acquiring the skills I will need in the future but almost selfishly so, and I am still struggling to find the proper mediums to reach more people.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve manifested a fairly large social media following, I&#39;m working on a documentary, and I&#39;ve got a lead on potential book deal but I&#39;m merely exploring all of these things and not really sure where to put my time. Although I do love to write and if I could figure out how to write for a living that would be my ideal, but even so I want to also build a following in real life and meet with others in person.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I&#39;m rambling. Thoughts? Do you believe you&#39;re a Starseed as well? What&#39;s your experience been?</p>

<p>It would seem so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting so your third eye is blocked. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. That must be really difficult. </p>

<p>My third eye is over active, if anything I have trouble grounding myself. I&#39;m basically the inverse of you energetically.</p>

<p>If your natural state is grounded, earth elements, then you need to raise your vibrational frequency to reach your third eye. Research &quot;decalcifying your pineal gland&quot; some easy tricks are avoiding toxins like fluoride, heavy metals, aluminum (in antiperspirant), and eating an organic mostly plant or Paleo diet. Also sun gazing with your eyes closed particularly in the morning sun. </p>

<p>Cannabis can also raise your frequency depending on the strain and strength of what your smoking (although the wrong strain can lower it). Sativas
and hybrids are more likely to stimulate the third eye but then again some indicas can as well. Everyone is a little different.</p>

<p>Kundalini yoga is also really amazing for moving energy energetically between chakras and if your really rooted you&#39;ll be able to break through and awaken your third eye potentially. Google or YouTube &quot;awakening the 10 bodies&quot;. </p>

<p>Breathing techniques mixed with movement and meditation all have an accumulative effect when used together. If you only practice them one at a time you&#39;re missing out on the unified experience which is where you&#39;ll make the most progress energetically.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get too frustrated if you don&#39;t experience an awakening immediately or even really seek one. Just keep practicing and they&#39;ll happen when you&#39;re ready. </p>

<p>Anyhow thank you for the information. Been researching this all night now. Fascinating really. Feels like there&#39;s some weird distant crazy truth here, still skeptical, but also aligns with other theories and makes a lot of sense in a metaphysical multiverse quantum mechanics kind of way. </p>

<p>Best of luck unlocking your third eye. It&#39;s going to be an amazing experience when you break through. Keep practicing, meditate daily, practice yoga, practice breathing techniques (Wim Hof), go to concerts and other public events or group meditations and keep expanding your consciousness. Even if you can&#39;t visualize it, your other senses should still be able to feel it. Follow those senses.</p>

<p>Actually it&#39;s not that bad for daily life, I don&#39;t see a difference. Though I can&#39;t help but feel all those visualization exercises serves a purpose in meditation.</p>

<p>Currently have some sour diesel, I try to stay in sativas. As for decalcification, yeah I&#39;ve started changing some of my habits however I can trace my third eye switching off to a single event I believe. I used to as a kid to be daydreaming a lot or as my mom would put it &quot;I was living in the past&quot; and we went to see some dude that plays with energies that&#39;s a bit religious and then I had less problems etc. My guess is I might need to find another one of those and ask them to fix me up haha</p>

<p>I did the same when I found out haha, followed my instinct, which is what we want to do as we already contain the knowledge, encoded in our DNA or whatever (97% junk dna my ass right)
I agree with you, when I stumbled on it, it just filled up holes in answers I already had through previous research into other conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I think one of my biggest problem is I&#39;m too conscious of my body, I can only trance so much up until my mind sends a random &quot;Hey, am I breathing still?&quot; is just enough to never really disconnect. I feel visual imagery is pretty much what removes your focus/awareness of one&#39;s vehicule. </p>

<p>Thanks for the replies, always interested in hearing other&#39;s stories. I&#39;m not sure what exactly my role is supposed to be/will be but I figure spreading the word and discussing conspiracy theories online so far as net some nice results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you haven&#39;t experienced visualization since you were a kid, and someone created some kind of energy field to prevent you from fully accessing your third eye that&#39;s a tricky situation.

<p>From my understanding visualization is key to manifestation. So being unable to visualize is potentially hindering your ability to manifest your desired reality. It is very common for Starseeds to struggle with manifesting abundance, and it could even be because you swore some kind of vow of poverty or swore of material possessions or power in a past incarnation.</p>

<p>Have you tried Kundalini yoga? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9jBj-OZ7a8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9jBj-OZ7a8</a></p>

<p>Or any kind of breathing techniques?</p>

<p>The physical body is absolutely a gateway to unlocking your inner capabilities, and to access it you have to physically cultivate energy. Breathing is by far the most successful way to do that, as your lungs are one of the most powerful organs in the body and connect to your immune system, and nervous system.</p>

<p>I hear you on having too much awareness of your own body, I am hyper sensitive and feel all kinds of things you&#39;re not really supposed to such as the digestive process, and any other number of things related to neuromuscular system. I also use to freak myself out about not breathing enough, but since I started doing Wim Hof I&#39;ve since realized that not breathing can be just as useful as breathing. </p>

<p>I can now hold my breath for several minutes after oxygenating my blood through breathing techniques, and through the use of oxygenation I&#39;m able to open blocked channels or meridians or whatever you want to call them. I can also feel and access my autonomic nervous system using various breathing techniques as well. This has some weird truth to it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWaxF8jlnm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWaxF8jlnm0</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not formally taught on mysticism, but from my understanding and self research I imagine you will be a force to be reckoned with if you unblock your 3rd eye which is possibly why it was blocked in the first place. It will likely be an incredible responsibility and possible burden if you do unblock it so you need to be ready, balanced, and spiritually mature enough to handle it. I&#39;ve been 3rd eye dominant since I was child, and it has been a challenge.</p>

<p>You&#39;re energetically likely compensating as well, so I imagine some of your other energy centers are open and possibly imbalanced as a result. I would probably focus your energy identifying those energy centers and balancing them. You&#39;ve obviously navigated this far without your 3rd eye, so I&#39;m guessing your heart charka or something else is leading you (which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing).</p>

<p>Interesting way to put it, All I remember is laying on a table for an hour and then that was that. And ever since then (afaik) I didn&#39;t dream again, or rather see them, or remember them. I have memories of having dreams before and know what they feel like but that has been gone for about 10 years now. Sleeping, regardless of length (assuming a good night) is just like skipping time. I go to bed, 5-10 mins later I&#39;m out and then I wake up to my alarm.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say I have tried everything as I learn something new everyday but it&#39;s not a new topic to me on that aspect. I found out about QHHT this week, looked up around and there&#39;s practioners in the area, I could try that, it&#39;s quite expensive though</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got some balancing to do on the physical body (who doesn&#39;t heh?) but apart from that I&#39;m fine. Ready? I&#39;ve never been so motivated. I&#39;m researching, keeping up with the world, eating data all day long lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating.</p>

<p>Breathing techniques - research Wim Hof you can torrent his classes if you can&#39;t afford them. Kundalini breathing techniques such as breath of fire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKqWXieA_8c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKqWXieA_8c</a> is also really powerful for building up heat and energy in the body. The key though to control the flow of energy through the spine is whats called a root lock <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDiLtXh75tM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDiLtXh75tM</a> .</p>

<p>If Tesla was right, everything in this universe is composed of frequency, energy, and/or vibration. That was his hypothesis before we even had an understanding of quantum mechanics. By using breathing techniques you can use oxygen, energy, and vibration to alter or change your frequency. Also should note using cannabis while meditating or doing yoga or both can also be very powerful.</p>

<p>I doubt whatever was done to you energetically is not reversible, in fact the healer who did this likely did it for your benefit at the time. The energy had to go somewhere, so they likely sent it into your lower charkas.  I can&#39;t imagine why they would want to block your 3rd eye forever, or send the energy up to your crown chakra. For some context, the 3rd eye is the seat of the soul, it is your intuition and that little voice inside your head that tells what path to follow. Now you may still have an intuition even with your 3rd eye blocked, but that means its coming from somewhere else.</p>

<p>QHHT might help, but I think what you&#39;re dealing with is more energy (physical) and frequency based (intangible energy). Reiki would probably be the quickest path to a solution, or even finding the healer who worked on your before.</p>

<p>By blocking your 3rd eye you&#39;ve essentially been grounded from reaching higher frequencies. Most people are living their lives from there first 3 charkas. They&#39;re 3D beings, in a 3D universe, and only think, feel, and interact with things within the 3rd dimensions of reality, or what we like to call the physical world (this would be the root, sacral, and solar plexus). The 3rd eye is actually your 6th charka with your 4th being your heart charka (love, meta), and 5th being your throat (truth). The 7th is your crown chakra which connects you to the astral plane - I only have minimal experience with the 7th charka as I&#39;m not there yet in my personal development. I can access it, but only for a few moments and I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing when I&#39;m there.</p>

<p>As for imbalances, as I said the energy had to go somewhere. So again you may be energetically abundant elsewhere which could explain your ability to go with the flow of life better since your 3rd eye has been blocked. It&#39;s a very similar principle to someone who loses their eyesight, and their other senses become enhanced. Considering you&#39;ve experienced some kind of energetic event to block your 3rd eye that likely caused some kind of imbalance somewhere.</p>

<p>Anyhow the fact you&#39;re researching these kinds of things, and exploring Starseeds and what not means something is leading you—if it isn&#39;t your 3rd eye because that&#39;s blocked the only thing I can guess is perhaps your heart chakra (love) or throat chakra (truth) is leading you which is a very real possibility. I&#39;m not familiar with astral projection so I can&#39;t really sense your energy over the Internet, I can only analyze the information you&#39;ve provided, and your writing style so I might be wrong about this. You will have to seek your own truth. The fact you&#39;re grounded within your body isn&#39;t a negative thing either. As I mentioned, I&#39;m 3rd eye dominant, and struggle to ground myself because I&#39;m operating mostly from the frequency of intuition most of the time, and I can tap into the astral plane mostly when I&#39;m dreaming or tripping but again not great at navigating it—all of this is mostly self taught never really had a spiritual guide or anything. </p>

<p>The first thing you can do is get your body in shape, as I mentioned previously a clean organic Paleo diet, avoiding toxins, detoxing, and yoga are keys to raising your frequency, unblocking the pineal gland, and accessing your 3rd eye. It could simply be that is all you need. Meanwhile, I would meditate on your other charkas and practice moving your focus between them, and use physical energy from Kundalini and breathing to move the energy through your body and stimulate the different energy centers. Research charkas as well, and using whatever is guiding you to find the imbalances and correct them. If you need help, seek it. There is no shame in finding an experience energy healer to guide you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m maybe 8-years into experiencing energy healing first hand, and only 4-years into researching and practicing daily with most of my awakenings happening in 2017 so far this year. So I don&#39;t consider myself an expert just yet, but for some reason all of this is coming to me naturally in a way I don&#39;t really understand. Perhaps I&#39;m a Starseed or something else. Still trying to figure out what I am exactly, and why my consciousness selected this body and felt the need to endured these experiences.</p>

<p>Definitely throat chakra, overwhelming sense to correct something if I know it&#39;s wrong. Truth seeking is kind of natural. But I mix it up with intuition too, I try to listen to it. As I read everything and anything, it usually resonates.</p>

<p>Now that you mention it, I would think it is Reiki techniques he had. Though I&#39;m certain he didn&#39;t know it by that name, it was an old religious man haha. I&#39;ll definitely see if there&#39;s any nearby, probably less expensive and if I can get just the eye back I might be able to do the rest of the journey without hypnosis. If necessary though, I know I can get hypnotized so it&#39;s aight.</p>

<p>Yeah that guided meditation focused on that, it had the chants and everything too, I have it bookmarked to try again later</p>

<p>I believe the answer to this would be encoded knowledge in the dna, from my understanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Operating out of the throat chakra is a good place to be. I&#39;ve dealt with some throat chakra weakness in the past, and I&#39;m still healing from it but I am finally able to speak my truth again. Stopped writing for nearly 10-years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really curious what that energy healer did, it sounds like your 3rd eye is still functioning from a functional intuitive capacity through your throat chakra, you&#39;re just blocked from the visual experience of the 3rd eye. You may be able to consult with an energy healer via Skype even, some may take your call for a free consult even. Most of them don&#39;t charge a lot, others charge way too much. Granted you want to find someone who knows what they&#39;re doing, and being in the same place at the same time I feel like helps. Although I know energy healers who claim it doesn&#39;t matter — the ones who have mastered astral projection and can sense and feel peoples energy no matter what the distance. If you believe in quantum psychics its not entirely impossible that consciousness can actually move faster than light, and we know an observer is required in some instances for matter to behave a certain way. Even the CIA has researched this kind of thing.</p>

<p>Chanting is another way to raise frequency as well, although I find its best in group situations and aligning your energy with others around you and chanting and meditating together.</p>

<p>As for DNA, I&#39;m certainly getting closer to accepting that much to be true. I simply know things I have not experienced in this lifetime I cannot explain otherwise, particularly when it comes to this kind of stuff. The fact I have 0.5% less Neanderthal DNA than 84% of the rest of the population is fascinating as well. That means I&#39;ve got extra DNA where most people have earth born Neanderthal DNA, which potentially contains additional knowledge that most human beings don&#39;t have. Then again, they potentially have Neanderthal DNA and knowledge I don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still torn as to what the hell the source of my DNA could be, is it ancient aliens? Am I merely more purebred than the average human? Am I related to some lost civilization such as Atlantis? So many questions. This concept of Starseeding is a fascinating explanation, but of course reads more like sci-fi then anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I&#39;ve never met another lesser Neanderthal before. What the hell are we?</p>

<p>I can tell you from my experiences I don&#39;t believe I am the same breed of Homosapein as most of the population. I say this not with ego, or because I believe I&#39;m special or anything like that, but merely because I&#39;ve felt something my entire life telling me I&#39;m not the same as others. When I got my DNA test and found out I have less than .5% Neanderthal gene as the rest of the population that kind of felt like validation that maybe there is something to this feeling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 1/4 Greek, 1/4 Italian on my Mom&#39;s side but the gene-line is consistent - meaning my Italian and Greek ancestors were at one point the same tribe, and the gene-line was merely reconnected with the birth of my Mother. This DNA supposedly traces back to Mesopotamia about 40,000 years (which by modern standards of time telling means this is a fairly ancient gene-line as this was also when Neanderthal&#39;s were wiped out). I also have 0.3% Sardinian which is a rare island gene-line.</p>

<p>On my Dad&#39;s side, I&#39;m a Northern European consisting of a little bit of German, French, British, and Irish. His gene-line is about 12,000 years old. Most Europeans are of this gene-line. Although I am less than &lt; 0.1% 
Ashkenazi Jewish which I did not know until they reanalyzed my DNA recently. This gene-line supposedly traces back to just 4 different unrelated women, and is also incredibly rare.</p>

<p>My understanding of the true nature of our history is in its infancy, but if you believe Atlantis was in Doggerland, that would mean my Father and most of modern Europeans are likely descendants of Atlantis which was potentially wiped out about 12,800 years ago. Most of that gene-line is common aside from that touch of Ashkenazi Jewish which is incredibly rare, and traces back to an area in modern day North Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>On my Mom&#39;s side, I&#39;m an Athenian on her Dad&#39;s side, and Southern Italian on her Moms but before that it is hard to say. If this gene-line truly dates back to Mesopotamia then theres a number of ancient possibilities. I take after her both physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt a great empathy for others, yet always felt like I was another breed or species almost at the same time. Typical group-think, and hive mind mentalities don&#39;t really work on me, and never have. I have always seen the world differently than others, including my own parents. I can absolutely connect into the collective consciousness of humanity, but it is like I&#39;m on another frequency most of the time. When I do tap into the frequencies everyone else is on it can be a very overwhelming experience (still learning how to shield myself and protect myself from others energy but I&#39;m slowly getting better at it).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known from a very young age I wasn&#39;t like the other kids, and they sensed it as well. When I was a kid, I was considered &quot;gifted&quot; but as I became older that soon turned to &quot;troubled&quot;, and my 20&#39;s were a rollercoaster ride of suffering, personal development, and some incredible successes of things that really shouldn&#39;t have been possible.</p>

<p>I had my first awakening about 4-years ago during a group meditation, but probably didn&#39;t have my second one until a few years later. Recently, I&#39;ve experienced 3 charkas or energy centers or whatever you want to call them awaken or become available to me through a combo of kundalini yoga, and wim hof breathing techniques combined with meditation and cannabis. Been through a lot of healing in the past several months, and as I improve I continue to experience more and more frequent and intense physical awakenings.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. Trying to keep this short lol
Started sophomore year when I met a Holocaust survivor Mr Walter Kase. He recounted his story to my World Humanities class and it really struck a chord with me. To what I paid attention to that day (besides his story) I noticed people didn&#39;t REALLY seem effected. I was balling and really heart broken I felt those mans words as he was talking about my own history.. Little did I know years later I take my DNA test after my grandmother passes away and leaves her genealogy reports on our ancestry. The results came up Ashkenazi. Haven&#39;t looked thru her files they are in NM at the moment. One day I&#39;ll have my family send it to me I&#39;ll have some use to it compared to anyone else in the family. We always say I turned out just like her. </p>

<p>Anyways so I get my DNA test earlier this year, and every single continent on the earth lights up, sans Australia russia and Greenland. My Ashkenazi is less than half percent only
Then this year I fell down the rabbit hole and a whole bunch of crazy shit happened but its relief to know I&#39;ve been finding a few people who have the same occurances
According to my reports there are 295 variants of Neanderthal.. %76 more than anyone else on the site so it says</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re more or less Neanderthal?</p>

<p>Yeah finding out I have less than a % Jewish was kind of eye opening. I grew up in an area with a lot of Jewish kids, and always felt like they looked down on me for not being Jewish. I&#39;ve had many people ask me if I was Jewish over the years as well and always told them no, and they always seemed disappointed for some reason. Well turns out a tiny fraction of my DNA is in fact Jewish so I&#39;m not really sure what to think about it. I didn&#39;t even know about the Ashkenazi people until after my DNA results and it was only recently that they reanalyzed my DNA and discovered this.</p>

<p>I even dated a Jewish girl once and her family really didn&#39;t seem to like the fact I was raised Catholic (even though I do not practice and consider myself agnostic).</p>

<p>I am just curious if anyone else has gone through a sudden awakening  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  The end of last year.  I had some very &#39;supernatural experiences&#39; (I don&#39;t use those words lightly but they quickly explain the type of feelings I had) after looking deeply into moloch connections and tptb, leading back to babylon.  </p>

<p>I initially believed I was having a mental breakdown.  Turns out it was a breakthrough.  I was shown the Truth of this world (it&#39;s a prison matrix powered by malice and suffering, covered in sygils and runes) and after searching some more and questioning everything, I was lead to the way out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume he&#39;s referring to ego death, or residing as awareness, itself. To let go of every belief you&#39;ve <em>ever</em> had, every idea, every personal dream, everything...is to allow what you <em>really</em> are to recognize itself. Without the illusory baggage of beliefs, which creates an illusory center/identity (even though it feels so damn real) within and as consciousness, what you really are -- which can only know itself by being purely in the moment -- recognizes itself. Awareness becomes aware that it is aware, and through that transition of being, one might refer to the experiential sensation as &quot;finding a way out,&quot; because you are no longer existing as an identity, thus you no longer suffer and no longer believe in the illusory realm of good vs. bad. When consciousness recognizes itself, what it also recognizes is that everything outside of itself is also it. Everything is inter-connected, and everything is one. These truths can be experienced as your literal state of being. All it takes is gathering the fierce grace to be able to acknowledge that the &#39;me&#39; is nowhere to be found. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost.  Everybody is connected.  It&#39;s why we feel bad for others when they suffer, when they are sad etc.  It is because we all came from the same place.  Some of us have lot our ability to feel that empathy, they have been corrupted too much.  But the world is not what we think, it is a majick trick meant to deceive us into thinking &#39;this is all there is&#39;.  But God is real.  Jesus Christ is our way out of here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have limited knowledge as to the original names, I&#39;m afraid.  I pray and ask for guidance to reveal the truth.  Yeshua is possibly a more era-accurate name for His time in this realm.  You could call him by the title Messiah.  </p>

<p>I am basing all this on gut-feeling, as I said I&#39;ve had certain strange experiences that lead me to these beliefs.  Almost like following a path and all the correct turns are being put in place, if that makes sense.

    <div class="md"><p>He was the Son of the living God.  He died and his blood was shed to atone for our sins.  The original followers of God failed to follow His commandments and live without sin.   They continued to perform sacrifices to false gods etc</p>

<p>Jesus Christ came here to live a perfect life.  He died sinless, thus His blood washed away all the sin we accumulate throughout life.  Because none of us were fit to enter heaven and none of us are capable of being without sin.  So by believing in Him, who sacrificed for us, we may receive salvation.  This, I believe is the way out.  </p>

<p>I say &#39;Him&#39; because everything that points to the sacred feminine is wrapped up in paganism and death worship.  And when you follow the connections, they always leads to the same place.  Goes to nature, gaia, the divine self, etc and on and on always ends up at the sun, the light.  lucifer.  </p>

<p>I do not know what you are missing.  I am not a prophet or vessel of God.  Just someone who has reached a conclusion that makes sense based on the things i&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve said, I am no expert.  If you have any questions that I can help answer, I will try. But all of this comes from intuition and profound feeling tbh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But by believing in him, we are maintaining a belief. To have a belief is to maintain ego, or a center in consciousness. I believe Christ consciousness is accessible for all, and the way to attain it is by letting go of every belief ever held. Maybe we can use him and his teachings as a guideline for how to let go, because as you let go of your ego/mind identity, it is true that you might start recognizing that what Jesus said about his own self <em>really is</em> our true state of being, without all the conditionings and beliefs. Just my thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t believe in a historical Yeshua,  aka &#39;Jesus Christ&#39;, but I will consider a &#39;Christ consciousness&#39;.  If we agree that there is such a thing as &#39;Christ consciousness&#39; then I would also admit that it&#39;s not specific to Anglo or Hebrew notions and labels but would exist beyond such cultural specificity and be known by other labels and names. </p>

<p>Maybe you haven&#39;t considered this and you literally think Jesus Christ is/was real.   In that case,  we have little to discuss.   But I wish you well, as you seem to be following what is true for you and that, in my opinion,  is all we can do.  Peace be with you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only go by what I deeply feel inside, obviously that won&#39;t help anyone else to conclude anything.  I think He was real though.  So much manipulation of His message and teachings through history tell me that something wants to prevent people from hearing the message.  The false images of Him etc.<br/>
I am of the opinion that the roman catholic church was very early corrupting the Truth.  We can see in the wealth and idolatry it displays (going against His teachings).  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is a case of a chosen people only receiving His salvation.  That would go against what He preached.  I, of course could be wrong, don&#39;t think He cares about skin colour or places of birth.<br/>
He is certainly more than a man so the idea of a divine consciousness is not repulsive.  The truth is none of us really know anything.   </p>

<p>Thanks for your time.  I too, wish you the best of things with whatever path you walk.  Take care, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand where you come from in that perspective.  I am from a country ravaged by the sick, sick actions of those who were supposed to represent God.  Sadly, those people who do those things are fully in the grip of the synagogue of satan.</p>

<p>What I came to see, after my personal &#39;revelations&#39;, is that organised religion was never meant to be.  Jesus actually states that none shall be claimed as a teacher or priest over anyone, only God himself.  Sadly, this destruction of the True message brought by Jesus is all part of satans deception.    </p>

<p>If you are still open and seeking, look up the words that Jesus himself spoke.  Ignore teachings by churches claiming to represent God.  I think the message was delivered clear enough but over time has been corrupted , as have the people and organisations that claim to spread it.  </p>

<p>What better way to turn away the true believers than to take over the &#39;house of God&#39;.  When you look at the history of the catholic church and its actions, it becomes very clear it represents not Jesus Christ nor God but something much more malignant. </p>

<p>Whatever happens or whichever path you take, keep positive and be excellent to each other!  Take care, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the thing: if I look only at God&#39;s actions, he is a jealous, angry, vindictive, destructive, cruel and murderous God. He caused the flood, and almost wiped out mankind. He has directly killed so many people! If I look at my own life, my father was a good, honest man who worked hard to provide for his family; he retired at 64, found that he had cancer almost immediately, and died at 66. It wasn&#39;t the cancer that killed him. The chemotherapy destroyed his immune system. At one point he had a heart attack, and I think they put a breathing tube down his throat. It got scratched up, and an infection of warts took hold; the warts grew until he couldn&#39;t breath. He basically drowned in warts. </p>

<p>When I judge by actions, frankly, God looks far far far worse than Satan. So no; I reject God with all of my heart! If I met him, I think the best thing I could do for all of mankind is to immediately kill him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no single source to give.  I spent months following links and reading.   </p>

<p>Start with the basics.  Go to wikipedia and look up some babylonian or sumerian deities.  Follow the links within, and do external searches for them as well.<br/>
Notice the names that keep popping up (most of these false idols are all the same throughout history, just being renamed to hide in plain sight).  The same entity always has multiple names.  Notice that practices associated with these entities also carry through history (sacrifice by fire being the notable one).  </p>

<p>Look closely at the images and stone carvings associated with these beings.  You&#39;ll start to see symbols that reoccur throughout history.  Then start to examine royal and aristocratic crests.  The same symbols pop up all the time.  </p>

<p>Look into occult symbols and meanings etc.  All of this will begin to tie in together, piece by piece.</p>

<p>Hopefully that will get you started, there&#39;s so much information to see if you look.  Any specific questions you have, I&#39;ll try to answer or at least help if I can.  </p>

<p>For a real link from the past to today.:<br/>
Have you ever heard of a canaanite horned altar?
An item used to sacrifice children to ba&#39;al aka moloch etc?
There is one in the centre of the floor in the <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-glRnolvKp6I%2FUVKR1wWq85I%2FAAAAAAAAM90%2FrMXpTtUCLC8%2Fs1600%2F1731-large.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">freemason temple in washington dc</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck with the research.  And stay positive throughout.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No visions or anything spectacular like that, haha.  Lots of synchronicity, so much it becomes impossible not to believe.  Reading something and then an idea pops into my head, as if out of nowhere, that this is the exact next step or path to take in relation to the research.  As if my mind is making connections I can&#39;t possible know have connections at all.</p>

<p>Thinking something and knowing, more than anything you&#39;ve ever been sure of in your life, that it&#39;s correct before you even confirm it.</p>

<p>I will tell you it&#39;s a strange experience  but it&#39;s happened and been happening too many times to reject as coincidence.</p>

<p>Some of the things weren&#39;t so great.  I was given the sensation that I was dead.  For a day or two I walked around feeling that all of us were dead and had no idea.  That was awful but I knew it and knew I had to make amends for the things I&#39;d done.  I am under the belief that this was, in a way, a warning or sign to change my life.  So I took it at that.  And have tried to be a better person.</p>

<p>Some might say I&#39;m just mentally ill but if it made me a better person, what harm is that?  Take care, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I grew up with a narcissistic dad and a sort of angelic mom. My thought structure was hugely flawed, and my cognitive dissonance was on another level. I couldn&#39;t ever concentrate because something in me always felt that what I was doing in this moment wasn&#39;t &#39;it&#39;. I was never satisfied, which means I was never present, which means I was always perceiving through the mind&#39;s identity which is inherently dissatisfied. I think that, because my particular identity was so blatantly glitching, with back-and-forth thoughts, huge cognitive dissonance, no satisfaction or peace, I was then lead to questioning truth. For a while, I was into drugs as a form of escape and I&#39;d begun to experience suicidal ideologies, but my love for family and music was too strong. So I chose to start asking questions as a means of <em>understanding</em> my anxiety and experiential confusion. </p>

<p>So, for the first time in my life, I stopped asking questions to get the answer I wanted, and I, instead, started asking questions about what&#39;s <em>actually</em> true, no matter if the truth offended me or not. Fortunately, the ultimate truth that I discovered, internally, was that &#39;I&#39; do not exist and my cognitive dissonance was a consequence of consciousness maintaining certain beliefs which created a guideline for how I <em>believed</em> I must live, which also creates the center within consciousness which we refer to as &#39;me&#39;. This might sound nuts. For a while I thought I was losing my mind, going schizophrenic. But all seems good now :)</p>

Later that day watching <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> someone posted an article titled 27 signs you&#39;re a starseed then later the next day there was someone that posted some letter to playedian starseed and it piqued my interest haha</p>

<p>I have very similar mullings.  I seek for this in others around me.  To those close to &quot;having it&quot;, I need educate ... little by little.  </p>

Can woman exist without man?<br/>
Can the individual exist without the species?<br/>
Can the species exist without the individual?
What does it fully mean to be part of something greater than you?<br/>
What is the range/domain of balance?  </p>

<p>The individual is so incredibly temporary by comparison to the species ... the ego mind is sad.  The real mind gains clarity.  Does everyone play the same role/part?  Intuitively, we say &quot;of course not!&quot;, but still ... we want to be That, have That, get That.  Yet, here, we are, we sit(?). </p>

<p>I believe and yammer about so many things.  It is a thing without words, without vocabulary.  However, to name the thing is maybe to take away from the thing ... for as soon as it is named, it&#39;s opposite is also true.  So entwined, all the things.  It means so much ... and yet ... it is nothing.  At this time, I believe this is a sort of unspoken tradition that exists within the human species.  I am finding it spurred and stimulated in me ... age + info + &#39;other&#39;.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s worth it to slow down and really try to take this information and apply it to your immediate experience, right now, where you are.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of your life, what is the <em>one</em> thing that has never changed? Your body changed, your idea of yourself changed, your idea of the world changed, your relationships changed, but what <em>didn&#39;t</em> change?</p>

<p>Your entire understanding of yourself and the world has happened <em>within</em> the changeless. That &#39;changelessness&#39; is consciousness. It is the experiential manifestation of energy becoming self aware. Every person you&#39;ve ever known is that, and only that. All else that we <em>think</em> we are, and all else that we <em>think</em> others are, is and always has been a total illusion. </p>

<p>Consider a TV. When we sit down to watch TV, we turn the TV on. Within the totality of the TV screen, we see a story, a show, with colors, shapes, people, relationships, narratives, and so on. But that entire TV show and all of its happenings have happened <em>within</em> the totality of the screen, itself. What you are is the screen; not the show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, man.</p>

<p>Your thoughts are your own in the sense that they are happening to you and to you only. But that doesn&#39;t mean that they <em>are</em> you. You are the life-force in which they appear. That life force can recognize itself once the ego-mind/identity dissipates. I&#39;d suggest meditating, or sitting in silence, for at least 15 minutes a day. See if you can become more and more relaxed, and see what comes of that. Once you start opening up, truth becomes much more easily understood and recognized. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still struggling to feel grounded again. I&#39;m happy for the awakening but it&#39;s not an easy thing to go through.</p>

<p>Listen to your mind and body and take a break when needed.</p>

<p>If you have a loved one who you can trust 100% then ask them to keep an eye out for you getting too far down the rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree.  To an extent.</p>

<p>I think each generation does indeed believe it is the most woke. For the time, they are because as we draw nearer to whatever is coming, more and more wake up. A hundred years from now, they may very well think that...because even more will be awake at that time.  IF mankind has that amount of time.</p>

<p>But special, we are not. We&#39;re recipients of a beautiful gift and it is our duty to spread the word and guide others out of their slumber. </p>

<p>IMHO these people face two barriers to this knowledge (and it&#39;s value)</p>

<p>Firstly, most <em>haven&#39;t even given it a thought</em> in the first place</p>

<p>But, if they have, chances are they&#39;re overwhelmed with the problems they do see and have no &#39;answers&#39; to these problems so they go and stick their collective heads in <del>the sand</del> Netflix <em>and chill</em> ,, becoz <em>that&#39;s all they&#39;ve been taught to do!</em></p>

<p>As much as I love this idea;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>once we recognize that none of us, as individuals, are special because none of us, as individuals, even exist.. that is when real change will come. That is when humanity will begin living through the heart, rather than through the mind.

<p>I&#39;ve become older and more cynical about the &#39;nature&#39; of the &#39;average human&#39;</p>

<p>Human&#39;s on the whole are a selfish race of animals who <em>will fuck you up</em> to improve their day!</p>

<p>e.g. there&#39;s no shortage of Redditors who are studying or working in &quot;business/finance&quot; of all types <em>who think</em> they&#39;re &quot;woke&quot; becoz they know about the scam the Federal reserve is .. and yet <em>they perpetuate that very system</em> simply by participating!</p>

<p>It&#39;s like soldiers in a civil war, are they going to <em>kill their own people</em> just becoz they have &quot;orders&quot; to do so? </p>

<p>Sadly yes!  Becoz those fools <em>think</em> that they will be granted some form of exception <em>becoz they&#39;re the enforcers!</em></p>

<p>Just like the financiers <em>think</em> they will &#39;get out&#39; <em>before</em> TSHTF! </p>

<p>most &quot;people&quot; on the whole are just too selfish to evev think about &quot;loving the world&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One pertinent thing I have observed in our contemporary struggle is that the current crisis we are experiencing with identity politics is a direct symptom of our collective inability to ignore our minds telling us what we we are, as opposed to just living it. So we reaffirm our existence by &quot;identifying&quot; with something and discarding everything that isn&#39;t that thing, thereby isolating ourselves (usually unconsciously) from everything that is.</p>

<p>The process of becoming conscious is a difficult one, one which usually requires a total (if slow) disintegration of our mental identity. For many people this is a distracting and terrorising prospect, because they fear losing what they are. But in losing who you are and seeing what is left you realise there was nothing to lose in the first place, and you become able to become fully conscious.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that being &quot;awakened&quot; is neither the permanent nor preferred state of being that many writings on this topic would suggest, but rather a momentary lapse in our everyday continuity that gives us the spiritual wherewithal to continue existing in our otherwise complicated lives in a way that allows us to thoroughly appreciate everything that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone has a spiritual &quot;bone&quot; in their body. Anyone who says they don&#39;t is in complete and utter denial. Glad you&#39;ve found yours. We mortals don&#39;t know anything. Everything we do is ultimately based on faith and hope. I&#39;ve definitely had my share of major spiritual awakenings. I fell you <a href="/u/Rage_harles">/u/Rage_harles</a>. Despite the massive connections you&#39;ve made with, spirit, or whatever you want to call it, it can still fell real lonely not being able to bring others along.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a wacky personal anecdote. I believe I have convened directly with &quot;God&quot; or &quot;The Creator,&quot; on two occasions. First I got to ask lots of questions and got lots of answers. Second time, well, I was told to build &quot;The Ark.&quot; But without the sense of urgency of the last one, and got very different directions. It&#39;s sort of a, &quot;You&#39;ll know when it&#39;s time.&quot; situation. I imagine that will be the third time, when I&#39;ll get the specifics. If or when that happens. I&#39;ll let you all know, worry not. I heard about a guy in the news who got the same directions, in his own way, so I&#39;m not alone in this. Other than that, divine intervention or guidance is a regular thing for me. Pretty much on a daily basis. To the point where it&#39;s distractingly annoying. Yet at times, I&#39;ll go asking for it still. With out fail, it&#39;ll come in it&#39;s, &quot;the lord works in mysterious ways,&quot; fashion. This is all just the tip of the iceberg. It&#39;s all too irregular and beneficial to be schizophrenia. Can&#39;t rule it out though. Even I take all this with a huge grain of salt. So yea. The path of enlightenment is a total trip. Seems like you are but, if you&#39;re not meditating yet, definitely start. Amazingly powerful practice you can pretty much use for anything. </p>

<p>In any case. Regrettably I have a hard time believing the majority, or all people will wake up and suddenly see reality for what it is, ever after. I certainly remain hopeful and optimistic towards this. I must remain realistic too, keeping human history in mind. Granted this kind of thought is becoming far more mainstream. It&#39;s also coopted, curtailed, used for personal gain, and thus adding to the illusion.</p>

<p>This sort of thing, in the state we&#39;re currently in, can&#39;t be shown or explained to people. You&#39;ll end up being ostracized at best, martyred at worst if you try. Hasn&#39;t stopped some people, so go for it if that&#39;s what you think you should do. It&#39;s all something people must seek out and find on their own. It takes truly massive intentional and conscious effort, over entire lifetimes. Even then it&#39;s transient.</p>

<p>This all sounds very, &quot;heaven on earth.&quot; That&#39;s simply not what earth, this realm, is for. This realm is a proving ground, a test. If we awake, then later on, &quot;in the next life,&quot; we&#39;ll have what you&#39;re talking about. Your thoughts hold though. We are having lots of people wake up, without a doubt. Only a few will stay awake and manage to make a difference in this world in their lifetimes. I&#39;d like to think that&#39;s us but sometimes plain old survival gets in the way.</p>

<p>We&#39;d be lucky to get exactly half of humanity thinking this way. That would be great!</p>

<p>Good argument in the documentary &quot;unacknowledged.&quot; I think the &quot;alien&quot; revelation is coming soon. Peak oil and water are coming. When they do, aliens will &quot;coincidentally&quot; show up officially. We&#39;ve been getting primed for over 50 years now. I think the powers that be might be waiting for the first priming generation to die off. This way they don&#39;t have to worry about grandpa being around to set people straight and rest fears. Aliens would really wake up huge numbers of people. Will it be the critical mass we need, maybe. But there&#39;s a lot of prep work being done to ensure it&#39;s a controlled, fear-based release, rather than enlightenment. It&#39;s just too much of a chore to keep it hidden much longer. Even for the incredibly powerful people running things.</p>

<p>See you all around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think this should be listed under conspiracy.  These are some pretty deep thoughts which, as you are correct, have come out much more commonly over the last few years.  People are starting to &quot;awaken&quot; literally and figuratively, to the fact that the world is somewhat illusionary.  (Illusionary is not a word but it sounded right).  That being said, do you remember growing up and everything was SOOO innocent...like...the world was unquestioned because you didnt know to question it?  Than, as you get older, you start wondering about things...like...why did that person die, or why does that person hurt people...Than, you probably did a lot of things that you are guilty of because you don&#39;t understand consequence.  Than, as you grow older, you look back on these moments and feel guilt because you realized now, what you did was wrong.  Now, a 30 something, I am in total understanding of my mortality. I believe that the moment I was born, it started a clock (However long the time was), that will eventually hit zero, and I will go back to whatever cosmic plain of existence I came from.  We are all one entity with different &quot;consciousnesses.&quot; Its a very eye opening, cold water in the face, feeling when you come to the realization of life and existence.  So many people live in a world of illusion and do HORRIBLE things to one another not realizing that...in due time....there is a bigger/better or worse place that we all end up.  i have a son and a beautiful wife.  I live to make sure they are happy and taken care of.  I love myself because I am MYSELF.  I love my wife and my son because they are the world to me.  Stay humble, stay good, and realize that, no matter how much wealth you have, no matter how many friends you have....your coffin is only 6 ft by 2ft.  Cant take much with you and death is a natural process you go at alone.  Go out and be kind to everyone.  Everyone deserves a chance.  Someone may look happy but you don&#39;t know what others may be going through.  Whether you earn 10MM a year or 10/hr, we all have a story.  be nice to everyone.  They deserve it.  Dont wallow in the past.  What you have done in the past is just that, the past.  Think about all the good you can accomplish.  Be a good person for tomorrow may not come for all of us.  </p>

<p>Godspeed and much love!</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I am just curious if anyone else has gone through a sudden awakening </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 2013 I had such an experience while sitting at work, which is why I fondly call it my &quot;cubicle epiphany.&quot; Later on I learned about the Zen concept of <em>satori</em> and felt that thsi described my experience very accurately. A sudden, accidental, inexplicable tipping of the scales followed by a radical shift in perspective. </p>

<p>Nothing changed, externally speaking, but internally everything changed and remains so to this day. </p>

<p>As for part two of your question, I feel that a &quot;Great Awakening&quot; is more possible now than ever before. I mean, rare individuals have been waking up and trying to wake up their neighbours since the dawn of history, and probably before then. And every time one of these Outsiders emerges from the wilderness with a piece of the Good News, what happens? Secular authorities defame, murder, or hijack the teachings for their own purposes. But now we have means of communicating directly, instantly with one another. We can go to the source ourselves instead of relying on second- third- and fourth-hand accounts which have been heavily edited and curated by individuals with ulterior motives...</p>

<p>So yes, possible, but not inevitable, not assured. For as you pointed out, it&#39;s one thing to grasp all of this intellectually and quite another to experience it firsthand. Moreover, waking up is only the first step--second, and much harder, is <strong>staying</strong> awake. This requires discipline, practice, and constant monitoring of one&#39;s psyche. Such labour is, in my experience, never ending, though it certainly becomes easier with time and dedication. </p>

<p>Despite being dedicated to study and practice over four years, I still catch myself dozing off all the time, being swept away by irrational ideas and emotions, losing sight of the true and concerning myself with the illusory...</p>

<p>But as I tell people, any progress in this area, and I mean ANY whatsoever, pays huge dividends. And there are so many tools, so many practices, to many teachers just waiting to reveal their secrets--it has never been a better time to wake up :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. Mine started with FBIanon last summer then devoting countless hours to /cfg/ then , pharma, finance, politics, conspiracy, and now &#39;spirituality&#39; (not religious but scientific such as vibrations and electromagnetic waves).

    <div class="md"><p>I can do deny it. People report the &quot;awakening&quot; in every generation, in reality it&#39;s just the same thing over and over. It&#39;s just the same as each generation thinking they invented sex and rebellion. </p>

<p>Also, yes, we do know (approximately) when the age of aquarius begins. The ages refer to the procession of the equanoxes, you cN literally see in the sky which age we are in and it&#39;s not aquarius. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating. I&#39;ve never met another lesser Neanderthal before. What the hell are we?</p>

<p>I can tell you from my experiences I don&#39;t believe I am the same breed of Homosapein as most of the population. I say this not with ego, or because I believe I&#39;m special or anything like that, but merely because I&#39;ve felt something my entire life telling me I&#39;m not the same as others. When I got my DNA test and found out I have less than .5% Neanderthal gene as the rest of the population that kind of felt like validation that maybe there is something to this feeling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 1/4 Greek, 1/4 Italian on my Mom&#39;s side but the gene-line is consistent - meaning my Italian and Greek ancestors were at one point the same tribe, and the gene-line was merely reconnected with the birth of my Mother. This DNA supposedly traces back to Mesopotamia about 40,000 years (which by modern standards of time telling means this is a fairly ancient gene-line as this was also when Neanderthal&#39;s were wiped out). I also have 0.3% Sardinian which is a rare island gene-line.</p>

<p>On my Dad&#39;s side, I&#39;m a Northern European consisting of a little bit of German, French, British, and Irish. His gene-line is about 12,000 years old. Most Europeans are of this gene-line. Although I am less than &lt; 0.1% 
Ashkenazi Jewish which I did not know until they reanalyzed my DNA recently. This gene-line supposedly traces back to just 4 different unrelated women, and is also incredibly rare.</p>

<p>My understanding of the true nature of our history is in its infancy, but if you believe Atlantis was in Doggerland, that would mean my Father and most of modern Europeans are likely descendants of Atlantis which was potentially wiped out about 12,800 years ago. Most of that gene-line is common aside from that touch of Ashkenazi Jewish which is incredibly rare, and traces back to an area in modern day North Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>On my Mom&#39;s side, I&#39;m an Athenian on her Dad&#39;s side, and Southern Italian on her Moms but before that it is hard to say. If this gene-line truly dates back to Mesopotamia then theres a number of ancient possibilities. I take after her both physically, mentally, and spiritually.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always felt a great empathy for others, yet always felt like I was another breed or species almost at the same time. Typical group-think, and hive mind mentalities don&#39;t really work on me, and never have. I have always seen the world differently than others, including my own parents. I can absolutely connect into the collective consciousness of humanity, but it is like I&#39;m on another frequency most of the time. When I do tap into the frequencies everyone else is on it can be a very overwhelming experience (still learning how to shield myself and protect myself from others energy but I&#39;m slowly getting better at it).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve known from a very young age I wasn&#39;t like the other kids, and they sensed it as well. When I was a kid, I was considered &quot;gifted&quot; but as I became older that soon turned to &quot;troubled&quot;, and my 20&#39;s were a rollercoaster ride of suffering, personal development, and some incredible successes of things that really shouldn&#39;t have been possible.</p>

<p>I had my first awakening about 4-years ago during a group meditation, but probably didn&#39;t have my second one until a few years later. Recently, I&#39;ve experienced 3 charkas or energy centers or whatever you want to call them awaken or become available to me through a combo of kundalini yoga, and wim hof breathing techniques combined with meditation and cannabis. Been through a lot of healing in the past several months, and as I improve I continue to experience more and more frequent and intense physical awakenings.</p>

<p>What&#39;s your story?</p>
