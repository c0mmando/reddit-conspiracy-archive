       JRR Tolkien, along with CS Lewis and others, was a member of a society of writers known as the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inklings">
        Inklings
       </a>
       . They wrote books that exposed Satanism and control by the elites through metaphors, with the Lord of the Rings and Chronicles as the most prominent examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Two Towers  represent the two pillars of Freemasonry, as does the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron on the top. They also may represent the French and English Grand Lodges that competed for many centuries for dominance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ring of Power represents dark occultism. Its only real power is to make the wearer invisible (symbols to hide one's intentions from the public) but it makes one visible to the Ring Wraiths (other dark occultists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the Ring corrupts the wearer, and none have been able to completely destroy dark occultism. Isildur's name means "devoted to the moon" a reference to ISIS worship. His failure to destroy the ring could refer to the failure of the Israelites to destroy the dark occultists in Babylon (or many other historical events).
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">
        Silmarillion
       </a>
       is an expansion of the lore and contains many hidden truths. It refers to an ancient Island kingdom (Atlantis) that was destroyed when they failed to kill the leader of the evil forces, and he slowly corrupted them, until their island was destroyed, and they fled to the ends of Middle Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago, a previously lost
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p7jFcnnE4U">
        recording
       </a>
       of JRR Tolkien was recovered. In it, he explains how the Lord of the Rings is actually a metaphor for the evil people ruling the world; there are followers of the evil wizards, and the good people of the world (hobbits) need to work together to defeat them.

       These are great parallels you've pointed out. I would add that the Lord of the Rings is Saturn and is in fact what the Freemasons draw much of their symbolism from.

       Yes, I would add that Saturn is Nimrod. Ive been researching the Mystery Babylon and Saturn worship for a bit now, and I believe that Saturn is representative of Nimrod. It is possible that since Uranus is a Titan, perhaps Nimrod's father Cush was also a giant, maybe how Melkor is a giant compared to Sauron?

       I think it's unlikely that Cush was a Nephilim. Noah's 3 sons were brought onto the Ark because they weren't a product of the Nephilim. So it would have to be basically the 1st generation of offspring off the ark (Ham then Cush) corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a possibility, however. And it would explain why Nimrod instituted Mystery Babylon.

       Well we know that the sons of Cain were destroyed but what about the daughters of Cain? Maybe the curse of Ham is that he mated with a daughter of Cain, maybe his mother. Nimrod marries his mother, which I think is part of the reason why royalty does too, to maintain a high amount of Nephilim DNA, some claim this is annunaki.

       A natural disaster. There's a lot of flooding recorded in various countries. If you really need to find a flood for the benefit of making the story work, I would recommend changing the timeline to an earlier point, prior to the inundation of the Mediterranean basin.

       Like what? The complete absence of any other country outside of the tiny little area of the middle east? Or the incorrect notions of origin, which should by rights, be perfect in every detail if indeed the story is from the supreme intelligence that has a fixation with a forth rate star and the minute rock in orbit? Maybe the time that all of the dead in a town came back to life and took to the streets, and yet is somehow absent from all other contemporary records?
      </p>

       It's a fable for the powerful to control the population. No more, no less.

       yes the creation myth is confusing... but what i'm confused about is why you said that it was an incorrect account of our creation. so i want to know which parts are incorrect. if you're going to say "all of it" then maybe you can offer a better alternative.

       Let us take as an example, women. Ecumenical devices demand that the origin of woman is a bit of a rib. We are mammals. We are all merely clever bald animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doubtless you will counter with "but no-one really knows" but it is a dishonest position to take to demand all the evidence that is contrary to writings of late neolithic and early bronze age nomadic farmers be disregarded because it is not in line with a book that was written by a series of committees for the purpose of introducing praise/punishment for believing/disbelieving.

       The "evidence" in the archaeological record is very clear - no such place as nazareth at the time of the events depicted in the bible. No great mass of people who spent forty years in the desert. No contemporary reports of miracles or Jesus (Josephus' account has been discredited as a much later addition)

       Certainly not trolling. It seems that the make believe world view with which you have saturated your judgement is preventing you from considering the possibility that the whole cosmogonic scheme is the biggest conspiracy of all. One which you are willing to sacrifice logic to.

       As with most Christians you're probably cherry picking the parts of the bible that suit your agenda and support your ideas and ideals - you're most likely not truly following the word of the book because it's a mass of contradictions, a mess of philosophies that read like a palimpsest of a developing ideology and an ideology is all it is. Not a genuine set of records of an historical individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider Saul. His moment of revelation - temporary blindness, disassociative voices, hypnogogic visions and temporary paralysis all read like a description of a seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the contemporary reports outside of the bible? All of the reports are written outside of the eyewitness period. Josephus has been added to after his death to lend credibility to the early church. We know that it isn't Josephus writing as it isn't structured in the same way as his other writings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The council of Nicea conducted the most obvious manipulation of texts - gone are the accounts of Jesus killing children, and the equality of women. It's been edited to suit the agenda of the church and the men who ran it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up next: morality is possible without an imaginary friend to celebrate your actions after your death.

       I know that you mean this as an insult as pride in the mythology of your religion is a "sin", but telling someone who sees through the ecumenical devices and orchestrated suppression of people who are not questioning of the "faith" and the people who run it for their own power and money, doesn't actually carry any weight as an insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your reply is also notable for the lack of any evidence of the existence of god to merely a handful of powerless personal slights. I would go so far as to point out the pride you have in your faith that means you can accept the obviously impossible without question. You are proud of not challenging the status quo of the religious institutions because it might have an effect on the post-mortem reward for living your life with restrictions imposed by a succession of men desperate for power and money. That's really something to be proud of, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not challenging your church about the vast sums of money they extort from their followers, hoard and invest in the stock market for profit, while the teachings in the bible point to getting the money out of the churches and into actually helping people who need help without reference to the need to believe, then you are merely an instrument of financial support to the enormously rich churches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenge the authority of the church and the people who run it. It will make you more Christ like. I you won't, because you're cowed by being dazzled by the promise of heaven and terrified by being damned into hell. Both of which are substantially lacking in evidence of existing.
      </p>

       Be like your christ figure and fight the inequality, misery and suffering that the church enables, perpetuates and survives on.

       It's amazing, but nowhere in that did I state "all", but to deny the wealth of the institutions of religion is plain old lying, which is a sin, according to the bible.

      <p>
       Let's consider the value of religion in America, for example... The religious industry, and it is an industry, is worth $378B a year - but that is just the religious institutions. That's all tax free. When the broader picture of industries which are faith based is taken in to consideration, the figure is roughly $1T. One trillion. Literally enough to resolve 99.999% of social problems in the US alone, but that's primarily being used to line the pockets of people involved in the scam. That's terribly sad.

        You spent 20 minutes projecting memes you heard from others. Could have saved that time and just typed "Brains!" because you're an unthinking, unconscious zombie who will believe ANYTHING you are told if it appeals to your intellectual pride.

       Sorry, is that where you finish? With a childish insult. How weak. Nothing actually positive, just impotent ranting.

       Where's the rest of your rebuttal? Why have you chosen to cherry pick these bits? It's almost as if cherry picking is a way of life for you.

       I think it's probably best for you to get back to your make believe escapist fantasy rather than challenge the institutions of religion that are clearly corrupt, clearly run for the ego and personal power of the people running them.

       From my personal experience the bible is a description of how our consciousness creates this reality. I dont know if this subreddit is home to users that believe this type of stuff but there is some truth here. The truth is in the words and the bible is all about words. Anyone experience similar realisations to me?

       I haven't been able to figure it out. The towers seem to be Freemasonry, so England or France would make sense. Washington is possible, but why is it surrounded by mountains, and why is the tower there?

       Tolkien was also clear that his books were incomplete allegories, and they jump around a bit, and sometimes contain multiple metaphors (Gandalf is one of the wizards, but his battle with the Balrog is like Jesus' harrowing of hell).

       Could the Two Towers be representative of the obelisks in Washington DC and London City? There seem to be more than a couple layers to the potential allegorical meanings as to why D.C. could be Saruman and England representing Sauron.

       I think JK Rowling is doing similar things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her latest movie, Fantastic Beasts, is overtly about MK Ultra. The kid gets "beaten" and "becomes angry" so he "loses control of his magic."
      </p>
      <p>
       She also throws in some symbols of the light occultists, indicating to me that she is probably one of them.

       I have been reading Spivey over the years and he used to have some good points. Now I find him largely sticking out a begging bowl lying his server costs and spending his days with some ridiculous face comparison software. Most of his old good stuff seems to have been lifted from elsewhere anyway. Plus you need to decode his slang, which even as a cockney I can't

       Yes agreed. And haven't we all heard about that non stop since? Plus, of course, the eternal begging bowl. Back when he was good I would have donated. Now, no chance. The guy is a busted flush. Far better sites out there with real integrity who don't swear every third word

       I know this is very late but first awesome post and I am fully on board. Secondly, it makes so much sense. The Hobbits are seen as the little guys to everything bigger than them... But yet they are tasked with the most responsible task and deliver in the end.

       “My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch.”

       That's because Hobbits, above all other races, lack the desire for power. Frodo especially, that's why he was able to resist the power of the ring relatively easily.

       "Found in a French museum with an inscribed attribution on the frame saying it was by Lewis Carroll and of Lorina Liddell, it shows an “uneasy” pubescent model in her teenage years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expert analysis shows it was taken around the time Carroll was seeing the Liddells, using the same processes he is known to have used in photography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparison with other photographs of Lorina are said to show “certain similarities”, though the truth about the picture cannot be proved for certain more than a century after the author’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prof Hugh Haughton, one of the contributors to the programme, said the photograph – if it was taken by Carroll – was a “shocking image”, with the author’s relationship with the Liddell girls known to have a “huge intensity” which would be “pretty strange now”."

       What did he go through? I'm a huge Tolkien fan but I don't know much about CS Lewis. I used to love the Chronicles as a kid, just waiting to re-read the with my kids now. Also, even as a kid I remember feeling weird about all the occult stuff in the Chronicles....Aslan's sacrifice and the magician's ring (was that I thing? I forget)

       Aslan was like Jesus; basically.  ANyway, look up CS Lewis books The Screwtape Letters (about a lessor demons attempt to "possess" a man) and the book Mere Christianity. Amazing books.  The love of his life and he were finally married when they were both older, and they only got to spend a few short years together before she passed away from cancer.  He almost lost his faith from it and wrote about his sorrow,questioning his faith and God.  Its very raw, real and human and I love that he never gave up on God.

       Because it's not an allegory to Jesus. The only thing they have in common is their resurrection. Gandalf is the equivalent to an angel, more literally a servant of a specific God in the pantheon (Manwe).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason he was sent back was because Saruman failed in his task as the leader of the Wizards and became corrupted by the ring, so Gandalf took over his title of the white wizard because he was the only one to stay true to his cause.

       I LOVE all of Tolkien middle earth, and I always wondered about the different parallels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that there are 5 towers: Cirith Until, Orthanac, Minas Tirith, Minas Morgul and Barad-Dur. I think it was always kind of up in the air which towers were "The Two Towers"- the movies assumed Orthanac (Saruman) and Barad-Dur (Sauron).
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on one's interpretation, it might be fun to draw parallels between WashingtonDc London, the Vatican, and??????

       Interesting. Another theory I've found says it might have been Cirith Ungol and Orthanac as both had people (Frodo in IV, Saruman in III) stranded at the top of them at the end of books 3 and 4 within the book. It's apparently a debate that's raged since like 1954 though haha

       It's a shame that despite the fact that the elites are so deeply spiritually dark, we can't confront them the same way epic heroes do. We also have to learn to use occultism.

       The modern telling started with "weird tales" a magazine in the 20's by robert e. howard who wrote the conan series.

       The real king Conan was a Cambrian king (now Wales) Obviously the more fantastic sides of the retelling are a lot to accept but its most definitely a part of druidic folklore of fighting the snakes/serpent of giants and all manner of fantasy.

       Very interesting theory! I just want to add a point to the discussion: It was Peter Jackson who created the now - iconic visual of the Eye of Sauron on the top of Barad-dûr. I remember reading somewhere (I'll try and fish out the interview and post a source) that he needed something to be a physical representation of Sauron throughout the films. Before the trilogy, Barad-dûr was just a fortress. The 'eye' was just in the minds of the various characters who became influenced by the ring.

       Yes, the physical eye of Sauron was simply a physical representation of Sauron. He didn't have a physical form at the time, but that doesn't translate well to a movie. (In my opinion, this was a brilliant way to represent it.)

       He does have a physical form at the time (in Tolkien). Gollum is tortured by Sauron, whom he (Gollum) describes as having nine fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative of spy networks or such reporting up to a physical Sauron in Mordor wouldn't have been as compelling on film, so they took liberties with that.

       It seems like you haven't actually read LOTR.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, the Ring has much more power than just invisibility. If anyone wears it who knows how to use it, it would enable them to conquer the world. That's why they make Frodo carry it, because he can't unlock it's true potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the island kingdom (Numenor) was not destroyed because they failed to kill Sauron. The armies of Numenor came to fight him, but Sauron surrendered after seeing their might. They take him prisoner to their island and over the years he convinces them to invade what is essentially heaven. So their island is destroyed by a divine reprisal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if we're discussing LOTR symbolism, I think two very important subjects are the rings and the wizards, because they play a massive role in the story. The rings are powerful artifacts Sauron gave out to many races as gifts, but he tricked them and crafted the One Ring which acted as a sort of master control and bent them to his will.  The five wizards are basically angels (called Maiar) sent by God (called Manwe) to help the mortal races fight Sauron. Saruman is eventually corrupted by power and forms an alliance with Sauron, and only Gandalf fulfills his duty of battling Sauron head on. So what do you guys think those represent?

       You see Gandalf the Grey (then later the White) and Saruman the White in all three Lord of the Rings movies and all three Hobbit movies. You can't have missed those two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Radagast the Brown is only seen in the Hobbit films. He's the guy with the bunny sled and bird-shit on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two blue wizards are mentioned in the first Hobbit movie, in the rainy scene soon after the group leaves the Shire. Gandalf says to Bilbo that he forgets the two blue wizards names. This is a joke because Tolkien never came up with a definitive version of their names, and each revision of his works has new names for them.

       When you construct a book as symbolism or metaphor for something else it is easy for the metaphor to break down and stop making sense. Sometimes you have to fill in the blanks, or just fill it with narrative and entertainment like a normal book otherwise people won't read it nor will it make any sense.

       It might be a reference to Isis worship, but definitely not ISIS worship, because the acronym ISIS has nothing to do with the Egyptian goddess Isis. ISIS is only possible acronym of the terrorist organization's title, and is in English anyway whereas the title of the group would be in Arabic.

       The real answer is that 99% of people are not involved. I'm
       <strong>
        sure
       </strong>
       there are Masons that practice dark magic, I am also
       <strong>
        sure
       </strong>
       that the overwhelming majority of Masons do not practice.

       The occult is fascinating to me, but I do not practice.
And i've actively tried to find people who do.

       Well, they're one of the reasons people say that most Freemasons don't know what the higher levels are doing.

       This is awesome. I've always thought there was a hidden message behind Tolkien's saga, and I have always tried to make parrallels with the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought that the hobbits, elves, dwarves could be the goyim (with the LOTR races being the main religious groups in real life, or different ethnic groups, such as the caucasians, the Africans, the eastern Asians etc). The orcs would be you know who, the nazgul would be the zionists, mordor would be that small state in middle-east, isengard would be washington. Sauron would be the BIS. The ring would be international finance, or the power to print fiat currencies.

       . They quite look alike, so that's an easy one. Unless it's his mate Soros.

       I haven't figured where would be mount doom yet, and who Mr Fraudo is. Maybe he's not around yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit I'm probably a little off here. And I don't know well enough about the details of the saga to make all the parrallels.

       I've often felt that Numenor was comparable to the idea of Atlantis and that has only strengthened listening to Graham Hancocks interpretation of the myths.

       I think it's unlikely that Cush was a Nephilim. Noah's 3 sons were brought onto the Ark because they weren't a product of the Nephilim. So it would have to be basically the 1st generation of offspring off the ark (Ham then Cush) corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a possibility, however. And it would explain why Nimrod instituted Mystery Babylon.

       Sauron wasnt a puppet. During the 3rd age, Melkor was long gone. Sauron was the remaining evil superpower. He wasnt controlled by Melkor anymore, he was acting on his own.

       Yes agreed. And haven't we all heard about that non stop since? Plus, of course, the eternal begging bowl. Back when he was good I would have donated. Now, no chance. The guy is a busted flush. Far better sites out there with real integrity who don't swear every third word
