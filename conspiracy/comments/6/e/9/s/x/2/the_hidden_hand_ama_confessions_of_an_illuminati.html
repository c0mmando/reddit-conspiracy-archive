<p>I&#39;ve posted this before many times in some comments and discussions with users on the subreddit, largely because out of the many LARPs that we have read throughout the years, this one is still possibly the most convincing of all of them.  The Hidden Hand interviews were conducted on Above Top Secret back in October 2008 by someone purported to be a member of one of the 13 Bloodline families in an AMA-style interview discussing the true plans and the motivations of the ruling Elite.  Some very big concepts are discussed here (those of you who have studied <a href="http://www.lawofone.info">The Law of One/Ra Material</a> will have no problem understanding it) and &quot;HH&quot; lays it out from a position of deep knowledge and legit authority on this subject.  Obviously since this was written almost 10 years ago, some of the information inside isn&#39;t entirely accurate anymore, but to this day I have yet to come across a better window into the motivations and true goals of the Luciferian/Saturnalian Elite.  Enjoy.</p>

<p>Thank god these guys chose ATS to bless with this opportunity. </p>

<p>HH: Our Lineage can be traced back beyond antiquity. From the earliest times of your recorded &quot;history&quot;, and beyond, our Family has been &#39;directing&#39; the &#39;play&#39; from behind the scenes, in one way or another. Before the rise and fall of Atlantis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>still not living in totalitarian NWO movie apocalypses. why these guys so slow? he then goes on to talk about breeding when essentially they are all massively inbred and EVERYONE is their relative if theyve been around since before Atlantis.</p>

<p>fails on his prediction about collapse of economy</p>

<p>fails on his prediction about NAU. about new currency</p>

<p>fails on his prediction about nibiru coming 2012</p>

<p>this is essentially a spiritual / mystical / mythical focused 9 year old LARP with little &quot;future happenings&quot; accurate type predictions or anything. obviously he had caveats to the interview that would allow essentially anyone whos well read in this stuff to do one of these if they so wished. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, he avoided putting specific dates and times on any sort of specific events (the 2012 thing was technically wrong, but the esoteric / spiritual &quot;Apocalypse&quot; and its meaning is very open to interpretation), and also said that plans were subject to change depending on how certain things played out within the factions of the Illuminati itself.  It&#39;s entirely plausible that he could be a fake, but it&#39;s fairly unlikely considering how considered and informative his replies were.  Nobody just makes all that shit up on the spot, and people in real time on the thread were trying to trip him up constantly to prove he was a fraud and failed every time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what im saying though. someone who is well read on the subject matter (e.g. any researcher whos serious) could pull of an anonymous &quot;insider&quot; LARP and then simply dismiss any serious questions with &quot;cant for sake of anonymity, plans always changing, this is 50% disinfo on purpose so i dont get caught by NSA and killed&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this guy conducted a two or three-day interview just for funsies and went through all that trouble for no reason?  That&#39;s a little unlikely.  I&#39;m sure he lied about a few things (considering his stated nature as a Luciferian), but that doesn&#39;t mean what he was saying in general wasn&#39;t true.  There&#39;s a big difference between a three-paragraph 4chan LARP and this.  What with the goal be for this in particular?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Page views for a public BBS/forum he has no stake in?  I&#39;m not buying it.  And considering a lot of what he said lines up with the Law Of One material and what other researchers like Corey Goode and David Wilcock have talked about, I think it&#39;s more than just a standard LARP.  There&#39;s an incredible amount of detail in his descriptions and explanations of widely held esoteric concepts that don&#39;t just come from somebody mildly interested in this for fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I read this. If this is the person who says their job is to play the evil role so the good guys rise up, then its the one I read. </p>

<p>The one thing to remember is that this can easily be a psyop. I know a lot of what this person is talking about but he is mixing up a lot of fiction in his post. Also, people who gravitate to the negatively polarized section become insane so if this person is indeed a very bad person, he is also very insane. That stuff about Yawhey is BS too. There is no Yawhey God. Yawhey is just a name that was attributed to God by Moses 5000 years ago. We can call Bob or anything we want. </p>

<p>I was thinking this is more of a psyop. It sounds to me like this person was well trained on what to say so that we will end up accepting the Illuminate role in this world like its something good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, he clearly has an extremely deep understanding of these subjects, much more than the average LARP.  He was insanely consistent, and if you look at how the ATS thread actually evolved, they tried many times to trip him up and expose himself as a fake, and he <em>never</em> slipped.  I don&#39;t care how good of a LARPer you are, that&#39;s pretty tough.  There is something to say about the fact that he openly identifies as a Luciferian, and as we all know they are all about deceit and trickery, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s at least a few blatantly false morsels in there to muddy the waters and provide plausible deniability.  I would say that a large majority of it is very much true, or he at least believes it to be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I do believe he is a Luciferian from the Illuminati. That part I do believe but I think he is also deliberately giving false information in the process only to make us think the Illuminati are some sort of a necessary evil in the world. It&#39;s a subtle manipulation. They mix truth with fiction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  I think he made it pretty clear that his intentions and the intentions of the Illuminati were definitely negative, but he did a good job of explaining how they are in some ways a necessary evil in the esoteric grand scheme of things to provide balance and a choice of service to yourself or others.  I think he said &quot;We exist to show you what you are not&quot;, i.e., we have to be completely and utterly &#39;evil&#39; so you can realize your own inherent divinity, or something to that effect.  Ultimately he isn&#39;t wrong when he says that we are literally all just parts of a greater whole, and &quot;behind the scenes&quot; we are all fully aware of our roles within &quot;the Great Game&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea Dont beleive it, i started a UFO alien abduction hoax on ATS 15 years ago before being abducted forever by the men in black. And the skeptics of my story  who called bullshit (and gave all the exact right reasons why it was bullshit) were accused of being disinformation agents.... &quot;But it cant be a fake story, the details are so similier to the other abduction accounts!&quot;
Hate me all you want but I learned a valuable lesson about the value of real evidence and how easy it is for a teenage sci- fi nerd to create a hoax.</p>
