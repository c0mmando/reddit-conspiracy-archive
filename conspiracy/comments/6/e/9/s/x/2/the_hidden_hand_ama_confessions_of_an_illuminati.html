       I've posted this before many times in some comments and discussions with users on the subreddit, largely because out of the many LARPs that we have read throughout the years, this one is still possibly the most convincing of all of them.  The Hidden Hand interviews were conducted on Above Top Secret back in October 2008 by someone purported to be a member of one of the 13 Bloodline families in an AMA-style interview discussing the true plans and the motivations of the ruling Elite.  Some very big concepts are discussed here (those of you who have studied
       <a href="http://www.lawofone.info">
        The Law of One/Ra Material
       </a>
       will have no problem understanding it) and "HH" lays it out from a position of deep knowledge and legit authority on this subject.  Obviously since this was written almost 10 years ago, some of the information inside isn't entirely accurate anymore, but to this day I have yet to come across a better window into the motivations and true goals of the Luciferian/Saturnalian Elite.  Enjoy.

       this is essentially a spiritual / mystical / mythical focused 9 year old LARP with little "future happenings" accurate type predictions or anything. obviously he had caveats to the interview that would allow essentially anyone whos well read in this stuff to do one of these if they so wished.

       To be fair, he avoided putting specific dates and times on any sort of specific events (the 2012 thing was technically wrong, but the esoteric / spiritual "Apocalypse" and its meaning is very open to interpretation), and also said that plans were subject to change depending on how certain things played out within the factions of the Illuminati itself.  It's entirely plausible that he could be a fake, but it's fairly unlikely considering how considered and informative his replies were.  Nobody just makes all that shit up on the spot, and people in real time on the thread were trying to trip him up constantly to prove he was a fraud and failed every time.

       thats what im saying though. someone who is well read on the subject matter (e.g. any researcher whos serious) could pull of an anonymous "insider" LARP and then simply dismiss any serious questions with "cant for sake of anonymity, plans always changing, this is 50% disinfo on purpose so i dont get caught by NSA and killed"

       So this guy conducted a two or three-day interview just for funsies and went through all that trouble for no reason?  That's a little unlikely.  I'm sure he lied about a few things (considering his stated nature as a Luciferian), but that doesn't mean what he was saying in general wasn't true.  There's a big difference between a three-paragraph 4chan LARP and this.  What with the goal be for this in particular?

       Page views for a public BBS/forum he has no stake in?  I'm not buying it.  And considering a lot of what he said lines up with the Law Of One material and what other researchers like Corey Goode and David Wilcock have talked about, I think it's more than just a standard LARP.  There's an incredible amount of detail in his descriptions and explanations of widely held esoteric concepts that don't just come from somebody mildly interested in this for fun.

       for example, this could easily have been Corey Goode or David Wilcock themselves and then others would go "wow, look an insider said this....Goode/Wilcock are on the right trail, lets buy their shit!"

       I think I read this. If this is the person who says their job is to play the evil role so the good guys rise up, then its the one I read.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing to remember is that this can easily be a psyop. I know a lot of what this person is talking about but he is mixing up a lot of fiction in his post. Also, people who gravitate to the negatively polarized section become insane so if this person is indeed a very bad person, he is also very insane. That stuff about Yawhey is BS too. There is no Yawhey God. Yawhey is just a name that was attributed to God by Moses 5000 years ago. We can call Bob or anything we want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking this is more of a psyop. It sounds to me like this person was well trained on what to say so that we will end up accepting the Illuminate role in this world like its something good.

       Idk, he clearly has an extremely deep understanding of these subjects, much more than the average LARP.  He was insanely consistent, and if you look at how the ATS thread actually evolved, they tried many times to trip him up and expose himself as a fake, and he
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       slipped.  I don't care how good of a LARPer you are, that's pretty tough.  There is something to say about the fact that he openly identifies as a Luciferian, and as we all know they are all about deceit and trickery, so I'm sure there's at least a few blatantly false morsels in there to muddy the waters and provide plausible deniability.  I would say that a large majority of it is very much true, or he at least believes it to be true.

       Oh, I do believe he is a Luciferian from the Illuminati. That part I do believe but I think he is also deliberately giving false information in the process only to make us think the Illuminati are some sort of a necessary evil in the world. It's a subtle manipulation. They mix truth with fiction.

       Agreed.  I think he made it pretty clear that his intentions and the intentions of the Illuminati were definitely negative, but he did a good job of explaining how they are in some ways a necessary evil in the esoteric grand scheme of things to provide balance and a choice of service to yourself or others.  I think he said "We exist to show you what you are not", i.e., we have to be completely and utterly 'evil' so you can realize your own inherent divinity, or something to that effect.  Ultimately he isn't wrong when he says that we are literally all just parts of a greater whole, and "behind the scenes" we are all fully aware of our roles within "the Great Game".

       I remember reading this just days after he posted - it was SO fascinating.  It really opened my mind up a lot at the time.  Definite must-read for conspiracy lovers who've never heard of HH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I recall everyone being really engaged and thoughtful with their questions/interactions.  Even those that remained critical (understandably), stated as much but remained respectful and intrigued.  Crazy (sad) how far we've come in 9 years.

       The price of housing in San Francisco renders it uninhabitable for my purposes. Maybe it's all a part of the NWO agenda.

       no, he do not, he said that you are the chosen to bear the truth, that the rest of people who do not believe or agree with him are blind by the midia, this is what he said. and how nice is to hear that, and to believe that... to some people

       By the governments, generally, yes. People are seen as 'collateral'. Pawns that are maneuvered around the chess board, according to the game plan.** By the Family, contrary to popular beliefs, many of us do not mean you any harm directly. There is just the matter of divine destiny to uphold and unfold, and we must play our parts in the game, as given to us by the Creator. In many ways, it is actually in our own interest that you are prepared for the coming Harvest. Just not maybe prepared in quite the way that you would like. Still, even then, you are choosing the Negative Polarity with your own Free Will decisions, with a little 'help' and direction from us. Souls are Harvestable in either 'extreme' of the Polarities, one could say.*

       Yea Dont beleive it, i started a UFO alien abduction hoax on ATS 15 years ago before being abducted forever by the men in black. And the skeptics of my story  who called bullshit (and gave all the exact right reasons why it was bullshit) were accused of being disinformation agents.... "But it cant be a fake story, the details are so similier to the other abduction accounts!"
Hate me all you want but I learned a valuable lesson about the value of real evidence and how easy it is for a teenage sci- fi nerd to create a hoax.
