       Kim is just now popping up

       Kim has an obvious and clear underlying motive (not being extradited and charged with racketeering, fraud, money laundering,  mass copyright infringement, etc.)

      <p>
       So either Kim sat on evidence of an active murder investigation for over 11 months or Kim is using Seth's death for his own personal gain. Or both

       Given that all of those organizations are real and this story is big, we could expect to see falsification by one of them if they're not actually involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that letter was sent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that letter was sent, then I believe that Kim DotCom is sincere in what he says. He has sought legal council, taken advice and acted. Publicly aggroing Mueller that way is hazardous and the guy doesn't come off to me as a moron. Smarmy yes, moron no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim's opinion is one thing, Mueller's may be quite another. I presume he'll get to see what Kim's holding, or at least receive a list of claims, before he has to make a decision. No matter what he decides I think that he can kiss any hope he had of leaving the WikiLeaks out of the story goodbye.

       The other guy's comment wasn't reported but it's now been dealt with.  You should worry about your own behavior considering your post history is full of personal attacks and accusations over the last 48 hours.  That's what the warning was for - other people's actions don't excuse your own.

       If that's a personal attack (pointing out that 2 accounts are brigading Seth Rich posts in unison when they get near the front page), then the mods need clearer rules on the subject.

       Because I get "T_D! Trump supporter!" attacks all day long in here, and that needs to be a bannable offense as well if you're consistent.

       And seriously, look at the voting. It's a joke. One of their comments is invisible, OP is at 100, and it's got like +21, and mine has -19.  Obvious 20 vote bots is obvious.

       Report/ignore/move on.  If you're getting shit slung at you the answer isn't to resort to shit-slinging yourself.  The goal of rule 10 is to prevent threads from derailing into back and forth insults and accusations.

       That's fine, I was pointing out there needs to be a clarification and consistent enforcement of the rule. If the rule is "don't talk about people's post histories" or something, then that should be clearer.

       I pretty much only ever see you show up to make character assassinations at people who you politically disagree with and make no contribution towards any discussion outside that sole topic, regardless of the thread.

       That's exactly what he's doing. Not to mention forfeiting a 500k reward.

       If Kim has real info..would he not have to provide some evidence prior to them agreeing to an immunity deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a legal expert but think of them giving him immunity to come to the US when he could literally have bullshit info.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he does give him the info and they don't want this Seth Rich shit to blow up they will probably just ignore him. So he'd have to just go public with this info eventually no?

       Yeah that is exactly what I am saying. If they reject his deal then he would/should just release the info publicly.

       I agree that's what he should do if there is no deal. I don't think it's too unrealistic to think there might be a deal however.

       Given the weight of the claims behind the investigation into the current administration, I think it is possible for them to cut him a deal, maybe substantial fines or something like that. I mean we are talking an investigation into the White House, megaupload or whatever pales in comparison

       He'd be immune from being arrested while on US soil even though he has charges out on him. It's still a temporary immunity and would absolutely require him to show solid evidence beforehand.

       huh.
Immunity from Prosecution
State and federal statutes may grant witnesses immunity from prosecution for the use of their testimony in court or before a grand jury. Sometimes, the testimony of one witness is so valuable to the goals of crime prevention and justice that the promise of allowing that witness to go unpunished is a fair trade. For example, a drug dealer's testimony that could help law enforcement to destroy an entire illegal drug-manufacturing network is more beneficial to society than is the prosecution of that lone drug dealer. Although the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants witnesses a Privilege against Self-Incrimination, the U.S. Supreme Court has permitted prosecutors to overcome this privilege by granting witnesses immunity. Prosecutors have the sole discretion to grant immunity to witnesses who appear before a grand jury or at trial.
States employ one of two approaches to prosecutorial immunity: Use immunity prohibits only the witness's compelled testimony, and evidence stemming from that testimony, from being used to prosecute the witness. The witness still may be prosecuted so long as the prosecutor can obtain other physical, testimonial, or Circumstantial Evidence apart from the witness's testimony. Transactional immunity completely immunizes the witness from prosecution for any offense to which the testimony relates.
Congressional committees have the power to grant testimonial immunity to witnesses who testify before members of Congress. Congressional investigations into allegations of misconductâ€”such as the Watergate investigations in the 1970s and the iran-contra investigations in the 1980sâ€”rely heavily on witness testimony. Whereas prosecutors simply decide whether to grant immunity to a witness, congressional committees must follow more formal procedures. Immunity may be granted only after a two-thirds majority vote by members of the committee. Ten days before the immunized testimony is given, the committee must advise the Justice Department or the Independent Counsel of its intention to grant immunity.

       Holy shit you are picky. The terms are one in the same. "Safe passage" is not some official term. Even diplomatic immunity uses both terms:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal immunity that ensures diplomats are given safe passage
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I said Kim would need to show actual proof before being granted safe passage/temporary immunity. Nobody is giving safe passage to a guy who has shown nothing. Stop acting like a law student when all you did was copy and paste something.

       Thing is, they don't really want evidence from anyone that exonerates Russia or Trump. As long as they keep the Russia collusion allegations in a grey area, they can keep the idea that they are guilty in the public consciousness. I mean, the entire media establishment is completely absorbed by this story right now. To find out Russia was relatively innocent here would be humiliating for too many people and institutions, and it really hurts their plans for WWIII with Russia.

       So thanks Kim, it is a grande gesture. But you won't be wanted.
