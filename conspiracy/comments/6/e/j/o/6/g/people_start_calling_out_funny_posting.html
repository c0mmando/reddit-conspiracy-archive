<p>Nothing critical since 2012, just like your links show. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. One of the main entities Wikileaks wanted to combat, since its inception, was Putin and Russia. Assange has gone on the record a bunch of times saying he has a ton of information that would topple the Russian oligarchy, but since he&#39;s been compromised around 2012, not a word of it has come out, and he&#39;s actually come to the defense of Putin! Look up interviews with Assange prior to 2012, back when he was highly critical of Russia&#39;s actions. Putin has only gotten exponentially worse since then, yet WL and JA have been completely mum on the subject.</p>

<p>No, you linked a search that brought back results that just <em>mention</em> Russia in some capacity. The reason you did that, is because WL hasn&#39;t released anything even remotely cross about Russia in over 5 years. </p>

<p>Pot, meet kettle. </p>

<p><strong>They&#39;re not being moved</strong>. The whole purpose of OP&#39;s comment was that there&#39;s a country that Wikileaks is very specifically avoiding releasing anything bad about, and I clarified that it was Russia, since 2012. <strong>You</strong> then went into a bunch of bullshit about how Wikileaks is primarily for the West  (when Assange himself said during their inception that their focus was on countries like Russia and the like).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And now showing Russian documents on wikileaks isn&#39;t enough evidence to prove that wikileaks has leaked Russian documents</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You still haven&#39;t. It&#39;s like you didn&#39;t even click your own links. </p>

<p>Why is it so important to you to defend Wikileaks&#39; obvious pro-Russian agenda, in light of all the evidence?</p>

<p>&quot;Knocking on wood - in Britain and Australia the phrase is touch wood - is an apotropaic tradition of literally touching, tapping, or knocking on wood, or merely stating that one is doing or intend to do so, <em>in order to avoid &quot;tempting fate&quot; after making a favourable observation, a boast, or declaration concerning one&#39;s own death or other unfavorable situation beyond one&#39;s control.&quot;</em></p>

<p>By most accounts, Putin is a ruthless leader and that&#39;s something of course I disagree with. I don&#39;t know enough about Crimea but I do know that it used to be s part of Russia, has predominantly Russian citizens, and I believe it voted democratically to rejoin Russia.</p>

<p>I should remind you that there isn&#39;t any proof that Russia interfered in any elections. But how do you feel about the US&#39;s acts of war and interference in elections? Do you feel there should be consequences for that too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea my other account was banned on most other political subs for questioning the narrative and being too progressive so I decided to start over. And I have found myself gravitating toward r/conspiracy ever since r/politics was taken over by shills. The Seth Rich assassination is of great interest to me.</p>

<p>I said I don&#39;t know enough about Crimea; I do know there was an invasion and that there was a democratic vote as well. Is it possible you don&#39;t know enough too? You&#39;re not pushing s fabrication are you?</p>

<p>What whataboutism? I thought we were talking about acts of war and interfering in elections? Do you have proof that Russia interfered in any elections?</p>

<p>I can tell you&#39;re <em>extremely</em> pro-establishment as if you work at CNN or something, and you seem to be anti-conspiratorial too. How come you post here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, so you were banned from other subs so you created a new account so that you could post almost exclusively in conspiracy with an anti-DNC bent. That doesn&#39;t make sense, but even if it did, you could easily prove it by providing a link to your old account with proof that it&#39;s you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re being disingenuous. I haven&#39;t said anything pro-establishment here, I&#39;m questioning the blatant forum manipulation and bot nets pushing the Rich conspiracy. Of course, as soon as I poke a Rich conspiracist, I find you are also pushing a pro-Russian narrative.</p>

<p>You are precisely the sort of thing I uncovered in the bot net. A group simultaneously pushing a pro-Russian agenda and following Dugin&#39;s suggestions for interference in American democracy to the letter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why doesnt that make sense? My other account has personal information on it and I&#39;m trying to keep this one a little more anonymous. Either way, why should I feel the need to prove anything to you? Your request seems rather brazen to me.</p>

<p>Yes, around here, at r/conspiracy, we generally like conspiracies, and we notice that pro-establishment accounts try to suppress the story. </p>

<p>You&#39;re suggesting I&#39;m being disingenuous but yet you&#39;re accusing me of participating in some sort of pro-Russian bot/script thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re just pushing the exact same set of concepts as the recently uncovered botnet.</p>

<p>You claimed you made a new account because you were banned from other subs, but your new account does not post in other subs. I guess that makes sense to you.</p>

<p>You also seem to think it&#39;s completely normal that conspiracy theorists are all pro-Russia. Why is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never considered myself to be pro-Russian but if you say I am then it must be true. I e always considered myself to be a peace loving American; in almost all cases I&#39;m vehemently anti war and aggression. </p>

<p>Like many users of this sub, I understand that the red scaring and sensationalist Russian fear mongering is part of a greater campaign to manufacture public consent for a regime change proxy war with Russia in Syria, and like I just said, I&#39;m against war. Is that part of the &quot;Russian botnet?&quot;</p>

<p>People who support these wars are generally considered pro establishment neoliberals. Is that how you see yourself? </p>

<p>And yes, ever since the Seth Rich assassination I have found myself gravitating towards r/conspiracy but I like r/WayOfTheBern and soccer too. </p>

<p>Why so confrontational anyway? </p>

<p>this reminds me of The_Donald back before the new algorithm. the admins were afraid of looking bad if they shadow banned or outright banned The_Donald. eventually they created the new algorithm to shadow ban them from All. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t understand what they were afraid of, nobody would care or do anything about it and the liberal media is way bigger than the conservative media, especially it&#39;s presence on social media.</p>
