       You are arguing with people that probably havent accomplished much other than create not very interesting reddit IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is made up of sore losers, angry failures and people generally incapable of achieving any significant measure of success.
      </p>
      <p>
       But its not entirely their fault.  They have been conditioned to hate real success and have been conditioned to accept their failure as an acceptable way to live life.  They dont even know how fucked in the head this corrupt society has made them.

       If its so easy to acquire massive amounts of highly valuable real estate, why havent all these fucking geniuses here done it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean if Trump the Idiot can do it, sure the Top Minds on Reddit could do it while they were asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       but they dont.  because they cant.  They cant because they fear risk and failure.  They care too much about the opinions of others (despite what they say).  They are afraid to do anything out side the herd.  They prefer to work
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       someone else and expect other people to provide them jobs, housing, food etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they ridicule Trump because he is superior to them and they know it.  Trump owns LAND.  And lots of it.  A man is nothing if he has no land.  What are wars fought over? Land.  Why is real estate law so important and complex? because nothing is more valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever stayed at a Trump property?  I have in Vegas.  Fucking immaculate and posh.  Far better than the basements these losers live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt vote for Trump because I think anyone seeking power over others is just a bad human and I refuse to support the political process, but I respect his success.  He has done what very few are capable of doing.

       Because they weren't born with a silver spoon and groomed in business since birth? A genius from a poor family could work themselves to death and not make a dent in the wealth an idiot from a rich family has. Poverty creates poverty and wealth creates wealth. I'm not going to say Trump is an idiot but saying someone born rich is smart because of how rich they are is a bad argument.

       You would totally own real estate in new york if your parents gave you $9 million. neet detected.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        New York Times recently found documents in Queens Surrogate Court that show that Fred Trump, in his will, divided $20 million among his four surviving children, among other distributions after estate taxes. (The will was contested by the children of his oldest son, Fred C. Trump Jr., who had passed away.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump’s father, like most wealthy individuals, also set up trusts before he died.
        <strong>
         Donald Trump admitted in a 2007 deposition that he borrowed at least $9 million
        </strong>
        from his future inheritance when he encountered financial difficulties.

       Trump is definitely intelligent, there's no denying that, but Keith Olberman is also very intelligent. Donald has no interest in philosophy, or anything related to academia. He thinks life is exceptionally simple,  seeing all things as black or white.

       you and the smartest people you know will never scratch the depth of this dude's effect on international real estate. none of your heroes ever will. no one you like even a little will ever execute a single free standing structure. In the real world, not philosophical-pleasantry-land, the "real" in real estate is quite significant. in other words, you will never do anything real, and criticizing those who complete real things is so worthless and illogical that no one in the real world cares...hate to be so star,,,maybe youre trolling me?

       I do not mean to be belittle his success or intelligence in any way. I am simply putting forth the only legitimate criticism of Trump. The ass-clowns in California hate him because he confronts their bigotry head on. I only wish he was more prepared. I honestly think camping with some mushrooms would prepare him overnight.

       He is sober because his brother was a raging alcoholic which shows some critical thinking and desire to succeed on his part. Still doesn't make him good at the science of governance. Our political system isn't set up for the most qualified to win it's set up for the most popular among the most. Outing blocks. He was by far the highest q scored candidate of all time. I should have bet on this.

       I think their point is that Trump was given everything he has, so developing real estate is easy and doesn't take that much when you start with the money and knowledge inherited from your father. And also that him being a great real estate developer has literally no worth in his presidency. He could be able to sell igloo's in Texas for all most people care but that won't make him a good President.

       I was saying that Trump inherited his money from his father that made those buildings with his name on them possible. Yes, Trump has made good business decisions to multiply his father's money but it's a lot easier to earn money when you have money (compared to his father who actually worked his whole life to get that fortune).
      </p>
      <p>
       And what I can do has no relevance on what Trump can do? Like I said he could be the best real estate developer in the world, how does that make him a good President? They're completely different occupations with different skills.

       It's not dumb luck it's a mix of people and over correlation of intelligence and wealth and under correlation with wealth and increased wealth. Really if you have money, and access to trusted professionals, both of which trump had because of his fathers money and connections, all you need is to be able to delay gratification for a bit and you can make a lot. He had a lot of money but not crazy amounts, I think dr dre has more then he has.

       Well, yeah that's true. As far as effective presidents are concerned, that's usually a boon though. What I mean is that he lacks the personal politic that most high profile leaders generally develop. He should have lined up his cabinet with the people that he ran against. Christie, Romney, Bush etc.
