<p>Reddit is made up of sore losers, angry failures and people generally incapable of achieving any significant measure of success.</p>

<p>But its not entirely their fault.  They have been conditioned to hate real success and have been conditioned to accept their failure as an acceptable way to live life.  They dont even know how fucked in the head this corrupt society has made them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If its so easy to acquire massive amounts of highly valuable real estate, why havent all these fucking geniuses here done it?</p>

<p>I mean if Trump the Idiot can do it, sure the Top Minds on Reddit could do it while they were asleep.</p>

<p>but they dont.  because they cant.  They cant because they fear risk and failure.  They care too much about the opinions of others (despite what they say).  They are afraid to do anything out side the herd.  They prefer to work <em>for</em> someone else and expect other people to provide them jobs, housing, food etc.</p>

<p>And they ridicule Trump because he is superior to them and they know it.  Trump owns LAND.  And lots of it.  A man is nothing if he has no land.  What are wars fought over? Land.  Why is real estate law so important and complex? because nothing is more valuable.</p>

<p>Have you ever stayed at a Trump property?  I have in Vegas.  Fucking immaculate and posh.  Far better than the basements these losers live in.</p>

<p>I didnt vote for Trump because I think anyone seeking power over others is just a bad human and I refuse to support the political process, but I respect his success.  He has done what very few are capable of doing.</p>

<p>Because they weren&#39;t born with a silver spoon and groomed in business since birth? A genius from a poor family could work themselves to death and not make a dent in the wealth an idiot from a rich family has. Poverty creates poverty and wealth creates wealth. I&#39;m not going to say Trump is an idiot but saying someone born rich is smart because of how rich they are is a bad argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would totally own real estate in new york if your parents gave you $9 million. neet detected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New York Times recently found documents in Queens Surrogate Court that show that Fred Trump, in his will, divided $20 million among his four surviving children, among other distributions after estate taxes. (The will was contested by the children of his oldest son, Fred C. Trump Jr., who had passed away.)</p>

<p>Trump’s father, like most wealthy individuals, also set up trusts before he died. <strong>Donald Trump admitted in a 2007 deposition that he borrowed at least $9 million</strong> from his future inheritance when he encountered financial difficulties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think their point is that Trump was given everything he has, so developing real estate is easy and doesn&#39;t take that much when you start with the money and knowledge inherited from your father.

He could be able to sell igloo&#39;s in Texas for all most people care but that won&#39;t make him a good President. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was saying that Trump inherited his money from his father that made those buildings with his name on them possible. Yes, Trump has made good business decisions to multiply his father&#39;s money but it&#39;s a lot easier to earn money when you have money (compared to his father who actually worked his whole life to get that fortune). </p>

<p>And what I can do has no relevance on what Trump can do? Like I said he could be the best real estate developer in the world, how does that make him a good President? They&#39;re completely different occupations with different skills. </p>
