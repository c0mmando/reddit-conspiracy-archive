        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Up Front Disclosure: This probably contains spoilers for both <em>Prometheus</em> and <em>Aliens: Covenant</em></p>

<p>I went and saw Aliens: Covenant today, and noticed some symbolism in it, so I decided to dig a bit. I actually haven&#39;t seen any of the <em>Alien</em> series or <em>Prometheus</em> so this was a new experience for me.</p>

<p>During the movie, I noticed <a href="https://i0.wp.com/media2.slashfilm.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/alien-covenant-trailer-breakdown14.jpg">this</a> symbol (the one on his jacket below &quot;Covenant&quot;) was everywhere, on the uniforms, on the ship, absolutely everything, and I felt like I had seen it before somewhere. That&#39;s the <a href="http://www.lgtnigeria.com/pictures/4546.jpg">Rosicrucian Order</a>, or at least very close. I found that very interesting, so I decided to watch <em>Prometheus</em> when I got home to see what else I could find out about the series.</p>

<p><em>Prometheus</em>, to me, is much more than your typical sci-fi alien movie. If you&#39;re not familiar with the mythological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, he was considered the creator of mankind (hence the movies namesake), and was responsible for stealing fire from the God&#39;s of Olympus and giving it to man. A literal light-bringer. </p>

<p>The story in Prometheus is incredibly interesting, and I found an <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/moviesandtv/prometheus-a-movie-about-alien-nephilim-and-esoteric-enlightenment/">article</a> on it that adequately represents how I feel about the motivation behind the story (and addresses the Nephilim amongst other things):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While most moviegoers probably stepped out of the Prometheus thinking that it was a “decent alien movie”, digging a little deeper into its meaning and symbolism reveals an entire other layer of interpretation. Drawing inspiration from the Ancient Astronauts theory, Prometheus proposes a radical rewrite of history and theology, one that makes humanity a product of extra-terrestrial “creator gods”. The movie also intermixes this quest for scientific knowledge with spiritual and metaphysical questions, making this story not only about angry aliens, but about timeless existential questions.</p>

<p>As the title of the movie suggests, the story of humans going into space to find their creators has an underlying esoteric meaning, as it can be interpreted as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment. The Titan Prometheus is a central figure in occult mystery schools, an archetypal figure of a “rebel from above” that brought divine knowledge to humanity – with all the benefits and pitfalls it engenders. Occult secret societies believe that this knowledge provides the path back to divinity. The same way the spaceship Prometheus leaves earth to find the Engineers, occult initiates look to leave the material plane to reach illumination and “be one” with the Great Architect of the Universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So after I had a solid opinion on this, I came to the conclusion that Ridley Scott may be a Rosicrucian, and definitely believes in the idea that mankind was influenced by aliens at the very least. This is a quote by him on the topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“NASA and the Vatican agree that it is almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way … That’s what we’re looking at (in the film), at some of Eric Von Daniken’s ideas of how did we humans come about”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my search to find more connections to the Rosicrucian Order and Prometheus, I came across a book, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NA97fgS7mPEC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=prometheus+rosicrucian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HRN0qhgaS-&amp;sig=qbGBLfNkKEkeZj4xgeVY_OgbwcA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2zcaAtpvUAhWpiFQKHY1JCPIQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=prometheus%20rosicrucian&amp;f=false">The Rosicrucians: The History, Mythology, and Rituals of an Esoteric Order</a> which discusses <em>three lost plays</em> performed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_de_la_Rose_%2B_Croix">Salon de la Rose + Croix</a>,  having to do with the story of Prometheus, <em>Prometheus, Bearer of Fire,</em> <em>Prometheus Enchained,</em> and <em>Prometheus Delivered</em>. </p>

<p>I got interested in the Rosicrucian theory of the creation of man, and came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGAJrx1JLqQ&amp;t=36s">this</a> video, which addresses exactly that. It&#39;s one of those annoying videos with a computer voiceover, but it&#39;s the only one I can find that mentions this specific topic.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear if anyone has any theories regarding this, I&#39;m going to continue looking, but I wanted to put what I had found here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda scary to think about, at least in regards to the theory with <em>Prometheus</em>. As soon as they wake up one of the &quot;Engineers&quot; from his cryo-stasis, he immediately tries to get to Earth, presumably to destroy it.</p>
