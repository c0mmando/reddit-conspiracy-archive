        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not addressing climate change will make mass migration worse.  The longer we delay, the more centralized state action and international mandates will be enacted when people get serious about preserving civilization.  The costs of climate change will be far greater than the cost of addressing it (which would require a large, blue-collar jobs program, ie the exact thing the elite wants to avoid).</p>

<p>The oil men funded the JFK hit.  The oil tyrants funded 9/11.  Exxon knew about climate change in the 70&#39;s and is on the record pumping money into disinformation campaigns and paid shills to protect their destructive business.  Oil companies are also responsible for scads of normal, boring, evil in countries no one cares about.</p>

<p>Unlike most controversial events, climate science can be roughly corroborated from anywhere on the planet.  The shills can convince people of their lies, but at least with this it is figuratively impossible to cover up all the evidence in perpetuity.</p>

<p>The clearest way to tell if a conspiracy theorist is legit or just controlled opposition is their take on climate change.  Everyone trying to downplay or discredit this is acting in service of an actual, documented, evil elite.</p>

<p>And before all the conservatives masquerading as skeptics downvote this to oblivion, just remember that actually taking climate seriously still lets you shit on liberals, Trudeau and Obama especially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change is real...is a statement equivalent to &quot;wind, precipitation, topography, and time are real&quot;. Not very meaningful or insightful.</p>

<p>What about the facts that many or even most of the &quot;solutions&quot; to climate change are promoted by the same financial and energy oligarchies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anthopogenic global warming caused climate change then, don&#39;t be a fucking pedant.</p>

<p>Those fake solutions should be all the proof you need.  Those people have known this is real for decades, and so they&#39;re going to make sure that the proposed &quot;solutions&quot; don&#39;t actually affect their massive wealth.</p>

<p>The easiest way to fight climate change is decentralization.  Solar panels.  Local agriculture. The internet.  All that stuff decentralizes.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the (obviously corporate funded) delay campaigns make the eventual international mandates worse.  If we&#39;d had given a shit and started on the path to carbon neutrality say in the 90&#39;s when Kyoto happened, the transition would have been gradual, and wouldn&#39;t have required much if any lasting centralization. If we&#39;d started when Obama got elected, like he tricked us into thinking we would, the transition would have been a little sharper, but still spread out over decades.  If we don&#39;t start till the 2020&#39;s or later, as the oil companies are fighting for, then the mitigation curves get massively steeper if we want to save coastal or equatorial regions.  <a href="http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/i/global_mitigation_curves.png">This graph illustrates the concept.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today, many of the people who have bought the Koch brothers campaign that global warming is a &quot;conspiracy&quot; claim that in the 1970&#39;s, it was an &quot;ice age&quot; coming.</p>

<p>This revisionist history is simply not true. Here&#39;s what relaly happened in the 70&#39;s: 46 global climate studies were done. 39 predicted warming and seven predicted cooling. The studies that predicted cooling were promoted by MSM on magazine covers, while the stud8ies predicting warming were not. Thus, the claim.</p>

<p>Global warming science is very simple, unlike vaccines or GMOs. Because it is so pathetically easy, the interjection of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; culture may be the single most damaging LIE to discredit conspiracies generally.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that a Rothschild is one of the leaders in the area. It&#39;s almost like they <em>they are trying really hard</em> to get us to believe its fake by putting Rothschilds in there.</p>

<p>I suggest that those who want to learn more about the politics of global warming look up Naomi Klein and &quot;shock doctrine.&quot;</p>

<p>As the sea levels rise and certain cities are threatened, people will be crying for government intervention like never before. Trading this likely eventuality off for the &quot;carbon tax conspiracy&quot; now is not very bright. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well silly as it may be, there is a decent sized movement out there to tax soda.  But I think the main thing you&#39;re missing is that the amount of carbon involved in the aggregate is negligible compared to what gets spewed into the air from cars, planes, smokestacks, cow farts (methane is significantly more effective greenhouse-wise than carbon), burning of forests, etc.  Also I&#39;m pretty sure the carbon put into sodas comes from industrial byproducts, so it&#39;d be put into the air anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody said &quot;Industrial ByProducts&quot; to me last month about the source for CO2 used in soda.  I was like, no way do they use a &#39;by-product&#39; in soda manufacturing.  </p>

<p>The CO2 used in the manufacture of soda must be certified as food-grade quality to be used as an ingredient in a food product.  This means it has a higher purity level than industrial grade CO2 and cost to produce is higher also.</p>

<p>the soda tax initiatives you speak of have been directly earmarked to go to healthcare budgets and spending.  </p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I am not against soda... I drink it all the time.  I just think it&#39;s odd from a conspiratorial standpoint that these obvious sources of CO2 release are not on anyone&#39;s radar.  </p>

<p>Billions of people on this planet believe there is a &#39;God&#39; up there in the heavens somewhere.  I don&#39;t.  does that make me wrong?  Those same people would show me volumes and volumes of &#39;evidence&#39; to prove the existence of &#39;God&#39;.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s valid evidence.  I have not seen or read anything in my lifetime to prove the existence of a &#39;God&#39;.  I really doubt any of those Billions of people have either.  They are all operating on faith.  </p>

<p>Now, since we are talking about Global Warming, we are dealing with science, not religion.  we should not have to deal with &#39;Faith&#39; at all with regards to science.  However, that is exactly how people are dealing with the subject of Global Warming.  &quot;I have faith in the scientific organizations that study global warming&quot;.  &quot;I have faith in my government to do the right thing about global warming legislation&quot;.  I have faith that my college professor knows a lot about world events like global warming.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a scientist.  However - I do know how the scientific method works.  It never rests.  science is always open for debate and always ready for change.  There are always &#39;new&#39; discoveries and revisions to &#39;old&#39; scientific discoveries.  Science does not boil down to a policy or a vote.  Yet, that is what has happened to Global Warming.</p>

<p>The reason I spend a good deal of time on the r/conspiracy subreddit is because I don&#39;t believe anything anybody says until I can prove it for myself.   the problem is I don&#39;t have the time and skills to do so.  I suspect others don&#39;t either.   I use r/conspiracy as a divining rod to help evaluate all the other so called facts from the real news outlets.    I also do a lot of reading and fact checking.</p>

<p>For every news article or &#39;soft scientific journal&#39; piece that I&#39;ve read, I have always found counter points in the form of evidence or other studies that refute the results and I&#39;ve also found the original studies recanted years later.  In short, I have found nothing to convince me of the impending danger called Global Warming.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read that Humans now dwarf volcanic emissions and I&#39;ve also read that both estimates of each are just that and are questionable.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that the Sun is the true arbiter of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere.  humans can quadruple their CO2 emissions tomorrow, but the Sun won&#39;t as it automatically regulates the contents and densities of Earths atmosphere.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not locking on to anyone&#39;s political agenda either.   Based on my own research, I think thats what the real problem is. </p>

<p>An enduring popular myth suggests that in the 1970s the climate science community was predicting “global cooling” and an “imminent” ice age, an observation frequently used by those who would undermine what climate scientists say today about the prospect of global warming. A review of the literature suggests that, on the contrary, greenhouse warming even then dominated scientists&#39; thinking as being one of the most important forces shaping Earth&#39;s climate on human time scales. More importantly than showing the falsehood of the myth, this review describes how scientists of the time built the foundation on which the cohesive enterprise of modern climate science now rests.</p>

<p>I like your solutions, sure, but the initial point was valid. Call it &quot;Global Pollution&quot; or &quot;Climate Pollution&quot; or simply &quot;Mass extinction&quot;.</p>

<p>Terminology is important. &#39;Climates changing&#39; is not an issue, nor is &#39;global warming&#39;. Pollution and mass extinctions effect humans, warmth and change less so. When u think about it in terms of correcting pollution and proliferating wildlife, the solutions become more clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at, sorry.  The climate is changing, due to the warming of the globe.  Saying Climate Change and Global Warming are thus accurate descriptions of ongoing phenomena.  Particularly with Climate Change, because of the complexity of the terrestrial system, the issue is more than just whats being directly caused by human pollution.  Its also the things being caused by the things being caused by the things being cause by that pollution, so broader and less editorialized descriptors seems the better course.</p>

<p>I might be wrong about that, but it doesn&#39;t seem like the term being used is the reason people are so hellbent on denying it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are people in this thread denying that the globe is warming.  I also take the &quot;hur dur the climate&#39;s always changed since it was different millions of years ago and that slow evolution is obviously analogous to the rapid shifts currently underway&quot; to be effectively a denial that the climate is currently changing.  Think you should follow you own advice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough in principle.  I&#39;d say though that the government is not pushing acknowledgement of anthropogenic climate change, but in fact the opposite.  Four of the last six Presidents have been deniers.  Despite the PR gestures Obama threw at his base, his substantive actions did not indicate he understood or believed contemporary climate science, else he would have pushed green jobs, not massively promoted international fracking and domestic oil production, and would not have sabotaged the attempt at a binding international agreement (Copenhagen) in favor of a relatively meaningless feel-good voluntary agreement (Paris).  In addition, for 3/4 of both the Clinton and Obama presidencies Congress, which never gets attention equal to its power and importance, was controlled by deniers.</p>

<p>To your second point I&#39;d say letting global warming go unaddressed is the greater threat to your freedom and wealth than the measures to address it would be.  Climate change is going to destroy tremendous amounts of wealth globally, from the flooded coastal regions, increased droughts and storms, mass migrations, extinctions, and food chain disruptions that it will induce.  The longer we put it off the more expensive mitigation and adaptation will be.  That also impacts freedom, as the longer we put things off, the quicker we&#39;ll need to change to avert catastrophe, and thus the more coercion might be used to bring that change about.  <a href="http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/i/global_mitigation_curves.png">Just compare the slopes of the different mitigation curves on this chart.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve got nothing against skepticism, but at a certain point skepticism should argue for taking precautions, ever if you&#39;re uncertain about the extent of the danger.</p>

Don&#39;t know about the NOAA leaker.
The risks have been understated for years so I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, but FYI just because the general principles are settled doesn&#39;t mean the details aren&#39;t still being investigated.  We&#39;re barrelling into climate states that earth hasn&#39;t seen since humanity has been on it, so there&#39;s going to be a bit of figuring it out as we go that has nothing to do with the validity of the science involved.
WTF are you talking about rebranding?
AGW is caused by pollution.  People still talk about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The news just generally doesn&#39;t talk much about environmental issues, because of the conspiracy I outlined in my original post, but AGW is the main one discussed because it is far and away the most dangerous for humanity.  Littering is bad but its not a threat to human civilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I just don&#39;t trust the Daily Mail to be a credible source.  There&#39;s also plenty of other research to corroborate global warming, so even if that one study was wrong its not dispositive of anything.</p>

<p>All those terms you cited refer to different and distinct phenomena.  I you think calling different things by correspondingly different names is some sinister rebranding effort I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>

<p>Celebrities are generally idiots, I try not to listen to what they have to say.</p>

<p>Denialist as a descriptor seems accurate for people who, either professionally or just passionately, deny scientific consensus.  Its also no different than what they call people like me (warmist, alarmist, worse).</p>

<p>You can be skeptical all you want, but a) skeptisicism leads to science, which you seem to be denying, and b) healthy skeptiscism should lead one to takeing reasonable precautions even if they&#39;re uncertain about the extent of a plausibly catastrophic danger.  </p>

<p>Agenda 21 is a meaningless boogieman.  No one has ever explained what is bad with non-binding sustainable development guidlines, other than just generic UN-derangement or the standard right wing lines about public transit being one step away from gulags.  </p>

<p>Carbon tax would be a great thing, and if done right it should be the best sort of tax - one that naturally expires.  Regardless, we&#39;ve got to get revenue from somewhere, so is taxing carbon any worse than taxing income, property, inheritance, sales, or any of the other things currently taxed?</p>

<p>Regardless, it&#39;s been proven that global warming is due to solar cycles, not carbon emissions. Not much we can do about that. It&#39;s a naturally occurring phenomenon. Certainly not a reason to implement a global carbon tax.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/rind_03/">https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/rind_03/</a></p>

<p>Incidentally, increased C02 actually leads to global cooling according to that link, which means that any warming would have had to be due to the solar cycle.</p>

<p>This is probably why global warming had to be rebranded as climate change. We&#39;re at greater risk of cooling. Al Gore&#39;s hockey stick graph showing temperature increase would have produced the same results with any input set. It was a flawed algorithm.</p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical of a global carbon tax that would circumvent our national sovereignty regardless of the reason, but even more so due the carbon tax having been pushed before the impact of C02 was properly understood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of the different ones you mentioned, half are the exact same thing, that&#39;s been consistently warned about for decades now, global cooling wasn&#39;t a thing, and the ozone layer was real and was addressed because back then the polluters hadn&#39;t succeeded in completely politicizing and stigmatizing science.  I do think though that if we&#39;re regularly creating new environmental crises then maybe your response shouldn&#39;t be to doubt the scientists but instead to realize that humans are continually finding new and different ways to damage this planet we live on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism leads to the scientific method, which leads to understanding of climate science.  Economic ideologues generally shouldn&#39;t be listened to for their opinions on scientific issues.  The sooner we address global warming, the less likely global government or mandates is.  If we leave serious action until the ice caps melt and the coastlands flood then the advocates for world government will be far likelier to succeed.

<p>Some, like #1, were decades ago before they doubled down on denial.</p>

<p>Others, like #25, are pretty easily explicable by geopolitics, where the science is irrelevant.</p>

<p>6 is four digits or below, so truly negligible amounts of money for the institutions involved.</p>

<p>7 doesn&#39;t actually allege anything relevant.</p>

<p>Most of the others can fall into a few boxes: attempted bribery, attempts to assuage guilt, desperate attempts to find some new breakthrough that gets carbon off the hook, enough money on the table that cash-strapped research institutions can&#39;t afford to say no, or negligible PR that doesn&#39;t involve much money or much if any &quot;warmist&quot; activity.</p>

These are not real science the way creating the self driving car society is real science.</p>

<p>Also, fighting climate change now means we don&#39;t need any global government.  If we only start fighting climate change once the ice caps melt and the coastal regions flood, the need for quick action and the momentum behind global unity and coordination may be unstoppable.

<p>I am indeed concerned with fracking and LNG.  In an ideal world they could be used as bridge fuels to slowly taper us off carbon, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening at all.  The silver lining though is that at least they&#39;re helping to bankrupt the Saudi monarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s my issue with climate change... it&#39;s always been changing. The weather literally has never been the same ever in the history of this planet. This planet has volcanoes which spew all kinds of crap into the atmosphere, and regularly has been hit by meteors. We&#39;re constantly recycling all kinds of crap into the air and have been long before humans even showed up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost foolish from a historical perspective of the entire history of this planet to assume we&#39;ve made such a rapid impact globally that we&#39;ve somehow forever scarred the planet. I mean 12,000 years ago where I&#39;m about to go to sleep on a house on top of a mountain was 2 miles under ice sheets from the last ice age. There&#39;s evidence that two fucking miles of ice covered most of North America just 12,000 years ago, then rapidly melted creating the oceans we have today. Ever wonder how we got things like the Grand Canyon? Fucking weather change long before humans could have an impact on this planet.</p>

<p>I mean obviously I&#39;m concerned about pollution, and yes a trend of a few degree temperature increases are happening globally but so what? This is absolutely nothing compared to a meteor hitting the planet and ushering in a new ice age. </p>

<p>Seems to me like a lot of people are making a mountain out of a drop of water in the ocean. This doesn&#39;t mean I support the oil industry, or oil backed currencies, or any of the evil companies and toxic crap they put into our atmosphere. I just merely think ultimately in the grand scheme of things our species will merely be a blip on this planets historical timeline. Maybe we&#39;ll birth some kind of AI that out lives us or even figure out how to seed other planets but unfortunately our time here is limited. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s cool to trash the place on the way out, but ultimately I&#39;m not sure how much it&#39;s going to matter. The planet can&#39;t sustain this kind of population anyway, we are long over due for some kind of event to thin our species numbers again and if it&#39;s at our own hand that would be rather fitting for humanity and the bullshit we put each other through. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq3WlRxfWC0">This is incorrect.</a> Overpopulation started with Malthus in the 18th century when he theorized that the population would grow faster than the food supply, causing a crisis.

<p>We both agree that the current system is the cause for a lot of the world&#39;s troubles, and that we need a complete overhaul and overthrow of the worldwide oligarchs to get back on the right track.

<p>Whether or not climate change is real doesn&#39;t change that, but it should play a factor in how we deal with it. We need more localization, not globalization. That is the better way to create real impactful change.</p>

<p>Unless we can define why the climate is changing, this discussion is pointless.</p>

<p>I would never label someone as controlled opposition simply for having a difference of opinion. It&#39;s all about how that difference is communicated, either with civility or toxicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t be more wrong. Climate change (which is a tautology, climate is always changing and always will be) is being used by the globalists as a tax on existence.</p>

<p>First, no climate predictions from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s have all been wrong. Climate is a chaotic system, and the fundamental feature of a chaotic system is that you can&#39;t make predictions based on previous trends. </p>

<p>If climate science were legit, there would be testable, repeatable and falsifiable experiments we could conduct to verify such things. These tests don&#39;t exist. Climate science is little more than observe and report. If you believe otherwise, please point me to such an experiment.</p>

<p>Further, the mainstream media is looking to tar anyone who questions climate change as a &quot;climate change denier&quot;, as if scientific results weren&#39;t supposed to be questioned. Moreover, this associates climate skeptics with Holocaust deniers. (As those who are said to &quot;deny&quot; climate change are conditioned to be treated as having an obviously wrong opinion.)</p>

<p>Think about it, since when does the mainstream media have the people&#39;s best interests at heart? Since never. Media companies are owned by the banking elite who want to enslave the world. The media has lied to you about all major historical events and they are lying to you now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all in favour of polluting less, investing in green energies, etc... But we should be doing this anyway. We don&#39;t need the climate change boogeyman to scare us into action​. Especially when the proposed solution by our governments is a carbon tax, which is effectively a tax on existence.</p>

<p>The government wants you to be scared so you&#39;ll give up your power. Climate change is just another facet. I&#39;m afraid op has fallen for it hook, line and sinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US govt alone spends <a href="http://www.gao.gov/key_issues/climate_change_funding_management/issue_summary">over 11 billion</a> annually towards climate change programs. The rest of the world spends at least that much again. Skeptics on the other hand get limited funding from a few private groups. Heartland was accused of accepting billions from Exxon and so Peter Gleick went to find proof of that. It turned out that Heartland had received a mere $23K. The idea that there is massive funding working against AGW is a fiction created by AGW militants.</p>

<p>Exxon conducted research in the &#39;70s and they were looking for environmental impacts predicted by the few people who were working in the field. No effects were found and so Exxon abandoned the research. Those facts fly in the face of the &quot;massive conspiracy&quot; that the internet has invented.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not addressing climate change will make mass migration worse.</p>

<p>Climate cycles naturally and during warm periods the human population expands while cool periods see little population growth. During the RWP and MWP populations grew to the point where the pressure of people led to wars. There is no difference in that aspect today during this current naturally warming period. (The LIA ended ~1850 and so global temperatures had to increase.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a plant food.  The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been increasing for the last 150+ years thanks to human activity, due to extracting and consuming fossil fuels, as well as land use changes. The added CO2 has benefited and continues to benefit natural systems and agriculture.  Scientists estimate that 15% of the current agricultural production comes from elevated CO2.</p>

<p>For most of Earth’s evolutionary history, the CO2 concentrations were much higher than they are today or that they can reach in the foreseeable future. For example, the CO2 concentration in the Jurassic period was 3-6 times higher than it is today. The so-called “pre-industrial atmosphere” was anomalously impoverished in CO2.</p>

<p>Our sun is the main source of energy on the Earth’s surface. Heat is removed from the Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere through multiple mechanisms, including convection and radiation.  Earth radiates in the infrared spectrum.  Gases with molecules having three or more atoms are infrared-active: their molecules can absorb and emit radiation in specific parts of the infrared spectrum.  The main infrared-active gas in the Earth atmosphere is water vapor.  CO2 plays a very minor role, except during ice ages.  Further, it has a very narrow absorption/emission spectrum, and it is almost saturated even at low CO2  The amount of infrared radiation, temporarily absorbed by CO2 molecules in the atmosphere, grows nearly logarithmically (i.e., very slowly) with increases in CO2 concentrations.</p>

<p>Thus, the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration has an extremely small warming effect, which is negligible compared with natural temperature fluctuations in any region. Even larger mean warming would be beneficial for human societies and the biosphere, especially as a buffer against natural temperature drops.</p>

<p>A greenhouse is a man-made construction, minimizing air convection that removes heat from the ground and thus increasing the inside air temperature. Most greenhouses are artificially enriched with CO2 to facilitate plants’ growth.  CO2 plays no role in heat retention in a greenhouse.</p>

<p>The sea level has been rising since the last glacial episode, which ended about 20,000 years ago. In the last few thousands of years, the sea level has been rising at the rate of 0.2-1.0 inch per decade, and no acceleration has been detected in the last several decades.  There are different opinions on whether discernible global warming would accelerate or decelerate sea level rises.</p>

<p>The oceans are alkaline, which is the opposite of acidic. The freshwater in most locations is slightly acidic.</p>

<p>Humans exhale CO2 with each breath.</p>

<p>Attributing hurricanes, droughts, and extreme weather events to anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, or to any known global anthropogenic activity, has no scientific basis. It has antecedents in the medieval witch hunts that included accusations of “weather cooking.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as &quot;climate change denial.&quot; That absurd, meaningless phrase was invented as a slur against critics of the man-made global warming cult. Anthropogenic global warming is a failed hypothesis that has been disproven by reality. Its computer models have not even been close to predicting changes in the climate, and if they cannot predict future climate changes, <em>why in hell would we give billions in tax dollars to elite fucks who came up with this scam</em> on the basis of those computer model predictions!!! It&#39;s not rational.</p>

<p>The planet can&#39;t sustain this kind of population anyway, we are long over due for some kind of event to thin our species numbers again and if it&#39;s at our own hand that would be rather fitting for humanity and the bullshit we put each other through. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq3WlRxfWC0">This is incorrect.</a> Overpopulation started with Malthus in the 18th century when he theorized that the population would grow faster than the food supply, causing a crisis. This has not come to pass. The hysteria was also peddled by the financial elite in the 80s, a lot of whom were proponents of eugenics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of the different ones you mentioned, half are the exact same thing, that&#39;s been consistently warned about for decades now, global cooling wasn&#39;t a thing, and the ozone layer was real and was addressed because back then the polluters hadn&#39;t succeeded in completely politicizing and stigmatizing science.  I do think though that if we&#39;re regularly creating new environmental crises then maybe your response shouldn&#39;t be to doubt the scientists but instead to realize that humans are continually finding new and different ways to damage this planet we live on.</p>
