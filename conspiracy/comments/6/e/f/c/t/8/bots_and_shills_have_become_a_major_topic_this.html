       This is the nature of Reddit these days. I spend more time trying to filter propaganda from all sides then actually reading good conspiracy info.  It's tiring. However, I gave up once already but decided not to let them win so I adapted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, it will change someday but i think it will be this way till Reddit dies.

       The RES tagging has really helped me recognize if I'm wasting my time or not. Also helps to tag people who's opinions and overall demeanor you appreciate.

       I go red for shills/idiots/blatant assholes, and green for people who seem open minded, intelligent, and genuinely looking for knowledge/productive discussions (whether I agree with their viewpoints or not).

       Use you friends list to tag people you want to keep track of. That only gives you 1 category, but I find it highly useful for mobile. I avoided it for a long time because I wasn't sure if it notified people, and I didn't want to look like some stalker weirdo. But it does not. Just highlights their names.

       You put "proof" in quotes, implying that you find that claim suspect.

       I've read them all and have read the comments.  I have no doubt those accounts posted what they did.  And I am not denying there being a very good chance that they are shill accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Proof" is in quotations because of the dubious nature of both it's timing and definitiveness (not a real word I know).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it plausible those are legitimate right-wing shill accounts?  Absolutely.  Is it also plausible that it's a false flag?  This is a sub dedicated to conspiracies, so I would say equally so.

       Not only is it equally likely, but it almost seems more likely to be a false flag due to the level at which it is being defended, and the level that people who are questioning it are being attacked and downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest question I still have is, who would really benefit from all this? How would T_D users benefit from blatantly shilling here on r/conspiracy? Seems to me that the ones who would benefit the most are the ones trying to discredit this sub. And considering T_D shares a lot of parallel views on the government and media that we do here, it would make absolutely no sense for them to try and ruin this sub.

       Even if that were true, then what's my excuse? I think the exact same thing is happening here that he does. Am I a pro-trump shillbot? Am I a "heavy T_D poster who loves Trump and comes in here to gaslight?"
      </p>
      <p>
       No. I'm a 3 year r/conspiracy subscriber and frequent contributer, who thinks the whole left vs right bickering is complete bullshit and exactly what TPTB want.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm here to tell you that this entire thing with T_D bots looks 100% like a setup to me. I can see trolls and shills from both sides of the isle, unlike those who are party-blinded. And in this case, it doesn't add up. Mainly because T_D trolls are WAY better at disguising their trolling than the shills on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I could also see it being an amateur T_D user trying to write his own bots. But the amount of attention that it is getting feels very artificial.

       Since you asked me, someone who has been coming here since I first got onto Reddit and not the person who is making accusations with zero history to back it up, I'll give you my opinion on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I first got on it was in the middle of the election cycle and the leaks were first coming out.  Most posts were about the leaks and the election, with open discussion, and a few unrelated conspiracies peppered in (I wish I could have seen this place before the election).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only places holding open discussion about politics was here and Wikileaks.  Obviously T_D was biased toward Trump, however it was not without reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more it became obvious that the DNC had screwed Bernie, and that MSM was trying to cover it all up, people started jumping ship from the DNC, and at the very least browsing T_D.  At that time, there was a lot of cross-posting between here, T_D, and Wikileaks because they were all interested in the same topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there, more people who serf T_D started coming here to post and comment, as Redditors do when they find an interesting sub.  So less and less unrelated conspiracies started making the top, and more and more political stuff did.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the election and since there has been a concerted effort to coral conservatives into T_D and get them away from the rest of Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, more and more is coming about about the DNC and the mess they've created.  Since about maybe a minth ago, this sub started to see an unusual increase in subscriptions and users online at once.  Old topics that would normally make the front page with maybe 50votes and 15 comments suddenly had 1000 upvotes and 150 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going through the comments and vote totals (also related to how long the post or comments had even been up) it became clear that it was no longer just /Conspiracy and /T_D stragglers but a group attempting to sway the discussion away from the DNC and more towards discredited stories about Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now there's a wealth of evidence to suggest that accounts a month old, around the time this started, are bots from T_D trying to flood this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       As arthurdent11 said, it's a gaslighting tactic to make people think they're crazy when they experience something.  If you have the time and it's possible, go back three or four months on this sub and see what the environment was like.

       I don't think its about "benefiting", i think it's about keeping an entire sub that might otherwise dig into the affairs of their "god-emperor" from being able to. Using bot's to to keep control of the narrative here with non-stop shit-postings, specifically of anti-left conspiracies has made it impossible to have a real discussion about alot of topics here....
      </p>
      <p>
       imagine if the narrative wasn't being influenced by pro-trump bots/shills and our sub had looked into any anti-trump conspiracy with the same passion and relentlessness of Pizzagate or Seth Rich........ think about how passionate our sub is about only pointing the finger at one side, and our sub has a tenancy of very aggressively pursing a hot topic and if this is an organized effort, who ever is behind it doesn't want to "benefit" from it directly, they just want to make sure our energy is focused anywhere but trump...... and imo they have been doing a really damn good job at it

       Is it not possible that the most intriguing and open conspiracy(ies) at the moment revolve around the DNC?  People have been Hillary hunting for decades, there are answers here that could finally bring her down; that's pretty big.

       If anything, this sub SHOULD be more on Trump's side in all this. Granted, he pretty much sandbagged everyone with his drain the swamp BS and being anti-establishment, but the platform he ran on was very much in line with the beliefs that a lot of the subscribers here believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that keeps me from thinking he's a complete puppet, is the media's nonstop onslaught of hate and ridicule that they give him. It still feels very much as if the establishment is still scared of him. So excuse me if I'm not quick to jump onboard whatever the newest "conspiracy theory" is that the MSM is blasting out on every channel.

       Here's the biggest problem I have with your logic here. The MSM (which most here inherently do not trust) is already ravenously chasing every single potential anti-Trump story out there. If something is being talked about non-stop on your television screen, it's because "THEY" want you to see it. And "THEY" don't give a fuck about you or I, they aren't doing it to be magnanimous. You're suggesting that because a sub that's all about conspiracy theories (and is anti-media and (relatively) anti-government), is focusing the hardest on the stories that the MSM either refuses to cover or only covers to call them crazy, that this place is overrun with "pro-trump bots/shills"??
      </p>
      <p>
       This is madness! Are there pro-trump trolls? Of course there are, I don't think anyone is disputing that. What I have a problem with, is people like you who put all the blame on one group. I have 100% seen a large majority of the shilling in this sub come from anti-trumpers and those on the left pushing the MSM narrative almost word for word. The most obvious examples of vote brigading are almost exclusively from people who are going AGAINST the conspiracy theory, saying it's crazy and nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the biggest problem! The MSM push so many bullshit anti-Trump conspiracies every single day, that many people have already stopped caring about whatever it is they are claiming he did today. So now, if/when he actually DOES do something criminal, those people who have stopped listening won't believe the people calling it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the same goes for the right. All this Seth Rich nonsense is only serving to drown out legitimate claims or breaks in the case.

       This is a sub dedicated to conspiracies.  It has become blatantly obvious over the past year that the DNC is embroiled in a massive conspiracy.  When the Trump-Russia collusion evidence surfaces, you can bet your sweet ass it'll be posted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until that time, don't you think it would be prudent to talk about a conspiracy, with many angles, that affects not just this nation but the world at large?

       Would you prefer it if there were no posts about Seth Rich, the DNC, the Awan brothers, etc.?  Would you prefer the front page to be filled with unconfirmed reports made by unnamed anonymous sources?

      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the fact that this account is now tagged in a huge RES list so if I post anywhere outside of a few subs I'm instantly downvoted and sometimes shadowbanned.  Why would I post anywhere else with it?

       Because it's fun to post bullshit and, they post articles and memes you won't find anywhere else on Reddit.  Just because I post there doesn't mean I worship the man, it's an online forum for Kek's sake.

       That sub is bigger than Trump, it's about their view of America.  They post about all kinds of issues (yes, from a right leaning perspective).

       Why does nobody hate /BrendonFrasier and /TrebuchetMemes?  You say that sub is dedicated to one man like not every single other sub is dedicated to one topic.  Of course they're going to post pro-Trump stuff and ban people who speak against him.

       There's pretty good evidence for it.

      <p>
       The posts get thousands of upvotes with little or no comments.

       When they did their little protest they had no effect whatsoever on the rest of the site, showing that their actual numbers are quite low without targeted upvote bots.

       Because shitposting is about getting the message out with as little information as possible; ie a graphic picture with a few words on the cause or effect.  There doesn't need to be a lot of commenting when the message is in your face, you just agree (upvote) and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts that require going into them and reading a wall of text usually have a way higher comment/vote ratio than a picture with words.  If they were trying to hide something they would comment as much as possible to make it appear natural.
      </p>

       Their "little stunt" got the admins to evenly enforce sitewide rules, wait for it, site wide!  Anti-Trump subs are no longer allowed to link directly to T_D or call out any of it's users directly.  It took a sub of 400k+ going private for a few hours to have rules evenly enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did you want?  Did you really want that many people shitting all over Reddit?  Despite what you may think, they're not bad people who would do that out of spite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that just because the site wasn't flooded with downvotes when it went private proves that they use bits is silly.  In fact, I would argue that if they could no longer use their bots on T_D then they would have unleashed them on the site at large, and you would have seen exactly what I described above.  So really, the lack of activity on the larger site during that time would be more an argument in favor of their not being bots.

       What is the standard shill playbook?  Can you point me towards the blame and deflection that points out a shill, because I would like to avoid them.

       All that happened was they made the sub private, everyone made fun of them, then they realized that without the echo chamber and bots they have no voice at all so they reopened it.

       Go ahead and try what you're claiming is now banned, you'll find it isn't.

       I actually do some programming, it would be a pain in the ass because you'd have to stop targeting general parameters in one sub and start targeting specific users. That also opens you up to an easy ban when one users posts, with no comments, get huge upvotes in other subs where that doesn't happen.

       Have an upvote for an honest question.

       Seeing as how you enjoy going through post histories, go back to the beginning of mine and see where I started.  I posted in many subs before starting my run in T_D, and continue to browse the 39 other subs I'm subscribed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of my posting in T_D I'm now on a RES list followed by bots and anti-Trumpers.  When I post in subs I used to I'm instantly downvoted and in some cases shadowbanned.  So now tgis account doesn't post in many places other than here and T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying those bots exist and that they appear to be coming from T_D.  I'm giving my opinion that the situation seems a bit fishy and a kinda "too good to be true."
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowdstrike is also certain that Russia hacked the DNC because they found code that looked like it could have come from the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is dedicated to conspiracies, I posited one.  Would you like to discuss it or just accuse me of being a partisan hack whose only qualification is that I post on T_D?

       This sub has basically become T_D lite with less memes  (thank god).  Just look at the front page, every other post is anti-left, Podesta, Hillary crimes or Pizzagate.

       What I really dont get though is how so many people can so fervently support a man with practically no redeemable qualities.  Hes an awful president and an awful human being, but you guys are out in droves to defend your side.

       Idk about here but, on T_D we constantly bash Republicans like McCain and Ryan (the leader of the Republican party in congress).  You say anti-Left, I say pro-exposure.  Those things on the front page are real, and happening, and they involve people in Washington on the left
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say a man has no redeemable qualities, you're speaking in hyperbole and it is hard to have a discussion with someone who makes a stand from the beginning with such an absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree with some of what he has done and with some of the people he's brought on but, trying to expose the massive corruption in Washington once and for all is a pretty big deal.  Can we expose these people together, try to restore some semblance of trust in Washington, and then argue about Trump?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I wasn't here then, wish I could have been.

       What do you find likable about him?  The only  thing I could even consider was early on in his campaign, that he called it like he saw it - and said whats on his mind.  But then I kept listening, and realized that those werent really good values because he had no eloquence or tact in what he said.  He just spouted the same talking points like any other politician - the only difference was that he used simple words because he lacked the vocabulary to say anything truly meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       His policy choices so far have done little to nothing to benefit the average american.  Theyre based around racism and corporate interests and the 1%.  Coal will never come back.  Brown people arent inherently dangerous.  He cant fix healthcare because "nobody realized it was so hard" and his tax plan will cost the country severely.  Climate change is demonstrably true and he pulled us out the Paris deal which has no benefit to anyone but Big Oil.  It just makes us all look like fools to the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       His appointees include a woman who thinks schools should have guns in case of bear attacks, in charge of education.  A surgeon who thinks the pyramids were grain silos, in charge of urban development.  A propaganda peddler for his national security adviser.  And how many seats are still vacant?
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me.  What one good thing has this man done since taking office - amongst all the  garbage we've seen so far.  What redeemable quality does he have that I'm missing.

       Couldn't come up with anything quick to tell you that Obama holdovers are denying and witholding security clearances, and congress is fighting him every step of the way, you can't put that one on him.

       And if anyone were to put up a thread with as much witchhunting and shill-calling as the
       <em>
        stickied
       </em>
       thread, but the target were known CTR/ShareBlue paid shills and their supporters, you'd get banned.

      <p>
       r/conspiracy died the moment they started adding mods sympathetic to shills and their mission, and in particular are friendly to CTR/ShareBlue.
