       The problem with that flippant response is our leadership considers SSI entitlements. So someone like me who worked thirty six years is getting a "freeby" using that metric.

       Indeed.  My neighbor has an 8 year old kid, he has been getting SSI $700/mo for ADHD.  Another neighbor has 2 kids that are off, both getting SSI.  She doesn't work and always has amazing hair and nails.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not, and I doubt any reasonable American would consider a retiree with decades of work under their belt drawing from SSI an entitlement.

       It's out there Eric, my mom is 87, worked outside the home in a career. One time online a guy suggested she's simply an economic drag as if her longevity is screwing up his savings. We have turned against ourselves in this country. Lastly, the scenario you wrote about is flat wrong but I do not doubt the story at all.

       That is sad.  Sure now she is costing SS some, but all those decades she and your dad put into it, all those decades that was allowed to invest in the fund.

       I'm not kidding when I say that a day may arrive where the elderly can simply "tap out" on their remaining years. It won't be marketed as a cost saver but that will be the result of it. Frankly, speaking for myself only, if I knew now that I would suffer dementia later as my dad and grandmother did, I would want to be put down once it presented itself so I guess I would support the "cost savings".

       It is amazing.  I wonder though, have you seen any tv or movie that was so out there, it couldn't happen? So many subjects available to us and they all seem semi-feasible.

       So for her, those things were so unbelievable and unfathomable.  For me, shows like Timeless (time travel change history for/against TPTB) or Stargate (portal to other worlds created by ancient race) etc could come out in full disclosure and I'd be like 'damn, thought it was'.

       That would be crazy but I would love to be able to time travel. My brother was in the hospital when he was younger and his roommate was an old guy. He lifespan included horse and carriage transportation all the way to digital watches. Who knows what we will see before checkout time arrives? Who knows what already exists and remains hidden from the masses?

       Working people pay into SSI their entire lives as insurance for not only their own retirement but to take care of disabled or orphaned family, loved ones and people in their community.  Wall St. wants that money; the entire GOP "leadership" and a handful of turncoat CorporoDems are more than willing to loot it for them, and have an army of Ivy League-educated geniuses at well-funded "conservative" think tanks to tell them how to sell that to the public as handouts to brown people, thus making them unwitting accomplices in their own fleecing.

       The new world order is planned to be a SOCIALST police state, so they must create the illusion that capitalism is failing and push the public as far to the left as possible so the majority of the masses will accept socialism in thier hearts and minds, and of course will be fucked over epically. This is also why they most heavily target universities and younger people- they are building their army of useful idiots that will accept this nightmare with open arms.

       Rush Limbaugh, Alex Jones, Fox News all have massive audiences. Both sides buy into this nonsense that only (neo)liberal media is mainstream. Democrats and republicans both agree with endless war, increasing corporate profits, furthering the police state, surveillance etc. So there is no "liberal media" only corporate(or otherwise bought and paid for) media.

       This is such a funny concept.  Here's the flaw in that perception:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) since mid-90s (Telecommunications Act), the wall between the profit-averse "news" divisions and the profit-driven entertainment divisions has been removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) that means that over the last 30 years, the "news" has served a single master: profit
      </p>
      <p>
       3) add in the five transnationals that now largely own everything you read, see and hear
      </p>
      <p>
       4) on the boards of the transnational corporate parents are people with a financial stake in the industries the "news" media should be keeping its eyes on
      </p>
      <p>
       5) those two phenomena combine to pull off the miracle the financial elite has been praying for since the First Amendment was enshrined in the Constitution:  to smother freedom of the press.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberals wish they had majority control of the media.  Democrats too.  (not the same thing in my mind)  The idiology that has a chokehold on the media is
       <strong>
        greed
       </strong>
       and the particular brand of greed you find in the elite classes.

       In her book "Against Our Better Judgement" Allison Weir used historical documents of the time to show where Zionists plotted and planned for the state of Israel and in that plan was the idea of infiltrating the media, for members to rise up the ranks until it was controlled.   That book explains a lot about how the US got where it is today... led by Zionists,  not Americans   (120 pages, about as many pages are included as footnotes and references)

       Ftfy.  If the "historical documents" are like the ones in Galaxy Quest, I'm in.  But there's a much more direct way to understand how the US go where it is today because it's laid out in detail by corporate lawyer, board member of 11 corporations, and eventual SCOTUS Justice Lewis Powell in
       <a href="http://reclaimdemocracy.org/powell_memo_lewis/">
        his 1971 memo to the US Chamber of Commerce

       The documents referenced in the book were from the 1930's to the end of the '40's. It laid out quite specifically how the Zionists worked together to obtain influence in both political and media arenas.

       You can selectively parse bits from "historical documents" to build a fairytale around whatever villain you fancy but while you're railing against the Termites
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       villains are purchasing your democracy as cheaply as a beat-up pair of work gloves right before your very eyes - no parsing necessary.  You want to ignore them because they don't fit the ethnic/cultural/religious type you want to blame, that's on you.  What's happening
       <em>

       has been escalating for decades

       - you just have to open your eyes instead of trying to shoehorn the painfully obvious ills of our current cultural/political/economic landscape into some Rube Goldbergian timeline that starts with Zionists.

       I'm not "blaming" anyone. I pointed out that a well documented book laid out the historical facts demonstrating how it began in the 30's and has evolved into what it is today.   If the finger points to the  Zionists rather than the Cossacks or the Catholics or even the Haitians, that's where it points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I resent that you accuse me of having ethic/cultural/religious motivations, why can't it ever just be what it is... history pointing to someone YOU'D rather it didn't point to?  I see what's occurring today.  I see the dual citizenship politicians, the billions in aid, the Palestinian conflict.
      </p>

       Maybe if you actually read the book.... found discrepancies in it.... rather than accuse me of a fairy tale.

       If there wasn't an entirely sound, highly visible foundation for understanding the direct hand a small number of corporate elites and families have had on the current rot in our entire cultural/political/economic structure, facilitated by "conservative" SCOTUS Justices extra-Constitutionally legislating from the bench, I might turn to a book like that in desperation.  There's no shortage of unacknowledged conspiracies that have had and continue to have a profoundly negative impact on us and our world, and I've been down the Zionists rabbit hole once already and found it lacking.

The Powell memo is just a good gateway drug if you have any interest in understanding the long game these greedy fucks have been playing to deliberately and meticulously engineer our system of laws to benefit the very, very rich at the expense of virtually everyone else, not to mention the next generation or two, the planet and democracy itself.

       I'll read it carefully, Thanks for the info.  But a question... what makes it feasible that a lot of connected CEOS, elites and others have collaborated to do as you say but makes it seem not possible for an organized and cohesive group like the Zionists not to?   Plotting the long game seems like it would need a bond that over rides  the natural competitiveness (greed)  that the elites would have for each other.

       It's not that it's not possible, but one thing that has come through loud and clear throughout my life, bearing out in all the relevant conversations I've had, people I've met, books I've read or places I've worked, is that virtually anything is possible if you throw enough money at it and underneath the perceived agenda of any efficient and effective campaign, movements, conspiracy or war is a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       agenda, which is a more powerful motivator and facilitator than any ideology, belief, group or any other organizing factor - and that's greed.  So, #1, you have to have a lot of money to invest, or the resources and/or power to get your hands on it; and #2, there has to be a mechanism in place or waiting at the other end for generating, increasing or monopolizing profits.  That's my litmus test.  If in that book there's evidence that a Zionist conspiracy yielded what I just described as powerfully and comprehensively as the corporate and financial elite has in the US and abroad, then you might be on to something. Otherwise, it's a dead end.

       As a matter of fact, it did specifically mention the Zionist plan to infiltrate the highest ranks of government and industry.  This was back in the 30's and 40's.  I don't think it's a coincidence that many media leaders, Wall Street bankers, Federal government officials are Jewsih while admitting not all Jews are Zionists. I think the organization was used for forming a Jewish homeland in the 40's and evolved into a plan for a "Greater Israel" currently and eventual world governance in the near future.  I think the Paris deal Trump just canceled was part of this globalist plan.

       You can't have it both ways - the globalist plan is a cancer but if you look at some of the biggest funders and pushers of globalism lie they ain't Zionists (unless the sovereign corporate nation of Exxon-Mobil and Monsanto-Bayer are masterminded by Zionists, which, last I checked, they weren't).  Would it make sense for Zionists to entrust the fate of their plan to whatever the Zionist version of infidel is?

       Well, truth has a liberal bias. And which news do you think they control?
      </p>
      <p>
       I follow about 600 TV stations on twitter (US stations) and a you find many of them belong to a handful of companies - and corporations are the ones conservatives want to control the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it your ideal that if anyone criticizes the current president it makes them liberal? What does that make rush, hannity, fox, etc (and you do know most all talk radio is run by RW'ers, right?).
      </p>
      <p>
       So tell me which media out of them all in the US? NYT/WaPo/NBC? 3 maybe that lean left compared to hundreds (and not to mention radio and newspapers that lean right).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a myth that media is leftists - it is propaganda from the right to cover their ass without addressing the facts.

       Because conservatives made it legal to buy control of the media ... and damn near everything else.

       PS: There are ~7billion people alive today and two categories are insufficient to contain their myriad political views. The fault line here is indivudualist/authoritarian, not pogressive/conservativeor liberal/conformist.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fox News averaged 1.72 million total day viewers, with 359,000 of those falling in the key adults 25-54 demo. CNN finished second with 826,000 total day viewers and 266,000 viewers in the demo. MSNBC came in third with 781,000 total day viewers and 185,000 viewers in the demo. Yet despite finishing third, MSNBC definitely has reason to celebrate. The network grew its viewership by 55 percent in total day viewers and 40 percent in the key demo compared to quarter one of 2016

       I heard a joke, I think it was on the Joe Rogan &gt; Alex Jones podcast, where Alex says no one is watching the mainstream news. The only place you'll find it on a tv is in nursing homes. That's their audience.

       There's no mystery. The media is controlled by Jews. Jews tend to be liberal. That is, they tend to want to destroy Christian traditions and to cripple the power of whites in white Western societies. They look upon white Christians as a threat and attack them at every turn.

       It's out there Eric, my mom is 87, worked outside the home in a career. One time online a guy suggested she's simply an economic drag as if her longevity is screwing up his savings. We have turned against ourselves in this country. Lastly, the scenario you wrote about is flat wrong but I do not doubt the story at all.

       It is amazing.  I wonder though, have you seen any tv or movie that was so out there, it couldn't happen? So many subjects available to us and they all seem semi-feasible.

       So for her, those things were so unbelievable and unfathomable.  For me, shows like Timeless (time travel change history for/against TPTB) or Stargate (portal to other worlds created by ancient race) etc could come out in full disclosure and I'd be like 'damn, thought it was'.
