       Oh, and I reversed engineered some of the tech and gave it to the mother fucking Russians FOR FREE, including the frequency ranges... though... the Russians did seem to already know about some of it.

       Not what I said at all. I asked what the point of posting this is since OP apparently doesn't have any interest in providing even basic explanations for what is "going on" that he felt the need to post about.

       Those were your words.  The implication being that OP has no purpose in posting.  Thanks for putting a criteria on when and how people should express themselves.  I'm sure it's appreciated.

       Well your intent would be ambiguous if that was all you wrote.  But you also wrote "Why should we believe you?", before that.  This colours your statements with a validity smell and an expectation that OP needs to fulfill your questions, and that otherwise there's no reason OP should be posting.  That's how it reads anyway.  I'm sure you can try to spin your intent some other way, so please carry on trying.

       Presumably someone doesn't make a statement without the intent for the information to be received. If the information is not believed it will not be received. It only stands to reason that someone who took the time to post in a public forum would be invested in at least creating the appearance that their statement is true.

       You put a lot of burden on the self-expressed victim to meet your own personal thresholds of truth.  Surely all victims are perfectly heroic that they can meet this, lol.  I also enjoy that you're no longer implying that you weren't doing this to begin with.  Funny how that can change in a couple of posts, eh?

       You're too much. I asked OP why we should believe this (and by extension care) and then when he expressed he didn't care if we believed, I asked what the point of posting at all was.

      <p>
       You chose the term "conform" (implying an order), not I.  So you're strawmanning here, injecting terms that the other party didn't use and then accusing them of using those terms.  Hahahaha.  Hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear you asked for further explanation that, if absent, would necessitate you not caring about the subject.  So, applying your rationale to your own comments - why should we care whether about your standards were met?  What's the point of posting about your standards in a public forum, absent further explanation?

       The best part of this exchange is the demonstration that you're incapable of seeing your own hypocrisy.

       Lol ok buddy. I'll just take your word for it.

      <p>
       100% paranoid schizophrenia doesn't exist, people never delude themselves into believing things are happening that aren't, and it's a widespread practice for people to invest massive amounts of time and money just to harass random people on the internet for "reasons".
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is denying the possibility of orchestrated harassment, but not every person who claims they are being "gang stalked" is actually experiencing this sort of harassment. It's much more likely there is another explanation.

       Right. Youtube has tons of people filming mailmen and confronting them for being in on a conspiracy against them. It's sad, but sometimes I come across legit cases. Ted Gunderson was gangstalked but he was an extreme FBI whistleblower.
