        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>A low cost earthquake early warning system may be designed using archives from both the usgs and noaa.
This system would be an algorithm coupling the likely seismic activity to accompany our incoming solar activity real time. Potentially giving up to a day or weeks advanced notice to incoming seismic events. </p>

<p>Serious case studies have been performed regarding the existing relationship of solar storms and seismic events on earth.</p>

<p>My goal is to create an easily deployable system that compares past geological records and known incoming solar data to recorded archives. Hoping to assess the probability of an incoming earthquake. </p>

<p>This system may give nations up to a week or more time to prepare critical infrastructure and public interests for an incoming seismic episode. </p>

<p>A simple threat level detection system could progress over time to enhancing our full understanding of the various processes taking place to create an earthquake. </p>

<p>If we stop asking why earthquakes occur and work to answer how they occur. We will have greatly reduced millions of dollars in damages, saving hundreds of lives in the process.</p>

<p><em>I believe there are hundreds of discoveries waiting to be made.</em></p>

<p>Simply by taking the initiative to assess the relationship. Finding the common factions of each science and determining why they compliment each other. </p>

<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>

<p>There is an array of magnetic filaments known as flux tubes, which effectively transport photons from the outer ionosphere to the earths magmalayer. Leading to the creation of highly condensed P waves in seismic studies. </p>

<p>Given the nature of the process taking place we can infer specific data to be used in the future prediction of seismic events.  </p>

<p>Three specific data sets must be collected in order to create a hypothetical earthquake prediction utility. </p>

<p>The first is usgs seismological data. </p>

<p>The second noaa&#39;s solar wind data. </p>

<p>The third is aces bz componet feed. </p>

<p>Each piece of data reflects an important role in monitoring energy distribution from the start to the finish. In terms of the energy being released into space from a solar wind stream, as it guides itself to earth. </p>

<p>To the moment it strikes the planets magnetosphere. Penetrating the lower atmosphere. Seeding the magnetic field tubes with positrons protons and photons as they convey within the planet. Super conducting our flux dyanamo along the way. This leading to the expansion of magma cavaties. Causing earthquakes and volcanic episodes on earth. </p>

<p>The current seismic model uses a base recording system to detect these areising p waves giving upto 35 minutes warning. This system however is nearly obsolete as most incidens are more likely to actuate far prior then emergency designs allow. </p>

<p>My proposal is to design a highly advanced earthquake warning system by integrating an algorithm to detect and compare incoming solar storms, using past geological data feeds, to assess the fundamental architecture of singularities in ionic material of past solar wind surges. To give a comparitive model outlining the exact changes we should expect in comparison to archived geological record. </p>

<p>My research has indicated that most massive earthquakes  follow a consistent pattern in terms of their symmetry to solar wind streams that harbor extreme velocity shifts.</p>

<p>When the solar winds pitch at a high velocity, the embedded plasma often penetrates the earths upper atmosphere causing a large scale seismic event. 
The process has been consistently documented by myself and several researchers. </p>

<p>This period of penetration is recorded by a satellite known as ace. The extrapolation of aces bz data feed shows the occurance of multiple high proton breaches in the upper atmosphere. These breaches outlining peak solar storms in past record. </p>

<p>By calculating the time dialation between a breaching incident and seismic events on earth a given value can be established noting the volume of energy, its dispersal, and the time inbetween striking and the postulated seismic events that follow. </p>

<p>By taking several years world history, we can devise a general system of alert based on the likelihood of an incoming seismic event as it compares to our current and predicted future solar weather. </p>

<p>If a clear pattern can be extracted showing a consistent relationship to the three systems; a highly advanced comparitive algorithm may be established. Not only predicting a given size estimated with the seismic event; yet the additional location most probable to recieve the energy. </p>

<p>By using past documentation in relationship to the geo positioning of earth in past events at a time of strike, we may also learn a vast amount of material on the quantity of the relationship between our sun and the earths magnetic field. </p>

<p>We have existing records in seismology indicating the areas annual probability to see an induced seismic event. Using those data points in culmination of a past usgs seismological record and past noaa solar wind data set. May prove to give an even higher level of accuracy. </p>

<p>The predictive algorith could be designed to firat assess a given incoming solar wind stream. Comparong it to a past solar event. Then its function would disect the probable geo positioning of earth at tine of impact. </p>

<p>Upon this assessment the data would use an algorithm to research all past seismic records which followed this pattern most similarily. Displaying a potential size and location vector within seconds. Furthermore, comparing this value to all current earthquake data noting potential areas of recent seismic risk and potential seismic risk (due to delayed activity), would give a proven range of potential locations most likely to see an earthquake of the magnitude and scale. </p>

<p>After continued monitoring and researching of the results in comparison to events as they are manifested. We could begin trimning the most inaccurate features of the predictive model. While adding new tracers and parameters to finetune the display. ..</p>

<p>The main focus would assign programmers the obligation of securing 5 years worth of existing data sets from each system. Then marking all incidents which correspond to one and other. Noting their sizes and locations. Time stamps. Proton levels and the duration from start to finish. Leaving researchers with a past feed for algorithnic comparrison. There by using the data itself as the future road map of this software. The utility would then record incoming data in real tine comparing the sequences and comparing then to all known events on earths existing record. </p>

<p>Once drafted we can then begin guaging the most critical points and successful programming analog that compliments the incoming seismic data sets in real time. 
Editing most values until a highly accurate model can or may be achieved. </p>

<p>The model would then use an assigned function outlining the severity to a single area to outline its current level of danger. </p>

<p>Two systems could likely be devised. </p>

<p>A single system measuring the threat of an incident based on the incoming solar data. (easy).</p>

<p>A complex system devising all probable data points in past history defining the very probability of an earthquake. The exact time it would strike; as well as the seismic magnitude or scale to expect, and the potential quadrant city or some day potentially exact city the earthquake would strike. There by effectively reducing the uncertainty of many seismic events on earth.</p>

<p><strong>Basic model</strong>
Take pre recorded feeds of all usgs events significant of 4.5 seismic scale. From January 01 2011 to january 01 2017</p>

<p>Take prerecorded feeds of all solar storm data IN ADDITION TO all BZ componet data sets from January 01 2011 to January 01 2017. </p>

<p><strong>Parameters</strong>
Mark all events above seismic intensity 4.5 with a value given for each magnitude at 1.0 scale. </p>

<p>(I.e. 4.5 = 1 5.5 = 2 6.5 = 3 7.5 = 4 8.5= 5 9.5 = 6)</p>

<p>Search all existing bz componet breaches prior to an earthquake. With INCLUSION of solar wind (extreme velocity shifts). </p>

<p>Wind velocity shifts value 400km/s = n1 500km/s=n2 600km/s= n3 700km/s =n4
800km/s = n5 900km/s n6.</p>

<p>Set Bz breach parameters of scale to determine values: +1=b1 +2=b2 +3=b3 +4=b4 +5=b5 +6=b6 +7=b7 +8=b8 +9=b9</p>

<p>Use current &#39;real time data&#39; to dissect and compare all incoming streams to past existing data sets. Monitoring the probability of an incoming earthquake. </p>

<p>Assign a warning level based on the basic magnitude associated with the current solar weather. 
(i.e. 4.0-5.5 mag / yellow; 5.5-7.0 mag / orange; 7.0 - 9.0 mag / red).</p>

<p><strong>Complex model</strong>
Devise an additional location projection model. </p>

<p>There are likely several ways to perform this task. One method would be assigning the most seismic locations on earth with a low value/number. And assigning the least seismic locations on earth a high value/number will add the first level of efficency. </p>

<p>To design the second level of depth we would begin by syncing existing seismological records to a &#39;smart program&#39; with a buily in/ in depth system which could then determine the more probable location (basing it on either gps data location or n.s.e.w. (quadrants) to experience a seismic event based on its annual expectancy. (eq&#39;s &#39;expected&#39;: per year) (decade). (Century)...</p>

<p>A third level could further determine the probability by then cross examining the recent activity seen comparing the potential for sequencing of an incoming seismic episode to the earths current real time seismic activity. </p>

<p>A 4th level of programming could integrate multiple weather anomalies wind patterns and tidal charts in hopes to detect &#39;tells&#39; or &#39;warning signs&#39; associated with an incoming seismic event. </p>

<p>Such as schumann resonances, sudden buoy movements, area tremors, recent quake swarms, tidal flows, volcanic activity, and recent hot / cold pockets visible by satellite. </p>

<p>These systems being assigned significant roles and values may provide a very accurate first response algorithm capable of detecting the largest seismic events on earth. </p>

<p>Furthermore given time the unique system could be updated with new data feeds by online provided providing multiple inputs and further polishing it into potentially/ eventually being able to predict the earths smallest seismic episodes. </p>

<p>Correlate the existing data to past geo stationary activity may eventually lead to the first steps in mapping the magnetic field lines of earth. Providing intimate details and introspection to the system as a whole.<br/>
Using a geostationary data set could ultimately allow us to monitor the direct seismic area of response to a significant blow to our field when recording past solar wind data.</p>

<p>The sheer documentation would be invaluable to researchers eagerly hoping to map and research our planets complex magnetic flux system. </p>

<p>Providing countless researchers with ample opportunities never beholden by mankind in the past. </p>

<p><strong>Why 24 hours...</strong></p>

<p>We would like to assume an advanced algorithm could guarantee a direct 24 hour period of basic warning. </p>

<p>In fact most space weather is determinable up to a week in advance giving us a unique potential window of
Opportunity in assessing future seismic events. This system essentially detects the incoming process of a seismic event from its postulation to execution. </p>

<p>By redefining the significance of the solar to seismic relationship. It is the pieces that do compliment each other in significance that will ultimately determine the significance of our hypothetical model. </p>

<p><strong>conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This system would redefine both the very advancement of advanced seismic warning. As well as the very field of seismology itself. Fully verifying a significant relationship to the earths cosmic winds and seismic events as a whole. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently written a new theory on the relationship to seismic events in their proximity of incoming solar wind streams. </p>

<p>These theories have led me to discovering a fully verifiable process which would allow researchers to record an earthquake in real time.</p>

<p>By taking the time to verify this discovery the utility most curious in the advancement of seismic prediction models may gain absolute accrediting in the journal of science. With the given potential of creating one of the most highly accurate, predictive seismic monitors to date. Greatly eclipsing all current researchers strides as they stand. </p>

<p>On several instances i&#39;ve tested this model to show its value in application. </p>

<p>With a high level of success and acceptance by the world community. </p>

<p>Id like to request the participation of outside sponsors. To further enhance the general constructs of this engagement. As any sponsor taking part may indeed gain the full capability in designing an executable earthquake prediction utility. Which would be available for public, and private distribution.</p>

<p>Greatly reducing the costs associated in these events.</p>

<p>I believe we now have the resources, and technological capability to create an advanced earthquake warning system. </p>

<p>Which could immediately predict the earths largest incoming seismic events. 
And given time would likely also begin to assess the earths smallest earthquakes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earths seismic data may not be quite that random at all-
From what I understand carbon emissions lead to the increase of heat decay on earth; Heat decay is significant as it warms frozen methane pockets allowing the gasses to eacape into our atmosphere.
Earths prime meridian is the warmest section on earth. This is due to orbital forces lifting heat at our centeral most region.
However...
As heat rises pockets of methane which are released as &#39;oxides&#39; travel within the orbital heat decay allowing methane to take flight into the upper atmosphere...
When the methane reaches the &#39;ionosphere&#39;; Ions begin to steadily strip the gasses of their products into their particle makeup, via a process called &#39;ionization&#39;.
As the methane is stripped protons meet with open current electrons, creating what we know as &#39;Plasma tubes&#39;. (Due to the orbital heat of the prime meridian the tubes rest near the ionosphere).
With that in mind:
Solar masses of plasma are often released from coronal hole structure, sun spots, coronal mass ejections, and various cosmic weather and interstellar events...
As the masses of plasma arrive to the earth. During the most caustic solar wind velocity shifts, the earths magnetosphere is breached by photons travelling between 350 and +900km/s.
When photons have surpassed the protective layers of the magnetosphere, and are introduced into the ionosphere. Electrons become the dominant force within the earths plasma tubes.
These tubes then convey deeply into the earths core and magma layer. As magma and particle accelerations interact, heat leads to expansion pockets which trap various expelling gasses. These noble gasses often explode sending a P wave towards the earths surface. (ricocheting off the techtonic plates above them;
The exact location of the striking p wave will be known as an epicenter, while the reverberating effect causes what seismologists know as S waves.
&quot;This is a process which creates many of our known earthquakes on earth&quot;
Taking existing seismic data from archives seismologists can assign geographic locations, a value of vulnderable via &#39;probability&#39;; assessments in annual interval can be used k. comparrison to the expected incoming solar masses. Leaving upto a 2-30day advanced earthquake precautionary measures window.
Most incoming solar related events have at least a 7 day advanced forcast.
My theory could be tested using a low a paired low frequency radio telescope to photograph the earths flux tubes during an incoming solar storm.
By taking a series of snapshots researchers could record the plasma tubes, as it interacts with the incoming solar plasma sheens.
Earthquakes and seismic data show an indirect relationship; Although: It is known that the data is suggestive of an existing relationship.
I feel the primary reason that it remained exlusive to the public is a small list of factors...
Firstly
The process takes time and there is a need to measure the effective time dialation when comparing the known or estimated makeup of the fields. Continued testing would likely evaluate the process giving a &#39;key&#39; to pre-assess the situation.
Secondly
The plasma tubes are now able to be photographed, which can lead to a documented definition forever changing the field of seismology.
Thirdly
Seismologists are not physicists; these two fields have common respect to eachother yet their general education is indifferent to eachother.
Conclusion:
&quot;My findings have shown a consistent relationship of this process. The data is available on the webarchive ceddit.com
(Via <a href="/u/globalhell">/u/globalhell</a> as a tracer.&quot;)
The dedicated fields of (astronomy and seismology), could reason to gain an immersive understanding of an advanced interplanetary system. Giving further insight and knowledge on solar storm effects on earth, as well as their relationship to seismic events which compliment them. &quot;This may very well lead to the future of an advanced earthquake prediction model&quot;.
&quot;Using past archives and comparing solar impacts and seismic episodes, may also expand the time dilation which occurs on the process&quot;. &quot;Going as far, as saying that: the locations may also have a clear definiton in terms of probability.&quot;

<p>Can Solar Activity Cause Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Extreme Weather?</p>

<p>Posted on August 25, 2011 <em>by WashingtonsBlog</em></p>

<p>Some Scientists Believe Solar Activity Can Cause Earthquakes, Volcanoes or Extreme Weather</p>

<p>A 1967 study published in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters found:</p>

<p>Solar activity, as indicated by sunspots, radio noise and geomagnetic indices, plays a significant but by no means exclusive role in the triggering of earthquakes. Maximum quake frequency occurs at times of moderately high and fluctuating solar activity. Terrestrial solar flare effects which are the actual coupling mechanisms which trigger quakes appear to be either abrupt accelerations in the earth’s angular velocity or surges of telluric currents in the earth’s crust. The graphs presented in this paper permit probabilistic forecasting of earthquakes, and when used in conjunction with local indicators may provide a significant tool for specific earthquake prediction.</p>

<p>A 1998 report by a scientist from the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, also found a correlation between low solar activity and earthquakes:</p>

<p>It has been found that:</p>

<p>(1) Earthquakes occur frequently around the minimum years of solar activity. Generally, the earthquake activities are relatively less during the peak value years of solar activity, some say, around the period when magnetic polarity in the solar polar regions is reversed.</p>

<p>(2) The earthquake frequency in the minimum period of solar activity is closely related to the maximum annual means of sunspot numbers, the maximum annual means of solar 10.7 cm radio flux and solar proton events of a whole solar cycle, and the relation between earthquake and solar proton events is closer than others.</p>

<p>Mitch Battros theorized in 1998 that large solar flares affect Earth’s magnetic field, which in turn shifts the oceanic and atmospheric currents, which can cause earthquakes and extreme weather. As Battros summarizes his formula:</p>

<p>Sunspots =&gt; Solar Flares (charged particles) =&gt; Magnetic Field Shift =&gt; Shifting Ocean and Jet Stream Currents =&gt; Extreme Weather [including earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes or other extreme natural events]</p>

<p>Battros’ theories have been endorsed to one degree or another by:</p>

<p>Dr. Ernest Hildner, Director NOAA Space Weather Center
Dr. Tom Van Flandern, former US Naval Observatory Chief of Celestial Mechanics
Dr. Stefaan Poedts: Lead Scientist University of Leuven Center for Plasma Astrophysics
Dr. Ronald van der Linden, Director of Solar Physics Department of the Royal Observatory
Dr. Pål Brekke, Deputy Director of SOHO project- European Space Agency
The BBC pointed out in 2008:</p>

<p>Nasa scientists have said they could be on the verge of a breakthrough in their efforts to forecast earthquakes.</p>

<p>Researchers say they have found a close link between electrical disturbances on the edge of our atmosphere and impending quakes on the ground below.</p>

<p>Just such a signal was spotted in the days leading up to the recent devastating event in China.</p>

<p>They have teamed up with experts in the UK to investigate a possible space-based early warning system.</p>

<p>Many in the scientific community remain deeply sceptical about whether such signals are indeed indicators of an approaching earthquake.</p>

<p>But Minoru Freund, a physicist and director for advanced aerospace materials and devices at Nasa’s Ames Research Center in California, told BBC News: “I do believe that we will be able to establish a clear correlation between certain earthquakes and certain pre-earthquake signals, in an unbiased way.”</p>

<p>The ionosphere is distinguished from other layers of Earth’s atmosphere because it is electrically charged through exposure to solar radiation.</p>

<p>On a significant number of occasions, satellites have picked up disturbances in this part of the atmosphere 100-600km above areas that have later been hit by earthquakes.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these is a fluctuation in the density of electrons and other electrically-charged particles in the ionosphere.</p>

<p>One study looked at over 100 earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or larger in Taiwan over several decades. The researchers found that almost all of the earthquakes down to a depth of about 35km were preceded by distinct electrical disturbances in the ionosphere.</p>

<p>The analysis was carried out by Jann-Yeng Liu, from the Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research in Chung-Li, Taiwan.</p>

<p>Though full details have yet to be released, the BBC understands that scientists also observed a “huge” signal in the ionosphere before the Magnitude 7.8 earthquake in China on 12 May.</p>

<p>Minoru and his father Friedemann Freund, also from Nasa Ames Research Center, developed the scientific theory behind these earthquake precursors. It boils down to the idea that when rocks are compressed – as when tectonic plates shift – they act like batteries, producing electric currents.</p>

<p>“We now pretty much understand the solid-state physics of these rocks,” Minoru added.</p>

<p>According to their theory, the charge carrier is a “positive hole”, known as a phole, which can travel large distances in laboratory experiments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cont:
When they travel to the surface of the Earth, the surface becomes positively charged. And this charge can be strong enough to affect the ionosphere, causing the disturbances documented by satellites.</p>

<p>When these pholes “recombine” at the surface of the Earth, they enter an excited state. They subsequently “de-excite” and emit mid-infrared light particles, or photons. This may explain the IR observations.</p>

<p>NASA assumes that compressed rocks release electrical charges which travel upwards into the ionosphere. But no one has tested whether or not the reverse is happening: solar fluctuations are charging the ionosphere, causing earthquakes.</p>

<p>NASA also discovered last year that “space weather” causes “spacequakes” on Earth:</p>

<p>Researchers using NASA’s fleet of five THEMIS spacecraft have discovered a form of space weather that packs the punch of an earthquake and plays a key role in sparking bright Northern Lights. They call it “the spacequake.”
A spacequake is a temblor in Earth’s magnetic field. It is felt most strongly in Earth orbit, but is not exclusive to space. The effects can reach all the way down to the surface of Earth itself.</p>

<p>“Magnetic reverberations have been detected at ground stations all around the globe, much like seismic detectors measure a large earthquake,” says THEMIS principal investigator Vassilis Angelopoulos of UCLA.</p>

<p>It’s an apt analogy because “the total energy in a spacequake can rival that of a magnitude 5 or 6 earthquake,” according to Evgeny Panov of the Space Research Institute in Austria.</p>

<p>“Now we know,” says THEMIS project scientist David Sibeck of the Goddard Space Flight Center. “Plasma jets trigger spacequakes.”</p>

<p>According to THEMIS, the jets crash into the geomagnetic field some 30,000 km above Earth’s equator. The impact sets off a rebounding process, in which the incoming plasma actually bounces up and down on the reverberating magnetic field. Researchers call it “repetitive flow rebuffing.” It’s akin to a tennis ball bouncing up and down on a carpeted floor. The first bounce is a big one, followed by bounces of decreasing amplitude as energy is dissipated in the carpet.</p>

<p>“When plasma jets hit the inner magnetosphere, vortices with opposite sense of rotation appear and reappear on either side of the plasma jet,” explains Rumi Nakamura of the Space Research Institute in Austria, a co-author of the study. “We believe the vortices can generate substantial electrical currents in the near-Earth environment.”</p>

<p>Acting together, vortices and spacequakes could have a noticeable effect on Earth. The tails of vortices may funnel particles into Earth’s atmosphere, sparking auroras and making waves of ionization that disturb radio communications and GPS. By tugging on surface magnetic fields, spacequakes generate currents in the very ground we walk on. Ground current surges can have profound consequences, in extreme cases bringing down power grids over a wide area.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Some allege that spacequakes cause actual, physical earthquakes on Earth. The above-quoted NASA article concludes with a poem which implies such a connection:</p>

<p>Vortices swirl</p>

<p>plasma a’twirl</p>

<p>Richter predicts</p>

<p>a magnitude six</p>

<p>However, the poem may use artistic license rather than scientific rigor.</p>

<p>BBC weather presenter and climate correspondent Paul Hudson noted in March:</p>

<p>Last year a preliminary study was published from the Space and Science research centre in Florida. [Here is the study]</p>

<p>A review of historical records was performed for 350 years of global volcanic activity (1650-2009) and seismic (earthquake) activity for the past 300 years (1700 to 2009) within the continental United States and then compared to the Sun’s record of sunspots as a measure of solar activity.</p>

<p>According to this study, there exists a strong correlation between solar activity and the Earth’s largest seismic and volcanic events.</p>

<p>They found an impressive degree of correlation for global volcanic activity (&gt;80.6%) and for the largest USA earthquakes (100% of the top 7 most powerful) versus solar activity lows.</p>

<p>Piers Corbyn, at Weather action, added last month following the New Zealand earthquake that within such long quieter solar periods like we have been through, the biggest earthquake &amp; volcano events are triggered by extra solar activity, particularly during the the rising phase of even solar cycles.</p>

<p>This is precisely where we are now as Solar cycle 24 gains in strength….</p>

<p>According to Mr Corbyn, ‘The (New Zealand) event follows the world wide increase in volcanism and earthquakes in the last year or two and confirms the general statistical fact that more – and more serious – earthquakes, and volcanic activity, tend to occur around solar cycle minima’.</p>

<p>He reckons there will be more strong earthquakes like the ones we have recently witnessed in the next 2 years.</p>

<p>This is another one of those frustrating areas of science. There does seem to be empirical evidence to show a link between periods of low solar activity, and increased occurrences of earthquakes, but quite why this is so is not fully understood.</p>

<p>RT claimed in July:</p>

<p>The change in the Earth’s seismic activity coincides with the rise of activity on the sun. Scientists have been witnessing gigantic bursts of plasma on its surface and say they are affecting our planet, even though it is over 90 million miles away.</p>

<p>Each burst sends billions of particles into space which impacts the Earth’s magnetic field. This may trigger some of the processes going on deep bellow its surface, leading to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p>Scientists predict solar activity will increase and say in the next few years, large-scale disruptions of electronic equipment, radio transmissions, computer failures and massive black-outs could become parts of everyday life.</p>

I&#39;m pretty confident based on everything you&#39;ve shared that you&#39;re a part of the research body and simply being ignored / marginalized, but one never knows.  The problem here is two-fold.  1. If you&#39;re correct you would strip all of these researchers who have spent tens of millions of dollars of their funding and they would never get another grant.  These are arrogant, know everything type people who are not out for progress but to satisfy their assertions of being the smartest people in the room.  2. The entire infrastructure of the USGS and other agencies would be upended which would expose it for the extreme waste of money it is.  Budgets would be slashed (rightfully so) and their posture in the scientific community would fall.  They would never let this happen.  I&#39;ve seen this time and time again in politics. </p>

<p>This is the type of presentation that needs to be made to PCAST.  If you need assistance getting this to the right people let me know.  USGS is currently holding research interviews in silicon valley for their next wave of funding.  They are extremely narrow minded in their approach and will only fund if the research supports certain investigations (and potentially even certain conclusions) but you clearly need more exposure than this board.  DM me and we can chat.  At a minimum email Mario Molina, Daniel Schrag, and Ernest Moniz.  Cheers my friend.  I applaud your willingness not to hoard this info and make actual progress in the world.  We need more people like you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ty. 
Tbh if you believe you know others that should have this. 
Its 100% legit. This should work to some variation, and in time may lead to a 99% effective system depending on the design team. </p>

<p>Anyone you think that could use this or have this share. 
Its likely worth a lot of money. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore...
I don&#39;t even know why I researched this that long. </p>

<p>I need a job and a life again.
My spirits broken...</p>

<p>I just want to know if it works. I want to help the world...</p>

<p>You are right about many people-
Their grandeur being threatened makes me a vulnerability. 
Thats why I am truly hoping someone like elon musk sees this. Its truly that important an idea. 
One id hate to not give to the world.</p>

<p>So now ive done just that. 
Given it away...</p>

<p>In hopes it will save all the lives it could-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve done something worthwhile.  Do not allow your spirit to be broken.  Most of humanity never comes close to the impact you can make.  Let that drive you.  There are several ways to think about this and you should be compensated for this so don&#39;t think about giving it away yet.  Monetizing something is typically the only way to make people pay attention.  If I were you, I would approach insurance companies.  They are the ones that lose tons of money to the rebuild.  Why not offer them some insurance themselves?  This approach seems a win win to me?  Forget the US Gov. they are a waste of time.  Btw, the US is not the only country that needs earthquake prevention.  Ever think about showing this to another country?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hence why I only give assessments of data. Having completed several public tests with a variable yet essentially high degree of accuracy. </p>

<p>I am just a human. Its about what programmers can do with this from here. Factually they can take this to the next level. Its all far more complex then any one person can accomplish. </p>

<p>Ive never claimed to be magic. I just read data and extract variables which effectively fit into a set of parameters I designed. These tests have effectively spotted most significant seismic episodes on earth since november 2016. (when I began posting here). </p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to oush users towards extracting the relevant data. This data may prive highly consistent in developing an advanced seismic prediction algorithm. </p>

<p>I also believe that after many years their model could stand to gain by adding more parameters. Not sure if they use bz component or schumann resonances as an example. To me its viable to assess 80% of seismic activity wotg oo% accuracy. 
We simply have to keep tracking what actually sticks to create a more sophisticated model. </p>

<p>Id be curious to see how effective tge model is and what their programming code was. Ty for the link :)</p>

Yet their algorithms would be greatly enhanced by teaming up with a variety of software engineers that use predictive monitoring software. (like teslas crash prediction algorithm). I also doubt they cross checked the bz componet data. Which also would greatly diminish their models accuracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone ever questioned if pulling oil out of the ground has a direct correlation with seismic activity and climate change? As the earth tectonic plates are losing (oil) which is a buffer for plates to move, which is now causing friction and knocking the earth off it&#39;s normal rotating course? Weather patterns that would occur over the open ocean are not occurring over land since the earth is moving irregularly? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pressure of pumping chemicals into the ground to extract the oil is creating earthquakes. Once the oil is extracted and the plates try and go back to a resting position, the oil that was once their as a buffer is gone, so they rub together creating quakes. 
Just the idea of carbon being released into the atmosphere, and is causing climate change is a bit far fetched. If the oil was in the ground the earth would not have a tilt, and therefore weather patterns wouldn&#39;t be irregular. </p>
