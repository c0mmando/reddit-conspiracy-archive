    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s not a legend, and never will be, he is a massive fucking LARPer that enjoy&#39;s making his crappy tabletop worlds like it&#39;s fucking D&amp;D.</p>

<p>He&#39;s constantly pressed here, because he&#39;s an annoying /b/ tier dickhead, and people on the sub-reddit are quick to hope due to their lack of faith.</p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s a so called &quot;habbeing!!! XDD&quot; going on tomorrow. No there isn&#39;t, and even if it is, it&#39;s Project Blue Beam, and if VOTL isn&#39;t a LARPer, he&#39;s as I&#39;ve stated several times: a deciever shilling for the establishment/illuminati/whatever, then five year&#39;s later he&#39;s the fucking Anti-Christ.</p>

<p>On the other hand I&#39;ll let you guys on a little secret:</p>

<p>Have faith, and trust in the words I say Christ exists, but the Christian version of him, is inspired by the truth, in fact all religion is inspired by the truth, but in majority Paganism and Christianity is actually one, and the creator is &quot;a woman&quot;, I would go a lot deeper but, well, If I give too much, many of you will dismiss me, I&#39;ve given you a few shavings and you will dismiss me. Within the next five years, the truth will be revealed, whether you choose to believe what I said, is up to faith and trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Orthodox, 7th Day, Protestants, and Jehovah&#39;s Witness is the only really pure form of Christianity, but even then they&#39;ve still got a bit to go.</p>

<p>Not much reconciles, the closest you&#39;ll get too is Mary, the clothing of the priests, but Christianity is a spin-off of Judaism, mixed with Roman Pagan elements (Saturnalia = Christmas, although JC was born around Sept. 25-Decem.25) </p>

<p>Christianity has essentially divided itself, but that had a purpose, Christians that have faith and trust in JC are &quot;god&#39;s&quot; people, the Jews fell out of favor long ago, but it&#39;s likely they are waiting for JC to set foot on earth again, hence the &quot;true messiah&quot;</p>

<p>Are you sure it was the Godlike Productions forum that tipped you off, and not the baby with a skin disease that was being passed off as an alien? Or maybe it was the statement that Jimmy Kimmel and Jon Stewart were the ones that turned them on to politics.</p>

<p>To be honest, I wasn&#39;t completely sure how I felt about the account until today. The fact that he&#39;s trying to pass off a typo as a secret code related to aliens just confirms that it&#39;s a LARP for me. He&#39;s just openly taking the piss now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very obvious he is a LARP, or at the most, a Double Agent masking as a &quot;agent of good&quot; when he is in reality either the Anti-Christ, he&#39;s here to makeor simply here to do the good old &quot;divide and conqueror&quot; to prevent a true uprising.</p>

<p>Covfefe on the otherhand is simply Trump misspelling coverage, it&#39;s fairly obvious, but VOTL is either deceiving, larping, or being a total tard.</p>

<p>Also he keeps talking about those fucking UFOs called &quot;TR-3Bs&quot; when the reality is that the so called &quot;patent&quot; is a fucking fake made by some fucking whackjob in 2012 for internet credit. Mind everyone else the Belgian UFO wave Spacecraft (Triangles with three yellow lights) were alien, but the TR3B is a completely unrelated vehicle that never had a &quot;patent&quot; made, but was nevertheless still in development.</p>

<p>In other words: Don&#39;t trust VOTL, sources are slightly more reliable,  but they are still fucking sandwiches made of shit meat instead of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People aren&#39;t going out of their way to discredit him,he&#39;s doing it himself.  Just because people find fault in something doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s close to the truth, it just means there&#39;s something wrong with the info.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the most annoying thing about this sub.  Every time there&#39;s a problem with a conspiracy and people start speaking out about it there&#39;s always a group of people that think it&#39;s only getting called out because &quot;they don&#39;t want us talking about it, therefore we must be getting close to the truth,&quot; when in reality the more rational people just see it for what it is and know it&#39;s a waste of time to dwell on it.  </p>

<p>Noone wants to talk about flat earth, and the flat earthers think it&#39;s a giant coverup. When in reality it&#39;s just not being discussed because anyone who can do somewhat simple math can discredit it, but you&#39;re not going to get those who can&#39;t to believe it by showing them what they think are random numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Debate around it, try and understand different viewpoints, thought processes, don&#39;t throw out un reasoned opinions. Debate properly people! Stop dragging personal issues into these discussions, it only benefits the people who could potentially &quot;get away&quot; with whatever we are discussing and ultimately just hurts the community. (Understandably, shills aren&#39;t going to go with this.. but then won&#39;t it be 100 times easier to realise who is a bot/shill/troll?)</p>

<p>We are supposed to question everything. But a big point around that is QUESTION everything, questioning things turns up facts, or discuss possibilities which can lead to facts. Who cares if a wild thought is wrong?! If someone thinks of a potential idea, then the likelyhood of someone else thinking of it and acting upon that is pretty high in this day and age.</p>

<p>Everything he/she &quot;released&quot; can be found on the internet before he/she ever posted it.</p>

<p>So what exactly do his/her followers think was released for truth? Cause we all talk about evidence and the one post here that showed was lying and instantly people started buzzing like they wanted to input but not discuss what was just presented showing he/she is false. . .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. All I can do is look at this and smh. This is so fucking stupid. All the talk of religion Jesus, antichrist and Christianity peppered in here make it sound even more fucking stupid. </p>

<p>Some random moron on twitter is playing make believe and somehow this is a viable topic on this sub bc only now you&#39;re finding out he lied about it all lol? People are really, really, really fucking dumb nowadays. Talk about something worth talking about. Think critically for fucks sake. Bc this is just some time wasting bullshit. </p>

<p>I think he gained notoriety when Obama started following him. That&#39;s second hand info though, so don&#39;t quote me on that. Regardless, LARPS gonna LARP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People aren&#39;t going out of their way to discredit him,he&#39;s doing it himself.  Just because people find fault in something doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s close to the truth, it just means there&#39;s something wrong with the info.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the most annoying thing about this sub.  Every time there&#39;s a problem with a conspiracy and people start speaking out about it there&#39;s always a group of people that think it&#39;s only getting called out because &quot;they don&#39;t want us talking about it, therefore we must be getting close to the truth,&quot; when in reality the more rational people just see it for what it is and know it&#39;s a waste of time to dwell on it.  </p>

<p>Noone wants to talk about flat earth, and the flat earthers think it&#39;s a giant coverup. When in reality it&#39;s just not being discussed because anyone who can do somewhat simple math can discredit it, but you&#39;re not going to get those who can&#39;t to believe it by showing them what they think are random numbers.</p>
