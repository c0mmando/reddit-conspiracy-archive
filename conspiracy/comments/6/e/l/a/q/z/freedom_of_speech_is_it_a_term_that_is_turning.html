    <div class="md"><p>My main question was based around the topic you replied to, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ok for me to tell someone else how to live there life (religious or not), therefore some aspects of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; should be condemned. Many will disagree, as they will say they reserve the right on a moral stance to tell eastern religions that it&#39;s wrong to treat women the way they do plus many other things, but really it&#39;s none of our business</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally my view on this is we are dealing with the consequences of human communication being primarily face to face or voice to voice to written communication (social media etc) human communication when sitting face to face is mostly made up of body language and tone something which is lost when using written language.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get offended when your brain cant understand the tone of which something was said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I have real concerns that the rights I possess in this country to speak my opinions freely should be restricted by some dope&#39;s definition of appropriateness. There is NO right in this country to be shielded from my opinions simply because someone has taken offence to them. Triggering someone else&#39;s ire does not constitute incitement, nor is it akin to shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded building. If &quot;offence&quot; to others is the measure of free speech, then I have quite a list of folks who owe me their silence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the thing is that a lot of people just run around trying to piss everyone off and then claim they have freedom of speech and that everyone else can fuck off if they feel offended.<br/>
That&#39;s not what the first amendment stands for (or any other freedom of speech law).<br/>
Freedom of speech means that you shall not be prosecuted for your religious or political beliefs and that you are free to express them.<br/>

If you are offended by my comment, that&#39;s not my problem, it&#39;s actually yours.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You make MY point! That offence to words is definitely the RECIPIENT&#39;S problem if I am not endangering anyone&#39;s health or welfare with mine.
