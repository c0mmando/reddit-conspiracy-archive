       There’s an exception to freedom of speech in relation to incitement. I don’t agree, but this could potentially be seen to fall under that.

       Do you think I reserve the right as a white man, who knows nothing about the Muslim religion apart from the general basics, to be make moral decisions on what they ' can and cannot do ' as part of their religion? Face to face/internet chat both included

       My main question was based around the topic you replied to, I don't think it's ok for me to tell someone else how to live there life (religious or not), therefore some aspects of "freedom of speech" should be condemned. Many will disagree, as they will say they reserve the right on a moral stance to tell eastern religions that it's wrong to treat women the way they do plus many other things, but really it's none of our business

       Constructive criticism is something I widely support.
       <br/>
       But I'm also a firm believer in the separation of politics and religion.
       <br/>
       And, yes, I do believe that the western world can criticise eastern religions, but also vice versa.
       <br/>
       Freedom of speech gives everyone the right to express critique on any subject, but the freedom of your speech ends where someone else gets offended.

       You are, of course, correct.

       Personally my view on this is we are dealing with the consequences of human communication being primarily face to face or voice to voice to written communication (social media etc) human communication when sitting face to face is mostly made up of body language and tone something which is lost when using written language.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to get offended when your brain cant understand the tone of which something was said.

       Again, I have real concerns that the rights I possess in this country to speak my opinions freely should be restricted by some dope's definition of appropriateness. There is NO right in this country to be shielded from my opinions simply because someone has taken offence to them. Triggering someone else's ire does not constitute incitement, nor is it akin to shouting "Fire!" in a crowded building. If "offence" to others is the measure of free speech, then I have quite a list of folks who owe me their silence.

       Well, the thing is that a lot of people just run around trying to piss everyone off and then claim they have freedom of speech and that everyone else can fuck off if they feel offended.
       <br/>
       That's not what the first amendment stands for (or any other freedom of speech law).
       <br/>
       Freedom of speech means that you shall not be prosecuted for your religious or political beliefs and that you are free to express them.
       <br/>
       Calling someone a nigger, chink, kraut, jap, spic or whatever has nothing to do with freedom of speech. It's just ignorant.

       Words are usually interpreted by everyone differently.
       <br/>
       If you are offended by my comment, that's not my problem, it's actually yours.
       <br/>
       However, if there is a legislative foundation to have me prosecuted for my words, then my freedom of speech can surely be used against me; if there is not - I'll give zero fucks.

       You make MY point! That offence to words is definitely the RECIPIENT'S problem if I am not endangering anyone's health or welfare with mine. (And if hurting someone's feelings is considered endangering their health or welfare, we have quite the proverbial slippery slope) And if "words can be interpreted by everyone differently" then how the hell can you follow the "legislative foundation" to prosecute me for mine? Legislation is recorded and conveyed in......words.......

       No. But the term "Climate Change" is. Due to the fact that change is the one and only constant.

       Can you beat Global Warming? Yes!

       Can you beat Climate Change? No. Climate will always have change.

       Not saying we should not make the earth a better place to live. But we need to start by putting sanctions on countries that are tearing their forests at a rate higher than they are planting trees

       Fossil fuels have little to do with the problem. They are a dying breed. They will die off soon enough because we have better solutions.

       The right to freedom of speech is considered self evident by Americas revolutionary founders. If there's any turmoil it's from the tyrants.

       There’s an exception to freedom of speech in relation to incitement. I don’t agree, but this could potentially be seen to fall under that.

       Constructive criticism is something I widely support.
       <br/>
       But I'm also a firm believer in the separation of politics and religion.
       <br/>
       And, yes, I do believe that the western world can criticise eastern religions, but also vice versa.
       <br/>
       Freedom of speech gives everyone the right to express critique on any subject, but the freedom of your speech ends where someone else gets offended.

       Well, the thing is that a lot of people just run around trying to piss everyone off and then claim they have freedom of speech and that everyone else can fuck off if they feel offended.
       <br/>
       That's not what the first amendment stands for (or any other freedom of speech law).
       <br/>
       Freedom of speech means that you shall not be prosecuted for your religious or political beliefs and that you are free to express them.
       <br/>
       Calling someone a nigger, chink, kraut, jap, spic or whatever has nothing to do with freedom of speech. It's just ignorant.
