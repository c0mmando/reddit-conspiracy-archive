<p>We were fucking duped. And this could hurt the sub, could hurt the resistance. They are trying to merge to conspiracy culture with conservative ideas and support of Trump, to stifle and calm rebellion against the system. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re all chasing the DNC in the past. I agree they should be held accountable for their crimes. My opinion right now is, ANYBODY of status going to jail could help us. </p>

<p>We are not in a post WW2 world. US tools are waaaay beyond any Russian move. They (agencies) know everything that happens everywhere.  I&#39;m just yet to made up my mind if Pizzagate thing is a real thing or completely made up from a get go, to engage conservatives. But planned murders (or &#39;suicides&#39;)  and &#39;terrorist attacks&#39; are a real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but how. Both real and fake media are  putting fuel to fire with their white-supremacy (conservative) vs. most weird transgender alien person (democrat) examples.</p>

<p>The whole narrative of both sides is the same thing in the mirror. </p>

<p>There is no middle ground. There are no moderate people. </p>

<p>Either you are a nazi, or you are commie, either you are pro-muslim ISIS supporter or you are anti-muslim bigoted facist.</p>

<p>There was a moment a few weeks ago I realized this. And media is the most responsible factor for this state. They are propagating extremism on both sides. It can&#39;t be accidentaly.</p>

<p>I was thinking to myself, if ISIS attacks in europe are staged by someone else, how can the white-supremacist attacks be staged by that same someone else. It maked no sense. But , oh , how it makes sense now!</p>

<p>It&#39;s in the picture to the right of this forum. Everything is a rich man&#39;s game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multiple motives and objectives for this type of psyop. For one, to distract from the content of the actual leaks. Second, for the CIA and its assets in the media to further demonize Russia among the left using a guilt by association tactic by blaming them for Trump winning the (orchestrated) election and to manipulate them into supporting an eventual armed conflict with the nation or at minimum is opposing Russia&#39;s foreign policy objectives and to ignore Russian media criticizing American foreign policy. Third, to further divide and distract the masses with a manufactured controversy, so they remained mired in the banality of the false left-right paradigm and do not dig deeper into the real issues or become aware of those who truly wield power behind the scenes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always deflecting to &quot;WHO&quot; leaked, not &quot;WHAT&quot; was leaked. </p>

<p>&quot;Trumps cabinet members kinda scare me. Goldman Sachs? Wilbur Ross? also what&#39;s up with kushner?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh so you think he&#39;s a Russian spy huh?&quot;</p>
