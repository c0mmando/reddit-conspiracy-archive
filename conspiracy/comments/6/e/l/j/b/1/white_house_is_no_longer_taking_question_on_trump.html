       Trump is an idiot who has no say with what is going on and happening... When Obama was president I was told I had to make sure not to blame only him as he answers to so many people. Now all of a sudden Trump is in charge of every decision...
      </p>
      <p>
       Kushner was absolutely handling trump business but people are trying to make something out of nothing there(well there's nothing to it out in the open yet just a bunch of he said she said, Kush and Don want to build the temple) . Flynn and Manafort could have other reasons for meeting with russians. Just like other politicians and connected individuals who have met with the russians in the past.

       Setting up a back channel to Russia using Russian equipment so our government can't surveil what is being said isn't "nothing."  If Hillary took office and John Podesta secretly met with Saudi Arabia (for example) and attempted to set up a secret back channel that our government couldn't surveil would you say "no big deal!  Nothing here!"  I doubt it.  Also, keep in mind that in this scenario Podesta would also fail to disclose this meeting on his security clearance applications (as Kushner failed to disclose his meeting with Russia on his).  Yeah... nothing strange about that...

       So you think it's normal that Kushner would secretly meet with Russia to set up a backchannel on Russian equipment to avoid US surveillance (but not Russian surveillance) and then lie on his security clearance application about the meeting ever happening.. that's normal?  Nothing worth asking about that?  Ok then...  you trust the government more than me apparently.

       What was made up and why won't you address the point.. is that normal to you?  The facts are what they are.  Kushner met with Russia and wanted to set up a backchannel using Russian equipment and then didn't disclose this meeting in any way on his security clearance application.  The White House is saying that they needed a secret backchannel to work with Russia on the Syria issue without the obama admin being able to interfere.  That's their reasoning... that doesn't explain why Kushner would fail to disclose the meeting but that's the story the White House is floating.  You're ok with that?

       I mean it's not outrageous is it? Obama had a backchannel with Iran before he was President. It happens all the time this is nothing new. I think Trump is bad news but I think the MSM is just publishing story after story to keep us confused to what the truth actually is.

       Obama didn't have a backchannel on Iranian equipment from an undisclosed meeting.  It's not the same at all.  Why didn't Kushner disclose the meeting if there was nothing unusual happening?  Why was his initial response to have his lawyer say he doesn't recall the meeting and then after Flynn (who was also in the meeting) said he will release info to the FBI suddenly the story changed from maybe the meeting didn't happen to "of course we wanted a secret backchannel.. there's nothing unusual with that."  You have a lot of faith in the good intentions of the trump administration who has been lying every step of the way up until they can't lie anymore and then changing their tune from denial to "everyone does this!"  I thought they were elected to stop doing what every administration does...

       Hey, can you please stop imagining what my faith is and where it lies. You're not very good at it. I am not defending Kushner. Or the intentions of anyone. In fact, I have stated otherwise. I have no idea why they were elected. I don't get involved in electing fools.

       You are being an apologist for what he did and saying obama did the same thing with Iran.  He didn't.  So I question why you are saying there is nothing out of the ordinary here when there is unless you have faith in the Trump administration being above board.

       These aren't Washington post hit-pieces.. this Kushner story isn't denied by the White House.. they even explained why they did it (but didn't explain why Kushner didn't disclose the meeting).  Is the White House doing a hit piece on themselves?

       I didn't deflect.. you did.. you brought up the Washington post.. I didn't get my information from the post.. I got my information from White House surrogates attempting to explain Kushner's actions.  I can't believe the Post OR the White House.. so who do you get news from?

       Why is every one of your replies about me personally?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a bunch of times. You make up scenarios, make up excuses for others similar behavior, try and turn it around on me personally. When I haven't said the Kushner thing didn't exist. Just because you see it as the end of the world and I don't does not mean I have faith in any body in politics or the gov't.

       I don't see it as the end of the world.. I see it as a piece of the puzzle.  And why wouldn't he disclose the meeting on his security clearance application?  Ok.. he wants a backchannel to the country his admin is accused to colluding with.. let's assume that's normal.  Why not disclose the meeting on his security clearance application?  Why are multiple members of the administration consistently lying about meeting with Russians?  The coverup may be worse than the crime.

       Saying you think it's normal before stating implies I am okay with this administration doing it. His last statement of I trust the gov't more than him (which isn't important and is flat out false).

       How many times can the white house say "there is no evidence to back your allegations?" Trump is no saint, might even be some kind of stooge, but this russia stuff is utter nonsense! Good for them for not answering the same rubbish questions over and over.

       For some reason most of the media is happy to talk about Russian hacking, Russian collusion, with no evidence, but investigate the death of Seth Rich? No way, that's for conspiracy theorists!

       There is a ton of evidence that the administration is in bed with the Russians. And there is a ton of evidence of inappropriate contact between the Russians and campaign officials. While we may not have concrete proof of actual campaign collusion, with so much evidence surrounding the Trump-Russia relationship, no reasonable person could call it nonsense to investigate.

       And Seth Rich's murder was investigated. He didn't have the necessary access to get the emails. On top of that the FBI already said the story about them having his laptop with evidence of the emails was false. Wheeler even admitted after his story was retracted that he had never seen the evidence personally himself.

       I reckon it's because the subject is boring as fuck. Not because there's nothing to it. Israel ties - legit, Saudi ties - legit, whatever ties - legit, why can't Russia ties be legit as fuck, do you reckon they should start a war with Russia for whatever fake reason ?
