    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incredibly complicated and essentially impossible to explain in a comment. Watch George Webb&#39;s videos on YouTube, try to find some summary videos. </p>

<p>Essentially, these guys the Awans set up a massive network of synced blackberries in congress to use for blackmail I believe. Something like that. They worked for DWS and there are a lot more connections to other organizations that are tied in by money. Organ harvesting, drug and child trafficking. It&#39;s all related to Pizzagate, 9/11, black budget space programs, the whole kit and caboodle. </p>

<p>Just watch George Webb on YouTube. It&#39;s impossible to explain in a post or a comment. </p>

<p>He has funds, time, money, equipment, energy, hasn&#39;t really been character assassinated yet. Potential plant is what my paranoid personality says (ha ha). Who knows. I pray he genuine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my limited knowledge, they&#39;re the DNCs top IT guy, working for DWS, which gave them access to all the information from most Dem politician&#39;s smartphones, laptops etc... Then they lost one of their laptops (which was probably filled with a lot of sensitive information.) There was a video a few days ago showing DWS threaten the DC Chief of Police to try and recover said laptop (it was found by DC Police.)</p>

<p>What is actually on the laptop...only the Awan Brothers, the DC Police and maybe DWS know. She could have been told by Awan Brothers what was on it. </p>

<p>Everything else is conjecture and speculation though, but given how desperate DWS seemed to retrieve it and DC Chief of Police referencing it as evidence in an active investigation, it seems vitally important for some reason or another.</p>
