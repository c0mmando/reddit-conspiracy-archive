        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">541</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-05-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/CheneyShotFirst.html">CheneyShotFirst</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Throwaway account here since this is not a known &quot;conspiracy&quot; and I only have knowledge of it through a personal connection.</p>

<p>We all remember when Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington in the face during a bird hunting accident back in 2006 right? Well, I am here to tell you that Dick Cheney did not shoot Whittington that day. It was actually a woman named Pamela Willeford who accidentally shot Whittington.</p>

<p>Willeford was a Bush family friend and the Ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein at the time, a cushy ambassadorship Bush had appointed her to in 2003. She was the only other person hunting with Cheney and Whittington that day. Willeford accidentally shot Whittington, not Cheney. So what possible reason could the Vice President have to take the blame for shooting a man he did not shoot? Easy...He was having an affair with Pamela Willeford. </p>

<p>Once it was clear that Whittington was going to survive, the political calculus said that the news that Cheney shot a man in the face would be so out there (especially with his sith lord image back then) that the reporters would totally ignore Willeford and the incident would just be a joke on late night TV and viral internet articles. That it would be so ridiculous that the VP shot someone that they wouldn&#39;t even bother to ask why Pamela Willeford was there hunting with Cheney that day. </p>

<p>If the story had been that Willeford shot Whittington while hunting with Cheney all the journalists would have been trying to find out who she was, why she was there hunting with the VP, etc. The affair would have most likely been revealed. If you go back and look, I believe it was something like 10-14 hours after the incident before they let the cops on the property/made any kind of comment. It took so long because they were waiting to see if Whittington would live (since a death investigation would completely change the calculus) before they decided what story they were going wtih.</p>

<p>There were a few other fishy things that point towards this story being true. Willeford was hunting with a 4/10 (or maybe it was a 28 gauge, it has been a while since I read up on it) while Cheney was hunting with a 12 gauge shotgun. If you know about guns there is a HUGE difference between getting shot in the face with a 4/10 or 28 gauge vs. a 12 gauge. I also remember at the time they had articles that broke down the story as far as where everybody was standing etc that showed the official story was not right.</p>

<p>But besides all that how do I know this is true? Because I am (distantly) related to Pamela Willeford by marriage. I heard both stories (true and false) before it was on CNN or anywhere else. You have no reason to believe me, but this is the true story of what really happened on that fateful day in 2006 when the sitting VP, Dick Cheney, was involved in a hunting accident.</p>

<p>Edit for Willefords Wiki link: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Willeford">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Willeford</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: I showed this to a friend and he googled and found an article that actually makes some of the same allegations I do: <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/32311/cheney&#x27;s_buckshot_reader">http://www.alternet.org/story/32311/cheney&#39;s_buckshot_reader</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see why you might think that it would identify me, but to explain why it won&#39;t would actually identify me. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think there are any repercussions to be had here. I am an anonymous user posting on a conspiracy forum with nothing but my words to back me up. They aren&#39;t going to bother spending the energy, however little it takes, to do anything because most people aren&#39;t going to believe me (I don&#39;t expect them too myself either). Also, it doesn&#39;t matter if some people reading this believe it anyway because what are they going to do? This happened back in 2006 and Cheney is no longer in public office. Who cares?</p>

<p>As for whether it is true or not, like I said I don&#39;t expect most people to believe me. It doesn&#39;t matter, I know it is true and I wanted to tell it. You can take it or leave it. That being said I showed this to a friend who did some googling and apparently there were a few allegations that are alleging the same things I am. Here is a link and I am going to edit the main post to include it as well:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no I can see it. But in no means do I see that as the more likely scenario.</p>

<p>Honest opinion, it was the sith lord comment that makes me believe this.</p>

<p>If I had to take shot in the dark Op is between 28-38.</p>

<p>But I read it as someone who enjoys his public persona seeming evil covers up story because Americans believe he is just that evil. So adding that he lied about it when he was receiving the apologies, not giving them, just shows me that he was and still is a malevolant being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there was ever any question about whether or not Cheney is a malevolent being.

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, it looks like the plan was: claim Cheney shot the lawyer, admit she was there, hope to God that the claim that Cheney shot his friend would monopolize the press&#39; attention, and they wouldn&#39;t care about the girl.  Hide that she&#39;s there, and someone later finds out, they might go &quot;why wasn&#39;t she mentioned before&quot;. I find it seductively plausible, but there&#39;s no real proof.

I can&#39;t reconcile politics and its evil basis with what I sometimes feel are actually good people.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP, I&#39;ve been looking into this every now and then and I have to admit that your theory threw a curve ball for me.</p>

<p>My question is if Whittington and Cheney were not friends and only had met a couple of times before their hunting trip, then why was Whittington invited in the first place?</p>

<p>Also, to this day, Cheney has not apologized for shooting Whittington although shortly after the accident, Whittington was on TV apologizing profusely for gettting shot by Cheney, like it was Whittington&#39;s fault.  </p>

<p>Hey OP, could it be that the story you got was the cover up to the cover up?</p>

<p>To me, it looked like Cheney wanted Whittington to do something for him and Whittington said no.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were but it was only those 3 together when the shooting happened. Nobody else was with them to see what happened. A woman named Armstrong (who some believe was Whittington&#39;s mistress) and who I believe worked at the Ranch was hunting with them but was in the car and not present for the shooting. There was nobody else to blame it on.</p>

<p>As for the gun knowledge, you are correct there is a lot more that goes into it than gauge, but in most cases if I had the choice I would rather be shot with a .410 than a 12 gauge. Look at it this way, Willeford was hunting with a .410 (or  28 gauge, again I can&#39;t remember) and not a 12 gauge because the recoil is much lower. The recoil is going to be equal to the amount of force applied on target because of physics. The 12 gauge is putting out more force than the .410</p>

<p>Also, for the naysayers, if I was going to make up some conspiracy theory, don&#39;t you think this one is not the one I would make up? Like who would even come up with this story in the first place? Especially about an event that almost nobody even cares about anymore.</p>
