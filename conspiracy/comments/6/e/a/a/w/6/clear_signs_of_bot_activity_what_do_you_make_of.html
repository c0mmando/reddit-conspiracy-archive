       Look at
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6e9w3l/breaking_comey_admits_the_fbi_was_never_given/">
        this post
       </a>
       that was recently created, and scroll down to the comment by doubleobama. They pointed out comments that were exactly the same as in
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e9n0a/breaking_comey_admits_the_fbi_was_never_given/">
        this T_D thread
       </a>
       , but they were posted by different accounts. If you click on any of those accounts, you will see most of them were created around the exact time (~24-26 days ago). After this was pointed out, the OP deleted his post.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are your opinions on what's happening? Are these poorly disguised bots, or are they fake bots (something akin to a false flag)?

       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       : the users from T_D that made the original comments are older accounts, and it's the accounts lifting their comments and posting them in r/conspiracy that are ~24-26 days old. Maybe it's a bot to spam stuff from T_D? Also potentially relevant is this post just started by u/skoalbrother:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6eafuy/realdonaldtrump_account_has_gained_over_5_million/">

       <strong>
        Edit 2
       </strong>
       : Here are accounts that seem to be bots lifting comments from elsewhere (mods, let me know if this isn't allowed and I'll delete it). CNCCocoa, Cubelover777, Delta-bomb, Aryan-Swede, DroneLee, AuroraofDeath, Bond_0007, Colouratura, discogoatsex, DarePunisher, Detective_Mash, Daipenmon, SultanPeach, AuroraofStubs, GodofLs, Kirin_Spam, PatriotEAGLE98 (I'll update as more are discovered)

       Look at the comments below by u/Mouth2005 for a lot more examples (thank you for compiling all of those links!)

       <strong>
        Edit 3

       For people here who genuinely want to expose and understand these types of games, take a look at
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">
        this thread
       </a>
       . The links in the OP are great, but also look at the confessions of paid shills down in the first comment chain. It'll help you better understand the tactics being used

       I know it's a given that they exist, but now we have pretty clear evidence of them running, which means we can conduct some analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if bots have managed to remain relatively hard to detect for so long, why are these bots so obvious? It's like they want us to notice, which is why I'm suspicious this is some sort of bot false flag. Any other opinions?

       the prevalence of bots on both sides just straight up wasn't a thing until Trump got the primary. Then the automated Troll war broke out and it is still happening, jot not in the same volume.

       There is a big thing on Twitter right now about trump's bot followers, he has been getting a steady 80~100 a minute since January.

       its volume, not uniqueness. You write up a bunch replies and RNGesus decides which of those pre-canned lines gets used. In low volumes, you don't really get to see it in action, but up the numbers (of postings) and it is much easier to spot, as you get more and more repeats.

       The amount of people vehemently attacking anyone who suggests this idea is even more suspicious. If you say anything other than "Confirmed! This place is T_D 2.0!" you get ridiculed as a T_D troll and downvoted to hell.

       I know all sides play this game, so I don't want to single out any particular group. However, there are noticeable patterns to the manipulation, and I'm trying to up my game in order to identify these people and their tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who only post partisan stuff, especially ideas pedaled by the MSM, are easy to spot. You can usually notice the talking points they're using, and when those don't work, they derail the conversation. It's also obvious that they're not into conspiracies, which begs the question of why they're so invested in this sub in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inorganic users from the T_D side are much more difficult to identify because true T_D users share a lot in common with conspiracy theorists. I'm curious if this was the reasoning behind creating these bots: someone wanted to place a magnifying glass on manipulation from T_D posters in order to take some heat off of the obvious shills from the other side.

       I can't see what someone would hope to accomplish by running this is a false flag? What makes more sense to me is just T_D posters trying to push their agenda on this sub and control the narrative here. If you sort the front page by hot you can see they've been very successful with it.

       I'm frankly amazed that you're taking this stance. As if the mods shouldn't do the right thing and take action on real evidence that bots are manipulating this sub because someone might complain about that. That's like saying "hey don't arrest crack cocaine dealers, some of their customers might get upset about it!".

       That makes a great line for a movie, the reality is those bots will continue to manipulate this forum. I also predict it will get worse now that they know the mods won't do anything about it.

       They've at least voted to sticky this post. That's not
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       ignoring the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think they should do? What
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       they do aside from maybe banning the users who are absolutely, 100% bots?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah this could be people from t_d just trying to push their "agenda", but there are plenty of organic t_d users here who are allowed to post here like everyone else anyway, and crossposts are allowed here like pretty much every other sub. But I might just be missing what everyone else thinks the point of this would be. Using this sub to get to all is possible, but a lot of it is comments which doesn't exactly help that cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised at all if it were people attempting to make this sub look more like trump2.0, have more people bitch and complain about biased, pro trump mods, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's absolutely plausible to me and there are no lack of people trying to make this sub look as pro-trump and alt-right as possible, and doing something like this wouldn't be difficult at all to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they're so easily identified seems suspicious. So does as the fact anyone even suggesting this could be people trying to make this sub and t_d look bad on purpose are all being downvoted into the negatives with people acting like they're crazy for even thinking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The suspicion only heightens for me seeing people immediately trying to blame it on
       <em>
        the Russians
       </em>
       and saying they're obviously doing it to make sure people here can't talk about the "obviously legitimate" Russia conspiracy, as if there are people here who don't already know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a bit weird to me there are so many people here who are acting like it's just crazy and not possible someone is doing this on purpose to make this sub look bad when there are subs specifically to make us look bad and like a bunch of crazy assholes.

       That would be a mighty fine start, don't you think? Let me ask you a question. If bots were found here posting anti-Trump shit straight from
       <a href="/r/esist">
        /r/esist
       </a>
       you think they'd let that slide? I don't.

      <p>
       I honestly think who is creating these bots and why they're being used here is a secondary issue. The primary issue is we know they're here, we know they're trying to manipulate the discussion here, and the moderators have decided to do nothing.

       There is no need to clarify my position. I made my point and an argument with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ignored it, deflected away, and are now trying to put me on the defensive and I'm outright refusing to take the bait. That's not being confrontational. That's being confident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to address the argument I made rather than the one you invented, and we can maybe have a discussion from there. Or you can keep playing this game where you feign innocence.

       Haha what is going on? I don't even understand your argument. I said r/politics is super establishment. Then I think you said no, r/republicans is establishment, and that you're correcting me or something. And then I said they both can be.

       You can't even scroll back up to the top of this conversation and read our posts without typing a misrepresentation of what they said?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious at this point you have no interest in any sort of honest discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, let me help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claimed that
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was
       <em>
        the most establishment subreddit
       </em>
       , I countered with another subreddit and an argument about why.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then tried to say that I was the one being partisan, despite you specifically naming a liberal/Democratic subreddit intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I refused to take the bait, where upon you then misrepresented my argument and tried to paint me into a corner with your own made-up argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still refused to take the bait and urged you to actually make a coherent argument against my point, rather than making this about me personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       You at this point still refuse to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me ask you, so far:

       lol are you always like this in convos? I think I see the problem: I was approaching this like a conversation and you were approaching it like an argument. Why so argumentative?
      </p>
      <p>
       You might be right. r/republicans might be more establishment but I'm a progressive and I've never once been to that sub. With that said, it's still hard to imagine a sub more establishment than r/politics.
      </p>

       These bots we uncovered only respond to their own comments and won't interact with anyone else. Who knows if that account was a shill or not, but I'm pretty certain they weren't one these bots

       Well it looks like things are back to normal somewhat as it looks like a lot of them were taken of line. If their are more bots they probably have better programing and won't just steel posts and comments from TD, so probably harder to find.

       Between the vote bots, the comment bots, and the presumably
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       number of inactive or fake subscribers, I'm glad things were changed.  There was a period where only vote manipulation explained the number of posts on the front page: no amount of "I upvotes everything" explained the ratio of front page posts versus comments and in-post votes, and that's without the obvious incidents when there were counter-bots tamping votes up at 51% by the thousands.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they do make the front page.  There was one there this morning.

       Wait, but if we're t_d part 2, doesn't that  mean that I won't care if Pepe is a reptilian or not and would just like him being used as a hate symbol despite the fact that his creator is entirely against him being used like that?

       I enjoy conspiracy theory as thought experiment and entertainment that occasionally finds some truth. The thought experiment is sort of like stretching the muscle that finds the sort of connections that people try to obscure when trying to cover something up.

       Here's the thing though, what is a crazy conspiracy to one person is a totally valid conspiracy to another and vice versa.  Once you start to judge what is a conspiracy and what isn't, you are actually stepping over a line into censorship.

       It's totally fine and healthy to disagree with the weirder conspiracies.  We agree on that part.  What I have more of an issue with is gatekeeping what constitutes a conspiracy.  If the person I had mentioned before said 'I don't believe in reptillians', that's fine.  The concern I had was with the fact that they were saying that reptillians shouldn't be discussed here.  In the post that the person had replied to, I didn't even say anything about the conspiracy beyond 'I want to talk about reptillians'.  Does that make more sense with context?

       Yeah any topic that actually incriminates the US government like 9/11, Sandy Hook, JFK, Apollo moon landings etc, all seem to have a prompt response from very dismissive people who somehow are getting many upvotes. And then you notice that some of the same users are shooting down multiple conspiracy theories which begs the question of what they're doing here in the first place if they don't even buy into the most basic of theories.

       Yes, that's evident to anyone with an ounce of intelligence. But I find it hard to believe that that alone is enough to keep people coming here for such a significant amount of time, and to use this site almost exclusively for this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've not seen any of these people open to any conspiracy theory, they merely mock the users of this sub (while seemingly spending more time here than most people).

       After writing this I realise it's not even worth arguing over (plus it's early and I can't be arsed), as you either agree that these people exist and or you don't. Either way I think it only leads to arguing about certain users and that's obviously not worth anyone's time.

       People keep pointing out that "conspiracy theory" was invented by the CIA to discredit theories.  But the fact of the matter is
       <em>
        it worked
       </em>
       because there are many people in counterculture who have problems with basic reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of inductive reasoning in conspiracy theories.  People take possibilities and present them as likelyhoods.  This subreddit is full of low-hanging fruit for know-it-alls who want to point out the flaws in other people's logic.

       Poor wording on my part then, I didn't intend to word it in such a way that indicates I were excluding them as users of this sub. I thought that'd be apparent after I said they use this site almost exclusively for this sub. But regardless, what I meant by "users of this sub", was the typical user who comes to discuss conspiracies with an open mind. Not ones who come following the mainstream narrative and trying to close down every conspiracy theory. And a lot of the ones who do that seem to have the entirety of their comments here.

       I'm not sure what you're getting at, mate (If I'm being stupid then just excuse me. I'm incredibly stressed so may not be thinking straight)? I understand the different types of users.

       In my other comment, which was censored by the mods, I said that counterculture has a habit of inductive reasoning.  It's one of the key things that distinguishes a conspiracy theory from an investigation.

       People who like to argue and feel smart come here to argue with people who use inductive reasoning.  It's an easy argument to "win", or to feel like you're winning.

       I think I would fit your description. I am skeptical of most conspiracies and buy into very few. They are by nature very difficult to prove. People are conspiring every day, but its usually not motivated by aliens or satanism, but money, influence, resources
      </p>
      <p>
       I come here for the discussion and arguments, I like the logical back and forths. I'd like to be convinced, but I still need to go through in my mind what the most likely explanation is based on what datapoints we have, and I feel its important to call out logical leaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get called the "s word" all the time because I dont just believe what some youtube investigator is saying without evidence. I feel like there are a lot of people here that disbelieve anything mainstream but fail to aim their cynicism at anything countercultural, which is just as stupid.

      <p>
       There's a difference in my mind between someone going out on a limb with a wild theory about interdimensional bigfoots (unprovable, but harmless and entertaining) and someone spreading obviously wrong information that affects people politically, economically, personally, etc. The reason I engage here is because I see the mis/disinfo start in places like this and right wing radio, then casually creep into the popular narrative. It's a sysyphean task, but I'd rather try to stop the lies before they spread.

       One thing these users almost never do? They don't ask questions and they never want to engage in a reasonable discussion. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because doing so leads to exchange if ideas and information. They don't want that. What they
       <em>

       </em>
       want is to control the narrative and form a group opinion. It's a lot easier to guide a group opinion in the direction you want.

       There are many different layers to the JFK conspiracy. If someone were to deny that anything suspicious happened with for example how Oswald was killed by a guy with mob ties, then yes that's suspicious. But if it's someone who doesn't accept the "multiple shooters" theory when there is plenty of supporting evidence for a single bullet, that doesn't strike me as alarming.

       I said it before and I'll say it again. When T_D went private, and conspiracy welcomed their users with open arms, it was going to give people legitimate reason to say "OH CONSPIRACY IS THE T_D 2.0, THAT PLACE IS GARBAGE."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that there's an influx of users and posts, everything has just been a mess. There's alot of "doubt" and copy and paste comments that share the same concept. They just spew their opinion while saying that they heard otherwise from another user as to why a certain conspiracy is wrong or why you shouldn't believe it. I distinctly remember when this sub used to be more open minded and you could have a decent conversation or debate but now it's constant manipulation and brigading. This sub has literally been comprised and i personally believe one (if not more) of the mods have been allowing this for the sole purpose of making us look like T_D 2.0 to outside users.

       You can be a conservative Trump-supporter and hold those views, and still mod fairly. If
       <a href="/r/politics">

       should be exhibiting it over the course of executing their mod duties. He's no where near as bad as AssuredlyAThrowAway was, but it still makes me skeptical about some of the ongoings here, and nothing being done about it.

       The duplicate posts AND comments between TD and here, proving there is botting going on. The fact that 4 out of 5 top posts at one point were all submitted by accounts less than 25 days old.

       Okay, you make a good point. One counter I can think of is that I don't think r/politics would ever even think to come here in that situation and many t_d users are already conspiracy users (such as myself).
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that he is biased but I think that expecting any human being to be unbiased is an unreasonable expectation, even in a position of power. There are liberal mods, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       How was AssuredlyAThrowaway bad? I am honestly asking. He helped me get my account reinstated once when I got a permaban for doxxing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your last point, I actually prefer the bot users not be banned because I have them all RES tagged and it makes it easier to keep track of them, instead of constantly checking account ages. That's just my 2 cents though, I can see the argument for having them removed as well.

       Did you read the TheGhostOfDusty/AssuredlyAThrowAway's mod interactions? It was all over SubredditDrama I believe. It's pretty insightful as to how hard some of these mods have been pushing back against returning
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       to it's former glory prior to the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting that they shouldn't have bias. I'm suggesting that they shouldn't be modding with any bias though. Tagging Trump/Russia stuff as "Misleading" whenever it gains traction, but letting a single image of 3 people with memetext stand on the frontpage cause it's "anti-dem/anti-dnc/etc"
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       showing that bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted a picture of Kathy Griffin and the Trump head with the title: Crazy lady blah blah blah. Secret Service involved. **Literally no conspiracy there. Just anti-dem/anti-DNC.

       As much as people want to ignore it, in the run up to the 2016 election, this place changed drastically to fall more in-line with the kind of content you see on 4chan and T_D. A circlejerk at times, essentially.

       It did definitely change, and it is annoying to see agenda pushing posts that have nothing to do with a conspiracy. I'm trying to evolve with the times though, to be fair I only lurked here once in a while before the election and now I'm active almost solely in this sub. Having my mind opened up to the corruption of the DNC helped me open my mind to other conspiracies too, and I think a large percentage of that is what we're seeing here, with the obvious bots and shilling as well. It's a new era of the sub, no doubt.

       I mean... I do.  Largely because regardless of the side of the fence there tends to be more critical thinking, though bias has clearly gotten worse and worse.  Also posts tend to have a lower comment count, meaning it's also just possible to have a better discussion.

       I personally don't see anything wrong with the sticky that was posted after t_d went private.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see your point and understand why you could have found it suspicious, but there is and has been a link between this sub and t_d (and it's users) that simply doesn't exist with r/politics, even though plenty don't like to think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very large amount of t_d users have always been conspiracy theorists and members of
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       community. When t_d was created, it was immediately populated with a lot of people who've been members here for a long time. Plenty of the people who had originally created an account because of t_d eventually made their way here also simply because a lot of Trump supporters happen to be conspiracy-minded sort of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I didn't see a problem with that post. He/other mods knew that we might see an influx here when t_d went private from users who probably spent most of their reddit time on t_d. It didn't necessarily mean most of them had literally never been here, and a lot of the replies I saw in the post were t_d subscribers reminding everyone of the fact a lot have already been here (and not in a "thedonald2.0" kind of way; these are people who happen to subscribe to multiple subs like everyone else is allowed to do.) T_d has very different rules than us though, and I saw it as, for the most part, just a reminder of what
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       rules are, and to act accordingly or risk a ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the fact there are more t_d users here than active politics ones, the rules on politics are pretty much very similar to ours, so I doubt there'd be much of an issue regarding rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree mods shouldn't be exhibiting political bias while fulfilling their mod duties. I know that before stickying anything, they take a vote so it's not on any 1 mod deciding what to sticky. I'm not entirely sure if they do something similar for
       <em>
        creating
       </em>
       stickies, but I wouldn't be surprised if they all talk about it first. I do believe they've said they all decided to not tag things like that dossier article anymore also, probably to avoid real or perceived biases like you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, this whole reply is assuming that the post that was "welcoming t_d with open arms" that you're speaking of
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed the post acknowledging there may be an influx of t_d users and a reminder of this subs rules. If you're talking about some other post entirely, then.. oops, lol feel free to ignore this reply or let me know of which post you're speaking.

       Yeah that was a bullshit move honestly. That just didn't need to be said. If they wanted to come here, that's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to make a public call for them to flood here as their alternative (when THEIR sub is a self-proclaimed "24/7 Trump Rally")
       <strong>
        forever
       </strong>
       destroyed the legitimacy of this sub.

      <p>
       The fact that it was... especially for a political faction... spoke volumes. Especially when the moderation here and "behind the scenes forces" are already questionable as hell. On top of that, it was done by a pro-trump mod.

       It was an extremely regrettable move. Plain and simple.

       I can't speak for everyone, but I can explain how I came to be a more frequent visitor here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always been a fan of this sub, since I discovered it a couple years ago. I never bothered subscribing, still haven't, but I liked to pop in and read about aliens when I was bored of my usual subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then last year wikileaks DNC leaks blew up, and this sub became one of the best places to discuss it. I started coming here every day for the latest updates and political theories. Now this place is in my regular rotation of subs to visit. Even though this place has definitely gone to shit and the kind of discussions that brought me here in the first place don't really happen anymore, I keep coming back. Just hoping that something exciting happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that a lot of people have a similar story. This place has been flooded with non-conspiracy folks who came here for Wikileaks and casual conspiracy folks like myself. Personally I mostly just lurk, but I imagine a lot of people in my position are more vocal or think they can drum up some easy karma posting horse shit.

       is gathering enough traction that it warrants inclusion in the battle over information going on right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that these external groups recognize:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        that more and more people are turning to forums like this to get a read on current events that fall outside of the MSM.
       </li>
       <li>
        that these new visitors treat these forums with some sense of credibility, meaning they spend time here and return with some frequency (or: it's becoming a habit/routine for many people who may begin as lurkers and transition to active participants).
       </li>
       <li>
        that forums like this represent a meaningful
        <em>
         threat
        </em>
        to the agendas of these outside groups... So much so that they are willing to spend real world money on astroturf campaigns.
       </li>
       <li>
        that they think that astroturf campaigns are an effective strategy on here.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is all good news IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       /R/conspiracy typically identifies these sorts of external threats with swift responses... Those running the campaigns might be able to brigade posts to upvote their agenda and downvote critical or dangerous information, but most regular readers in here know how to recognize this sort of stuff and either ignore it (or call it out for what it is, as you have).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, so long as people keep visiting, participating, and thinking critically about this stuff, we can relax and enjoy the fact that
       <strong>
        attention from external groups is validation that we aren't completely full of shit.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They fear open, un-scripted discussion of current and historical events.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to believe that the only viable source of information is the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are dinosaurs trying to fight against a massive cultural shift... But the dam is breaking and they only have so many fingers to plug up real conversations.

       Thanks for such a great post. The desperation is definitely noticeable, and I also consider this a very good sign. The thread I included in my third edit contains posts from shill whistleblowers, and I recommend checking it out. It shows that these people are normal humans who are in difficult situations trying to make a living. But after awhile, they realized how they were being used for unethical purposes, and they eventually turned. I expect many more will follow suit in the future. The people are tired of being lied to, and the deceit is no longer sustainable. It'll come crashing down eventually

       r/conspiracy has been part of the "game" for awhile. I don't presume to know how smart government sponsored AI is, but I would imagine they are quite capable of maintaining the cointerintelligence operations underway using less humans than we may think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think there were 1000s of trolls sitting in dark damp warehouses working for the government as shills, but the more I consider it, the more likely it seems to have a few programmers and an army of thousands of talk soup bots.

       They know people lurk, they know people rarely do their own research and seek opinion to confirm bias. We have to fix ourselves to defeat them.

       I could give you my reason for being here, if it will maybe shed some light on why some people might come off as seeming non conspiratorial.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a deeply, painfully skeptical person.  The scientific method is one of the few things that I trust and I always want rock solid data that can be tested.  It's in my nature.  That being said, I also love looking into stuff that contradicts that mindset because I find it really, really fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to hide or quiet my skepticism when I can here, but sometimes I can't help it.  But that doesn't mean that I don't love hearing about how Saddam had a Stargate and that allowed him to give his soldiers air conditioned underpants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that helps to humanize folks here a bit.

       Fair point. What I meant was that many of the posters in this thread seem to take the establishment side, like against the Seth Rich case, for example. I find that strange because this is generally an anti establishment sub.

       I'm accusing you of having a weird life. Your entire Reddit existence is so finely tuned to this one idea of arguing with people when they are asking WTF is up with r/conspiracy. Or maybe you just have a lot of accounts, and this is the boring thing this account is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it just pains you to see people question a conspiracy subreddit. Personally, I am more disgusted by things like, IDK, people harassing the parents of a murder victim.

       Of course not. When did I say that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich was only one example; but when users routinely are against any conspiracies that question the establishment it seems a little off. Not only that, but many of these users are also overly confrontational and argumentative. Can you help me understand that? Why so angry?

       I find it to be good practice with certain clients. Devaluation (what you're doing now) is a primitive ego defense; it's used, often unconsciously, when the individual doesn't feel good about themselves so they feel the need to devalue others. That could also explain why you're overly contentious.

       If I was trying to discredit r/conspiracy, I would get a bunch of fake accounts to copy and paste entire comment threads on similar posts from r/T_D, then upvote the shit out of posts that call me out on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be the benefit of T_D users doing this so blatantly? Seems to me like the people who would benefit more from this, are those trying their best to discredit r/conspiracy by tying it to r/T_D.

       I'm mostly​ referring to fake news, normally in the form of clickbait headlines or sometimes in meme form. Not like biased news or questionably sourced news, I mean 100% fabricated bullshit. Blatant disinformation that anyone with any critical thinking would be able to refute. Watching my grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends etc fall for that stuff was the main reason I chose to deactivate my account.

       False.  You're pushing a narrative that this was done by T_D, and refused to discuss the possibility (based on very FACTUAL evidence that I mentioned) that this could have been done precisely to push the "EHRMAGERD T_D 2.0" outrage.

       Yep, and I have my guesses who it is.  Let's see, all the threads given as an example are "low energy" examples with nothing in regards to new or interesting info, full of copied anti-Trump responses that are conveniently winning the botvotes even before being "exposed" by you, a person who has spent the last ~8 months on

       , it takes a while to run analysis.  I do think it's interesting how TRUMP dominates your wordcloud.  You seem a bit triggered, so far, but nothing nefarious has surfaced yet.

       Sure, I can assist you in reading the very page you got your tool from. Since you seem incapable of that yourself:

        Unfortunately, reddit doesn't allow a full account export, and only lets you retrieve a limit of 1000 records per type(submitted, comments, saved, overview). You can run reddit history using -sort new and -sort top, to get different slices of your history that reddit will allow. If you want this feature, help complain like I did.

       Yeah, I'm getting the same set, much less than 1000.  Only 241 posts to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       Could you be a dear and just link a single comment older than four months in

      <p>
       I did manually go through, and I think I'm missing something, being manual and all.  According to the manual lookup, your top posts of all time are political submissions, some four years old, but your comments beyond four months just are not showing up.

       Nothing, really.  You seem like a nice guy and there's nothing wrong with being new four months ago.  Just looking for a QA test case because it seemed a bit odd and wanted to make sure the tools were working.

       That's a shitload of posts, and over a fifth of the set you pulled. I too became interested in this subreddit about 4 months ago. That's because Donald J. Trump was sworn into office. There were a number of theories about outside influence involving the election, so I started to post here. Most of my posts are about how this sub ignores theories that have evidence while supporting theories with no evidence (or refuted evidence).

       Look again, I never even implied he was a bot.  He would have to be a time traveler to be a bot, as would I.  He just seemed to be
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       upset about me questioning the motives of the other 26 day old account.  I mean, when he's throwing out the navy seal meme in direct violation of rule #8, I think some light banter is an appropriate response.

       That is exactly what I was saying. This sub exists specifically to discredit legitimate criminal conspiracies by calling them crazy conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an old tactic and you can even check out when they did it with the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       "CIA Instructions to Media Assets" is to refer to the JFK assassination as a conspiracy theory to trick the suggestibles into believing there was nothing to it.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the reason this sub exists. Now, they are trying to tie the whole Trump agenda to crazy conspiracy theories while discrediting the sub further with the vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       TD is also a containment board, so they need to discredit them, rather than ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ban TD, then you risk the overflow into all of the other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that esionage and unethical statecraft are super real, have been around since Sun Tzu, at least, and real power shifts don't come through elections or war, but through infiltration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Christians infiltrated the Romans and turned Rome's intelligence apparatus to it's own end. The Vatican has always had an intelligence network that even participated in putting fake royalty on thrones. George Washington had help running a very sophisticated spy network with invisible ink and all of these people knew the importance of influencing the population because Unity of Purpose among a population is step 1 to going to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people who don't want war aren't in power, they soon will be and their operations are criminal conspiracies a lot of which have been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.

       If that were the case, then why wouldn't the users post under the same username? That makes no sense. If they wanted to push their agenda, creating bots to sloppily duplicate posts seems like the worst way to go about it, and would ultimately HURT your attempts at spreading your agenda.

       So they are reposting from The_Donald then using bots to copy the top comments from the original. On the face it looks like pro-Trump spam, but it's so damn
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       that I don't get why they'd even bother. The originals are all from established accounts, I don't think they have anything to do with the bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that the only ones to benefit from this scheme are anti-Trump as there was no way this wasn't going to get caught here. But then again, even
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is too obvious. It's confusing, which makes me think it's might be just general divisiveness that motivated it. Each side will blame the other, maybe that's better for some parties than us focusing on actual events.

       They would bother because it's presumably been happening for a while, but this subreddit is just realizing it now. Think of how many people were persuaded by "fake news" during the election. Plus, it effectively suppresses the legitimate discussion of the Russia conspiracy. When Trump fired Comey, all I saw around this sub were people talking about Seth Rich.

       Since I last checked on it, the only new evidence that brought this whole avalanche was the PI coming forward with some bullshit about the police having a laptop when ended up being bullshit. I just don't see any evidence. I don't actually disrespect your side, I just would need something much more concrete than "he got shot but still had his wallet". To me, the Russia story has many more strange coincidences to it.

       Wheeler never walked back his statement that he had an informant who laid eyes on the laptop and it's contents, that the MPD was covering something up, and went even further by naming Donna Brazille as the DNC official trying to snoop around and get him to shut-up.

       Isn't that what you're doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       The_Donald is full of Seth Rich and Pizzagate. Given your "logic" , why should those be discussed here when there's already a massive sub circle jerking over those issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying only those conspiracies belong here.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you not see your hypocrisy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe r/conspiracy should be a place for all conspiracies, not just the ones that fit your narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone who is active in a sub that worships the current billionaire​ celebrity president shouldn't be the arbiter if what type if discussion is appropriate in a sub dedicated to questioning the world at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you shouldn't pretend to be in favour of free speech, when you actively discourage opposing views in the exact arena designed for open discussion​.
      </p>
      <p>
       All subs should embrace opposing views. It's a shame Politics is such a circle jerk, but that doesn't justify turning other subs into The_Donald, the biggest circle jerk of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your views are so weak, you can't handle opposing views, you should just go back to jerking it with your fellow pedes, son.

       PG is not discussed on T_D, you get banned if you talk about it.  T_D is also no longer allowed on the front page (though it still manages somehow from time to time) while subs like /politics and /news are standard, and subs like /enoughtrumpspam, /esist, /marchagainsttrump, /againsthatesubreddits, /tinytrumps, and on and on consistently hit the front page of /all all day long pushing the same stories and the same angles.  Are you seriously going to tell me that T_D and
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of those subs get the same exposure?

       Russia is not a conspiracy, it has become a mainstream "fact."  You're arguing in bad faith if you say that Russia and the DNC ae equal conspiracy wise, it's quite obvious which is allowed in polite conversation and which isn't.

       I don't doubt that there's Trump bots/shills but I haven't seen a lot of firsthand evidence of it.  On the other hand, Shareblue has a huge presence on reddit; and considering the level they dominate reddit, they absolutely have the means (and potentially the motive) to pull something like this.

       People here have shown this and I have run into obvious bots who only post the same thing across many subs as well.  I think in this online world they can drown us out and have so many accounts going......which will only ever comment on how asinine that idea can be and thus contribute to the continuation of the same cycle.  When these accounts can pose as both sides......new ignorant and impossible to convince accounts add to the disbelief.....ad old accounts renounce the idea, real people get lost and may not see whats going on.  Divide and conquer.

       There is a balance to be struck.  If you can call them out and not have a response back, that would be optimal.  You know their response can only work in your favor and would further expose their agenda, so they don't bother anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it causes a huge long winded string of comments that no one will take time to read, then that works in their favor.  Your message will be lost, and they don't care about theirs at that point either.  Having important comments pushed down the list, with less exposure means good ideas can get missed.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they have to do is disrupt the natural idea that people would get together and agree that something is not in their collective interests and they would thus act on that.  This is their point of attack.  Disrupt things here and have everyone fighting each other, and poof.....nothing ever comes of the ideas, good, bad or otherwise.

       I'm genuinely surprised that Trump supporters are doing this. They complain about bots all the time. Could be a false flag, could be organized/corporate-ish, could be Trump supporters attempting to fight back (plenty of bots on the other side). I have noticed that a shit ton of stuff got cross-posted from the_donald to here and r/libertarian, but assumed it was organic previously.

       When T_D users in the past cross posted interesting conspiracy information (re:Seth Rich, PG, TwitterGate, DNC Leaks, Podesta Leaks, etc) they didn't hide behind cloned threads and bot accounts and they posted
       <em>
        juicy
       </em>
       stuff.  This is why it seemed organic then, and this feels manufactured.  It's generic unsuccessful T_D threads, conveniently.

       i have a theory that so many T_D posters got banned (because they questioned a Trump move or worse yet, asked the JQ) that there literally isnt enough OC. the sub feels so diff now. I rmb back in Oct/Nov it was worth visiting.

       There is clear evidence of astroturfing, vote manipulation, and brigading ( as people have been suspecting). Yet very little has been done regarding these accounts.

       So playing devil's advocate, what can the mods do about it? They can ban those accounts, but more bots will just happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't ban posts from
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , because as much as I hate that place, they do sometimes post decent articles that fit this sub nicely. Even if they attempt to ban posts from
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       that use the exact same titles, it would take 5 minutes of reprogramming a bot to add variations to the titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much the mods of this sub can do with the power they have. It's on the Reddit admins to actually buckle down and actually do something about the bots/astroturfing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think megathreads would at least help allow discussion for other topics so we don't have 100 posts about Seth Rich, half of which can be debunked in 5 minutes, but people get really butthurt about megathreads.

       For example, Rule 11 with misleading and fabricated titles. Misleading and sensationally titled  threads are t_d's bread and butter but for whatever reason the mods here on conspiracy seem to ignore the rule entirely. Especially if the content is pro-Trump/anti-liberal/anti-DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upvoting is out of their hands, though. If someone is determined to make threads rise, either with bots or sockpuppets, then there is very little the mods can do. You are right on that.

       I think part of the problem is it feels like people are only calling for the banning of bots from a single side -- everybody only wants to ban the bots associated with T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're being bombarded with bots, and shills, from more places than T
       <em>
        D.. but that's the only thing anyone ever talks about. Why does everyone seemingly want action only against _one
       </em>
       set of suspected bots? And why are we surprised the mods are suspect about that?

       I'm not denying that it's not happening or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that accusations of "TD v2" have been flying around like woah lately. Seth Rich threads are downvoted, just like this one. Same with PizzaGate threads. The comments are filled with how it's "proof this TD v2" or "PizzaGate is FAKE NEWS".
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's been a HUGE increase for calls to ban anything related to TD on the grounds that they are "bad" and "mostly bots".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       thing that mods are skeptical. Most people would be skeptical if there was a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       influx here with calls to ban anything related to politics, or HillaryClinton, or BernieForPresident, or whatever. We should be skeptical about this sudden huge influx in calls to ban anything related to TD.

       It's kinda funny though. In a thread about shills and bot I suggest that maybe they're not all coming from one side. So of course I get downvoted ;)

       I didn't downvote you, but if I were to have it wouldn't because you suggested that they weren't coming from one side. It would be because you claimed that Seth Rich threads are getting downvoted when that's primarily what is one the front page. And because I haven't seen a single call for anyone wanting to ban EVERYTHING related to TD, just stuff which is from the TD and nonrelated to conspiracy. Which, everything non conspiracy related should be banned because it's not appropriate here.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I love weed, I have a medical card. I don't want to hear about how weed is legal in a new state or another. That's not a conspiracy., that's just news.

       Never meant to claim you did. I just find it funny that my comments here keep going up a few points and the down into the negatives, and eventually stop at zero. And the jumps have been too big to be their fuzzy logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you read the comments in nearly any thread that's not bashing Trump, it quickly devolves into how this is just TD2 and it all needs to be stopped. That the mods are complicit in some Russian conspiracy. Etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The accusations of this being TD2 is starting to feel a lot like a way to get around Rule 10.

       Well the community is quite active in calling it out in other places. Even if the online community as whole does not take this place seriously, it is still a high traffic breeding ground for both actual conspiracies and critical of governments in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes one guy with credibility IRL to see this shit, believe it, and try to convince other people. If there is ever an archive of influential internet boards I think this place will be seen as 4chan Lite in regards to political activism on the internet.

       Not to mention every time something crazy happens on the site, people constantly flock here to see what is going on. I'm not surprised this place is seen as prime location for astroturfing.

       For so many reasons, it is literally impossible to possess the knowledge to make such a statement with any accuracy. How can one know the opinion of hundreds of thousands of those that aren't on the same outlets (or aren't even positing their position anywhere?) It's not possible. This can only be considered an opinion, not a fact, and one that is not particularly useful in making a credible argument.

       Do you have a plan for the eventuality that Seth Rich is confirmed to be the source for WikiLeaks' DNC corruption story? If not, start making one by reading the DNC Leaks for yourself: you need to know what's about to hit you. Time is short.

       To all those debating whether or not this is a false flag:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most factual way to discern whether it is a coordinated attack, is to see if we can find instances of this that dates back further than recent time frame (~26 days).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this have been going on all along undetected with this level of prevalence, it should be quite feasible to find older instances.  I've been looking and asking around, but so far I have not yet seen a single instance of this that dates back further.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is suddenly happening and they are made to be quite blatant (verbatim copy, not actual covert shilling), I think this deserves further scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen copied comments with absolutely zero agenda or value (comments that are entirely pointless), which makes me think that this is being indiscriminately to certain level.  Also, it appears that the posters in

       This is really easy:

      <p>
       If a post negative about trump makes it to the top (if it can) here - what happens to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets called out for 'brigading' (because people from all saw it and fellow redditors reacted) and is flared. If it is because it is upvoted by the_donald bots (and is either pro-trump or anti-dc) then nothing happens.

       Earlier someone posted a thread about a non-conspiracy (now deleted but was on the front page all day) with a fake headline and when the thread didn't go as planned for them they made a separate post about how "this sub is dying" because they couldn't push an irrelevant piece of pro-trump content to the front page without being questioned about their obvious deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's truly terrifying that this sub is going the way of zero sources, pure speculation treated as fact and downvoting people into obscurity because they've raised a solid point, or played devils advocate. It's as if someone has started a movement to try and make sure any discussions had here can in no way be taken seriously.

       Oh, carry on?  Why thank you, how kind.  But I think I'd rather stay here and ask you to clarify your statements.  You pointed in a lot of directions without actually pointing
       <em>
        anything

       out.  It's quite obvious you have the answers so please, enlighten me as to what statements of ours and theirs you are referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what "Russia media presser"are you referring to?  The meating between our president and a foreign diplomat held in a quiet setting, with only one American and one Russian photographer allowed in?  Are you upset that CNN didn't get to take pictures too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, how unprecedented, has this
       <em>
        never

       before occurred?  What should we take away from the situation?  Surely two diplomats meating in front of photographers from each nation is proof of collusion but, how far do

       You seriously want to cry about the MSM not being allowed in?  Tell me, how many memebers of the Russian press were allowed in again?  Oh that's right, only one.  Just like there was only one American allowed in.  Yes, an Amerwas there too no matter how much you want to deny

       Some of us like to have discussions about facts.  Other people leave one or two sentence replies with absolutely nothing of value to say, but instead consistently leave wild conjecture with no evidence for support and name call instead.  Russia, Russia, Russia.  No matter how many times you braindead zombies repeat the word, it's not going to make you're horrendous excuse for HRC losing the presidency true.

       One candidate said they believed it was best to be friends with Russia. The other candidate all but threatened war with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're asking the wrong question. You should be asking why you're event surprised a nation would support a candidate that wants to be friends over one that wants to bomb them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, just so we're clear, a foreign leader supporting/preferring one candidate over another is nothing new and it's not inherently wrong. If you believe it is then I'd expect to see your comment history filled with accusations of meddling by all the foreign leaders who backed Obama, or accusations of the US meddling in all the countries where our president backed their leader.

       I've commented on enough of these posts, like the one last night where Flytape straight up said no action will be taken against those accounts 'cos CTR are hiding under his bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a lot of people are missing the key point. This is one person
       <strong>
        actively fucking with you
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       There were more than just the accounts in OP’s post and they were all created in advance of the fake Macron documents, and the leaked emails (that were a mix of fake, real, and fakes planted by the campaign) to avoid the 48 hour lockout on new accounts from posting/commenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn’t a sophisticated operation and they were called out a little then, and it appears they lost a few accounts and some posts were removed but not many.
      </p>
      <p>
       They came back again over the weekend, this time with Seth Rich, anti-DNC, etc knowing that a blank post saying "I don't like Clinton #SethRich" would hit the front page and mods would be very satisfied with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again some users, some of us I can say now, called this out. But nothing was done, it was clear they could operate with impunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So their posts got even more stupid and more obvious, not even memes but post tiles with an image of someone. And the sub helped them to the front page some more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cue a rash of honourable non-partisan members of r/conspiracy taking a stand. …Only it wasn’t against any of these accounts, it was against the ‘obvious’ Shariablue agents calling bullshit on the posts they were making. “Look at all these upvoted posts, but the comments are negative. SHILLS!”
      </p>
      <p>
       So now they can not only post whatever they please, they even have a defence force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Latest stage is the comments copied over from r/The_Donald. They knew they were on a lot of radars before doing this so it would be unlikely that this would hold up to any scrutiny. If that doesn’t tell you that you’re being fucked with then I don’t know what else will. So now everyone goes headless chicken over “bots!” or thinking this is a serious infiltration effort, and the troll laughs some more.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’ve taken a big shit all over the sub and created lovely division (see all “it must be a CTR false flag” comments). All whilst spreading their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they are still free to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       So congratulations whoever you are, you won the sub. And thank you moderators of r/conspiracy.

BUT maybe I am wrong because I don't see all that they discuss (just going off what I have seen here - and this being a conspiracy sub that is par for the course).

       There are simple bots that just copy other people their comments and reuse them when certain patterns match, but some bots can be more advanced than you may think, not just simple Markov chains.
Sometimes the bots make mistakes allowing you to see what they really are, but otherwise they write perfect, unique and on-topic sentences. I started noticing them since 2014 when that Gamergate thing started. Read my other comment (see history) for more info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also. This is not only happening on Reddit (or between TD / Conspiracy). I even noticed and collected proof of bots being used on non-English websites as well.

       I realise all that is possible, I just don't see it in this instance because of their history and the small scale, and it's a bit beside the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the T_D comment phase I had seen them switching accounts to make (original, but pre-written) replies to their own posts. Sometimes deleting them if they used the wrong account, or making edits. That's rather low-tech.

       Yes. There are individuals that use multiple account and just reply to themselves. I can even imagine people thinking it is fun to do or a way to easily influence people. It usually does not take long before they make a mistake and they get exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am talking about is how there are  probably multiple actors involved. The old individuals switching account (from your example), mobs getting attracted to this sub and advanced bots that systematically influence the entire Internet (among them this sub). All these groups reinforce each other and create a certain bias. Something to believe in that probably does not even exist or confuse the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I believe there are more advanced bots being used and influencing the sentiment at multiple websites and using multiple languages. It is very difficult to proof because I only have access to limited data (no IP addresses etc). As soon as I am ready and think I collected enough probable evidence I will post it at multiple locations on The Internet.

       Apparently multiple accounts don't indicate much.  One redditor said he had over 50 accounts and nobody batted an eye.  Apparently having several accounts is a normal thing.  (I have zero desire to keep a spreadsheet for my redditing activities, let alone remember that many damn passwords - so I stick to just the one.)

       I have 2 accounts. This one, which is attached to nothing attached to me (totally anon email, phone number for that email, etc). My other one is more easily traced back to me IRL.

      <p>
       And it's not to stop the government from finding -- they're going to find me if they want me. It's because I don't trust all the radical fuckwits out there who will contact your family, friends, employer, etc because you said something they didn't like online.

       And yes, that happens. It happened to me during GamerGate. My wife ended up getting emails about how I hate women and shit. Not only that, but my bank account got drained by someone in California. I probably would have pursued charges if I wasn't broke at the time and it was only like 2k lol.

       This is the 3rd time I am saying this in the past couple of days, but if you want to know who is shilling on reddit, look no further than the front page of /politics, or in comments section of any thread there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything else is more likely to be a false-flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda only works when it drowns the truth. A few comments here and there does not cut it. It does not take much work to flood the comments section with the narrative you want to spread. Just think of a number of comments a person can post in a day if it was their full time job, and you can see that a team of 10 people can easily overtake /politics completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if someone other than CTR/Shareblue is seriously interested in shilling on reddit, you will most definitely see them in /politics, and CTR/Shareblue will be crying bloody murder using every sockpupet account they have.

       Seth Rich posts from here and the donald in its history.  It had a shitload of karma, like way more than normal per post.  The longest time between the account went between posts since its creation was something stupid low...I think 5 hours and some minutes according to that website that does reddit user analysis?

       Honestly what are the odds that someone finds out who "fake" soldiers are within 1 hour of seeing a single post (and there are many posts on T-D).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy clearly said "from what I can tell" which means he looked it up. So this guy somehow looked up two not directly known soldiers and found this out within an hour?

       FYI - At the time of this comment I counted 3 submissions out of the top 100 in  the main queue of this sub that were discussing or examining current events and activities of the Trump administration, 2 of the 3 submissions are on the same topic (Trump's waiver of ethics rules)
      </p>

       Other than that, it appears, based on the top 100 submissions here, we are not even concerned about anything that this administration is doing.

       If Other users here are like me, it could be that we don't like Trump for the same reasons we didnt like other presidents... War, war on drugs, police state, spying. Etc.... However the bullshit that r/politics users post here (to whine about us not caring) is stupid shit that most other presidents and candidates were guilty of... If you're complaining about something thats been done by people in your own party and no-one ever said a word about it... It's just partisan games. Ds are madras Rs got power, but none of them would care about the conflicting shit if it were Clinton ( and if she are elected the same told of crap would be going on.) There are much bigger issues at play and the president is minimally important in it all, unless they were to decide to stand against it. Its a whole lot of whining about little issues when regardless of who is in power we style bomb brown people, lock up people for nonviolent crimes, the cia deals drugs, the nsa spies on us, etc.... Just party games being played.

       The bot activity is designed to focus attention on the mainstream big-political figures like Trump/Seth Rich/Macron/Pizzagate, in other words to get our attention on the mainstream process, even if it's reflected in a negative way, and to white out important discussions that would otherwise be happening

       the prevalence of bots on both sides just straight up wasn't a thing until Trump got the primary. Then the automated Troll war broke out and it is still happening, jot not in the same volume.

        Unfortunately, reddit doesn't allow a full account export, and only lets you retrieve a limit of 1000 records per type(submitted, comments, saved, overview). You can run reddit history using -sort new and -sort top, to get different slices of your history that reddit will allow. If you want this feature, help complain like I did.

       So playing devil's advocate, what can the mods do about it? They can ban those accounts, but more bots will just happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't ban posts from
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , because as much as I hate that place, they do sometimes post decent articles that fit this sub nicely. Even if they attempt to ban posts from
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       that use the exact same titles, it would take 5 minutes of reprogramming a bot to add variations to the titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much the mods of this sub can do with the power they have. It's on the Reddit admins to actually buckle down and actually do something about the bots/astroturfing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think megathreads would at least help allow discussion for other topics so we don't have 100 posts about Seth Rich, half of which can be debunked in 5 minutes, but people get really butthurt about megathreads.

       is gathering enough traction that it warrants inclusion in the battle over information going on right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means that these external groups recognize:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        that more and more people are turning to forums like this to get a read on current events that fall outside of the MSM.
       </li>
       <li>
        that these new visitors treat these forums with some sense of credibility, meaning they spend time here and return with some frequency (or: it's becoming a habit/routine for many people who may begin as lurkers and transition to active participants).
       </li>
       <li>
        that forums like this represent a meaningful
        <em>
         threat
        </em>
        to the agendas of these outside groups... So much so that they are willing to spend real world money on astroturf campaigns.
       </li>
       <li>
        that they think that astroturf campaigns are an effective strategy on here.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is all good news IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       /R/conspiracy typically identifies these sorts of external threats with swift responses... Those running the campaigns might be able to brigade posts to upvote their agenda and downvote critical or dangerous information, but most regular readers in here know how to recognize this sort of stuff and either ignore it (or call it out for what it is, as you have).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, so long as people keep visiting, participating, and thinking critically about this stuff, we can relax and enjoy the fact that
       <strong>
        attention from external groups is validation that we aren't completely full of shit.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They fear open, un-scripted discussion of current and historical events.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us to believe that the only viable source of information is the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are dinosaurs trying to fight against a massive cultural shift... But the dam is breaking and they only have so many fingers to plug up real conversations.

       <em>

       set of suspected bots? And why are we surprised the mods are suspect about that?

       Did you read the TheGhostOfDusty/AssuredlyAThrowAway's mod interactions? It was all over SubredditDrama I believe. It's pretty insightful as to how hard some of these mods have been pushing back against returning
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       to it's former glory prior to the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting that they shouldn't have bias. I'm suggesting that they shouldn't be modding with any bias though. Tagging Trump/Russia stuff as "Misleading" whenever it gains traction, but letting a single image of 3 people with memetext stand on the frontpage cause it's "anti-dem/anti-dnc/etc"
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       showing that bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone posted a picture of Kathy Griffin and the Trump head with the title: Crazy lady blah blah blah. Secret Service involved. **Literally no conspiracy there. Just anti-dem/anti-DNC.

       As much as people want to ignore it, in the run up to the 2016 election, this place changed drastically to fall more in-line with the kind of content you see on 4chan and T_D. A circlejerk at times, essentially.

       I mean... I do.  Largely because regardless of the side of the fence there tends to be more critical thinking, though bias has clearly gotten worse and worse.  Also posts tend to have a lower comment count, meaning it's also just possible to have a better discussion.

       Bahahahaha lmfao!  Out of all that you chose to go with the meating?!  Man you people are seriously running out of steam.  I guess it's to be expected when you make ridiculous generalized claims about "our statements amd their statements."  Lmfao!  Still waiting on that clarification there genius.

       You seriously want to cry about the MSM not being allowed in?  Tell me, how many memebers of the Russian press were allowed in again?  Oh that's right, only one.  Just like there was only one American allowed in.  Yes, an Amerwas there too no matter how much you want to deny
