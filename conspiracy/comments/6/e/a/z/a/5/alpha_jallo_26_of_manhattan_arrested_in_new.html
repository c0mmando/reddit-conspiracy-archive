       - Capitol Briefly Locked Down Due to DC Police Pursuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on here? Are these 2 different people or is the media not telling us the truth on who he is. I find it odd that Webb did not talk about this at all. Does he know an individual named Alpha Jalloh was arrested right after Seth Rich was killed after being in a shootout with D.C. police? I remember reading about how that DC lockdown was related to Seth Rich's killers but nothing came of it. This seems to make more and more sense now though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this all very fascinating can someone else come in here and help clarify? Thanks
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'm an idiot and spelled Jalloh's name wrong in the title... whoops

       Same exact name - you'll see both names mentioned in each article. There's an 8 year age difference though and the hometown listed is different. That's my bad I just spelled it wrong the first time in the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what happened to him after Seth Rich's murder - it says he faced numerous charges but idk. That's why I posted this bc I'm honestly really confused.

       Can someone please confirm that George Webb knows that an individual named Alpha Jalloh was arrested in DC after Seth Rich's assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched 219.1 and he went into great detail about the carjacking ring and why he was bailed out, but I never heard once about Jalloh being arrested in the DC shooting (which I distinctly remember at the time being reported by some to be related to Seth Rich's killers.)

       He seems to be linking the New Jersey Alpha Jalloh to the two MS-13 guys who died at Myrtle Beach Sth Carolina the day after SR's murder.
He says it right at the end of this vid.
