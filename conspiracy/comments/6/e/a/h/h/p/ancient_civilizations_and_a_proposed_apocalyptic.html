        Graham Hancock (/ˈhænkɒk/; born 2 August 1950) is a British writer and reporter. Hancock specialises in unscientific theories[1] involving ancient civilisations, stone monuments or megaliths, altered states of consciousness, ancient myths and astronomical/astrological data from the past.

        One of the main themes running through many of his books is a posited global connection with a "mother culture" from which he believes all ancient historical civilisations sprang.[2] His work is viewed as an example of pseudoarchaeology; his work has neither been peer reviewed nor published in academic journals.[1][3][4]

       I don't have a ton of time available to do a full write up on this, however this "alternative theory" presented by Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson provides a lot of evidence pointing to this occurring.

       Love this theory. Can't wait for more studies to come out from the comet research team. I believe this one ties into the Antarctica Cover up theory.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The team used gravity measurements by NASA's GRACE satellites to identify a 300 km (190 mi) wide mass concentration and noted that this mass anomaly is centered within a larger ring-like structure visible in radar images of the land surface beneath the Antarctic ice cap. This combination suggested to them that the feature may mark the site of a 480 km (300 mi) wide impact crater buried beneath the ice and more than 2.5 times larger than the 180 km (110 mi) Chicxulub crater.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to the site's location beneath the Antarctic ice sheet there are no direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this mass concentration, such as formation by a mantle plume or other large-scale volcanic activity. If this feature really is an impact crater then, based on the size of the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese's team that the impactor could have been four or five times wider than the Chicxulub impactor, which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

       Most of the stuff I see about it says it's probably older though, they're linking it to the Permian–Triassic extinction
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These researchers therefore speculate that the putative impact and associated crater may have contributed to this separation by weakening the earth's crust at this location. These bracketing dates also make it possible that the site could be associated with the Permian–Triassic extinction event. The Permian–Triassic extinction occurred 250 million years ago and is believed to be the largest extinction event since the origin of complex multicellular life.

       I'm familiar with this theory, although I'm not up on what Graham Hancock has to say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows SOMETHING happened during that time because of the megafaunal extinction.  The main study that tried to link it to an ET event was by Firestone:
       <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.full">
        http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.full
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, those results were not repeatable:
       <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656015?journalCode=ca">
        http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656015?journalCode=ca
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So now everyone is back to thinking the megafaunal extinction could really be human caused (over hunting).  But the impact theory hasn't necessarily been ruled out, it just hasn't been proven yet (as far as I know, there could be stuff more recent).

       Is it possible that the people who built Golbeki Tepe, were the Natufians? Paternal Haplogroup E-V13 is theorized to have originated in Anatolia or West Asia, North East Africa, and is associated with the Natufians. I believe the dates match up between E-V13 origins and Golbeki Type.

       The Y chromosome that you inherit from your father is unique and can be traced back thousands of years to when it first originated, and it can be used to track human migration over thousands of years. The Natufian people lived in what is modern day Israel and Syria about 12 thousand years ago, and may have built what was to become Jericho, as well as other cities, and may have been the earliest group of people to use agriculture. Maybe it is possible that the ruins of Golbeki Type were constructed by these people, or people who descend from them. You can read more about them

       Actually I noticed that one of the Natufian sites is called Nevalı Çori where it say, Together with the earlier site of Göbekli Tepe, it has revolutionised scientific understanding of the Eurasian Neolithic period. The oldest domesticated Einkorn wheat was found there. So I guess I was right!
