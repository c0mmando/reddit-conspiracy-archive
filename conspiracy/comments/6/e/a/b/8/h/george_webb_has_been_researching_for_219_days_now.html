       And all of this
       <strong>
        "If you disagree you're instantly labeled a shill!"
       </strong>
       talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to touch upon this really quickly - I's not a valid defense excuse anymore. It never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before this past election, this subreddit WAS able to have civil discourse and people could have different opinions. No one was called a shill because it was
       <strong>
        organic
       </strong>
       . Ever since this past election and the PROOF of shill accounts, it has become nearly impossible to differentiate between organic differences and "I was paid to say this" differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you can thank the people who want to control online discussion for causing everyone to call each other shills - because that's what Reddit is filled with now.

       f hes honestly a self funded investigator with connections like he claims, all this free time, no work hours lol, hasn't been assassinated yet, then he is a brilliant investigator and deserves my respect for awakening the masss. I would love to believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, he's a very talented and convincing actor, much like Alex Jones, keeps his cool when he needs to, knows how to garner support and trust from "every-folk". Sociopath or not, that takes talent.

       all you have to do is start taking notes on the various facts he drops, in particular any names. put those names on a list, and learn the wikipedia page, etc of each person. once you know the background on each person, you don't need a guy like George Webb to tell you what to think, because it becomes self-evident by your own background knowledge of the people involved

       mission is to make a long list of names, assume that a social network exists, and discover all the connections between each person on the social network, and to find the paths of fewest jumps to get from one node to another, (in the case of a distributed network), or each node to the top, in the case of a hierarchical network (such as President of the United States and the Executive branch)
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps make a new folder on your desktop for each name, and add info such as their photo, screen shot of their wikipedia page, screen shots of reddit comments, screen shots of blogs, youtube videos, etc. to your folder

      <p>
       spelled #0p6dCP prefix, root, suffix
      </p>
      <p>
       prefix: starts with hashtag zero p for "Op" or "Operation" or "Opposition" etc
      </p>
      <p>
       (pound sign "#" and/or leading zero "0" helps float this 0p to the top by alphabetical sort)
      </p>
      <p>
       root: 6d is 6 degrees

      <p>
       suffix: CP is Child Prostitution/ Child Pornography

      <p>
       mission of Operation 4 colors is to tag each name from Operation 6 Degrees with the
       <em>
        best keywords
       </em>
       , and the
       <em>
        best number
       </em>
       of keywords. problem: how many hashtags is the best number of hashtags? too few, can't find anything anywhere, too many, will find everything everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       my personal opinion is that the best number of hashtags is somewhere between 4 and 7, for each of "who, what, where, why, why, how"

       . #0p64sCP Operation 64 Squares named after a chess board
      </p>
      <p>
       mission of Operation 64 Squares is to arrange photographs of all of the faces of the names from Operation 6 Degrees and Operation 4 Colors onto a chess board, starting with the President-Kingpin in the Top Left corner, and VP next box to the right, etc.

       Alex Jones may have caved on Pizzagate, but I still support the guy. He has been dragged through the mud for months now. You may not like him, but the guy has exposed real political cover-ups and scandals, and brought many to light that i had not heard of before.

       I've noticed for years, character assassination seems to be the number 1 tactic of the left and hardly ever the content or the policies. Especially during elections and it's not unique to the US, it's universal.

       So called "Left" and "Right" seem to use different ways for propaganda as they also target groups which are wired differently from a psychological perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The observation that the so called "Left" operates a lot with personal attacks, innuendo, PC and social/psychological ostracism looks quite accurate to me because a lot of the
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       "Left" seem to have a narcissist disorder and see themselves as "better" and more intelligent/enlightened human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so called "Right" seems to work differently and tries to use the base instincts(greed, fear, tribalism, ...) or cultural program(religion, culture) of people or make the opposite to feel weak by ignoring them. They also use more direct threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       About Bernie Sanders, he obviously targeted the more intellectual/rational Left side who needed to be convinced by an argument (at least on the surface). But then again Bernie Sander's "Elder Statement" act was never really convincing to me either as he completely lacked the leader personality to succeed. He has a weak personality IMHO and he is surely smart enough to know his limitations so I consider his whole run phoney. The end was quite revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure there are a lot people out there who looked into this complex far more deeper than the few mins I spent on writing this:-)

       It's silly the way they talk about stuff on the news. And the issues they choose from the BIGger issues and they always seem to direct u in different direction so you think about something else.To keep your focus away from the main subject? I know I can't be the only one that feels that way when watching any news..? or listening even? Js..

       You're absolutely right.  Sensationalism, misdirection, a skewed focus on violence and the negative.  These are the tools that the mainstream media use to simultaneously create a climate of fear and to keep people averting their eyes from the big picture.  I mean how often on the news do we hear about a community that came together today to solve a problem or better each other?  Those kinds of things happen every day.  But the focus is on almost nothing other than death and violence:  war and terrorism abroad, domestic terrorism and police brutality in the country, rape and murder in the communities.  This kind of skewed narrative has real power to shape and program people if they keep letting themselves be infected by it (watching TV).  The human spirit is never given the chance to be empowered by what we see on the news.  The mainstream media is the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Fake News.

       Its really strange. Reminds me of the email scandal too. With Seth they're happy to admit he was murdered, not robbed, yet they don't take the next obvious step, why was he murdered and who benefited. Same with the emails, it was all about who leaked and why, but nobody wants to talk about the content of the emails and what they mean. Everybody follow this distraction over here, do not look at the elephant in the room

       I just hope if he does uncover something no one else has that TPTB who it want to remain hidden, don't handle it like they usually do. 
Heart attack, "suicide",  bad wreck, plane crash, etc. 
Just look at what happened to Andrew Breitbart after he started going after the big fish and telling the public what was/is really going on.

       It was the last video in which he named the suspected killer and pieced the whole operation together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, he had a suspicion the night before that there were SEIU guys who were casing him. And then when he saw them on the elevator with the infamous duffel bag he figured he was done for. I also have to imagine he was being tipped off left and right by the same people who were giving him intel in the first place.

       In particular when there's no new information to be informed of. So, then, what we have is not information but his interpretation of information. In this case, it's not the (commonly known) information but the analysis that is criticized.

       Isn't this entire post a confirmation that those tactics work? I'm seeing a bunch of complaining and hardly and information. Why not just keep pushing facts and information than complaining. If you resort to their level they have either won or you don't have anything true to say.

       This happens because most of the people who like a good conspiracy weren't aware of him before today &amp; yesterday. Especially with the "He names Seth Rich's killer"
      </p>

       Which causes a lot more traffic going his way, what happens in places which are open to theories with no evidence? That's exactly what you get.. Speculative threads which fit in with their own personal idea of the world.

       Well if you had been listening to him from the beginning he started with Dyncorp and them going around the world havrvesting organs. He later said in one of his pariscope videos is he meant the organ harvesting hospitals do for transplants not what dyncorp does around the world in poor countries gathering organs for the black market.
      </p>

       A month or two ago he moved onto the Awan brothers and I feel he's the one that got the D.C. Police to start investigating them because before Webb started discussing them nothing was happening and that's why they fled to Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he started on Seth Rich which ties into the Awan brothers.

       He got people who watch his videos to tweet the D.C. Police to investigate the Awan brothers. You'll have to watch his vids and look at the dates of them to when the Awan brothers started being talked about.

       Yes they were, by February 2 they were barred from using any computers but they weren't fired, Webb started discussing it mid February. Then in march the fled to Pakistan and weren't halted by any US law agencies. If anything he was one of the few who did any research or journalism into the Awan brothers while the MSM ignored it completely. I found 1 article by politico about them.

       so again...my qs is did he potentially spook them out of the country? can you imagine them staying here with this sort of public heat? Theyre not Huma level, dont have protection from nutjobs to stay here. Again not saying they arent guilty or that he wasnt necessarily wrong to raise awareness about them..but thats all he did. he reported rather than did investigative journalism. repeating /pol/ isnt IJ imo.

       I don't understand your argument/discussion. You admit you haven't watched any of his videos, you just want my opionion on what he does? Just watch his videos and see for yourself. Look at the way he gets his information and follows up. He's been traveling all around D.C. this past week with his colleague asking senators and house members about the Awan brothers. If that isn't investigative journalism I don't know what is then.

       im not trying to be combative, but has George Webb legitimately broken something new that wasnt previously written on /pol/ ? 
Or is he simply confirming and following up on extra leads where he can? i mean its not like dyncorp wasnt suspected of child trafficking for a decade now or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       since i honestly dont rmb - how did the Awan brothers come to light? did pol discover a new story about an arrest? was it an FOIA request that revealed something? judicialwatch?

       He says hisself that he connects the dots that other people haven't in investigations that are going on. I'm not saying he in 100% correct and that every thing he says is truth. What I am saying is he put his evidence out there for his theory and what people are doing instead of talking about the evidence and the theory is just going after him and who he is and what he does and just completely ignore his evidence and his information.

       Cernovich was the one who broke the "Susan Rice was the official in the Obama Administration who ordered the unmasking of US Persons identified in foreign intelligence" story, that the NYT and WaPo had been sitting on for weeks without publishing. He actually does have sources inside the Administration who feed him news from time to time.

       Can't speak to Roger Stone or George Webb, although my impression of Webb from his videos leads me to believe he's full of shit. Roger Stone...eh. I tend to believe Infowars is a "poison the well" operation and that Alex Jones is a psyop, but who would listen? He has only the amount of credibility required to distract people open to conspiracy theories.

       I can get behind that. But also there are people who have an agenda and when it's threatened they refer to the only way they know how which is kill the messenger. I'm not saying Webb has all the answers but he put his evidence for his theory out there and people attack him not his evidence or they ignore what he's saying and just say he has nothing.

       Simply calling George webb a kook is exactly the character assassination this post is about. To make a valid point state why he is a kook, backed up by evidence.

        He drops a lot of names and facts and then makes huge conclusive leaps very quickly before your brain can process the analysis. And if you go back and try to follow his logic- it's really just not there. He's like the strawman stereotype of conspiracy theorists, just spouting unrelated factoids.

       At least you've stated why you think he is a kook, but I'd still need some examples to be satisfied.  (I'm not going through 219 of his videos, although I will accept that the making of 219 videos is kooky behaviour in itself)

       I've said he was bad information since day 50 or something.  it plays to the same type of meme magic that was so successful for rallying the trump troops.  He drops a lot of names and facts and then makes huge conclusive leaps very quickly before your brain can process the analysis.  And if you go back and try to follow his logic- it's really just not there.

       Even your post is inconsistent, given his video today accusing Kim Dotcom of being an FBI informant.

       If you knew what he knows you would sound like a crazy rambling person too. I have following his story only since today and I've already had nightmares and my brain is going crazy and I'm a little more paranoid than usual, he's been doing it since the 80s. lol

       If this guy was as intelligent as some here seem to think he is, if his work is really as important as people are saying, he'd be capable of putting out a &lt;1hr. long video summarizing his findings. Instead, I guess we need to parse through hundreds upon hundreds of videos to figure this dude out, with quite a few of the videos being absolute irrelevant trash (from my own research.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried to watch George Webb because people cite him as being at the forefront of the Seth Rich thing. But every time I turn him on I get the feeling I'm wasting my time....every single video seems like it needs way more context to understand and I shouldn't have to watch this motherfucker's entire YouTube videography just to understand what he's saying.
      </p>

       Fuck that.

       What? This is not true at all. Webb has been doing this for literally 219 days. I'm pretty sure it started with the news that Eric Braverman was missing and I
       <strong>
        definitely
       </strong>
       saw posts here discussing his early investigations in that area. I was here in this sub 220 days ago, but were you? The new account you're using is only 15 days old.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, George Webb has been all over the alternative media, too, for example, he did an hour long show with Tim Black on his progressive news YouTube channel. I've known about him after hearing about him on Reddit early in his investigation, but I didn't pay much attention to Webb myself until I saw that interview.

       He had some interesting comments today on the phone call video about being 'old guard' Mossad. He says there is an internal war between the old Mossad and New Mossad which is into the organ harvesting and murders and sketchy DNC deals. I dont think this should disqualify all his stellar research I think he's giving context for his connection to this world.

       This is interesting. When he first started posting videos about Dyncorp human trafficking and organ harvesting from Haiti to Syria, which seemed to evolve out of pizzagate connections to CGI, I thought that what he posted was genuine evidence, government documents, and even mainstream news reports. He seemed to be making a good effort and doing good journalism, even referring to Seymore Hirsch a lot. So I didn't see any reason to doubt him, but I did start to have this lingering suspicious in the back of my mind that he was in some way connected to Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't watched any of his recent stuff, but just what you said seems to confirm that even more. But that would actually be a good thing if it's true. It would mean people on the inside of these powerful organizations are working to stop corruption and make the organizations better, like they should be. So if that's the case, even if he does have ties to Mossad, it isn't a reason to disregard his work.

       There's a reason for that surprise, its because its ridiculous.  Are we supposed to believe that they are going through the hassle of convincing the family not to talk when they can just kill him and be done with it in one night instead?

       Why get the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Family Foundation involved, by having them write a letter welcoming him to the team (for a new job)?

       The working theory is that Braverman is not expendable like Rich. It's probable that his brother is Israeli intelligence, and for all we know there's a deadman switch out there that could unleash all of the dirt on the Clinton foundation--he did go to the Russian consulate and try to escape, after all... this is in addition to trying to drop off the info with Wikileaks members who end up dying in this timeframe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Webb speculates that he's in Israel right now--alive, but on a short leash. As to why Google is involved, they're practically an intelligence wing unto themselves. It would not surprise me for them to help the Clintons and do a solid on this one.

       It's a group of people who's "bosses" have a mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are here to derail conversation, call anyone genuinely interested in the murder of Seth Rich a lunatic, discredit anyone well known looking into this assassination by committing character assassination and creating a false "group consensus" - i.e they just respond to one another agreeing with each other when its obviously set up conversations.

       This sub is rooted in critical theory and skepticism.  Don't think that just because one person wants to insulate their bias that everyone else does.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is good that you are questioning.  If someone can come up with a strong response than your questions have created that strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       People that fight analysis and critique don't want their biases shattered.

       Thanks for that. I don't understand why people get so upset when you ask questions. I always thought that's what conspiracies like were all about.

       I'm here all of the time and I am critical of conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mostly I am critical because I know that when I go to and start to talk about this stuff that people will have questions for me.  So I try to find all of the weaknesses in the story before I go telling it to other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to just respond to the guys at work with "you are always denying what I'm telling you" and pouted my lips, I'd get laughed at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking the questions, demanding better answers creates a system where the truth becomes bolder and bolder.  It becomes tempered over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So do not drive away the deniers.  This sub needs them in order to make sure that the holes in our investigations are explored.

       I enjoy reading about conspiracies but this place has really become T_D lite. You'll see some breaking Seth Rich thing then go a couple comments in and see someone call it bs, and then there's people like you going year we've got em by the balls and then nothing will happen.

       First off, you can't even address my point. This same thing was said about him and it turns out it was true, he had nothing and was pushing a fake story.

       Why would Fox News, who exist to bash Democrats, suddenly be in the tank for the DNC?

       The reason I'm shitting all over him is that I have no idea who he is and all I'm seeing is a bunch of people posting about how he "cracked the case". Then I try to look at the video and what I see is exactly as advertised in the comments section... some idiot whose speech is that of a schizophrenic person.

       Would you fucking quit calling everything disinfo, saying vote manipulation is going on when something gets downvoted/upvoted, and calling everyone who doesn't buy into your dumb ideas a shill all the god damn time?
      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the shit that gets posted here with a tone of "GEE THAT'S FISHY, SHILLS AT WORK EVERYONE" is shit I look at and think "yeah, I can see why that got upvoted/downvoted, or why anyone would disagree with OP since OP is an idiot".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gotten to the point where at any given time, the front page has 2-3 post that are just calling out shills in a way that just makes OP seem retarded.

       Man you sure are angry. He does many videos through out the day giving his thoughts and opinions on evidence he has found. Just watching one video won't get you anywhere he's been doing this for 219 days, so of course watching one video is going to seem confusing and like he's rambling but he's been building for weeks to this one day. Also I'm not calling anyone shills or saying it's disinfo. I'm simply saying look at what he's saying and talk about that not say that he's some schizo rambling on. Take a chill pill man it will be ok.

      <p>
       All of the people you've mentioned have had criticisms levied against them for quite a while, but when they make themselves more visible those attacks become more visible.  Webb has stayed off of the radar of most people, at least compared to KDC and JA, and the general lack of attention means detractors were fewer in number.  But with this more recent claim by Webb, visibility has gone up and therefore you'll see more people unsure of whether or not they're untrustworthy.

       I understand where you're coming from, and I don't have any issues with Webb at all. But we're talking about a post titled "George Webb has figured out who killed Seth Rich" that has a link to a video in a series of over 200 where he is pointing at a computer screen for 15 minutes. Do you expect complete support for that? I'm not saying it's necessarily true in this instance, but here on r/conspiracy people upvote click bait bullshit to the front page all the time. I don't doubt that their are some nefarious things going on, but the second there's any dissent to the ideas on this sub people immediately start calling out shills and share blue like no one has any legitimate reasons to question something.

       Pretty much this. If you provide any sort of scepticism you're automatically a shill. I really wish people would stop upvoting baseless shill accusations just because they disagree with the supposed shill (I'm probably going to be called a shill because this is the first time I've commented on this sub), they just derail any sort of meaningful discussion.

       Maybe, just maybe, people didn't like the George Webb 'I know who killed Seth Rich' video because it was 15 minutes of complete nonsensical garbage.

       i'm just sick of the seth rich narrative these days, its like there is constantly a new 'i have proof who killed him' thing every day, like when the PI said he had new evidence, and there were like 10 posts of it on the front page, several being from the same account, i think i just need a break from this place

       I just don't understand how certain users are closed off to the thought of looking him and what he says.  Now I can understand the sentiment, but it goes completely against the investigative nature of theorizing criminal conspiracies. We have much to lose by blindly following Webb. We lose nothing by questioning things and figuring out if he's a good guy. If however he's wrong and we go with it, at best it'll be used to discredit investigators, and
       <strong>
        at worst
       </strong>
       , he'll lead us off into a direction that obstructs justice from being served for the murderer of Seth Rich.

       OP's post was written poorly, and he brought up two relatively low significance points(that I'm not hearing often), while making no mention of specific research related criticism, with just massive one being mentioned. Like he belives his
       <em>
        admitted
       </em>
       ties to Mossad shouldn't be questioned because it's something only a shill would do. At the moment Geroge Webb is in the same league as Alex Jones for me. Some truths (say 80% to 90% true) mixed in with deviations (10% to 20%) and character quirks where it most matters. Even the chans are in agreement that Webb should be taken with a grain of salt. I enjoyed this measured post that was on the frontpage:

       Youre completely right with the click hate sensationalism. I think you're not seeing what OP is saying, though. Your point isn't what OP is addressing. There does seem to be some sort of character assassination, maybe not on the large scale, but relative to George Webb's famousness. And I feel like I'm trying to be as non-biased as possible.

       I've watched every one of the episodes going back &amp; forth about what his purpose is. He solved the oil for arms ratline, the Awan brothers and now says he just needs to solve this Seth Rich case. Each one of these were going to bring down the whole deep state Hillary Clinton network. He admits to deleting all the ratline videos, deleted all his tweets and now has moved to periscope where people can no longer interact and most of his followers don't want to use it. After yesterday's fiasco I have awakened and am trying not to be too hard on myself for falling for this for MONTHS.

       I don't know if he deleted his tweets but he definitely did not delete his youtube videos just go to his youtube and click on playlists they are all there. He is saying he will leave periscope and go to youtube live once he and Jason figure it out. also you can interact with him on periscope he is taking peoples questions on there.

       Exactly.  For a lot of people this was their first exposure to him and they just said what they thought.  He takes a bit of getting used to and if you start watching him without any context he can seem like  the

       Nobody is disputing his information. The comments in this thread are either calling him a nobody who has nothing, a kook seeking for views and attention, or they just outright don't like him but have never seen any of his videos. Nobody has yet cited any evidence to prove him wrong, yet in his videos he cites exactly where he gets his information. Now that he's on periscope he's revealed some of his "sources" and is putting faces and names to his information.

       I have yet to see a comment that proves that what he's doing is factually wrong. I've only seen opionated comments.

       I don't like to use the word "shill" or "votebot". It's not a good look. You have to fight this fight with facts. Use their own words against them. Keep it simple and refrain from using your opinion. We all know that certain groups try and control the comment sections or derail the conversation but i found it easy to just use their words against them or facts. You'll never win an argument against people like them because it's their job to keep you from investing your time in real debate and conversations so if you feel their just trying to get under your skin then just ignore them.

       I've followed Webb off and on since around day 100. I don't really have the time to watch all of his videos, and I'm not that big a fan of his presentation style. That's not to say I discount his info—it might be true—but the format is hard to follow without devoting dozens, maybe hundreds of hours to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read over the other thread today, about him claiming he knows who killed Seth Rich, but what I couldn't find was what the actual claims and sources for these claims was. When people asked for this information, they were told to go and watch his videos, starting at 219.1. When people noted that he was making logical leaps, they were told to go and watch his earlier videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been several hours since I was on that thread, but I've yet to see a clearly written out thesis with supporting evidence. Sure, some people are trying to discredit him just to take heat off of the DNC and associated actors. I get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some of us are looking to see what it is he's actually claiming and what evidence he has to back it up. I know
       <a href="/r/truthleaks">
        /r/truthleaks

       was doing some summarization and outlining of his points, but is there a writeup with links that explains his thinking behind these latest claims?

       I simply am not 100% ok with George Webb.
      </p>
      <p>
       still skeptical. Nothing personal. I dont trust anybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       either way hes a talented and intelligent guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If hes honestly a self funded investigator with connections like he claims, all this free time, no work hours lol, hasn't been assassinated yet, then he is a brilliant investigator and deserves my respect for awakening the masss. I would love to believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, he's a very talented and convincing actor, much like Alex Jones, keeps his cool when he needs to, knows how to garner support and trust from "every-folk". Sociopath or not, that takes talent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I Would NOT just yet take his word as the gospel. stay skeptical of him too.

       At this point I find it more interesting to assess
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       this information is being dispersed to the public, since I don't doubt Webb's veracity based on my own research into organ harvesting rings, the people he cites and associates himself with (Sibel Edmonds, for example), and what I've studied about the Clinton family through Wikileaks and elsewhere. I get it if others aren't there with him, but it's a judgment call I'm personally comfortable with making.

       I don't understand these attempts to portray PizzaGate as some kind of huge debunked embarrassment to the conspiracy theorists. Podesta and his friends wrote a bunch of creepy stuff and were obviously, obviously speaking in some kind of code.  This code happens to be the FBI designated terminology that pedos used.  Again, these are people obviously, obviously speaking in code. If they weren't talking about pedophilia, then what was it, and was it likely not something similarly repugnant?

       Exactly, if these people would have come out and addressed the issue, then maybe it'd be possible to believe they aren't hiding something.  Podesta has never once fully addressed the code speak in many of his emails, and James Pizzagate has never addressed the creepy Instagram/calling a child a hotard.

       If somebody could take Webb's videos and summarize them into 60 second summaries, that would be tremendously helpful.  Even summarized, I'd still have 3+ hours to watch.  Dude's got a lot of long videos and they are not easy to follow, especially if you don't start from the beginning.

       That being said, I'd agree there is something fishy with the Rich reactions.  Reminds me of Andrew Breitbart, when they had bot Twitter accounts posting about his supposed cocaine use.

       Even if none of his stuff is true which I don't believe it's better than any season of house of cards on Netflix. He has said many times in his videos that people from intelligence agencies feed him breadcrumbs. Today when he revealed the mossad connection he was pretty scared and let some info slip that he now regrets and is trying to take back. I think he really thought there was a good chance he would die today. The first periscope video after he got out confirms that. Poor Jason. Jesus being red pilled so quickly took a toll on him.

       If they're anything like the last post they are incoherent rants. I think the Seth Rich murder stinks but this guy sounds just as bad as Alex Jones. If you want someone to believe you on Rich this guy gives you zero credibility.

       I'll just say this as somebody who was watched less than 3 of his videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       He mentioned in one of his most recent uploads that he had to offer an apology to mr Dotcom, he then said 'I knew that the FBI flipped you' but you've really turned things around now that you're involved with this Seth rich thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is red flags against his credibility. As somebody from New Zealand who has met with and spent a decent amount of time around him and his political party, Kim has absolutely had nothing to do with the FBI and strongly opposed the recent Comey lead FBI. Even going as far as filing complaints to the NZ police when Comey arrived in NZ to try to have have him held accountable by New Zealand law for his unlawful behaviour against Kim and mega etc (lol fat chance right? but still funny and I give him credit for taking the time to do it formally)
      </p>
      <p>
       What this means to me anyway is that this guy is at least capable of rambling about things he has no idea about as if they are factual and 100% real
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I want justice for Seth rich but I'm not sure about this guy being credible for the movement.. Happy to be proven wrong as like I say, I haven't seen much of his stuff.

       He doesn't even have ad's on any of his videos. Pretty sure he's not making a dime off any of the videos. Saying he did it for the clicks isn't accurate, but I've seen that being thrown around as a reason he has been providing content.

       The very thing that would make his theory compelling is a strong link between his "connected dots".  But this is where he seems to fail, as those are always nebulous or outright omitted.  "We'll see footprints" is not a convincing way to marry theory to fact.  What footprints, when will they be shown, how will they connect these two persons or events?  He seems to remain purposefully ambiguous in order to spin a story that he wrote the end to already.

       Yeah I thought it was odd that he released videos every few hours for weeks, and then the day I start watching he has a 24 hour gap between videos.

       George Webb is a deep state shill who is misdirecting people the mob is in on it, the dnc is in on it, the same people who killed Kennedy had Seth Rich dealt with. I'm beginning to think the media will start siding with Trump if that's what it takes to sweep this under the rug. Some social media platforms have already ran some pro trump fluff pieces which is a vast departure from all the vitriol. The Russian narrative is evaporating. It's all misdirection to get us to close up shop and stop snooping around looking for clues. With that said, don't stop the investigation, keep connecting the dots and don't trust any of these fake ads e-celebs.

       It appears that most of what Webb 'discovered' has been online since 13 July 2016, written 3 days after Rich was killed, and over 1 month before Assange revealed Seth Rich in the Netherlands interview.

       What is really weird is that most stories on this site are completely crazy, and every story is prefaced by "A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today ..." or some variant with "the Russian Foreign Ministry etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       Since every story comes from an unknown Russian report of one sort or another, most of them are bordering on crazy, why does this post appear to connect all the dots?   The key point here is that contrary to the public reports from not only the Washington Post, but also RT, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Kremlin site, that a tit-for-tat expulsion of two Russian diplomats from the US, and two US diplomats being sent back from Moscow, at or around the 6-7 July 2016, being the fallout from a bizarre incident outside the US embassy in Moscow a month earlier on June 6, that the expulsion of the two Russians from DC was connected to Seth Rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story says that Russian intelligence was monitoring traffic around the DNC and they detected a surge of activity between Seth Rich, the DNC and the Clinton Foundation, and they quickly realised  that Seth Rich was possibly being targeted for a hit.   It says that permission was obtained from the highest level to break cover and inform the State Department of the activity, and that Rich may be in danger.   But after doing so, the agents were surprised that the State Department simply expelled them from the US, saying that not to worry, the US will take care of it.  This then triggered the Russians to expel two US diplomats, one reportedly being the agent involved in the June 6 incident outside the Embassy in Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have scoured the Russian web using Yandex looking at blogs, news sites and there was not even chatter about this unreported version of events.   The first time the Russian web even mentions Seth Rich was after Assange spoke in early August.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its possible that someone invented this extra connection between the Russian diplomats, a secret report, and a warning to the State Department.   Everything else, including the DC shootout allegedly involving Aloah Jarroh on July 9, checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is Webb secretly behind the website?   Where is the evidence for the supposed warning to the State Department, as the reason for the diplomats' expulsion.   Any why on a site that regularly predicts the end of the world, every other week?

       I admit, I have no fucking clue.

       Having watched over 200 of George Webb's videos I find him one of the utmost brilliant citizen journalists of our times. What people have trouble with is unedited video. They don't know how to handle it.So they attack the producer out of frustration which just shows how ignorant or trollish they are.

       You're absolutely right.  Sensationalism, misdirection, a skewed focus on violence and the negative.  These are the tools that the mainstream media use to simultaneously create a climate of fear and to keep people averting their eyes from the big picture.  I mean how often on the news do we hear about a community that came together today to solve a problem or better each other?  Those kinds of things happen every day.  But the focus is on almost nothing other than death and violence:  war and terrorism abroad, domestic terrorism and police brutality in the country, rape and murder in the communities.  This kind of skewed narrative has real power to shape and program people if they keep letting themselves be infected by it (watching TV).  The human spirit is never given the chance to be empowered by what we see on the news.  The mainstream media is the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Fake News.
