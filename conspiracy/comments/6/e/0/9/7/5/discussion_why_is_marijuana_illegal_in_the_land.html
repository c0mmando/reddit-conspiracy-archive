<p>Just an FYI, this is not accurate. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white">Studies have shown either a lower, or about the same, rate of use by minorities as whites.</a> The incidents of arrests, however, are completely improportional compared to those usage rates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has a historical cause.  George Washington grew and smoked it.  Hemp was, at one point, widely used.  So it went from acceptable to unacceptable.  This happened, imo, somewhere around the turn of the century.  It went hand in hand with the temperance movement (a feminist social control play), which ironically put control of alcohol in a smaller set of hands (the mob, the people that trafficked it like the Seagrams).  This went hand in hand with industrialization and the ethic of &quot;hard work&quot;.  Weed keeps you on the couch, amusing yourself with silly ideas some of which might be dangerous to the status quo.  Because you&#39;re amotivated, you&#39;re also far less likely to go commit crimes or act against any of the traditional duality traps the establishment has created to maintain control.  So they have to make it illegal.  Can&#39;t have slackers slacking off on their anti-estab efforts.  Every Hero System needs villains - which is also the cause for a lot of divide and conquer and racial policy.  </p>

<p>Post-industry which is now, people widely know it has many benefits as well as being enjoyable.  This was great for the migration of the &quot;work ethic&quot; to the &quot;distraction ethic&quot; model of social control currently being implemented (and failing ever more, every day).  Which is why we&#39;ve seen it become more acceptable.  </p>

<p>Finally, keeping it illegal, or giving a small set of actors the freedom to arbitrarily persecute people has always been a stalwart of the american prison industry.  How else does this power stay around but by finding new people to villainize?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;d be really great for weed to be legal but also totally shit. Dealers would be out of a job and would struggle to get a &quot;proper&quot; one if they&#39;ve ever been charged for a drug offence (yes I think this matters because I can think of hundreds of jobs more unethical!). It would be taxed and they could easily mess around with strains if they wanted to. Decriminalise weed and you get less crime, less people in prison, less people with drug offenses and less shitty paper work for the police. I think the same applies for other stupid criminal acts like the TV license shit, illegally downloading stuff, prostitution ... If crimes like these weren&#39;t such serious crimes we wouldn&#39;t have such serious criminals everywhere.</p>

<p>Also weed opens your mind, they don&#39;t want that</p>
