What makes people think DNC is setup less security? </p>

<p>Why do people keep repeating the Fox 5 story it was <strong>retracted</strong>? KDC after his PR stunt?

    <div class="md"><p>Well you see Seth Rich was just another pussy anti-gun liberal until he got redpilled by Alex Jones and started taking Super Male Vitality. This gave him incredible intelligence and the ability to smell corruption. That&#39;s when he walked into the Italian DNC mob crime family&#39;s HQ where he could smell the corruption. It was coming from the emails. He had just taken this job so he would have to act quickly and covertly... it didn&#39;t work. HRC prayed to Satan to crush her enemies and in the well of virgin&#39;s blood she saw what she needed to know who was behind her future betrayal. She couldn&#39;t go to the cops... she had to take it upon herself. She called her suicide guy and told him... to make it not look like a suicide. &quot;Make it look like an attempted rape gone bad&quot; she screeched. </p>

<p>So yes, Seth Rich is a hacker because of SMV. Or filled a usb with malware created by others because he had been reading DWS email&#39;s in real time and knew of her plots. Or he just had frivolous access to the server terminals. God knows they give that kind of access willy nilly. Liberals, amirite. Dangerous, evil and satanic.</p>

<p>Why do people keep repeating the Fox 5 story it was retracted?</p>

<p>Where is this story being repeated?</p>

<p>What was claimed by Wheeler is that the PD has pressure on it by a DNC operative.  What Zimmerman&#39;s article claimed was that there was an anonymous federal employee who came forward and stated that Seth was communicating with the director of Wikileaks.  </p>

<p>The FBI memo released is a part of the disinformation campaign that is attempting to undermine the claims of a anonymous federal employee.  Here is the twitter handle that is supposedly responsible for the leaks:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Podesta was not hacked, but instead fell for a phishing scam. Let&#39;s not make out the process as some difficult hack as that is an elementary one. Most email servers are not that secure, and this is for two reasons. The IT department is either unaware of how to setup very secure servers, or the user base is unable to access highly secured systems. Most of these users are not tech savvy. The other reason servers are not secured well is that it is only as secure as the user base is secure--if they use weak passwords, you have a way in. If you let your password be phished, no amount of security will stop that.</p>

<p>To say you don&#39;t have access to other people&#39;s email is only indicative that you do not have the knowledge of how to access other&#39;s accounts, but does not mean it&#39;s not possible. Emails have been accessed time and time again like this, so it&#39;s certainly within the realm of possibility for a person to have done this.</p>
