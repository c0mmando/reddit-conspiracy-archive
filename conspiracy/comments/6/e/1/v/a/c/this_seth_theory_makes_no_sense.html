       Seth didn’t work in DNC's IT dept. There is no evidence he was a hacker or had access to their internal email system.  What makes people think he could hack DNC’s email and bypass their security? I work on my companies web site and yet I can only ready my email. What makes people think DNC is setup less security?

       Considering how biased the FBI was with not telling us about the Russia investigation, but using the Email investigation to help Trump? Seriously there were 2 active FBI investigations going on, but only one was used for political gains. No wonder they didn't want help.

       Difference between that one had several pieces of EVIDENCE.  Was not based on anonymous sources and was actually obstructed by a sitting administration.  Spoiler it wasn't the Trump investigation.

       I took a data communications course in college, and we were working with a virtual windows server, setting up business emails and such. My professor showed us how easy it can be -depending on security of course- to infiltrate a server, and access all the emails. It can be done using Wireshark, a packet capturing program, and a litany of other open source programs that are simple to use and facilitate an easy hacking operation. I'm not saying this is how he did it, but essentially, I'm saying you don't need to be a skilled hacker to do this. You only need to be resourceful.

       Sorry, but that only worked because you were on the same LAN as your Exchange server. Exchange emails are encrypted internally and can only be sniffed when you're on the same subnet. What are the odds Seth was on the same subnet as Podesta? Nice try though.

       The DNC emails and podesta emails are separate incidences. They were unconnected.

       Well you see Seth Rich was just another pussy anti-gun liberal until he got redpilled by Alex Jones and started taking Super Male Vitality. This gave him incredible intelligence and the ability to smell corruption. That's when he walked into the Italian DNC mob crime family's HQ where he could smell the corruption. It was coming from the emails. He had just taken this job so he would have to act quickly and covertly... it didn't work. HRC prayed to Satan to crush her enemies and in the well of virgin's blood she saw what she needed to know who was behind her future betrayal. She couldn't go to the cops... she had to take it upon herself. She called her suicide guy and told him... to make it not look like a suicide. "Make it look like an attempted rape gone bad" she screeched.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, Seth Rich is a hacker because of SMV. Or filled a usb with malware created by others because he had been reading DWS email's in real time and knew of her plots. Or he just had frivolous access to the server terminals. God knows they give that kind of access willy nilly. Liberals, amirite. Dangerous, evil and satanic.

       Yep so I worked for a company that had every employees email they sent also sent to a side email. My direct supervisor had access to this email account, therefore having access to every single email sent by an employee within the company...

       My supervisor didn't like the management so he also gave us all access to this email account so we could see what they owners/bosses were saying about everyone..

       No you're an asshat because you didn't think I had experience. You also don't know the DNC operates like that or not. You also, don't have any evidence it wasn't Seth Rich who leaked, we also have no evidence it was Russia/Trump collusion.

       SR is suspected to be 1 of 4 people who accessed voter data while the firewall was brought down back in Dec of 2015. It was suggested he stumbled on a voter scam. The bernie campaign got penalized for the breach. 1 employee was fired. Then they sued the dnc because of the breach. So that sounds strange. Why after accepting being penalized and firing an employee who took part in the breach, would you sue the dnc over the breach?

       What was claimed by Wheeler is that the PD has pressure on it by a DNC operative.  What Zimmerman's article claimed was that there was an anonymous federal employee who came forward and stated that Seth was communicating with the director of Wikileaks.

       The FBI memo released is a part of the disinformation campaign that is attempting to undermine the claims of a anonymous federal employee.  Here is the twitter handle that is supposedly responsible for the leaks:

       Podesta was not hacked, but instead fell for a phishing scam. Let's not make out the process as some difficult hack as that is an elementary one. Most email servers are not that secure, and this is for two reasons. The IT department is either unaware of how to setup very secure servers, or the user base is unable to access highly secured systems. Most of these users are not tech savvy. The other reason servers are not secured well is that it is only as secure as the user base is secure--if they use weak passwords, you have a way in. If you let your password be phished, no amount of security will stop that.
      </p>

       To say you don't have access to other people's email is only indicative that you do not have the knowledge of how to access other's accounts, but does not mean it's not possible. Emails have been accessed time and time again like this, so it's certainly within the realm of possibility for a person to have done this.

       Assange already hinted that Seth Rich was the leaker. They even offered a cash reward for info on his killer. He was shot for a deeper reason, it wasn't a robbery since nothing was stolen from him. You're the one being pushed by the fake news to ignore Seth Rich
