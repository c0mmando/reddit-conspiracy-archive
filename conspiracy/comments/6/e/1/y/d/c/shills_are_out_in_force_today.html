<p>Just look at the ridiculous amounts of upvotes defending the NYT and MSM, pro-mainstream viewpoints, the huge downvotes and sliding/deflecting from constructive comments, tons of non-sequitor anti-Trump posts, attacks on character/opinion that deviate from their defense of blatant liars in the media.</p>

<p>You guys are pathetic.  We see you, and you&#39;re not fooling a single thinking person in here with your blatantly inorganic shitposts and incendiary political rhetoric meant to divide and stifle actual discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pointing out that people who post anti-Trump posts <em>that also coincide with the other characteristics I pointed out</em> in no way says that I have a bias towards Trump, you&#39;re just cherry-picking points out of context.  Trump is a regular target of the shills that push mainstream viewpoints and downvote and marginalize other real conspiracies here.  I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve never personally seen a single pro-Trump poster or shill defending the MSM <em>AND</em> going out of their way to slag our sub and our beliefs, but I see it <em>every day on every thread here</em> from supposedly organic users with obvious liberal biases with month-old accounts or people who post almost exclusively in r/politics or r/worldnews.  But yet people say this is T_D 2.0 lol no matter how completely off-base and blatantly false that claim is.  It&#39;s just blanket statements to paint anyone who questions The Official Narrative® as a crazy, like Reddit does with T_D in general by marginalizing them as much as possible, because they want r/conspiracy to basically be r/politicswithalienstoo.</p>

<p>Cry about it some more. Call us shills some more. Not all news is fake especially since that word only came from one man who would call the most reputable source of news fake if it even slightly criticized him. </p>

<p>Does the media report everything you want it to? No. Do they have agendas? Yes. Have they published incorrect information? Yes. Fuck people being humans, that line to err is to be human, BS amirite. Trump&#39;s always perfect why can&#39;t the media be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has nothing to do with Trump and this proves my point that you have no argument other than crying about a Cheeto man.  Since you&#39;re probably 16 and have no basis of comparison, you might want to figure out that Presidents have <em>always</em> abused their power since day one.  The media has <em>always</em> been dishonest, it&#39;s their job to push propaganda to us to create compliant minded individuals that agree with what their government does, regardless of the morality or truth.  In other words, stop focusing on nothing but Trump and actually talk about something else and you might come off as a legitimate user instead of just coming here to shitpost about Trump because he triggers you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seth Rich, much like Weiner, Clinton, Podesta, are only bit players part of a very large web of deceit involving their banker masters and aristocrats behind the scenes.  But even the smallest strings can unravel the bigger picture that you&#39;re clearly not seeing.</p>

<p>Maybe you should look into why exactly every MSM source is for a suicidally-aggressive stance towards the only other massive nuclear superpower in the world?  Maybe it has something to do with Russia&#39;s hostile stance towards globalism and Putin&#39;s creation of the BRICS banking agreements that will eventually have to buy out and replace the IMF and World Bank/Reserve fractional banking when they inevitably fail?  Or maybe it&#39;s because 9/11 was essentially a massive fraud to cover up the destruction of the Soviet Union&#39;s economy that incriminates the Western power structure and US political class in crimes against humanity?  Maybe it&#39;s because they <em>still</em> cover up the Western-backed Bolshevik Revolution that slaughtered the Romanovs and 100 million+ Russians?  Or that this is all just revenge for a centuries-old hatred of Russia by the ruling classes because of the Russian role in the destruction of the Khazarian Empire that spawned the Israeli/Zionist factions of the Elite?</p>

<p>Hmmmm probably not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All roads don&#39;t lead to war. Just because you want them to hack the political party you&#39;re against doesn&#39;t make it right. And it doesn&#39;t mean they get to hack with impunity. </p>

<p>You already said yourself why Russia may have a motive to attack U.S citizens or organizations. I&#39;m not the one acting like Russia is a little baby child that couldn&#39;t pull something off like manipulate a vulnerable two party system. I&#39;m sure China has it&#39;s hands in making itself have better deals but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d resort to hacking the democratic candidate. </p>

<p>I&#39;m entirely open to Seth Rich being the leaker if there&#39;s proof. But there&#39;s not. The people who have the proof won&#39;t give it up us. </p>

<p>The DNC say they have proof it was hacked out of their system. If so that evidence would be part of a criminal investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC is no different from the RNC, they&#39;re both puppet corps that manufacture candidates and your consent.  Russia didn&#39;t hack anything, you can&#39;t hack paper ballots and you can&#39;t mentally force people to vote for Trump.  The states with electronic voting machines were rigged towards HILLARY, in fact, but still failed because she never had a chance outside of fraud and inflated numbers.  Other than basic spycraft that literally <em>every</em> country engages in, Russia didn&#39;t hack anything and there&#39;s literally no proof in support of it.  Stop propagating lies.</p>

<p>This is NOT about just the USA, how thick are you?  The two-party system has ALWAYS been a farce and controlled by the elite until Trump got in.  He was not part of the plan and that is obvious.</p>

<p>There&#39;s far more evidence in favor of Rich being murdered as a political hit for leaking to WikiLeaks then there is that Russia actually subverted the election bc &quot;reasons&quot;.  Putin is not an idiot, or looking to wipe out the world with mutually assured nuclear destruction.  He&#39;s actually the best ally we have in finally overthrowing the Cabal that has owned all of us for thousands of years.</p>

<p>You mean the same DNC that didn&#39;t even let the FBI touch their server that was supposedly hacked, and told us to rely on the word of CrowdStrike, who have financial ties to the Clinton Foundation and a direct involvement in the Western-backed coup in Ukraine?  The DNC that just openly admitted and argued that they had a right to subvert the democratic process and rig the primaries?  The DNC that sandbagged their own controlled opposition candidate Bernie Sanders because their main candidate was so fucking bad they <em>had</em> to do it?  The DNC whose former chairman brazenly threatened the Chief of DC Police on camera for access to Seth Rich&#39;s laptop?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  There&#39;s specific distinctions between non-stop partisanship of political witch-hunts on either side, and a unified attempt by both the media and the political parties to silence discussion of specific issues like Pedogate/Pizzagate, 9/11 truth, the false flag shootings, etc.  One thing that is for sure is that those who put down and smear discussion of those topics and events almost universally:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discredit any and all conspiracy theories that haven&#39;t come from &quot;official sources&quot;</li>
<li>Hate Trump, deflect all conversation to him and his perceived ineptitude or failings</li>
<li>Loved Obama, deflect all negativity as right-wing lies or obstructionism</li>
<li>Push MSM sources as empirical truth</li>
<li>Pro-war</li>
<li>Intense red-baiting, McCarthyism and xenophobia towards Russia</li>
<li>Predominantly left-leaning; usually a Hillary supporter</li>
<li>Vigorously defend the Clintons and insist they&#39;ve either never done anything wrong, or &quot;it&#39;s over, she lost, move on&quot;</li>
<li>Strongly support Israeli political aims and/or the Israeli apartheid state</li>
<li>Support the mainstream news networks and still consider them legitimate</li>
<li>Smear any independent media that counters official narratives</li>
<li>Dismiss or smear whistleblowers and especially WikiLeaks</li>
<li>Propagate the dubious Russian collusion narrative of the 2016 election created by the MSM</li>
</ul>

<p>Those people aren&#39;t here for legit reasons.  This is a subreddit used to discuss alternate theories that get covered up or ignored by the mainstream media.  Our universal trait is our skepticism of official sources; strong denial of alternative theories and support for mainstream points makes it fairly obvious that someone is only here to stir shit up, out of boredom or because they get paid to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool, that&#39;s a bit more fair.  I&#39;ve mentioned it before in this sub, but in all the conspiracy forums I&#39;ve ever been in, I&#39;ve never experienced the amount of political bias we are seeing these days.  Maybe, <em>maybe</em>, you could get a feel for a particular user&#39;s political leanings, but typically it just wan&#39;t an issue. As a whole, the conspiracy community, while having personal political biases I&#39;m sure, were pretty good at separating them from their conspiracy interests.</p>

<p>For instance, I can&#39;t stand Trump, liked Obama and voted for Hillary - but I also think they are <strong>all</strong> trying to screw us.  And that their <em>public</em> platforms may differ (which is what determines my vote), but their <em>private</em> platforms are very likely alllll the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I voted for Obama the first time around because I kind of bought into his hole charade of Hope and Change (I was heavily liberal myself at the time especially after 8 years of George W. Bush), but he is a perfect example of somebody saying really nice and great things and doing the exact opposite.  He basically allowed Wall Street to fuck us with no lube and presided over the largest theft of public money to the private sector in history ($5.4 trillion), vastly expanded the already unconstitutional policies of George W Bush and continue to prosecute even more wars and drone attacks under his command.  As a classical liberal / libertarian, it was Obama&#39;s betrayal of his promises to undo Bush Administration fuckery that really made me dive into the rabbit hole of understanding the power structures that control the presidents and other heads of state.</p>

<p>You are very much correct in that Clinton, Bush, Obama and possibly even Trump are all cronies behind the scenes - they are there to serve their interests and the interests of others like them, which stand in opposition to the needs and desires of the people far more often than they don&#39;t.  Trump to his credit is not a part of &quot;the gang&quot; so to speak - he was recruited by a counter-coup of IC/military white hats to basically throw out the Bush-Clinton machine that has controlled our political system since the days of JFK.  He was not &quot;supposed to win&quot; and only did so because of the direct involvement the IC and military on his behalf to halt Clinton&#39;s attempted electronic voter fraud (the same kind that Hillary used to defraud Bernie of 13 primary wins that he should have gotten).  Problem is, he has since surrounded himself by the same old neocon / neoliberal swamp-dwellers he campaigned on fighting, which has caused him to roll back on many of his more moderate/bipartisan ideas and turn a huge amount of his base against him, and he places far too much operational control of his presidency into the hands of scumbag fucks like Jared Kushner and McMaster, who are actively undermining him and his policies on behalf of the Deep State in an attempt to get him under control.  I think the man is an emotional child, frequently puts himself into a corner with his own words, he should be far more tactful in general than he actually is, and his support for Israel / Saudi Arabia seriously concerns me, but I prefer to look at Trump being president as an opportunity for serious change at a local and public level for the positive, because we will probably never get this chance again.  The Elite are hurting and crippled but not completely beaten, and they will make damn sure in 2020 to not let a political outsider get anywhere near the presidency and have history repeat itself ever again.  There&#39;s plenty of reasons to hate him, but the truth is that for the first time possibly ever America is not in control of the oligarchs anymore, and he definitely pisses off all the right people for all the right reasons.  We should use Trump as the useful idiot he is to bring her country back to a republic with Constitutional governance while we still have some sympathetic ears left in government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem.  You should look into the history between Trump and Nikola Tesla, that will really blow your mind.  It turns out that Trump&#39;s uncle was Dr. John Trump of MIT and was contracted by the FBI to research and document all of Nikola Tesla&#39;s patents and inventions way back in the day.  To get a better handle on some of it, I would suggest looking into some of the interviews with Robert David Steele and Dr. Steve Pieczenik (he was in fact the ex-CIA that recruited Trump for the Presidency).  RDS in particular is incredibly smart, and has absolutely brilliant ideas for open source intelligence (OSINT) that would gut the NSA, CIA and intelligence services and replace them with a system of and for the people that would actually work.  X22 Report on YouTube also takes a fairly even-keeled view at Trump and examines both the motives and reasoning of what he&#39;s doing without resorting to T_D/Alex Jones cocksuckery and ShareBlue REEEEE extremes of political partisanship.  I know it&#39;s hard even being positive with a Trump presidency when you look at the media coverage and his various fuck ups, but what&#39;s important to realize is that nothing going on right now with him is what it seems.  There&#39;s a very good reason why almost every single MSM publication and viewpoint is fully unified against him without even a semblance of fair coverage, and it&#39;s not because he&#39;s &quot;just that bad&quot; - Trump and his Presidency represent an existential threat to the establishment power structure, and that&#39;s why they are freaking the hell out, flogging the Russia connection (the power structure hates Russia for entirely different reasons that go back <em>hundreds</em> of years) and scrambling to find anything they can to get him out or kill him.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4tIkt8yU4dw">Here&#39;s a video of Trump calling out Anthony Weiner and making a mention to Pizzagate <strong><em>IN 2011</em></strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>Pedogate / Pizzagate is very real, heavily fucked by disinformation but definitely real.  It was spun into bullshit by the media to be &quot;Hillary running a child-fucking ring out of CPP&#39;s basement&quot; when in fact it was simply a group of people on 4chan and other sites that noticed weird coded language in John Podesta&#39;s emails and started to dig deeper, and eventually grew into Pedogate because it&#39;s all tied to a much larger International ring of child trafficking that involves high-level politicians of almost every country and goes back decades.  The Republicans are just as bad with pedophilia blackmail as the Democrats and are likely even worse, according to Robert David Steele - let&#39;s not forget that Dennis Hastert was literally Repub Speaker of the House and convicted as a serial child molester, or that the Franklin Scandals in the 80s went all the way to the top of the Reagan/Bush White House, or that McCain, Graham, Priebus, Ryan, both Bushes and several other prominent Rs have been implicated as a part of this by many people.  The angle that this is just a partisan/Democrat witch hunt is just deflection and dismissal of the topic because the implications can bring down our entire government - an estimated 30% or more of our politicians are compromised with this.  When literally the entire media freaks the hell out and does back flips to get in front of a story and bury it, you know something&#39;s there.</p>

<p>This is a common tactic of CIA / Mossad to honeypot politicians and celebrities to ensure their compliance, and some of them are literally just sick fucks that enjoy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep bringing up Trump.  I don&#39;t support him, nor did I vote for him.  There was a time where I cautiously put some faith in him that he&#39;d do a good job and wasn&#39;t completely owned, but he&#39;s been all but co-opted by TPTB at this point and supporting agendas I do not agree with, and believing that ANY of them will save us is exactly why we&#39;re in the situation we&#39;re in.  The only way we get out of this is if we all unite as one against TPTB instead of zeroing in on useless bickering and political theater like this.</p>

<p>On a side note though, you really have an unhealthy obsession..  Does The Donald keep you awake at night?  Want to show me where he grabbed you?  Was it by the pussy?  Do you need an adult?</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to there own opinion but it&#39;s safe to say that you don&#39;t naturally receive 250 upvotes for dismissing a JFK conspiracy in the conspiracy sub.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how conflicted your post is.  If a person is confronted with evidence that a &quot;belief&quot; is wrong, then they should absolutely change their view.  That&#39;s what it means to be intellectually honest.  You talk about promoting an anti-echochamber mentality while, at the same time, saying that it&#39;s a problem to have people question their beliefs.</p>

<p>I agree with you in that we need to promote an anti-echo chamber mentality.  Do you know how you do that?  Get rid of the intellectually dishonest bullshit where people will call you a shill or dig through your post history in order to discredit you so they can avoid addressing points made in a post.  Those are the most egregious examples of widespread intellectually dishonest discourse that is plaguing this subreddit.  </p>

<p>tl;dr - Start addressing the post or ideals espoused in a post and avoid ad hominem and trying to discredit someone via post history.  If we begin doing that, the quality of discourse would increase exponentially.  Interestingly enough, actually addressing a &quot;shills&quot; post and pointing out their faulty logic or reasoning would be more effective than just calling them a shill.</p>

<p>Your post read as if you were talking about posting in this subreddit.  No where in your post do you even mention social media.  As a matter of fact, you were talking about voting.  So can you blame me for not knowing that you&#39;re talking about social media?</p>

<p>Also, do you still not grasp how contradictory your post is?  You talk about creating an anti-echo chamber mentality while implying that it&#39;s a bad thing that people are changing their minds.  I mean, you make a condescending point that I&#39;m somehow not understanding while you gloss over the majority of points made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if there&#39;s anything to the conspiracy it&#39;s not what advocates of that theory think or want. People are calling anything pizzagate these days anyway, I&#39;ve largely ignored it and at least there&#39;s little of it here now.</p>

<p>I actually had a related exchange <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6dqn1g/astroturfing_how_to_spot_fake_grassroots_messages/di4o60t/">Here</a> (before the pizzagate.wiki link it hadn&#39;t clicked) and I still cannot see how the logo has any relation <em>at all</em>. Pizzagate means too many people like that and they&#39;re so quick to crow &quot;Pedoshill!&quot;</p>

<p>There are other areas I rather dislike and typically avoid even reading they do tend to be those with more hateful or invested participants (or where I fear there may be genuine mental health concerns).</p>

<p>I recognize my bias and I also recognize and understand cognitive dissonance.  I try hard to remain skeptical and intellectually honest, but it&#39;s becoming a struggle.  I can no longer take information posted here at face value because the majority of the time that I take an objective look at a post here, they turn out to be completely misleading or worse.</p>

<p>It&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult not to just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and just stop trying to stay informed.  The amount of bullshit that we&#39;re hit with on a daily basis is astronomical and I can understand why so many people here buy into bullshit and avoid challenging their world views because it&#39;s just easier.  The time that I spend checking stories and sources... it&#39;s just so time consuming and it&#39;s exhausting. </p>

<p>Sorry for ranting, but your quote is a fantastic rule to live by... and Goddamn is it exhausting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can read through the doublespeak where they essentially admitted that they were <em>completely wrong</em> about the outcome they predicted (97% chance for Hillary winning, right?  How does that much of a discrepancy even happen?) after blatantly pushing for their stated, preferred candidate to win (complete with rigged polls) and embarrassed themselves enough to have to issue an explanation from the publisher, I&#39;d say it was a fairly obvious admission of &quot;we fucked up&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Getting desensitized to the idea of being played is not the end of the world. It just makes people apathetic and not show up to the polls.</p>

<p>And that creates an opening for populist politicians. Trump turned out to be a fake populist, but he was the only one who even pretended to be a populist, and he won, despite massive media campaign against him.</p>

<p>That makes me believe that despite the establishments attempts to keep the status quo by dividing us into the left and the right, politics in US has become populist vs. status quo. And this is huge.</p>

<p>So unless they declare martial law and cancel elections, I am actually pretty hopeful for the future.</p>

<p>All I see is a bunch of users calling-out a post as the intentionally misleading bullshit it is. That&#39;s not &quot;stifling discussion&quot;, that&#39;s &quot;discussion&quot;.</p>

<p>Stop being such a pussy. Calling anyone who disagrees with you a shill is a clear sign of mental enfeeblement; and meanwhile, you&#39;re working overtime trying to convince everybody that there&#39;s nothing to Trump-Russia. Hey, maybe there ain&#39;t, but your incessant denials based on &quot;no hard proof&quot; (yet - though I suppose if there was you&#39;d insist it was a ploy by the &quot;anti-Trump&quot; MSM and shills...) are pretty damn odd for a conspiracy forum. </p>

<p>So, who&#39;s shillin&#39;? Who&#39;s botting? Why is the forum clogged bottom-to-top with nonsensical Seth Rich posts and almost nothing else?</p>

<p>And this may serve as a comfort to anyone who (like me) are getting tired of the ShareBlue vermin who are crawling all over reddit these days, obviously in a panicked frenzy to make the Seth Rich issue go away. Wow, the DNC thugs must be pissing their pants! Anyway, just look at how this pathetic Clinton News Network tool fails when he peddles his deep state propaganda, the like/dislike ratio and the comments are disastrous, hahaha. They are also a victory for humanity and common sense. People are simply not buying the David Brock scripts and the MSM horse manure anymore, so fuck you and I love watching you faceplant over and over and over again, ShareBlue vermin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW, if you regularly submit links and comment about topics that are either negative of the chosen establishment narratives or politicians, or supportive of their opposition, especially in popular subs, you will very quickly discover the shills and become convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt of their constant presence on reddit.</p>

<p>The most telling signs of a shill are changing though. It used to be excessively condescending and insulting comments appearing in a submission within minutes of a postng, day or night, from the same accounts. Absolutely having to get the last word in in any argument.</p>

<p>But lately I am seeing fewer insults, and less insistence on getting the last word in. They still make sure to get their talking points in every single thread on the topics they deem important. But it seems like the new tactic is to flood the comments sections, rather than attempt to win arguments.</p>

<p>But I am mostly surprised by a noticeable increase in new accounts. Even though it is circumstantial evidence, it is the simplest and the most obvious sign of a shill. It makes you wonder why they are risking being so obvious. I am worried that maybe they are getting ready to have full control over upvoting/downvoting game by amassing an unprecedented army of accounts they control.</p>

As a liberal, I&#39;ve been reading <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, <a href="/r/Conservative">/r/Conservative</a> and <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> for the past few weeks because I want to get an idea of what you guys are saying. T_D has zero tolerance for dissenting opinions, so I thought I could post and engage users here. Unfortunately, some of you are just as allergic and intolerant to dissenting opinions as the people on T_D. I&#39;m not a shill, no matter how much that may blow your mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t call anyone out in particular.  I have no problem with other opinions and welcome any point of view so long as it&#39;s given with respect and honesty.  Plenty of people are just very attached to their biases as well, which is why lots of &quot;shills&quot; aren&#39;t paid or bots, and are just people sticking to their political guns, as most people do.</p>

<p>As to a general idea, &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t agree on a lot of things other than basic tenets of any conspiracy theorist, which is to question everything, follow the money, establish <em>cui bono</em> (who benefits), ignore or marginalize the false Left-Right paradigm, and to not take authority figures and mainstream media as truth.  Looking in hard-right / conservative subs to get a handle on r/conspiracy is pretty misleading since we come from every political aisle and walk of life; the meme that it&#39;s only conservatives or right-leaning people that believe in conspiracies is patently ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a hero, saving people from my mean opinion!  Unfortunately your lazy non-argument that I&#39;m not open to having my mind changed is false (you&#39;re just not smart <em>or</em> nuanced enough in your viewpoint to actually do it), fairly hypocritical (the only conspiracy posts I see are you bitching about Trump and TD) and your passive-aggressive blanket statement that I&#39;m part of the problem is just like, your (wrong) opinion man.</p>
