        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who are unaware, the elections are completely rigged.</p>

<p>&quot;We&quot; (not me, but certain elements within the &quot;conspiracy culture&quot;), were fooled into thinking </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hillary was the &quot;chosen one&quot; for 2016</p></li>
<li><p>Trump was a noble challenger on the side of the people</p></li>
<li><p>The establishment and media &quot;honestly&quot; feared trump and &quot;attacked&quot; him to block his presidential nod.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite their best efforts Our savior Trump defeated evil establishment Hillary and saved the day!</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What REALLY happened....</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>TPTB rigged both primaries so that Trump and Clinton won them, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Media attacked DT, to add credibility to his &quot;anti establishment&quot; appeal. They blessed him with TONS of free publicity, the spotlight, and attention, late night appearances, catapulting him to secure the nomination, all planned. His supporters loved him.</p></li>
<li><p>Knowing the &quot;conspiracy culture&quot; hates the MSM and Hillary, they &quot;tricked us&quot; with reverse psychology, leaving trump to win, stifling any hopes of a revolutionary change or skepticism of the system. The people think Trump is on their side.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Voters were essentially tricked. The social engineers were writing the script for This election for quite some time, and they got a desired result. </p>

<p>If TPTB were really afraid of trump, what would they have had the MSM do?</p>

<p><strong>IGNORE HIM!</strong>That&#39;s all it takes to destroy a candidates presidential bid, no media attention. Remember Ron Paul back in 2008/2012? He got that treatment, as did his son. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/waoLeSEihxM">https://youtu.be/waoLeSEihxM</a></p>

<p>But not Trump...That guy got the limelight 1000x more than any other candidate and that&#39;s how he won. His name was in the forefront of everyone&#39;s mind, every tv show, every opening monologue, ect. </p>

<p>There is a lot more to the 2016 election than meets the eye. The social engineers used this not only as a way to secure their puppet for 4 years, but create a racial/social tension within the U.S. That will slowly simmer and boil throughout Trump&#39;s presidency. Branding him a racist by the MSM may seem like they are not on his side, but think of the implications. The SJW&#39;s and liberals, radical groups like Black lives matter and the Latino demographic are up in arms against him. </p>

<p>But not just TRUMP they hate, it&#39;s his supporters! You see, this is all being designed to add to the &quot;stirring of the pot&quot; with the current racial/gender tension that is being devised by the social engineers and pushed by the MSM. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s spread awareness of this and foil their plan! We can come together and expose this elaborate ruse. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a Rothschild asset to begin with. </p>

<p>He was bailed out by &quot;Wilbur Ross&quot;, a Rothschild consigliere, back in 1990 with his failing Taj Mahal project.</p>

<p>When asked why he helped Donald, Wilbur said,</p>

<p>&quot;The trump name is still very much an asset to us&quot;</p>

<p>That very same Ross has a cabinet position in trumps administration, AND he&#39;s at the Bilderberg group right now as we speak as a confirmed listed attendee. </p>

<p>Also, he has a known Israeli henchmen in Jared Kushner in his ear.</p>

<p>Not to mention he just bent at the knee for the Royal Saudi family, just like Bush, Clinton, Obama before him.</p>

<p>We already bombed Syria, more drone attacks and excecutive orders, and his fucking cabinet is filled with Goldman Sachs members for fucks sake...</p>

<p>I mean dude at what point do you just kinda go,</p>

<p>&quot;Uhhh....ok maybe you&#39;re right, maybe he is a little corrupt?&quot; </p>

<p>At this point he has done many good things, illegal immigration down, ban on lobbyists, not invading Syria (despite the pressure a chemical false flag), pulling out of TPP and renegotiating other terrible trade deals (huge), pulling out of global government / Paris accord, investigation into election fraud, investigation into vaccine/pharma crimes, investigation Obama-era leakers, speaking out against psycho MSM, dealing with the swamp rats surrounding him as best he can.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to the 2016 election than meets the eye. The social engineers used this not only as a way to secure their puppet for 4 years, but create a racial/social tension within the U.S. That will slowly simmer and boil throughout Trump&#39;s presidency. Branding him a racist by the MSM may seem like they are not on his side, but think of the implications. The SJW&#39;s and liberals, radical groups like Black lives matter and the Latino demographic are up in arms against him. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This. The MSM specifically branded him racist and sexist to add fuel to that fire. The left is just steaming with tension. This isn&#39;t good, because we need to unite to overthrow these people, and they know this...</p>

<p>Makes me think Trump&#39;s whole PLATFORM was all written and scripted for him by social engineers. The whole &quot;Im gonna build a wall&quot; thing? Great way to create tension within the latino citizens of america. </p>

<p>The whole &quot;Grab her by the pussy&quot; thing? Trump was aware they were gonna release it, and they did it to pit the SJW/feminists against his supporters.</p>

<p>Feminists, SJW&#39;s,and liberals at large hate trump and his supporters. They are dividing us by design. This whole election was wayyyyyy deeper than we thought. We need to regroup, and figure out our next move. This needs to be mainstream news!</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Copied from my thread for visibility, that is being downvote brigaded currently...</strong></p>

<p>Be suspicious of anyone that not only defends Trump on this site, but actively attacks anyone critical of his administration.</p>

<p>I&#39;m OK with legit real people who honestly have a sliver of faith in the guy, if you&#39;re genuinely just unaware of his crony policies and crooked cabinet members.</p>

<p>However, if you are a member here, and CLAIM to be a conspiracy theorist, a critical thinker, CLAIM to have knowledge of how the New World Order operates, and how presidents are merely &quot;puppets&quot; selected and &quot;installed&quot; to do the bidding of the elite, than you have no business here and are essentially embarrassing the mission statement of the sub. I suspect most people still pushing DT on this sub are shills and controlled op.</p>

<p>The social engineers are trying to merge the conspiracy community with conservative/Trump love. If they can give the illusion we support the current president, Trump and the current government lose their BIGGEST BLOCK of critics and skeptics: Conspiracy Theorists. This is being done by design.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re new, and unaware, read the sidebar, do some research on the &quot;New World Order&quot;, and how they rig the electoral system.</p>

<p>The elections are rigged so that no matter WHO is elected (Dem/Rep), TPTB always win either way, because both nominees are bought, paid for, and agreed to the agenda in advance.</p>

<p>So, this little &quot;fantasy&quot; notion that Trump, a &quot;non-puppet&quot;, somehow &quot;saved the day&quot;, from evil Hillary, is a fucking FAIRY TALE.</p>

<p>Stop with the bullshit folks, let&#39;s wake the fuck up and unite under a single, unbiased and warranted skepticism of the current administration.</p>

<p>Brigaded? Have you seen anyone linking to your post and telling everyone to downvote it?</p>

<p>Simply having your post receive downvotes is not brigading. It&#39;s called being downvoted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I suspect that the quote above is at least part of why that post is being downvoted.</p>

<p>You insulted a lot of people in this community by telling them they have no business here and are an embarrassment to this sub, and you immediately jump to thinking there&#39;s some sort of organized effort to downvote your post?</p>

<p>If someone believes in any conspiracies, then they belong here. They&#39;re not an embarrassment for being in the correct sub </p>

<p>Nor do they have no business being here for not agreeing with your opinion that Trump is a puppet. There are plenty of people here who believe he&#39;s the first non-puppet in a very long time and they&#39;re cutting him some slack and giving him time to prove it.</p>

<p>Those people are perfectly capable of supporting him <em>and</em> believing/wanting to talk about other conspiracies. We welcome people who believe in reptilians, that we&#39;re living in a simulation, that parts of our history never existed, ancient aliens, Atlantis, whatever. Anyone who believes in any of those things while supporting Trump still belong here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I suspect most people still pushing DT on this sub are shills and controlled op.</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s somehow more likely to you than the fact a lot of Trump supporters have been into conspiracies for years or decades? Or that a lot of regular members of this community joined t_d when it was created and are active Trump supporters?</p>

<p>Exactly. Whereas, in the past both parties have denied conspiracies (except the approved ones of course), now they are using conspiracies as a political tool -- with Democrats taking the old denial position and Republicans <em>taking over</em> the conspiracy &quot;theorist&quot; community. Conspiracies are no longer for independents -- we are being forced into partisan camps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean, but I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a way that a trajectory can be set as specific as you&#39;re saying here, <em>especially</em> because of the presence of the internet. </p>

<p>The symbolism behind Hillary and Trump is why I was hoping at least Trump won, because he gives everyone a clear glimpse into what truly goes on behind closed doors. The &#39;left&#39; symbol gives the illusion that everything&#39;s being taken care of and there&#39;s very little corruption, but the &#39;right&#39; symbol leaves a lot of it out in the open. Just simply putting it out there to be seen gives us an advantage to publicly make the connections of how Trump isn&#39;t different from Obama when it comes to the elite. You do get a different social environment &#39;package&#39; with each candidate, but when you get to the root of it, whichever candidate wins doesn&#39;t matter to the elite at all, they&#39;re still getting their cake and eating it too regardless. But what&#39;s most dangerous about the left is how they can do such massive power and privacy grabs easily under the guise of &quot;it&#39;s good for you, we care about you, don&#39;t worry.&quot; With the &#39;right&#39; symbol, more people might be riled up a bit more to actually do something to buy us some time to get our ducks in a row and realize what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>The msm does control a lot of minds, but the internet adds an extra layer that they can&#39;t really predict very well at this present time, it hasn&#39;t been around long enough to be super accurate. Right now is the perfect time to foil their bullshit.</p>

<p>Was Trump associated with these people before he decided to run for office?  I guess that is what I am wondering. </p>

<p>It seems to me that Trump was clueless as to how it all works after he won the election.  It seems that Trump thought he was going to come into office and implement his own policies.

At some point, we can&#39;t just avoid it,  their control of necessities and institutions must be wrested from them peacefully or violently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and Trump&#39;s effect on the ordinary delegates and in the way he simply blew-off all the rest of the Republican wannabes at the Republican convention was completely unexpected as was the way he similarly stirred-up the countless thousands of ordinary people in the full to overflowing crowds at the biggest venues he could find across the country. </p>

<p>That was all genuine and totally unexpected too. Very much what we might call &quot;old-fashioned, old-school politicking&quot; out among the ordinary people at as many whistle-stops with steam-driven trains running through them the way it was ages ago only marginally adjusted for our times. Trump truly put an altogether remarkable amount of energy and dedication into that for a man his age and despite the number of gaffs and setbacks that anyone else would have thrown in the towel that only made him just that much more determined to push on all the harder.</p>

<p>Just because we have newer and more modern methods we&#39;ve become accustomed to doesn&#39;t mean that what we relied on long before that came to be not only worked but still very much can.</p>

<p>The people who voted for Trump were all sick and tired of the &quot;same-old-same-old&quot; and Trump was a bigger than life maverick with an un-politically correct, no holds barred, shoot from the lip, kind of attitude that even if they thought he was something of a buffoon, they were going to support him anyway as something of a symbolic gesture and a rejection of all that &quot;same-old-same-old&quot; political and election clap-trap they were sick and tired of listening to. </p>

<p>And of course none of them thought for a moment that he was ever going to win, but they didn&#39;t care, they&#39;d had enough and would see just how many others felt the same way as they did. As it turned out a whole lot actually did, enough to carry the day, both at the convention and in the final election.</p>

<p>Now the President has a certain amount of power but he&#39;s only one man in a huge bureaucracy that already exists and that is committed to all kinds of ongoing plans they&#39;ve been working on for years whether he likes them or not that he can&#39;t just simply pull the plug on without all kinds of untoward repercussions that would essentially negate whatever advantages he hoped to achieve. So there&#39;s a lot Trump wanted and thought he could do that is simply going to have to wait. </p>

<p>People need to understand that it&#39;s difficult enough to turn a ship around at the height of storm let alone re-paint it at the same time. Trump has all kinds of enemies within the Republican Party in addition to all the rest. He isn&#39;t &quot;one of them&quot; and yet he has to find a way to work with them and to get them to work with him to get anything done at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And of course none of them thought for a moment that he was ever going to win, but they didn&#39;t care, they&#39;d had enough and would see just how many others felt the same way as they did. As it turned out a whole lot actually did, enough to carry the day, both at the convention and in the final election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like a bunch of empty rallying here. You&#39;re still analyzing this election as if there were legitimately two different candidates, with two vastly different ideologies, seriously facing off, with the peoples vote deciding who wins...</p>

<p>That is an urban legend to us here. These elections are a facade. The entire process is so deeply scripted and dramatized, to get us, the masses, to participate.</p>

<p>You have to divorce yourself from the entire process, because deep down you realize the process is faked. </p>

<p>Making these elections <em>look</em> real is HUGELY important to TPTB, because we need to have the <em>illusion</em> of choice to be truly controllable. They need to make us believe this democracy bullshit is real, so they stage and script these things years in advance, and make sure everything is arranged. The debate committee only allows certain questions too, so nothing dirty or gritty is ever REALLY asked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump has a far bigger ego, a much shorter fuse, and no time to be nice to anyone that isn&#39;t nice to him than either Ron Paul or Bernie Sanders, neither of which were up to baiting, ambushing, and sucker-punching the daylights out of the mass media for not giving them a fair shake the way Trump managed to do. </p>

<p>And he gave them far more than just a black-eye and a kick in the shins for that. </p>

<p>I&#39;d have to say that the way Trump exposed the MSM and forced them in turn to expose themselves all the more was a massive and disasterous blow to those that have been relentlessly consolidating their control over all that mass media over the past two decades and as a result have now lost the kind of exclusive control that had given them over informing the public about just about anything and everything before they crashed into Trump and damaged their credibility beyond repair for at least half of the US and much of the world who won&#39;t ever forget that. </p>

<p>We now have the so called alternative media and even countless ordinary people not simply reacting to events but taking the initiative and digging up all kinds of facts on what&#39;s actually been going on that the MSM has deliberately tried to skirt, obfuscate or completely hide from everyone and that MSM is at a complete loss to know what to do about. Truth is, there isn&#39;t much that they can and more and more things are going to be revealed and unraveled that they thought they had safely buried.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you could possibly believe that was ever some &quot;desired effect&quot; or a &quot;worthwhile sacrifice&quot; by the so called brilliant &quot;puppet masters&quot; who you believe call all the shots. </p>

<p>My view of conspiracies doesn&#39;t see the conspiritors behind any of them as anything more than selfish and self-serving creatures who have no morals or scruples of any kind and no compunction about breaking any rules or laws when it comes to getting what they want. Shrewd, calculating, and devious, certainly but intelligent or sophisticated? Absolutely not. Like my handle they&#39;re prone to leaving for too many &quot;loose-ends&quot; for those of us that are inclined to follow and trace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry friend, I&#39;m not an American and don&#39;t live in the US. I&#39;m merely an outside observer that&#39;s always followed and taken an interest in US politics because it&#39;s practically impossible to not to for anyone living next door to it in Canada.</p>

<p>The mass media is and has always been a critical component in how everyone&#39;s politics plays-out and with the concentration of ownership in North America and beyond the control and influence it&#39;s had over the political narrative up until now, shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. We&#39;ve all been conned and strung-along for a very long time by that and on a wide range of events and information. When Trump told everyone that the system is rigged and that the mass media is the enemy of ordinary Americans most people thought it was an extreme and ridiculously over the top remark. If he hadn&#39;t won the election, they&#39;d still think that and still be just as blind about how corrupt the entire system is and just how deep it goes.</p>

<p>The media fix was in for Clinton, both during the primaries and throughout the Presidential election. In attempting to prevent either Sanders or Trump from having even the slightest chance at all to possibly upset that plan they simply threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at them and in the process finally gave themselves away. To top that off the leaked emails of Clinton, Podesta, and the DNC more or less proved it.</p>

<p>Now that was about as direct an indication as you are ever apt to get of just how corrupt Clinton herself is and just how corrupt and on the take virtually all that mass media happens to be, too. </p>

<p>Correct, they are not hidden. As a matter of fact, they have been getting extremely exposed lately. But there are those higher up that we know not their names.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, like any president that gets elected, is people that voted for him were extremely uninformed. Most people who, not even a year prior knew that all MSM was a mouthpiece for the establishment, immediately started swalling whatever any MSM source gave that agreed with their politics. Even now, Trump supporters know &quot;fake news&quot; and all the MSM being garbage, but listen to everything Fox says, since it&#39;s the red team channel.</p>

<p>Do you know what&#39;s the easiest litmus test about Trump? Look at how the media treated him. Gave him tons of air time. Doesn&#39;t matter if it was negative - any publicity is good publicity in show biz.</p>

<p>If you actually threaten the status quo, you get <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BR4F1nE.jpg">treated like a ghost. Just like Ron Paul.</a></p>

Then sit on that land and let it go up in value as a &quot;nature preserve&quot; which is really just a ditch with weeds in it(which supposedly absorbs CO2), while your buddies still pump millions of tons of poly-chlorinated waste into our rivers, but it&#39;s ok because you paid rent to some asshole in the form of carbon offsets so polluting is ok.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying, thus far, it looks like Trump is working on removing the dark state (or at least an evil portion of them.)</p>

<p>Time will tell, for all of us. Become involved, do your best and hope Universe does the same.</p>

<p>TBH, even if they take out Trump, movement is going in a new directions, so I&#39;m not so sure Trump is the head of this movement. Actually, Trump appears to have done his thing, the more time he is in, the better, but this doesn&#39;t depend on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, none of us know. But Trump (or rather his partners), probably have some pretty big stuff to hold above the dark states heads (e.g. those missing Hillary emails.)</p>

<p>Sure, they might be able to take Trump out, one way or another, but anything clearly illegal, is going to cause a release of those emails, civil war, etc. </p>

<p>At this point, taking Trump out is not really a solution imo. The Avalanche has started. And Trump might be a puppet (e.g. to Israel - my worry) but it looks like he is cleaning stuff up.</p>

<p>No, Trump obviously is being helped by let&#39;s call them white hats in the IC here.

<p>But this &quot;puppet&quot; is dissasembqling what was once the dark state (e.g. state dept firings by SOS).</p>

<p>To put Obama in the same sentence as Trump is a bit too much though. He was/is a CIA asset, created by them. Trump appears to being helped by white hats in dark state. Maybe not all our best interests in mind, but a notable change.</p>

<p>Want to know who is a servant for the &quot;deep state&quot;? Its the dudes that will cut every program but military. The military IS the deep state. The secret service IS the deep state. When you never condemn law enforcement, and only seek to increase their power,  YOU ARE THE DEEP STATE</p>

<p>Maybe...if my agenda is to wake people up to the charade of the phony 2016 election. </p>

<p>We got played. Hillary and Trump were both subservient to the elite, and they went with DT. Divide and conquer pal. I don&#39;t understand how what I&#39;m Posting hurts he sub or seems selfish? </p>

<p>You see the evidence? Wilbur Ross? The embarrassing Saudi sword dance? Kushner? GS cabinet? The guy is more of the same, and you think I have an agenda? </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense. This whole sub is about question TPTB. I refuse to believe my post is some agenda...I just wanna set the record straight. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump was cast into the role of the vulgar outsider willing to shake up the establishment in stark contrast to 17 other candidates. Many seemed to know that Donald Trump would have the advantage against a divided group, but the establishment refused to gather the others together to pick just a few candidates to provide some chance of blocking Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite: they paved the way for Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Democratic primary rigged:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the unlikely “democratic socialist” Bernie Sanders became a real threat to Hillary Clinton, the press went crazy with negative stories and opinions against Bernie Sanders. Democratic and Republican establishment outfits joined forces with the mainstream press in attempting to derail the Bernie Sanders campaign...</p>

<p>At the precise critical time when Bernie Sanders was taking his last shot to win enough delegates, tone of press coverage for Hillary Clinton went net positive while tone of coverage for Bernie Sanders went net negative — both for the first time in 2016. (SEE THE GRAPH!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With Hillary, they would have gotten business as usual. With Trump, they have the perfect &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tool, not to mention a faux-populist who won&#39;t actually do anything to harm the ruling class. Seems to me like they won either way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know if i am right, i am Dutch and just looking from a distance at the American system and try to figure it out.</p>

<p>I see Trump as a goldfisch thrown in a shark tank.</p>

<p>Trump thought he new all the rules and tricks that comes with doing buisness and he thought running the country was like playing the same game on a bigger level.
But seeing he is a selfmade man he was not aware to the &quot;evil plans&quot; and connections of the real PTB and he was left out of a lot of information.</p>

<p>Now he is finding out that the rules and even the entire game is very different as he tought and friends are turning into enemies without him knowing why.</p>

<p>The covernment is corrupt to the bone and is playing a whole different game with a whole new set of rules. And if you don&#39;t know the real game and the real rules you will fail in your work. This also explains why there are Buiderberger people in Trumps government, i think he did know of all the conections, he just did not know the more evil parts of them.
And i have a feeling that Trump, even now he is president, is not beeing told the (complete) truth and he is trusting on the wrong people or presented false information.</p>

<p>This is Trump now, struggeling to get a grip on the situation, trying to find out who and what to trust, trying to find the truth. And now he is learning the game, the rules and how to play and he is becomming aware the consequenses of it.</p>

<p>Quitting the Paris agreement is, to me, a huge move and is pointing in the direction that Trump still is fighting for the right cause. 
This might seem controversial and look likes i don&#39;t give a fu.k about our world, but is see the world in a whole different way as mainstrean everything promotes. 
In my world free clean energy should be availeble for everybody, but if you remove the oil the whole system of TPTB falls together, so you can&#39;t promote this in the current time, especially not when you are a president.</p>

<p>The Paris agreement cost a lot of money and, to me, it is not well spend and is keeping people from beeing independent.
Trump might know the secret of free energy also, the Trump family is linked to Nicola Tesla and i would not be surprised if they got his resurch.</p>

<p>But if the president would bring out this info too soon all hell will break loose, there for it might be better to play it like he does now and save a lot of money from useless articles now and bring on the real change later on.</p>

<p>Ah well, i might just see it all wrong and i am also being tricked into believing in Trump, but for now i still have a little bit of hope left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all a very obvious ploy.  These obvious tricks always seem to work on the vast majority...</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t all a sham, tho...  Hilldawg&#39;s blatant corruption, if it were to be tolerated and the people voted for her, we would see A Brave New World and we would go quietly into it.  With Trump, we would show that we have some fight in us and they would have to go with the longer, bloodier plan.  Essentially, we voted for 1984 rather than A Brave New World.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I supported Trump, because at least we would have a chance to fight again...</p>

<p>We still have fight in us, and we still have hope that Trump will become a rogue asset.  </p>
