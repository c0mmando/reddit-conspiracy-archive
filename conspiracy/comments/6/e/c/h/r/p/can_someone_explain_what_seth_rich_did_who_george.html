       I am so interested.. really.. but all these posts are TL:DR and no one seems to really have the same answers as anyone else. So i just wanna know facts. All i know is Seth Rich was murdered, and someone is "investigating " it and this George Webb guy apparently figured it out, but people dont trust him.. so idk. Why was Seth Rich important?

       Seth Rich was a DNC data analyst who found some dirty dealings within the campaign. He sought to get the word out about this corruption by contacting wikileaks who then released the emails. Seth was subsequently murdered, while the DNC tried to spin the release of emails as a Russian hacking. There's no investigation into Seth's murder, so we don't know for sure he did it, but it seems pretty obvious that the DNC had him offed for leaking. George Webb seems to have found out who killed him, but again we don't know for sure. But again, it's all pretty obvious what has happened and that the DNC is scrambling to cover their asses.

       I think that about sums it up.

       Setting aside the mountain of unverified claims you just laid out there, let's tackle this point head on:
      </p>
      <p>
       There 100% is an ongoing investigation into
Seth's murder, and there has been one even before the topic started trending on T_D and this sub.

       Alright well there you have it, I was wrong. No one else was stepping up to comment so I did. I tried to sum it all up to the best of my knowledge, but it seems I don't even have the full picture yet. I'm eager for the truth to break out however.

       I have laid those out in a separate post below conveniently enough for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the results of the investigation obviously not all of that information is known. We only have a few bits that were provided, but typically Law Enforcement will intentionally not release much information on ongoing investigations.

       Except all other standard robberies usually post pictures of the suspects on the evening news and tell users to call in with tips. That did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       happen, despite the plethora of cameras available in the neighborhood. Nor has the conversation Seth Rich had with the cops (3 of whom wore body cameras) been released or known.

       Yes the US Attorney’s office for the District of Columbia is currently investigating the Seth Rich case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steven Wasserman, is the Assistant US Attorney for DC.. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's brother.  (Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s of course was the Head of the DNC when Seth Rich was murdered).  So, you can be sure that investigation will be impartial.

       There was a shift change. Do not feed the animals. Down vote them and move on. Earlier today is was goddess something with this bullshit. An in a few hours it will be back an this one will be gone. IMO if we down vote and do not make eye contact they will just be talking to themselves.  (like the homeless most people ignore)

       You're trying to ostracize the people who care that the discussions we have are using sourced information, or when something is speculation that it is labeled as such, not stated to be fact and then for the hive mind to down vote anyone who asks for the source or corrects a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've used this sub for years, and all of a sudden i'm being downvoted by people like you because i don't see the benefit in a circlejerk of half truths and you're acting like it's my job to do this sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Why are you and your buddies so intent on never discussing the facts, or acting like facts are oppressive and stop free thinking for things that benefit you? There's an actual conspiracy going on here that half this sub is ignoring, and it's that people who are likely to be critical thinkers have suddenly stopped employing it at all and are now targeting those that do in an attempt to make any discussion here entirely pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has convinced half this sub that they need to verify EVERYTHING anti-trump and never question anything pro-trump and why are you guys doing it with such fervor? Do you even know you're doing it?

       I think he was implying it was some fella associated with the Awan bros. You can go watch George's videos to confirm for yourself. I'm not sure so I don't want to spread too much disinfo by being wrong.

       An investigator supposedly made the claim that Rich had been dealing with Wikileaks. I believe he later retracted this claim at least to some extent. Shortly after, KimDotcom claimed to have evidence that Rich was the leaker.

       The unbiased series of events is Seth was murdered on his way home one night. He was shit two times in the back, and did not die right away, instead he lasted some time in the hospital before passing on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police determined that it was likely a botched robbery based on a torn wrist strap to Seth's watch and a string of robberies in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the timing of Seth's murder some people have theorized that he was the DNC leaker, however that has yet to be verified with clear evidence and all of the "evidence" currently available is circumstantial. Things working against this theory are several fake pieces of evidence that have been pushed forward and later debunked, and much of the narrative coming from 4chan anons.

       DNC and Podesta emails revealing the shady dealings of the Democratic party were leaked or hacked and were published by wikileaks. The democrats wanted to shift the focus from the content of the emails to where they came from, accusing Russia. The Seth Rich story brings back the focus away from Russia.

       You're trying to ostracize the people who care that the discussions we have are using sourced information, or when something is speculation that it is labeled as such, not stated to be fact and then for the hive mind to down vote anyone who asks for the source or corrects a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've used this sub for years, and all of a sudden i'm being downvoted by people like you because i don't see the benefit in a circlejerk of half truths and you're acting like it's my job to do this sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Why are you and your buddies so intent on never discussing the facts, or acting like facts are oppressive and stop free thinking for things that benefit you? There's an actual conspiracy going on here that half this sub is ignoring, and it's that people who are likely to be critical thinkers have suddenly stopped employing it at all and are now targeting those that do in an attempt to make any discussion here entirely pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has convinced half this sub that they need to verify EVERYTHING anti-trump and never question anything pro-trump and why are you guys doing it with such fervor? Do you even know you're doing it?
