<p>Thought-terminating cliché</p>

<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>

<p>A thought-terminating cliché is a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to propagate cognitive dissonance (discomfort experienced when one simultaneously holds two or more conflicting cognitions, e.g. ideas, beliefs, values or emotional reactions). Though the phrase in and of itself may be valid in certain contexts, its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating.</p>

<p>The term was popularized by Robert Jay Lifton in his 1956 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism. Lifton said, “The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché. The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis.” [1][2]</p>

<p>In George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the fictional constructed language Newspeak is designed to reduce language entirely to a set of thought-terminating clichés. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World society uses thought-terminating clichés in a more conventional manner, most notably in regard to the drug soma as well as modified versions 
of real-life platitudes, such as, “A doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away.”</p>

<p><strong>Non-political examples</strong></p>

<p>“Everything happens for a reason.”</p>

<p>“Don&#39;t judge.”</p>

<p>“Why? Because I said so.” (Bare assertion fallacy)</p>

<p>“I’m the parent, that’s why.” (Appeal to authority).</p>

<p>“When you get to be my age you’ll find that’s not true.”</p>

<p>“You don’t always get what you want.”</p>

<p>“You win some, you lose some.”</p>

<p>“Ah well, swings and roundabouts.”</p>

<p>“Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.” (Appeal to ridicule if said sarcastically)</p>

<p>“It works in theory, but not in practice.” (Base rate fallacy)</p>

<p>“It&#39;s just common sense.”</p>

<p>“It makes sense to me, and that&#39;s all that matters.”</p>

<p>“To each his own.”</p>

<p>“Life is unfair.”</p>

<p>“Such is life.”</p>

<p>“We already had this conversation.”</p>

<p>“It is what it is.”</p>

<p>“It was his time.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.”</p>

<p>“There you go again.”</p>

<p>“It&#39;s not worth discussing.”</p>

<p>“Whatever will be, will be.”</p>

<p>“Be a man and…”</p>

<p>“Who cares?”</p>

<p>“It&#39;s a matter of opinion!”</p>

<p>“You only live once.” (YOLO)</p>

<p>“Just forget it.”</p>

<p>“We will have to agree to disagree.”</p>

<p>“We all have to do things we don&#39;t like.”</p>

<p>“You are not being a &#39;team player&#39;.” (Ignoratio elenchi)</p>

<p>“That&#39;s just wrong.”</p>

<p>“You just don’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Just do it.”</p>

<p>“Link or it didn&#39;t happen.”</p>

<p>“Don&#39;t be that guy.”</p>

<p>“Because that is our policy.”</p>

<p>“Don&#39;t be silly.”</p>

<p>“There&#39;s no smoke without fire.” (used to convince others that a person is guilty based on accusation or hearsay and to 
discourage further examination of evidence)</p>

<p>“I&#39;m just sayin&#39;.”</p>

<p>“So it goes.”</p>

<p>“Me thinks thou dost protest too much.” or “The more you argue, the less we believe you.”</p>

<p>&quot;Rules are rules.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who do you think you are?&quot;/&quot;Who are you to...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s all relative.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People are going to do what they want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s just your feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>“Can&#39;t everybody just drop it and get along?” (used as an attempt to stop an ongoing debate or argument)</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s the way of the road.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Political examples</strong></p>

<p>Thought-terminating clichés are sometimes used during political discourse to enhance appeal or to shut down debate. In this setting, their usage can usually be classified as a logical fallacy.[citation needed]</p>

<p><strong>Religious examples</strong></p>

<p>Thought-terminating clichés are also present in religious discourse in order to define a clear border between good and evil, holiness and sacrilege, and other polar opposites.[citation needed] These are especially present in religious literature.[citation needed]</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.&quot; Job 1:21</p>

<p>&quot;Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!&quot; (opposing same-sex marriage)</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s not Biblical.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God moves/works in mysterious ways.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God never gives you more suffering than you can bear.”</p>

<p>&quot;Only God can judge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God has a plan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Lord works in mysterious ways.&quot;</p>

<p>The religious or semi-religious ideas of cults, heretics, and infidels are also often used as thought-terminating clichés, e.g. &quot;Do not listen to him, he is an infidel,&quot; (a guilt by association fallacy) or &quot;That line of thought sounds like a cult&quot; (also a guilt by association fallacy).</p>

<p><strong>As an autological phrase</strong></p>

<p>The statement &quot;that is a thought-terminating cliché&quot; can itself function as a thought-terminating cliché. Once the stator has identified a first statement as a thought-terminating cliché, they may feel absolved of needing to determine whether that first statement is indeed a thought-terminating cliché, or provides useful insight, in the context under discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccine Cult Examples</strong></p>

<p>&quot;vaccines work&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;vaccines are safe and effective&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;vaccines save lives&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;got polio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;got small pox?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;just vaccinate your god damn kids&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;omg measles!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;at least my autistic kid is still alive&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;not going to waste my time&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really have no interest&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not even gonna bother reading this drivel&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;vaccinations that save billions of lives&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have fun with your middle school level education&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;minor injection site reactions like redness and swelling&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not have the energy to deal with your specific brand of fallacy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a conspiracy, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a toxic one that I don&#39;t want nor do I need to hear about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Occams Razor&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re obviously stupid beyond hope. We&#39;re done here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Watched half. Clearly an anti-vax research hack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t waste your time like I did mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And... this is where I stopped reading. This is just too hilarious to continue&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;you&#39;re not worth my time&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;at least the mom in your video still has her son&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t really care about this&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t understand medicine, you don&#39;t understand medicine. They do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#39;re wasting your time and efforts worrying about this&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve already been through that&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Responding to me anymore is a waste of time&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like something you just made up&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now I&#39;m turning off notifications because your lack of competence is disturbing&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rofl. Do whatever you want, buddy&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am just tired of talking to you&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are ao fucking stupid, its sad&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;he&#39;s a known quack. I literally do not care what he has to say. He is batshit insane&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m tired of your shit, to be honest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s clear you don&#39;t understand biology or vaccines&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s so infuriating and obviously makes no sense&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;don&#39;t want to waste their time arguing with a conspiracy theorist&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;how can we be sure you didn&#39;t just fabricate that graphic on your own computer?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this material.  I wonder where it came from, I work a lot with General Semantics school, and they have several language extensions that moddify language. A lot of these thought-terminating cliches as they appear here, can get translated to E-prime (English w/o verb &#39;to be&#39;), which either exposes how they lack profundity, or clears up the intent.  In the current state, they strongly resemble, &#39;transactionally invalid&#39; statements.  I hesitate to go into an explanation there, but it just means they come across, kind of empty. I also think this falls into the category of communication barrier via &#39;avoiding the other&#39;s concerns&#39;. Having this comprehensive assortment seems handy, and thanks <a href="/r/consipracy">/r/consipracy</a> for all you do!    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. </p>

<p>The idea of newspeak is to reduce our exchanges to proscribed narrow lanes of thought and interaction. If you&#39;re musing too long on why something is specfically unjust, unethical, impractical, incorrect, you might stray too far into critical thinking, people might follow you there, and the ruse is threatened. Newspeak was a critical and ever-present component of Ingsoc life; if it failed, the system would eventually be overturned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vaccine related ones make discussing that topic so difficult. &quot;Vaccines save billions of lives.&quot; How the hell does one argue against that? You have to walk the person through 60 years of vaccine history as viewed from the perspective of a skeptic. It&#39;s not very likely that they would entertain the explanation. They would probably just continue using thought terminating cliches to tell themselves it&#39;s okay to listen to you but they don&#39;t have to agree with anything you say (even if it&#39;s a statement they otherwise would agree with). They&#39;ll probably go with something related to catastrophizing a made up scenario where you and anyone near you automatically contracts measles and polio. On a side note, wouldn&#39;t modern medicine make it easier to contract the diseases, survive them, and end up with a natural lifelong immunity? Kind of like what most people already do with chicken pox. They deliberately infect their kid and then give them medicine until they get over it. Maybe measles and polio are more debilitating than chicken pox, but of course that shouldn&#39;t automatically make it ethical to legally mandate that everyone be vaccinated.</p>

<p>indeed! and science cult victims are about the most aggressive, evangelical, egotistical, arrogant morons you could ever meet </p>

<p>they seem like normal people, until you rock their boat with some inconvenient truth, such as</p>

<p>&quot;no man has ever walked on the moon&quot;</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>&quot;vaccines are not as safe as advertised&quot;</p>

<p>and watch them go ballistic. I&#39;ve been puzzled by this behavior from some time, and have been trying to understand how these people &quot;think&quot;, as as far as i can guess, &quot;science&quot; has occupied the space in their brain that used to be reserved for religion, and so to criticize science is to criticize their religion... which is ironic because the whole premise of science is to constantly observe and question current thinking </p>

<p>its amazing how often you see someone claim that &quot;there is no debate&quot; or &quot;the science is settled&quot; when it comes to vaccines, and they feel so strongly about it that they not only do not want to talk about it, they don&#39;t want you to talk about it to anyone else either. </p>

<p>watch all 3 short videos, and ask yourself if you would take medical advice from the man in the 3rd video </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, lets follow up on this, and amend the list to include more political examples. </p>

<p>when i did the vaccine examples, i actually copy-paste real examples that came up after i started the list, instead of going back through old replies and/or paraphrasing what i think they might have said </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s important to be aware of thought-killing cliches. We&#39;re all guilty of using them. They&#39;re basically heuristics for not being willing or able to address an argument on its merits.  </p>

<p>However, I think your list is far too broad and includes non-cliches that actually do address the argument--or at least move the conversation forward. For example, &quot;sounds like something you just made up&quot; may very well be an appropriate response to something that sounds, well, er, like it was just made up. Similarly, &quot;correlation does not equal causation&quot; is true, though I do agree that it&#39;s often used by people who don&#39;t really understand what it means in order to stop an argument. Finally, &quot;how can we be sure you didn&#39;t just fabricate that graphic on your own computer?&quot; is especially prescient as an argument in this sub since many of the graphics presented as evidence are, in fact, just images fabricated on a computer and then shared on 4chan and presented as truth.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thought-terminating clichés, also known as thought-stoppers, are words or phrases that discourage critical thought and meaningful discussion about a given topic. They are typically short, generic truisms that offer seemingly simple answers to complex questions or that distract attention away from other lines of thought. They are often sayings that have been embedded in a culture&#39;s folk wisdom and are tempting to say because they often sound true or good or like the right thing to say. Some examples are: &quot;Stop thinking so much&quot;, &quot;here we go again&quot;, and &quot;what effect do my actions have?&quot;</p>

<p>The term was popularized by psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton in his 1961 book, Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of &quot;Brainwashing&quot; in China. Lifton wrote, <strong>&quot;The language of the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliché.</strong> The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis&quot;. Sometimes they are used in a deliberate attempt to shut down debate, manipulate others to think a certain way, or dismiss dissent. However, some people repeat them, even to themselves, out of habit, conditioning or as a defense mechanism.</p>

<p>i try to look at all of the available evidence, if i am interested in a topic. i want to hear the criticisms. i want the back and forth debate. </p>

<p>i am usually most intrigued when i become aware of a dissenting opinion on something i thought was &quot;settled&quot;. there was a time in my life when i didn&#39;t explicitly question the moon landing, and took it for what i was told. i only became interested in digging deeper after i was told by 3 different people that i finally looked into it </p>

<p>when i clicked the link to read the blog below, i thought i was pretty smart and that i would &quot;debunk&quot; whatever was written...</p>

<p>an idiot for believing they were true. </p>

<p>once i was shown how to look at these staged photographs, i never saw them the same again.  they are so clearly staged and fake now that i know how to see. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that there are thousands of people who spoke of their involvement in the moon landing but how many have spoken about they being involved in faking the landing?</p>

<p>i think people assume that everyone else is just like them, </p>

<p>in the sense that if i know i can&#39;t keep a secret, therefore i assume nobody else can keep a secret either </p>

<p>The government killed an astronaut called NASA a lemon so they killed him but someone else who supposedly proved that they have been lying about its most important event and they didn&#39;t kill him. Makes sense. </p>
