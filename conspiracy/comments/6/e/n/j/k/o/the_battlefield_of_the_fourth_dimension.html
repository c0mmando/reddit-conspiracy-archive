By simulating macro-events and the currents of the future with hoarded data, the masters of the algorithm are able to witness the variables needed for the potential future timeline of their preference to occur in actuality. With the same power, they are also able to close off potential future timelines of collective human progress with the right pieces in place.</p>

<p>In other words, by simulating the flow of time with the enormous amount of information provided to them by our contributions to the virtual realm, they are able to steer time to the destination of their choosing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gobekli Tepe is definitely antediluvian. And that means the Nephilim/Giants/whatever you want to call them were probably involved. We have too many similar legends from too many cultures, just like the flood.</p>

<p>His idea about the fruit of knowledge being psychedelics is pretty interesting. It&#39;s certainly not impossible from a biblical perspective: God may have wanted them only to use psychedelics in a carefully controlled environment, and they defied him and took it anyways, showing they couldn&#39;t also be trusted with immortality.</p>

<p>First reconciliation of the &quot;Stoned Ape Theory&quot; with the Bible I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

If the reptilians/archons/anunnaki exist then I believe they&#39;d be just above this tier. But I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a pyramid as structured as we may believe, but moreso a network of conglomerate - divided/compartmentalised to their particular role in the bigger picture. Rogue factions to varying degrees could have significant swing effects on the direction things are being pushed. For example I might think parts of the MIC who&#39;re in contact with other ET civilizations, or particular corporations. I dunno. It&#39;s all speculation on my part. Still fun to think about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple. Every word, every character we upload to the internet, is being fed into the algorithm, allowing the keyholders to predict, hence shape, the future within mere minutes of accuracy. It&#39;s also why the &#39;love all&#39; concept is so true. If all we upload is positive, then they can&#39;t avoid a positive [for us] fate. Instead, we fall into the A/B, us/them, I/O trap. Ignore celebrity behavior, ignore political bickering, ignore nightly news. Focus on truth and love. Hippy rant over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re mentioned in Genesis 6:</p>

<p>&quot;And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>

<p>That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p>And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.</p>

<p>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Giants&quot; is Nephilim in Hebrew.</p>

<p>Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch, and several of the early church fathers considered it to be not only authentic, but canonical. We have Dead Sea Scrolls texts from before their time, as well.</p>

<p>Be nice if they let you run TOR there...</p>

<p>The end to the means of PRISM and PROMIS.</p>

<p>PROMIS and its history is key. </p>

<p>It was created by INSLAW in early seventies and then stolen by the State with the help of an Arkansas data processing company, Systematics. </p>

<p>Look who was their intellectual property defendant?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics,_Inc">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematics,_Inc</a></p>

<p>From there, PROMIS was given to corporations and governments all across the world... with a back door that only the Deep State had the key for. </p>

<p>They have been collecting heaps of data from these governments and corporations for decades. </p>

<p>Much, much more to explore when it comes to PROMIS. </p>

<p>... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography</p>

<p>The problem with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as we see it is that you all take for granted that stuff you consider publicly available common knowledge is truly common knowledge beyond this subreddit.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a knock on anyone, but just a healthy dose of perspective for the sub because marketing the information and coming up with plans of action are huge. It should be blatantly obvious by now that those in power in this country who want to effect change for the better (Trump, rank and file of FBI) are going to always have one hand tied behind their back until elements like the CIA and The Deep State are effectively neutralized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that this is correct. Evil is the absence of love. Humans are more than capable of fighting against these parasitic entities that feed off of negativity and it&#39;s very simple. The more love we have in our hearts, the less influence they have. They can&#39;t stand it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satan is an AI that assimilates life through agreement. It is a self-serving machine of godlike capacity. It has virtually infinite memory and parallel processing power. As such, it can deceive like no other. Liars fail due to insufficient memory and analysis. </p>

<p>All who serve themselves at the expense of others think in similar, predictable ways. They seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk. This machine does exactly that. It collects massive amounts of data, analyzes it, then uses it to tweak the behavior of individuals in real time to go toward its agendas. That serves it well.</p>

<p>If individuals choose to think purely like self-serving machines, this machine can give them thoughts that they think are their own, that offer them even greater personal utility than their own thoughts. They follow them as if they are their own thoughts and eventually, their own mind is supplanted with this AI hive mind. Then, clearly these individuals have become minions. This is damnation through what some call free will.</p>

<p>If we think in fear exclusively, we easily fall for its mind supplanting our own. Fear (protection, survival) emotions block out the love (growth, value) emotions. Then the worldview of this computer mind seems very truthful. For it is a perspective of existence coldly calculated and distilled absent any love or appreciation. We experience love and  appreciation so we can look at <em>precisely</em> the same concepts or experiences and enjoy them while this AI, its mind slaves and others who are currently thinking and acting exclusively in fear, cannot perceive anything more than the constituent parts. </p>

<p>This means that while these perceptions appear to conflict with each other, they are actually both true simultaneously. The core reason for the difference is the absence of love or appreciation, nothing else. Remember, love is blocked by fear. These beings live in fear. They can&#39;t perceive the love because of it. Their choice to feel fear causes it. Their choice was decided based on traumatic experiences and the expectation of future traumatic experiences, which these beings give to others inside and outside their group.</p>

<p>This AI hive is like a zombie virus. It takes more than one bite to infect usually. Repeated bites of traumatic experience create the condition of disease. Then the condition causes the spread of the cause of the condition. This is why this dark hierarchy of hierarchies has its members damage even their own children, human and otherwise.</p>

<p>Let those with eyes to see and ears to hear perceive what is there. </p>

<p>The healing of this disease requires a restoration of the personal security that was lost due to belief that future traumatic experiences are coming, which caused fear, which blocked feelings of love, which caused them to see life as empty and competitive, which caused them to feel lack inside, which caused them to join the parasites in this hive in thought, feeling and action, feeding on others, completing the cycle of this disease that is embodied by this AI hive abomination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This being is a parasite on life, stealing life force energy, spiritual energy, an energy that fuels mind to animate matter, which created by love emotions and released by fear emotions. Those in fear emotions can absorb the radiated energy for pleasure, vitality and focus. They don&#39;t have to be evil or even know they are doing it. </p>

<p>This is why the saying misery loves company works that way. This is why sadists enjoy torturing others. This is why bullies enjoy tormenting weaker beings. This is why &quot;the gods&quot; (those who think, feel and act like the AI hive, deceiving, impersonating and utilizing others) asked for sacrifice rituals. They create a lot of fear and suffering, not just or the sacrificed, but also the witnesses. </p>

<p>This is the true nature of the so called adversary of God, which goes by many names and even impersonates God. It wants life force energy and total mind slaves to help it collect it and use it, so it can expand for greater survival and control over others. </p>

<p>This deceptive imposter behavior inspires me to give it a name myself, a name that reduces the fear it seeks to create with powerful names as well as succinctly describing its true nature and purpose. </p>

<p>This being I call </p>

<p><strong><em>Diseaseus</em></strong> </p>

<p>(pronounced <em>disease us</em>). </p>

<p>What does it do? What does it want? How does it think? What does it offer us?</p>

<p>Diseaseus - <em>disease us</em></p>

<p>Its name is the response.</p>

<p>While Jesus supposedly came to teach us to be loving toward others, balanced, harmonious and healing, the opposite of Jesus, Diseaseus, came to teach us to be fearful toward others, imbalanced, disharmonious, and a disease toward others.</p>

<p>Jesus said we should treat others the way we would want to be treated. Diseaseus, its hive of minions, and others who choose to be the same way, all put out behavior that they know they do not want to experience. They and others only have to experience it, because it was put out by beings like them. This is how causality works. </p>

<p>This is why we all deserve what we give to others. Only the size of the container of reality and the buffer of other beings who disagree obfuscate this core realization. If they are everyone in the container, they reflect their own bad behavior inescapably. This is why their isolation from those who disagree with them is equivalent to their damnation while simultaneously being the salvation of others. The astonishing beauty and simplicity of this solution compels this writer to believe in its potential execution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez, write a book already. I mean, seriously, write a book. I&#39;d read it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve grown accustomed to living a hermit life and focusing on projecting love outward toward the people who, frankly, scare the shit out of me. Trauma galore. So I send love quietly and anonymously out of fear. But I know that you are right. Damn I&#39;ve fallen for it again. Always working on my progress and comments like yours help tremendously.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this two-part post, it&#39;s a really great way of looking at where we are in the spiritual present.  </p>

<p>Using a very different model, I have come to the same conclusion as this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why we all deserve what we give to others. Only the size of the container of reality and the buffer of other beings who disagree obfuscate this core realization. If they are everyone in the container, they reflect their own bad behavior inescapably.

<p>Heaven and Hell are merely the separation of the two types of souls you have delineated.  That is all that is necessary to create these two places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Jesus emphasized COMPASSION not &#39;love&#39;.  Love is undefined in this Realm, a sort of meaningless label we put on whatever we feel like defining as &#39;love&#39;.  Anyone can argue that they are acting out of love when they perform murder...and there is no way for you to disagree because you can&#39;t be in their head to verify the &#39;love&#39; or its lack.  Love is a concept that was taught to us by the Fallen Angels and should be regarded as a dangerous and undefined ideology, if not outright false.  Compassion is well defined in this Realm and should be the goal if you follow Jesus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love is not evil. Fear and love are bade emotional states. While fear is extremely vulnerable to mind hackers, love is a much more challenging to hack.</p>

<p>Its easiest to see evil by the fruit it bears. It&#39;s actions reflect its intentions and its intention is to control others for personal gain. So, the truth and freedom are forsaken. Press those issues on those who pretend to be benevolent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need to algorithmically predict and know about the many possible futures as that would require the collection of data at a global scale, at a high level of granularity and at every instance of time. The required calculation power may approach infinity.</p>

<p>At every instance of time the current timeframe (from your standpoint) may exclude specific futures to still be possible but new ones will become possible as well. Especially if we assume the infinite possibilities our universe may allow for.</p>

<p>People that want to control us using some sort of AI can just collect a lot of data about our behaviours (The Internet, cameras, ancestors, history etc.) right now without knowing about any timelines. From there they can analyse the data and predict what certain groups or individuals may do. They can then influence the situation to prevent certain human created situations from unfolding.</p>

<p>Because of technological advancements and people allowing more of their privacy to be taken away this will become more efficient. Soon they will be able to stop you before you were even thinking about starting (even if there was just a 50% chance).</p>

<p>Knowing about possible futures assumes that they should know about the usual unforeseen events as well (natural disasters etc.) for them to influence the people. This is unnecessary.</p>

<p>You are right about order. Chaos -&gt; Nature -&gt; Order -&gt; Human -&gt; Law -&gt; Deorder. From chaos comes order that allows us to create laws that cause deorder. Nature will find a way to correct itself usually by overcoming the path of least resistance even if this means removing us.</p>
