    <div class="md"><p>So you think the world&#39;s biggest polluter - China - is going to lead the way to environmental responsibility?? </p>

<p>What kind of gibberish is this?</p>

<p>Clearly you have never been to China. Because if you had, you would have never put up such a stupid thread.</p>

<p>P.S. I have been to China. It&#39;s a shithole of environmental catastrophe completely out of your realm of understanding. Wake the fuck up, pay attention, and stop mumbling talking points about &quot;academia&quot; and take a walk on the wild side - get out in the world and actually look around.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fking laughable. The country is an environmental catastrophic disaster. It&#39;s <em>horrible.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  I  lived in China from 2009 to 2011.  Before that I had been traveling periodically since 2005.  The air quality from 2005 to now (I still travel there frequently) is beyond toxic levels.  And let&#39;s be clear, China during times when foreign visitors are expected (The Olympics for example) all industrial areas were on a strict no production status to keep the air as clean as possible.  If there is a time where it is low it is only a dog and pony show.  The largest source of heat in the winter is Coal which they use to provide &quot;steam&quot; heat to most areas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paris agreement fucking sucks, not sure why everyone is losing their goddamned minds</p>

<p>Educate yourselves, it&#39;s non binding, none of the developed countries are paying the 100bn everyone agreed to pay to help developing countries with infrastructure, it relies on the market creating technology that doesn&#39;t exist yet, and it&#39;s goals are unreachable without a HUGE overhaul of our infrastructure. We&#39;d pretty much have to drop our emissions (everyone, not just the US) to 0 by yesterday to meet it. Bye bye agriculture industry. India is part of this agreement. They plan on upping their emissions from now through 2030, and since it&#39;s non binding, who&#39;s gonna punish them?</p>
