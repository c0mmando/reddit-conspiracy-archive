I started watching Alex Jones recently and saw people keep bringing up his Sandy Hook conspiracies. I eventually cane across a video with an insane amount of views and a huge like/dislike ratio called &quot;We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook.&quot;</p>

<p>This video is well made. So like anything I look at a counter idea of it to see if I went wrong.</p>

<p>Not 1 debunking video. The only ones just say &quot;that person isn&#39;t reliable who did that segment&quot; without examining the segment. Is that the truth of Sandy Hook? Is there a video somehow debunking these points? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to think Sandy Hook is fake because it is a horrible tragedy that shouldn&#39;t have happened. Dead children is no laughing matter , but maybe it didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>There does seem to be piles of evidence that point to the whole thing being carried out by Crisis Actors and totally faked.</p>

<p>If the kids really did die , I think a team of Agents handled it because the ammunition that has been described as found on the scene doesn&#39;t match with the guns the &quot;deranged gunman&quot; was carrying. It matches a weapon left in his car.</p>

<p>Shady situation that Sandy Hook....</p>

<p>I suppose I also agree with you. Not everything had to be faked, but the overal event &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; is bullshit. Like people pointed out, there parents/corroner/... are acting, and really bad at that. (And they know, which I why I assume they&#39;re all so stressed)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an upvote just cuz, though you shouldn&#39;t give 2 fucks about this upvote/downvote system. That&#39;s like pretending Reddit <em>isn&#39;t</em> compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really understand how you can say you question everything but refuse to question Sandy Hook, which is one of the most bogus hoaxes to ever occur in the history of the world. There is a good reason that so many people say Sandy Hook was a hoax- they were sloppy in so many ways and it is obvious to anyone who has researched it for an hour or two that Sandy Hook was 100% a hoax. Nothing about it makes sense in terms of normal emergency protocol which is supposed to be followed when a school shooting. Simple things like not leaving the victims bodies in the building overnight instead of bringing them to the hospital- that sort of stuff. I will mention a few things and leave you with a couple links to check out. First of all, watch this- 34 questions about Sandy Hook that need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aUH4yBdFn1w">https://youtu.be/aUH4yBdFn1w</a></p>

<p>Wolfgang Halbig, who is a former state trooper, school principal, and school safety expert, is leading the case against the Sandy Hook hoaxers- search for videos with him. </p>

<p>They used crisis actor David Wheeler in two roles- one as a grieving parent and one as a swat team guy who doesn&#39;t know how to hold his weapon. I believe &quot;a call for an uprising&quot; YouTube channel made some good videos about this. </p>

<p>Another great documentary is Sandy Hook Line and Sinker. Only 45 minutes and more recent than we need to talk about Sandy Hook. </p>

<p>The school hadn&#39;t even been operational for several years before the event- it had asbestos and no internet traffic to the schools website for years. Speaking of the internet, there were donation pages set up for the victims of Sandy Hook before the hoax even happened. Follow the money. Newtown, CT got a $50 million dollar elementary school after the Sandy Hook hoax. Many residents got free houses on Christmas Day of that year. And none of the parents of the 20 children who allegedly died live in that town anymore- they all moved fairly quickly.</p>

<p>There is another video called &quot;the life of Adam&quot; which you can watch in which they find that Adam Lanza is actually just a fictional character made up for this event. As the story goes he was a 112 pound man who was able to carry the weight of several weapons which would be troublesome even to trained men who are twice that size and to kill 100% of the people like they said he did would mean that he did is simply unbelievable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Halbig is in an ongoing trail against Leonard Pozner. I believe he&#39;s fighting the good fight, because I firmly believe that it was a hoax. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s gotten donations from people pushing for the truth- I&#39;d donate to him if I had extra money to spare. Because this kind of crap should be exposed. Regarding the $100,000 figure, the alleged parents of the children who allegedly died got millions. The town&#39;s school system and police department got millions. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Newtown, CT was an outright CIA fantasy town.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a &quot;continuous loop&quot; because a hoaxer edited the clip that way.Aerial footage is after shooting was finished.Most were dead INSIDE a building,they havent invented X Ray tv cameras yet.
IF youre so sure its a hoax lets see one corroborated fact of evidence.I bet you can&#39;t</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for what it&#39;s worth, I didn&#39;t downvote, I don&#39;t give enough shits to care about e-points and e-karma and whatnot else u get here on reddit.  (I only upvote/downvote perhaps 1 post a day due to lack of care)</p>

<p>I suppose I also agree with you. Not everything had to be faked, but the overal event &quot;Sandy Hook&quot; is bullshit. Like people pointed out, there parents/corroner/... are acting, and really bad at that. (And they know, which I why I assume they&#39;re all so stressed)</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an upvote just cuz, though you shouldn&#39;t give 2 fucks about this upvote/downvote system. That&#39;s like pretending Reddit <em>isn&#39;t</em> compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Halbig is in an ongoing trail against Leonard Pozner. I believe he&#39;s fighting the good fight, because I firmly believe that it was a hoax. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s gotten donations from people pushing for the truth- I&#39;d donate to him if I had extra money to spare. Because this kind of crap should be exposed. Regarding the $100,000 figure, the alleged parents of the children who allegedly died got millions. The town&#39;s school system and police department got millions. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Newtown, CT was an outright CIA fantasy town.</p>
