       I question everything. However, I refused to question Sandy Hook. I started watching Alex Jones recently and saw people keep bringing up his Sandy Hook conspiracies. I eventually cane across a video with an insane amount of views and a huge like/dislike ratio called "We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook."
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is well made. So like anything I look at a counter idea of it to see if I went wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not 1 debunking video. The only ones just say "that person isn't reliable who did that segment" without examining the segment. Is that the truth of Sandy Hook? Is there a video somehow debunking these points?

       I don't want to think Sandy Hook is fake because it is a horrible tragedy that shouldn't have happened. Dead children is no laughing matter , but maybe it didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There does seem to be piles of evidence that point to the whole thing being carried out by Crisis Actors and totally faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the kids really did die , I think a team of Agents handled it because the ammunition that has been described as found on the scene doesn't match with the guns the "deranged gunman" was carrying. It matches a weapon left in his car.

       I like how he smiled real hard, I don't think he realized the camera was on. No grieving parent could go from smiling wide to barley being able to form a sentence with a safe face. Wtf this shit is sad.

       I was pondering this the other day, TPTB can try their best with smoke an mirrors but it can all be unravelled by something as small as a disingenuous smile during an interview. This was a clouds parting moment for me as well

       No kids died that day at Sandy Hook, the kids said to have died are all alive and well. There was a Sandy Hook memorial where the "surviving" children made a video/sang a song/something (can't quite remember), later when it was suspected to be the same kids that died 'they' refused to release the names of the "survivors" that participated.

       Sandy Hook is a pretty obvious false flag, though.

       I'm specifically addressing the stupid theories that no kids died that day and that the entire thing was faked. I'm not saying it was or wasn't a false flag. If no kids died, the town would know.

       That town is very close knit and not a lot of people actually live there. That place is like Salem's Lot. There's a dark cloud over Newtown and has been for a long time.

       Well for what it's worth, I didn't downvote, I don't give enough shits to care about e-points and e-karma and whatnot else u get here on reddit.  (I only upvote/downvote perhaps 1 post a day due to lack of care)
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I also agree with you. Not everything had to be faked, but the overal event "Sandy Hook" is bullshit. Like people pointed out, there parents/corroner/... are acting, and really bad at that. (And they know, which I why I assume they're all so stressed)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you an upvote just cuz, though you shouldn't give 2 fucks about this upvote/downvote system. That's like pretending Reddit

       A ton of single-family real estate changed hands for zero dollars in the year or so leading up to the alleged massacre, according to records. The town's population was seemingly turned over, so no, I don't think the whole town had to be in on it, especially if everyone in town moved away before the shooting.

       The smoking gun for me is the fact that there is no real evidence of Sandy Hook Elementary Achool even being open that school year.

       I don't think you can debunk that film because it doesn't really offer proof. It more just highlights a string of suspicious facts surrounding the incident.
      </p>

       The goal of that film seems to be to get people to question what happened, bit prove a specific chain of events.

       I don't really understand how you can say you question everything but refuse to question Sandy Hook, which is one of the most bogus hoaxes to ever occur in the history of the world. There is a good reason that so many people say Sandy Hook was a hoax- they were sloppy in so many ways and it is obvious to anyone who has researched it for an hour or two that Sandy Hook was 100% a hoax. Nothing about it makes sense in terms of normal emergency protocol which is supposed to be followed when a school shooting. Simple things like not leaving the victims bodies in the building overnight instead of bringing them to the hospital- that sort of stuff. I will mention a few things and leave you with a couple links to check out. First of all, watch this- 34 questions about Sandy Hook that need to be answered.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/aUH4yBdFn1w">
        https://youtu.be/aUH4yBdFn1w
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wolfgang Halbig, who is a former state trooper, school principal, and school safety expert, is leading the case against the Sandy Hook hoaxers- search for videos with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       They used crisis actor David Wheeler in two roles- one as a grieving parent and one as a swat team guy who doesn't know how to hold his weapon. I believe "a call for an uprising" YouTube channel made some good videos about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great documentary is Sandy Hook Line and Sinker. Only 45 minutes and more recent than we need to talk about Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       The school hadn't even been operational for several years before the event- it had asbestos and no internet traffic to the schools website for years. Speaking of the internet, there were donation pages set up for the victims of Sandy Hook before the hoax even happened. Follow the money. Newtown, CT got a $50 million dollar elementary school after the Sandy Hook hoax. Many residents got free houses on Christmas Day of that year. And none of the parents of the 20 children who allegedly died live in that town anymore- they all moved fairly quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another video called "the life of Adam" which you can watch in which they find that Adam Lanza is actually just a fictional character made up for this event. As the story goes he was a 112 pound man who was able to carry the weight of several weapons which would be troublesome even to trained men who are twice that size and to kill 100% of the people like they said he did would mean that he did is simply unbelievable.

       Halbig is in an ongoing trail against Leonard Pozner. I believe he's fighting the good fight, because I firmly believe that it was a hoax. I'm glad he's gotten donations from people pushing for the truth- I'd donate to him if I had extra money to spare. Because this kind of crap should be exposed. Regarding the $100,000 figure, the alleged parents of the children who allegedly died got millions. The town's school system and police department got millions. I wouldn't be surprised if Newtown, CT was an outright CIA fantasy town.

       Go to the official FBI website, find the crime statistics, look up Connecticut 2014, find Newtown, look how many murders they had. That's all you really need, even the FBI acknowledges it didn't happen.

       Sandy Hook was under the jurisdiction of the CT state police.  That means that the stats from the crime would come from the state police not any local cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the '12 CT crime report it lists zero murders in Newtown,  with the footnote that says "does not include the 27 deaths from Sandy Hook".  But in the state totals of the same report it has the footnote "does include the 27th deaths at Sandy Hook"
      </p>
      <p>
       This was explained over four years ago,  but hoaxers keep bringing it up.

       Interesting fact about FBI crime reports.  The 2007 VA FBI crime report shows ZERO murders in Blacksburg,  site of the VA Tech shooting.

       Not seen any claims of that shooting being a hoax.  Like with Sandy Hook,  the VA Tech murders are in the state totals.

       I think Sandy Hook was a test of a mind control device or solution. That is why after most of the shootings the shooter is reported confused, sad, and scared then they take their life... It is still a terrible event and i believe people died but i think it was just for testing. Because after the shootings nothing has changed so why do if not just to test the extent of whatever they are testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, it could have just been some wackjob that shot some kids.

       You will find a debunk here and there of some of the points. But at the end of the day the evidence that Sandy Hook was a hoax is pretty undeniable. A lot of people point to Robby Parker's video as the thing that finally convinced them (or first got them suspicious). This was the video that did it for me:

       It's one thing to say they deliberately got it wrong at first. It's another to say that Gene Rosen's story about harboring a class of children in his home was fabricated to get attention and nobody has ever figured out that he was lying. The only way that happens is if the media are complicit with trying to cover up the truth, not if their initial reporting was wrong.

       Sandy Hook was definitely fake, all you have to do is watch any aerial footage from that day to see that there is absolutely zero urgency from any of the responders. Not to mention the people walking in one door and out another is a continuous loop.

       It was a "continuous loop" because a hoaxer edited the clip that way.Aerial footage is after shooting was finished.Most were dead INSIDE a building,they havent invented X Ray tv cameras yet.
IF youre so sure its a hoax lets see one corroborated fact of evidence.I bet you can't

       It's honestly easier at this point to research what
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       staged. Sandy Hook, Pulse, Boston Bombing, San Bernadino, all fake and gay. The Somali refugee attacking people with a car and knife at Ohio State in late '16/early '17 may have been real, but most every thing is staged, pushing an agenda, creating fear and chaos, raising money, etc

       Well for what it's worth, I didn't downvote, I don't give enough shits to care about e-points and e-karma and whatnot else u get here on reddit.  (I only upvote/downvote perhaps 1 post a day due to lack of care)
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I also agree with you. Not everything had to be faked, but the overal event "Sandy Hook" is bullshit. Like people pointed out, there parents/corroner/... are acting, and really bad at that. (And they know, which I why I assume they're all so stressed)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you an upvote just cuz, though you shouldn't give 2 fucks about this upvote/downvote system. That's like pretending Reddit

       Halbig is in an ongoing trail against Leonard Pozner. I believe he's fighting the good fight, because I firmly believe that it was a hoax. I'm glad he's gotten donations from people pushing for the truth- I'd donate to him if I had extra money to spare. Because this kind of crap should be exposed. Regarding the $100,000 figure, the alleged parents of the children who allegedly died got millions. The town's school system and police department got millions. I wouldn't be surprised if Newtown, CT was an outright CIA fantasy town.
