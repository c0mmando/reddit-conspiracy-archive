       Please keep this topic alive. There are so many loose ends that I feel need to be answered with these strange children's videos on youtube. Some can be extremely disturbing. There are folks who cracked some simple letter substitution ciphers and discovered Monarch style conditioning in clips. Some clips discussed a town called Pelzer in South Carolina with a population of 89. Strange bits of info were mentioned about this place. Maps of this town were revealed in some of the vids. I believe that there was even mentions of a "field trip" to pelzer. Other horribly creepy stuff found in the comments in these videos besides the codes. Stuff in foreign languages even vaguely hinted about human trafficking.

       Here are some links that i have currently opened right now. It is a jumble, but please help guys. The shilling has been as bad at times as the blockchain investigation.

       I have no idea what they are, but every "G&amp;T" adult I've spoken with who was in those programs in the 90s remembers having to do the same types of "logic puzzles" in their classes. They weren't part of the curriculum, nor were they a standardized test.

       you also have to do a reflex test and a coordination test (these 3 are done at a psychologist's office; you have to have master's in "transportation psychology" to be able to test people) besides the actual road driving test and the legislation test. All these after mandatory 40 hours of driving with a professional driving instructor and 20 hours of legislation classes.
      </p>

       There are still many, many idiots on the road, just no actual retards.

       Hell if I know. I've yet to find one person who can tell us what it actually was, and every G&amp;T adult I've spoken with said some version of "I completely forgot about that until just now! What the hell?!"
      </p>

       On the fluoride, theory, though. Why would they serve it to us in school? It gets creepier the more you think about it.

       The fluoride thing I remember might not be related, as I remember it being given to most of the class. We would be lined up outside in the hall and given little paper cups of liquid that we had to swish around for a certain amount of time, then spit back out. I'm fairly sure that is standard to protect your teeth, but it was definitely not something we paid for out of our own pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as TAG...I can't remember now what that even meant. I know I was proud to be involved because it made me feel smart, but I don't remember doing anything special. I suppose testing happened.

       can you elaborate on this please? I'm very curious.  My niece and nephew are in gifted and talented programs right now and they are often removed from class to spend time with a certain 'teacher' (i don't know what his title really is he might be a counselor of sorts, i never get a straight answer) and the whole school has no windows which I find very odd. This is also in a town with a very large military presence.

       They aren't my kids and my brother and I aren't on the best of terms.  He gets very defensive whenever I bring it up. But the kids (twins, very smart) sense my apprehension and they non-verbally (their body language, eye contact, etc. when I mention it) hint to me that something is wacky.

       I was in a gifted program throughout elementary school after scoring high on an IQ test, I don't remember tons of details but it was a weekly or bi-weekly class that took up a regular period. We did have logic puzzles often, and it was in a windowless room, but to be honest I spent most of my time there on the computers playing DOS games like Duck Tales, Beetlejuice and Midnight Rescue. The liquid in a paper cup I do not remember one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to say if it had any negative effect on me or not, as I really only remember bits and pieces of it.

       YouTube would play gore and child abuse all day long if their legal team approved it and it generated ad revenue. As a business entity, they have one goal:
       <strong>
        maximize revenue while minimizing liability.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the equation... You figure out where you can effect change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hint: you can't stop kids from clicking these videos accidentally, but if you make YouTube fearful that hosting this sort of content constitutes a legal liability, they'll shut it down quicker than their legal team can send an invoice.

       They earn BILLIONS a year in profit. They make tons from ad revenue. Pay for an ad. See if they take your money. The "zero profit" thing is from them being pulled in to google. Now it is just part of Google's profit.

       Not true. Politics trump money. Syria videos (who don't play along with the official narrative "evil Assad/rebels=freedom fighters" don't get paid ad money.

       Most of the world is under some form of mind control rather it be actually name 'mk-ultra' or not.  Just think about this... do you think it's normal to not be aware of what goes on around you?  Those who seem to not be aware of anything except a specific function that they do are the ones deepest down the rabbit hole. The more aware, the slightly less controlled, etc.

       Very, very easy to tell. The MK programming leaves behind a very distinct pattern, of which every person regardless of location or how they were programmed will have these traits as a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very easy to tell a genuine case as I have associated with multiple others who have had this conditioning, and you simply cannot make it up. The depth, multiple people and stories - and being consistent over months and months is just one aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       For everyone else it is actually easy to detect the mind control and I have described the subtle patterns here -
       <a href="https://deprogramwiki.com/deprogramming/deprogramming-modalities-for-trauma-mind-control-survivors/#CommonPatterns_and_Behaviours_that_May_Indicate_Mind_Control">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       They are simple things like not being able to tell left from right without a visual aid, and questions which give subtle programmed answers.

       Actually there will be solid evidence of this that will come out through WikiLeaks. More towards the end of this year there will be hints, with close to mid 2018 being the time where it's obvious for everyone and out in the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks currently has the documents, with Assange himself tweeting some months back about the continuation of MKULTRA. Too lazy to get the link to it!

       You are correct. This is also referred to as 'predictive programming'. If 'the masses' have some hints of reality beyond their imagination, it really helps with what is called 'future shock'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If cognitive dissonances are closed too fast, then things get messy for some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with this there are also a lot of very unhappy people who have leaked and also hinted what is going on. The breadcrumbs will pile up eventually,

        screenshot
       </a>
       I took of one of them. The visuals are mixed up maps in colors, green, blue, red, and pink (if I remember correctly), and there is a British woman's voice speaking a phrase for each color for example "blue: your trigger is power rangers" or something to that effect, assigning an object or character trigger to each color. Spliced between each are some disturbing images like dolls around a tic tac toe board and blood on a wall. The text is some kind of standard cipher, anons were easily able to decipher in some of the 4chan threads.

       Hey I wanted to ask could I copy and paste these questions and answers as an update on my site?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway this one is interesting and to answer I have to give some insight to programming scripts and how they work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above material can be legit used for mind control programming. The disturbing images would be anchored to previous traumas. So generally after a suggestion there is the reminder of a specific trauma to more so bound the suggestion. The above script also would be used more so for social engineering type situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cipher text maybe giberish anyway and a coded message or trigger. Some alter(nate personalities) or alters, will know how to decipher this and some wont have that knowledge. It's a good way to get a message to just one alter if you wanted others to not know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of these programming scripts, the content generally has nothing to do with actually what is going on. The above could be used to program people for drug deals, assassinations or anything the programmer wants to engineer. The content is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old classic scripts are still known and in use to this day. This is Fantasia for Dr Green (Mengele and down), and Alice in Wonderland and Wizard of Oz for others. Everyone survivor I have talked with so far about the mind control has this as a base.

       Social Engineering - most basic example would be those school shootings that take up the news. These types of scripts above would suite those situations.

       And yes. The 'classics' are still used today, mostly to create worlds within the minds of survivors.

       Hi there, sorry for the late reply. I actually fractured my elbow two nights ago in a training accident! So I will type what I can,

       Yes, 100%.

      <p>
       I honestly could not read more then 20 pages of her book due to how triggering it is. It was also some codes in her book 'Thanks for the Memories' which really spun me out good.

       "Thanks for the Memories" is by Brice Taylor, isn't it? You believe that is also a legitimate account? I have not read that book, could you elaborate on what you mean by "codes in her book"? Does she describe codes that were used to trigger her?

       Yes, there is a serious warning at the start of her book that indicates if someone has had this conditioning, the book will trigger them badly. So yes, there are some straight legit MK codes in there - which made me remember some things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book is very intense, and I still cannot read it to this day.

       If you would like to learn more about the codes and how they work, I have given an example of real sex slave codes here -

       Thank you for all the information. What percentage of mind control victims would you say become conscious that they were mind control victims? How did you become aware?

       The percentage would be easily less then 0.5%. The history of this mind control is thousands of years old. It is only in the last 30 or so years some rare few realised and may have been able to keep out. Maybe due to the increase of mind controlled persons tenfold.
      </p>
      <p>
       'The Illuminati' (in this case I use this term to describe those with power to do this) kept their mind control 'in house' previous to WW2. As the years went on, the art of trauma mind control spread fast - that it gradually became out of control for even 'The Illuminati' to handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only became aware by reading about it online at the age of 25. It was Fritz Springmeiers work which woke me up to it. Previous to then I was 100% completely clueless about it all and thought I had a somewhat normal life.

       This may be too personal a question but have you or do you see a psychiatrist? How did you "deprogram" and how were you able to remember anything about what you experienced if it is buried so effectively by the programmers?

       Who is creating the infrastructure and facilitating all of these programs, is it still CIA run?

       Sure thing. It's a good question. I have been through mental health services against my will a few times. I have open sourced my notes and also have audio recordings here -
       <a href="https://deprogramwiki.com/deprogramming/sojans-mental-health-adventure-whats-typical-when-some-survivors-leave-the-cult/">

      <p>
       It just to type, so I will keep it minimal. Worst timing for an injury right!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mental health and psychiatric services are used in an MK sense as an 'emergency repair' and damage control situation. For example, end of last year Kanye West was rushed into psychiatric services for this reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to learn myself how to deprogram, however with a twist. Everyone in this thing has to do some programming anyway. I was regarded as 'rather good' at trauma programming to the point where they wanted me to be a Green doctor (equivalent of Josef Mengele).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I used this knowledge to deprogram, and everything I learned I published. It is what makes 'Deprogramming Modalities' somewhat unique, as you simply cannot just get this deprogramming knowledge anywhere. The work there is what worked best for me and others, and what was most helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intelligence agencies and military industries seem to be fronts for more higher level types of mind control activities. The problem is extremely widespread, extending to Hollywood, all major religions...
      </p>
      <p>
       As I keep trying to hint, despite it's front or its 'content', it can be very easy to detect from the patterns it leaves behind regardless of where/when/how/who.

       Ok, I'm curious about the Kanye West thing. What is his deal? He recently went on a rant, saying the powerful Jews were not allowing his ideas to succeed in the free market. The interview was posted on this sub several times.

      <p>
       That doesn't sound like something a person who is being mind-controlled would be able to vocalize. Is that really the reason he was sent into psychiatric treatment? What evidence is there that he is mind controlled and didn't just have a breakdown, which I would imagine is more frequent in people so largely in the public eye as celebrities like Kanye? Or, alternatively, that simply powerful Jews that he was referencing didn't like what he was saying and had him punished for it?

       Hi! Sorry for my late reply, still recovering. Otherwise I'd type a lot more!
      </p>
      <p>
       With the mind control, you have to understand that trauma mind control is total and absolute 100% control. This means there is no such thing as 'just having a breakdown'. Anything that they are experiencing is planned by their handler / programmer. So there is no room for even freedom to decide to have a bad day, as that is already decided for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all MK systems are perfect. Generally they can break down for many reasons. Kanye may have been rushed off for showing signs of this, or more likely indications that there maybe issues with the MK system without immediate intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       In mental health services a lot of drugging and torture goes down. The more trauma the better, as the system is based on trauma - and that's what keeps the system together - more trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can actually start to also break down if the survivor remains free from the trauma.

       If you look at the 'announcement' portion of this video (check out the blue one at 0:13) you will see that the backdrop is a chopped up map. One of the streets on this map is "Drake St.". Drake St. is in Pelzer, SC. Other streets on this map are "Anderson St.", State Highways "8" and "20".

       I think you get the point.

       Anyhow, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this yet - I just took a look into this now.

      <p>
       Don't know if it means anything or not, I just thought it was interesting since this location has apparently come up in other parts of this ongoing 'investigation'.

       Think of children, man. What is done is extreme methods of psychic driving are used to literally shatter these children at an extremely young age. They become malleable and you can quite easily pump this shit into their brains. The will is shattered and reformed. The practice apparently is not at all perfect, but it does work. It is one of the worst developments of mankind. It is hard to read about.

       I read there are some communites that are set up for sex offenders because some of the rules are so strict they can't be within 20miles of where any kids might congregate, so they have to live in the middle of bumfuck nowhere.

       These would be like one of those towns in horror movies that your car breaks down in and the townspeople seem just a little off, next thing you know you are being hunted and only one of your friends survives to tell the tale.

       Ya, I won't get into details but when I was 5 or 6 there was an incident that happened to me that caused my whole family to up and move. I don't remember much of anything but it was in Greenville SC. I look it up and sure enough Pelzer is 17 mi away, I was a child right near the hornets nest.

       I was supposed to have an identical twin sister but my mom always said she dissappeared while in the womb. Kind of hard to believe that she would be so developed but end up missing so i think we were born together and she died or died in the womb and mom and dad wouldnt tell me the truth.

       There have been some extremely fascinating GATE threads on /pol that are eye raising. I had some weird experiences in elementary school myself. I do not really remember elementary school at all... only snippets. Try and find the threads (there are archived ones I believe) on GATE and other gifted and talented programs discussed on /pol.

       Youtube and youtube kids have been found to have a variety of disturbing videos. Ranging from sexual and mental abuse involving real people and some animated. Both equally disturbing. Anyways, some people have done some digging and have found the term MKULTRA in some of these videos and Blue bird, another government project. There's also words and numbers that people believe lead to locations IRL and lead to other disturbing photos and posts on the Internet. Honestly, that's all I've gotten so far because it's still on going and there's more and more being uncovered as we speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an easy, more tame summary of what's going on:

      <p>
       But the rabbit hole goes much deeper than this. Do NOT let your kids on YouTube or Youtube kids for the love of God. Netflix or Hulu for kids is ok...for now but the best substitute is to just ve aware of what your children are doing and make sure that YOU filter everything that they do. These are truly fucked up times we live in.

       I remember when I got an iPod touch no one was monitoring anything I did or watched(no one ever has to my knowledge, outside big brother that watches us all, still took precocious). Anyway I remember the first time I went on YouTube on my iPod, I watched the moon landing recording, which lead me down a rabbit hole of creepy videos and conspiracys.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a week before I slept properly, if not more, I basically got overloaded with information, a lot of which was creepy stuff and it triggered my nightmares coming back. I remember that night I literally could not sleep and started shaking the whole night which my parents noticed.  I have a long history of nightmares were for years it was almost a daily occurrence to the point I became scared to sleep, I also had a lot of weird dreams as a kid were I would dream the future as far as I noticed were I dreamed about this old lady being a sub, and a new game we played in gym that day that we never played before. This seems like a tangent but it's late and meh.

       Every time I see public puzzle ARG-type stuff like this I always try to play devil's advocate and figure out if anyone would have any reason to post these things other than to fuck with someone. Most of the time, that's the only logical reason for anyone to post these types of "clues".
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I could think of for someone to post public cryptic information on pedo stuff is if they don't trust the authorities or they are involved in some capacity with the activities and can't expose themselves, both of which seem plausible. I don't subscribe to the extreme pedogate theory that every person in a position of power is a pedophile, but I could see how that fear might deter someone from reporting their info to police. Imo there is just enough potential incentive for someone to do this that bizarre cryptic stuff like these vids shouldn't be completely shunned.

       I do not think it is everyone in a position of power either. I think these activities peaked at certain times in history, depending on the activities of rogue elements in the intelligence communities, or specific plans by government leaders using spycraft tools to grasp power.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is where to start looking. The franklin cover-up and the dutroux affair are good starts. The full ramifications of the franklin cover-up can make your jaw drop. Literally there was a point in time when uncovering the corruption that my stomach got sour and I felt sick. Three grand juries were corrupted in this thing. Two state and one federal I believe. The power to corrupt THREE grand juries is astounding. If you read Nick Bryant, he will lay it all out quite methodically. What was uncovered seemed to be a Republican party version of this shit. It was huge and it led to some very dark things. Both parties have this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also pay attention to how much you will get attacked for bringing it up, even in conspiracy circles at times.

       many of these videos come from China.

       Funny you should say this: a while ago I looked at some of the precursors to these videos (less creepy ones watched by my niece) and nicknamed them "made in Chinas." I still wonder if it's not a US creation for MK Ultra, but hopefully time will tell.

       Yeah that's the thing, you never really know.  I don't like to point fingers willy nilly.  Maybe they are some random Chinese folks who are in need of work and just following orders.  Who know's where the 'orders' originated from, could be anywhere.  The internet is a very convoluted entity.

       The overall objective is complete control in all total aspects. From there, children are generally trafficked as sex slaves and used for well.. you get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Svali, a survivor of the programming wrote some material around the year 2000. She describes it much better then I can, and also says why they are doing what they are doing.

      <p>
       For their plans with me, they originally wanted me to carry on the work of trauma as a means of control as a programmer. Along with this I was also a skilled assassin and was sexually trafficked into adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I was MK my whole life, and with my programming broken years ago I thankfully have the bigger picture and know otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the past I am going okay. I work from home and freelance developing websites and enjoy the freedom to travel around and simply just live.

       Hey I will check out your website. Have you seen these videos? From everything I can gather, MK style conditioning is must more intensive than just these kinds of videos. Could these videos be people playing at mind control to test and see if it works? Could it be used for kids already conditioned in the program? What do you think?

       Hi there, sorry for the late reply. I actually fractured my elbow two nights ago in a training accident! So I will type what I can,
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally try to avoid 'those' types of videos as they obviously bring up unpleasant memories from the past. It is beyond the humans imagination of how intense this conditioning is, to the point where no one would believe it even if the truth was spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even normal and mundane movie and TV shows contain MK triggers, which can be spotted with the learned eye. For example I heard MKULTRA mind control assassination activation codes in the TV show 'American Dad'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are much easier and subtle ways then videos to detect the mind control and they are described here -

       I do not care if I get laughed at anon. I am too old, jaded, and weird to care about that. I do not know what all of this is. Could it be an art project by strange artists (lots have been using MK themes lately in their work, which is disturbing to me) as a "social experiment" to see if these kinds of techniques work? Could it just be people getting off on weirdness and shit that skirts the lines of child pornography? Could it be what people fear most? Just want to know what is happening.

       I do not care if I get laughed at anon. I am too old, jaded, and weird to care about that. I do not know what all of this is. Could it be an art project by strange artists (lots have been using MK themes lately in their work, which is disturbing to me) as a "social experiment" to see if these kinds of techniques work? Could it just be people getting off on weirdness and shit that skirts the lines of child pornography? Could it be what people fear most? Just want to know what is happening.

       Very, very easy to tell. The MK programming leaves behind a very distinct pattern, of which every person regardless of location or how they were programmed will have these traits as a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very easy to tell a genuine case as I have associated with multiple others who have had this conditioning, and you simply cannot make it up. The depth, multiple people and stories - and being consistent over months and months is just one aspect.

       For everyone else it is actually easy to detect the mind control and I have described the subtle patterns here -

       They are simple things like not being able to tell left from right without a visual aid, and questions which give subtle programmed answers.

       I honestly avoid those types of videos as they bring up unpleasant memories of the past, if you could get a screenshot or an example of the coded comments I could translate it from 'MK-ish' to English,
