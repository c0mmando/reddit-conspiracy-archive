       I 100% agree.  LGBT is destroying the natural family that creates life. Homosexuality is 100% proven to not create life, only a Man with a woman can reproduce life and only a man &amp; woman is natural for raising children.  LGBT is destroying the family and it's making sexual immorality the new standard.

       No it doesn't. Anti implies that it is a force against life, as in something that takes it. LGBT people aren't murdering children, they just aren't having them. No more immoral than an abstinent nun or infertile wife.

       They aren't inhibiting the creation of life. To inhibit it, you would have to be stopping it from happening where it otherwise would.

       There is nothing to show these people would be having children if they weren't with their preferred partner. Not to mention many LGBT couples do have children through sperm/egg donors and adoption.

       This is anti-intelligence statement. A community is natural for raising children. Families of today a only a social construct. And you obviously don't have a clue what the word fact means and your claims have no basis or prove. And a book assembled by a Roman empire to consolidate control doesnt cut it as sources of fact.

       My morals comes from God, not myself. It would be prideful of me to think I'm more moral than God.  God in His infinite wisdom knows that homosexuality is wrong.

       You're free to express yourself as well am I, but the fact remains that homosexuals are biologically unnatural and they don't reproduce life, if anything, they have shorter lives than heterosexuals, so there is a health risk to homosexual sex.  Putting a penis in another mans rear end doesn't sound healthy.

       Several problems:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Homosexual sex in found in nature, so by definition is natural. The only sense in on which it would be considered "unnatural" is if you are speaking to the fact that it is statistically not the norm, in which case are left handed people also considered immoral? I'd wager not.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why do they need to reproduce life? Are celebrity nuns and priests immoral? They don't reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They are capable of reproducing through the use of sperm/egg donors, so if we are really caught up on this notion that they must have kids it's not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Doesn't really matter what it "sounds like" to you.

       By your definition, if anything happens in nature then it is natural.  Since humans are part of nature, then the bombing of humans and the beheading of Christians by muslims is considered natural, so we should all have the natural right to kill each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a dog eats his poop and drinks his pee, then humans should be able to do the same.

       If a female praying mantis can eat their male counterpart after they finish mating, then female humans should be allowed to kill &amp; eat human men after we finish mating.

       Here is the literal definition: existing in or caused by nature; not made or caused by humankind.

       That is the definition I've been using. So your first example is obviously out.

       You made the claim that since homosexuality is found in nature, that we should be allowed to practice homosexuality, which goes against our bodies intended purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I advocate for only heterosexual sex, because it is natural and it fulfills our natural purpose, which is to have a bond with the opposite sex and create offspring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuals are known to have shorter life spans than heterosexuals, so there's definitely something about homosexuality that is shortening their lifespan.

       No I did not. I only refuted your statement that it was unnatural. I did not then assert that because it is natural it is therefore right, you assumed that and continued to to stick by your erroneous assumption despite the fact that I stated multiple times (3x now) that is not what I believe or have claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no reason to conclude that a loving relationship between two people of the same sex can't be just a fulfilling. They even have the option of raising children through sperm/egg donations or adoption.

       Maybe it has something to do with the stress of people constantly hating them for just trying to love their lives? None the less I'm going to need a source for that bold claim.

       The anus is not designed to receive a penis, therefore it is unnatural, even though it is found in nature.  Something that is natural upholds its intended purpose, just as heterosexual relationships intended purpose is to bond and create babies, plus the penis is made for the vagina and the sperm fertilizes the female egg.

       One could say the intended purpose of sex is pleasure just as much as it's procreation. Most animals do not feel pleasure when having intercourse, humans do. Doesn't that mean pleasure is part of the "intended purpose?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any sex that is not strictly for procreation constitute an immoral act for you? I am in a heterosexual relationship but out of the many times I have had sex I have never intended to produce a child as a result. Is that immoral?

       Says you. My purpose for having sex is not procreation. Some things can serve more than one purpose, sex for humans is one of those things. For someone who never intends to procreate the primary purpose of sex will always be pleasure.

       I wouldn't say that is someones nature. Like u/Her_Excellency said, natural is something that exists or is caused by nature, not by mankind. Although, I believe that human nature is naturally good, this isn't to say that everything that happens in our nature (or nature in general) is good, but it's always for the better. I believe humans are naturally good, until they have been hurt by an outside source, decide to become weak and ignorant, and destroy their own nature by killing, stealing, lying, controlling, etc. That is free will against nature.

       I can't accept the idea that homosexuality is immoral. Homosexuality has been around for ages, has been accepted by other cultures such as the Greek and Japanese, and is natural among other animals.

       One bad apple spoils the whole bunch, if you allow homosexuality, then you have to allow everything, even pedophilia and beastiality.

       Look, believe what ever you like. I don't agree with you, and I feel like you have been hurt by someone and are either trolling for pleasure or you want to brainwash others with your egocentric beliefs. I don't think you even read what I wrote earlier, but like I said, killing, raping, stealing, etc. isn't in our nature. That is going against our nature. Reread my other post if you like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying homosexuality is wrong is just like saying that writing with the left hand is wrong. You can teach a leftie how to write with their right hand, but they'll always feel more comfortable with their left hand. How are we going change someone from homosexual to heterosexual? It's impossible. Anyone who was homosexual and decided to be heterosexual is either bisexual in reality, or has decided to lie to themselves. Homosexuality, if it's between two grown men/women and it's consented, is not wrong and it's not going against our nature. If you want to think the way you do, I'm not going to stop you. Go ahead and be that way.

       No you don't. There is an obvious difference between a relationship between two consenting adults, and a relationship where one person takes advantage of someone/something that cannot consent.

       I like what you said. Except that I believe nature is always good, and everything it does is for the better. Anyone that is killing, stealing, controlling, lying, or doing anything we consider wrong, is going against their own nature and corrupting themselves. I believe people are only doing these things because an outside source (or even their own nature) has hurt them, put them in pain, and if the pain has made them ignorant due to their weakness, they now want to hurt others and destroy the nature to feed their ego.

       I can love my neighbor and warn him that homosexuality is wrong.  Warning somebody is an act of love.  If my neighbor house was on fire, then a loving neighbor will warn them and help them escape the fire.  Homosexuality is fire and I'm warning my neighbor and I'm showing him to seek refuge in God.  I love my neighbor and I don't want to see them perish.

       Just because homosexuality occurs in the wild, doesn't make it natural, it means that the animal is severely misguided.  I guess if an animal drinks pee and poop, then maybe we should start doing that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality is unnatural, because man and woman were made for eachother.  A man and women perfectly compliment each other, when a man and women make love, we create life, while homosexuality is just a perversion of the natural biology of the man and woman.

       Male animal sex parts fit into female sex parts, when male and female animals have sex, they create an offspring, because male and female are meant to be, otherwise they wouldn't create life, just as homosexual cannot create life.
      </p>

       So saying that homosexuality is unnatural is considered hate speech now a days, that's sad to say.  Political Correctness is nothing more than censorship of views that don't conform to the populous.  Since my message isn't politically correct, it's considered hate speech, nice logic, so I must be politically correct if I want to speak.

       That is one way to look at it... But try to look at it from the PoV I am. Is a fetish a mental health disorder? Yes. So homosexuality is as well. Why was it taken off as a disorder? I feel like there is a link to reduce population since mental health disorders, fetishes and homosexuality is through the roof atm. As though it's been planned...

       Why is a fetish a disorder yet homosexuality isn't? It doesn't make sense, especially since it's the same style of flaw, crossed wires in the brain. It's the exact same thing that causes it, sexualising something that is not seen as 'normal.' And this is coming from someone that's got fetishes and gay genes in the family line. I think it's connected.

       "The crossed wires" are very different in this case. Homosexuality shares far more similarities to heterosexual arousal than arousal brought on by an obsessive attraction to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention what is seen as "normal" is far from settled. Many cultures past and present have seen homosexuality as entirely acceptable, even expected within their society.

       Yet homosexuality has RISEN since ancient times! That is my point. Fetishes would've existed back then aswell. A fetish isn't an 'obsessive attraction.' You can ignore your fetish for years but it's still going to be there. There's nothing 'obsessive' about it. Are homosexuals obessive over the same sex? No, so I wouldn't think the same about fetishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny that you haven't answered my original questions apart from claiming it was wrong that homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same part of the brain that is affected that causes fetishes and homosexuality, and I certainly won't be surprised if there is a higher risk of other mental health disorders in homosexuality (and fetishes.)

       It was wrong to, for instance, prosecute Alan Turing for being gay and drive him to suicide. It is also wrong to force the LGBT agenda down all our throats. We need to accept that homosexuality exists, even in places like saudi arabia, it's not going away, but it also is found in only a tiny percentage if the population. 2-4%, not 20-30% as some might think. Society should cater to the majority. I used to get frustrated that guitar shops would only have two left handed guitars for sale, and lefties are 10% of the population. But that's life. If anyone is in a minority, we can advocate for acceptance and tolerance from the majority. But can i demand that society caters first and foremost to left handers? If that came about i would deserve to be lynched!

       You're begging the question.  The intended purpose for sex for every species is pro creation, the secondary purpose is pleasure.
