    <div class="md"><p>Several problems:</p>

<p>1) Homosexual sex in found in nature, so by definition is natural. The only sense in on which it would be considered &quot;unnatural&quot; is if you are speaking to the fact that it is statistically not the norm, in which case are left handed people also considered immoral? I&#39;d wager not.</p>

<p>2) Why do they need to reproduce life? Are celebrity nuns and priests immoral? They don&#39;t reproduce.</p>

<p>3) They are capable of reproducing through the use of sperm/egg donors, so if we are really caught up on this notion that they must have kids it&#39;s not impossible. </p>

<p>4) Doesn&#39;t really matter what it &quot;sounds like&quot; to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By your definition, if anything happens in nature then it is natural.  Since humans are part of nature, then the bombing of humans and the beheading of Christians by muslims is considered natural, so we should all have the natural right to kill each other.</p>

<p>If a dog eats his poop and drinks his pee, then humans should be able to do the same.</p>

<p>If a female praying mantis can eat their male counterpart after they finish mating, then female humans should be allowed to kill &amp; eat human men after we finish mating.</p>

<p>I see no reason to conclude that a loving relationship between two people of the same sex can&#39;t be just a fulfilling. They even have the option of raising children through sperm/egg donations or adoption.</p>

<p>Maybe it has something to do with the stress of people constantly hating them for just trying to love their lives? None the less I&#39;m going to need a source for that bold claim. </p>

<p>Does any sex that is not strictly for procreation constitute an immoral act for you? I am in a heterosexual relationship but out of the many times I have had sex I have never intended to produce a child as a result. Is that immoral?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say that is someones nature. Like u/Her_Excellency said, natural is something that exists or is caused by nature, not by mankind. Although, I believe that human nature is naturally good, this isn&#39;t to say that everything that happens in our nature (or nature in general) is good, but it&#39;s always for the better. I believe humans are naturally good, until they have been hurt by an outside source, decide to become weak and ignorant, and destroy their own nature by killing, stealing, lying, controlling, etc. That is free will against nature.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t accept the idea that homosexuality is immoral. Homosexuality has been around for ages, has been accepted by other cultures such as the Greek and Japanese, and is natural among other animals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, believe what ever you like. I don&#39;t agree with you, and I feel like you have been hurt by someone and are either trolling for pleasure or you want to brainwash others with your egocentric beliefs. I don&#39;t think you even read what I wrote earlier, but like I said, killing, raping, stealing, etc. isn&#39;t in our nature. That is going against our nature. Reread my other post if you like.</p>

<p>Saying homosexuality is wrong is just like saying that writing with the left hand is wrong. You can teach a leftie how to write with their right hand, but they&#39;ll always feel more comfortable with their left hand. How are we going change someone from homosexual to heterosexual? It&#39;s impossible. Anyone who was homosexual and decided to be heterosexual is either bisexual in reality, or has decided to lie to themselves. Homosexuality, if it&#39;s between two grown men/women and it&#39;s consented, is not wrong and it&#39;s not going against our nature. If you want to think the way you do, I&#39;m not going to stop you. Go ahead and be that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So saying that homosexuality is unnatural is considered hate speech now a days, that&#39;s sad to say.  Political Correctness is nothing more than censorship of views that don&#39;t conform to the populous.  Since my message isn&#39;t politically correct, it&#39;s considered hate speech, nice logic, so I must be politically correct if I want to speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is one way to look at it... But try to look at it from the PoV I am. Is a fetish a mental health disorder? Yes. So homosexuality is as well. Why was it taken off as a disorder? I feel like there is a link to reduce population since mental health disorders, fetishes and homosexuality is through the roof atm. As though it&#39;s been planned...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is a fetish a disorder yet homosexuality isn&#39;t? It doesn&#39;t make sense, especially since it&#39;s the same style of flaw, crossed wires in the brain. It&#39;s the exact same thing that causes it, sexualising something that is not seen as &#39;normal.&#39; And this is coming from someone that&#39;s got fetishes and gay genes in the family line. I think it&#39;s connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The crossed wires&quot; are very different in this case. Homosexuality shares far more similarities to heterosexual arousal than arousal brought on by an obsessive attraction to something. </p>

<p>Not to mention what is seen as &quot;normal&quot; is far from settled. Many cultures past and present have seen homosexuality as entirely acceptable, even expected within their society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet homosexuality has RISEN since ancient times! That is my point. Fetishes would&#39;ve existed back then aswell. A fetish isn&#39;t an &#39;obsessive attraction.&#39; You can ignore your fetish for years but it&#39;s still going to be there. There&#39;s nothing &#39;obsessive&#39; about it. Are homosexuals obessive over the same sex? No, so I wouldn&#39;t think the same about fetishes. </p>

<p>Funny that you haven&#39;t answered my original questions apart from claiming it was wrong that homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder in the first place.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s the same part of the brain that is affected that causes fetishes and homosexuality, and I certainly won&#39;t be surprised if there is a higher risk of other mental health disorders in homosexuality (and fetishes.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was wrong to, for instance, prosecute Alan Turing for being gay and drive him to suicide. It is also wrong to force the LGBT agenda down all our throats. We need to accept that homosexuality exists, even in places like saudi arabia, it&#39;s not going away, but it also is found in only a tiny percentage if the population. 2-4%, not 20-30% as some might think. Society should cater to the majority. I used to get frustrated that guitar shops would only have two left handed guitars for sale, and lefties are 10% of the population. But that&#39;s life. If anyone is in a minority, we can advocate for acceptance and tolerance from the majority. But can i demand that society caters first and foremost to left handers? If that came about i would deserve to be lynched!</p>
