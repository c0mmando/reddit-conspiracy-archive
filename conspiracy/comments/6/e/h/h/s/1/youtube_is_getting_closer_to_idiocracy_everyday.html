<p>There are seemingly ten of thousands of videos of young girls posting videos either recorded by themselves or by adults. They are very obviously sexualized videos of children wearing revealing clothing and preforming &quot;gymnastics&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an instant classic of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lHBhGnhJLI">video</a> </p>

<p>EDIT: ^ No worries all is <a href="https://archive.fo/BEbyt">archived</a>.. That video was up for 13 months and they finally delete it in less than an hour after this post went up. Just look at the sidebar videos in the archive why not delete those too their not hard to find.</p>

<p>With comments like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dejaun Johnson,  1 day ago,
 &quot;You will baby sitting our baby I&#39;m going to give you a baby inside of that pussy love you&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bo Red,  2 hours ago,
 &quot;Damn, I would love to suck your pussy !!!!!!!﻿﻿&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And to show youtube doesn&#39;t give a shit about your children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>nack b,  <strong>3 months ago,</strong>
 &quot;nice slit﻿&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They won&#39;t even delete sexual comments towards children let alone delete the video.</p>

<p>Does this not make anyone furious that videos like this are on youtube? They will only be getting worse if we don&#39;t try and stop it now. I know people will say it&#39;s the parents fault and the public should not have to look after irresponsible peoples children. But something needs to be done.</p>

<p>We&#39;re sprinting towards idiocracy right before we land on our face.</p>

<p>I understand this more than you know. Most of the time I have the attitude of &quot;I want to know the truth, whatever it may be.&quot; After p-gate I often thought, &quot;I wish I could go back and forget about everything I just uncovered.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. I get so angry thinking about all the children being hurt at this very second, and nobody knows they even exist. I feel like I have to know the truth so at least someone out there knows. And if there is any chance we can help them by tracking down the people that make stuff like this, then I want to do that.</p>

<p>But I get so messed up emotionally. I have to take breaks from this or it is just too overwhelming. I honestly think I&#39;ve developed some sort of PTSD from following all of this so much. And the worst part is nobody else seems to care about this at all. Nobody realizes the extent of how common this is. No human being deserves to be hurt like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a straw man attack.  There are still unanswered questions about creepy Instagram posts and weird code language used in emails.  Lots of people just want answers.  The idea that &quot;pizzagate = Hillary Clinton personally running a child sex ring out of a pizza shop&quot; is just a goofy and false characterization that helps the media discredit pizzagate researchers.  You should read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">this classic post</a> if you haven&#39;t already.  Don&#39;t be naive: child trafficking rings exist.  Top business and political leaders are implicated.  This is a serious issue and we can&#39;t stick our heads in the sand while children are being abused.  Are you aware that a federal judge called former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert a &quot;serial child molester&quot;?  Did you know that former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank paid a male prostitute thousands of dollars to live with him?  And that prostitute ran a brothel out of Frank&#39;s apartment??  Did you know that Bill Clinton ditched his security detail several times when visiting billionaire pedo Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s private island??  And Bill has flown on Epstein&#39;s private jet nicknamed the Lolita Express dozens of times?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the end, we&#39;re all still human. Just because we &quot;wake up&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re all on the same page. There are conspiracies out there that might be extremely popular and believed among the majority of the woke crowd, and then there are ones that no one will believe except for some of those who are unhinged.</p>

<p>And 9/11 seems to be one of those things that no two people totally agree on. Is it this way by design? Is there even a design to 9/11? I might think so, but your father for example, may not.</p>

<p>I might be a &quot;conspiritard&quot; (wow, my phone tried to add &quot;psycho&quot; to the end of that. Thanks, Google...), but I&#39;m not some rabid believer that Satanists are eating children wrapped in dollar bills. I think 9/11 was Israel and America working together, I think Gnosticism might have some truth behind it, I believe PedoGate is real to an extent, and I believe we&#39;ll see aliens within thirty years.</p>

<p>Our interests in conspiracies are exactly like interests in other stuff. Gaming, gardening, avionics, carpentry.</p>

<p>People will open up when they&#39;re ready, but even if they don&#39;t, bear the knowledge to help them when the time comes.</p>

<p>In the same vain that we as an urban Western culture don&#39;t like to see our meat as living animals because it reminds us of our mortality and fragility, we don&#39;t want to accept information such as a conspiracy theory because it reaffirms our mortality and lack of control over our perceived existence.</p>

<p><em>Based on a few recent comments, the way you turned out seems up for debate...</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>One day, I just decided to get off my ass and fix myself. I went from sitting in a tiny apartment all night doing blow, smoking copious amounts of weed and drinking un-godly amounts of whiskey and gin in a garbage, liquor bottle, cigarette pack infested drug den that someone would call an apartment. To living in a nicer apartment. I quit the blow, cut down liquor consumption to only a few bottles a week. I still smoke copious amounts of bud and cigarettes. But, I&#39;m physically fit now, have a decent job, and I keep my place clean.</p>

<p>Besides, it&#39;s funny to make fun of fat people. They are nasty as fuck. I used to be fat, like really fat. So I know first hand. If you are a fat fuck and don&#39;t like the fact that people make fun of you, maybe you can quit eating garbage and get off your fat lazy ass. Worked for me.</p>

<p>This guy doesn&#39;t understand the meaning of subliminal messages, c&#39;mon dude you watched a film that was completely made for adults, all the scenes were made for adults, you didn&#39;t have your brain confused as to why you were watching something &quot;cute&quot; and pretty and made for kids and they started doing weird shit.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvg-Igo-9Ic">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvg-Igo-9Ic</a></p>

<p>That is a russian one with almost one million views. By looking at view count and not being able to speak a word of russian you can INSTANTLY tell which videos are made for paedos.</p>

<p>People will have three to four hundred views on most videos and then the one with millions.</p>

<p>Its fucking disgusting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched the ones linked in the OP with the little blonde girl. Nothing overly bad happens but the vibe is so creepy. The camera keeps focusing on her hands, and she keeps rubbing her body and whoever is filming her has her laying on her bed a lot and playing with syringes. The opening shot is someone injecting food coloring into those fake practice arms and then immediately shows a shot of her laying in bed. The wall is completely covered in crayon scribbles and it&#39;s just weird and depressing.</p>

<p>I feel sick, I thought it was just going to be those weird Elsa videos. The worst part is it seems to link to a bunch of Russian videos featuring kids. I&#39;m not going to be watching anymore of this. I&#39;d there anything that can be done? Can this be reported somewhere? I feel helpless because it seems to be happening in Russia. And nothing really bad is happening... I mean maybe it&#39;s innocent but  I can&#39;t think of an innocent reason to make a video like that. I&#39;m so sad.</p>

I&#39;m just saying if cops had the resources to pursue this shit, and look into these cases, and follow up with YouTube, rest assured they&#39;d be taking them down.

    <div class="md"><p>So searching for &quot;videoplayback&quot; on youtube gives some really fucked up results. Just looking at the thumbnails you can already tell what it&#39;s going to be. Definetly not going to click on any of them.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m guessing is that these results come up because &quot;videoplayback&quot; is the standard name Youtube gives to your video if you don&#39;t name it yourself. People that get off from these videos probably realised this and started searching through them which obviously made the most violent and disturbing ones show at the top. </p>

<p>What really baffels me though, is that Youtube doesn&#39;t remove these. I went through some of them to report them, but I really don&#39;t feel like watching someone kill himself or abuse a child just to be able to describe whats going on in the report...</p>
