        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While I appreciate you starting the conversation on the subversion of our sub, it appears it is too late.  It looks like at this point over 80 percent of the posters here are not real.  You don&#39;t have to be a genius to see it.  It is a gut feeling more than anything.  We have been coopted.  Is there anything we can do to get our sub back, because everything I came to this place for is gone.  It is impossible to have a discussion without brigading and shilling.  I think the only possible solution is to get rid of rule 10 in regards to calling people shills.  It makes me really sad this has happened here, but now this subreddit is a shell of what it used to be.</p>

<p>To all the fake users, I plead with you, if you are Americans wake up and realize you are helping to rot your very own country from the inside out.  No paycheck is worth sacrificing your honor and national pride.  </p>

<p>Until things change I simply can&#39;t contribute here anymore as its just simply too far gone, and nothing is being done to stop it.</p>

<p>Edit:  This post is being made by a real person, and American, with no motives other than to start a conversation about the gross manipulation occurring here daily. I hope that anyone else commenting can also state that they are a real person posting on behalf of themselves.  If you are not able to honestly state that, please find a new discussion</p>

I explained that this is very common in all kinds of subreddits.  I was about to give examples when I looked at this posters profile.  Redditor for 20 days with 45 THOUSAND comment karma.  When I asked him, he said he had just been divorced, and that is why he is on reddit so much, then more and more excuses came out of him.  Why can&#39;t they just admit when they are caught?</p>

<p>Clearly alluding to the fact that he thinks I&#39;m some sort of divorcee turned internet shill. Which is frankly despicable and pathetic. If the poster claims to be one and wants to air their grievances, so be it, but when they refuse to show respect under a thin veil of sarcasm, then I don&#39;t find myself obliged. Do you? Did I insult you in any way before you not only accused me of being a shill but then went on to PM me and call me fake <em>after</em> I gave an honest response? Can&#39;t you think of someone on the other side who is actually hurting and looking at reddit as some sort of escapism? You cannot fathom that??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because a lot of people think that the idea of the russia connection is itself a conspiracy.  Which is totally valid.  The thing that I think favors the people against the russia story is that most of the MSM is going full tin-foil with the russia stuff, but avoids other conspiracies like the plague.  To me, that means the russia conspiracy is better discussed in the million and one places on reddit where they&#39;re discussing it, and r/conspiracy is a better place for the topics you&#39;d get banned for mentioning in those other places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far more than that, though. It&#39;s actively attacking and discounting any mention of it, to the point that &quot;No evidence!&quot; is a frequent refrain. Multiple resignations; refusals, Trump himself admitting in Tv interviews and tweets to several of the allegations, and yet around here the conspiracy is verboten.</p>

<p>Good job deflecting from the actual issue, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to explain yourself to me or anyone else, man. A lot of the people on here are just trying to protect this sub and are searching for the smallest crumb of evidence to out anyone as a shill. Don&#39;t take it too personally, we all love this forum and it does seem to be under direct attack. Just keep an open mind and be willing to discuss your point of view, and you can&#39;t be a shill. I don&#39;t care to go through your history, but, for what it&#39;s worth, you seem pretty genuine to me.</p>

The amount of time and effort you&#39;ve sunk into Reddit is weird... and for what? Fake internet points. Wouldn&#39;t your friends or family concerned about you?

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man, I set myself about six-eight weeks and I am going for therapy and stuff like that. The correlation is simple man. I don&#39;t feel like talking to anyone except behind this mask of anonymity. Like I said, I work in a place where I can reddit, heck I&#39;m doing it right now. I&#39;ve sunk in like 3-4 hrs a day on Reddit, it&#39;s not crazy you know ? Not great either. And I get most of my karma binging on news on politics. It&#39;s been a great few weeks for news.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doing it for fake internet points. I&#39;ll delete this account real soon. It&#39;s just a way for me to stop brooding over things lost and to give me an excuse to shut off my mind. I know this isn&#39;t great for me. I&#39;ve tried to stop, but it&#39;s tough. What do I do when I&#39;m bored at work? Text my wife? Plan vacations? Buy her gifts? I can&#39;t do a damn thing. Talk to my Dad? Fuck no, he&#39;s pissed off that &quot;I didn&#39;t take care of it.&quot;  </p>

And it used to be that even when they really hammered a post, you still got the general vibe that freethinkers here weren&#39;t just swallowing all the bait.  But what was once just a trickle has turned into a deluge where it becomes hard to even come up for air.  We used to be small and obscure enough that we mostly went unnoticed and unshilled, but I guess we hit enough hot topics to get the full wrath.  And listen, I will be the first to tell you that there are shills on all sides from all angles, but there is a particular kind of shill that is absolutely dominant here, and I believe it is the kind employed at Eglin with the task of keeping this bullshit narrative going about what our country has become as long as they can.   I think we really got too close to too many &quot;national security issues&quot; like rampant child abuse at high levels, and crimes against our democracy.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting point. I think it&#39;s likely that Eglin was/is manipulating votes and actually shilling to a lesser degree, but I had never considered the traffic stats reddit released might just have been about gathering the data. </p>

<p>Though on further thought, I doubt that would have been enough to make it the most addicted city. I&#39;ve done some work with the API, and on average you can collect all public reddit data with about 1-4 requests per second. Even a modest city would do a few orders of magnitudes higher than that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if any of the papers are published, I&#39;ve only ever given this a surface-level look. But there&#39;s a bit about one of the studies messaging users to see their responses in the comments there (I don&#39;t know if this was even reddit).</p>

<p>Researchers do take an active role on social media all the time though. Maybe I shouldn&#39;t mention that here or I&#39;ll start off a load of hell, there&#39;ll be thousands of published papers and many more that aren&#39;t. Even my teenage niece had a class project where they tracked the number of Facebook likes on different types of posts using fake profiles!</p>

<p>Eglin wasn&#39;t in &quot;Top cities by total visits,&quot; it was &quot;Most addicted city (over 100k visits total).&quot; Which seems to mean time spent using the site rather than hits/requests per &quot;Most addicted language (avg. time on site).&quot;</p>

<p>But all governments these days are active on social media and because it&#39;s global they can&#39;t really claim that foreign propaganda efforts don&#39;t affect ideas at home, let alone counter-propaganda. I can see the need when everyone else is escalating the situation but it&#39;s not a very comfortable thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allowing &quot;shill finger pointing&quot; just means that anyone you disagree with can be branded a shill, and they will do the same to you.  Not every dissenting opinion means they&#39;re being paid by the opposition, but that&#39;s where it goes when allowed.  If you don&#39;t believe me, imagine my next response to whatever you say is, &quot;Fuck you, shill&quot; and imagine how quickly the discussion ends.</p>

<p>I personally think the problem is mods who are way too relaxed about allowing obvious bullshit to exist here to be spun by these outside forces.  The other day there was an article about the death of &quot;Beranton J. Whisenant, Jr.&quot; who was labeled as &quot;investigating DNC voter fraud&quot; which is a lie.  He was not doing that.  He&#39;s investigated fraud in the past and was most recently investigating passport problems.  </p>

<p>The mods allowed that phony story stand here, accumulating right wing propaganda and inviting more people to make shit up about this guy.  Eventually, the story was corrected to make it about the Awan Brothers, because since they left the country, they&#39;d obviously need passports and OH HEY LOOK AT THAT Whisenant, Jr. was investigating passports.  That&#39;s the new link, the new theory, the new story, now that becomes fact in people&#39;s minds because it was never subjected to any scrutiny, it was just molded to fit an existing anti-DNC narrative.  </p>

<p>A dead man became a political tool and no one here wanted to stop that.  That&#39;s what&#39;s broken about this sub, moderators have allowed it to openly be utilized by those who&#39;d like to control the narrative, we&#39;re not the one&#39;s who are thinking for ourselves, we&#39;re still the sheep.

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is a good part of that which is shilling from the Donald.  I think many many people actually thought he would be able to come in and change the corruption, and maybe they will simply not give up that hope, and express it in all the wrong ways.  I will say I have never seen a full fledged attack on a new president such as this in my lifetime.  It goes beyond sore losers and rings much more like &quot;we will all hang if he wins&quot;  Just imagine being a high level government official who helped to steal your citizens freedoms, when all of a sudden there is a chance your crimes will come to light, and you will have to face the repercussions of selling out your countrymen.  I think that type of response is what we are seeing a lot of.  Fear of real change.  Fear of people waking up to the atrocities being committed daily in there name by both parties. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about what would happen if, say, a total outsider/concerned citizen ran for office on the platform of absolutely no bullshit wedge issues will be dealt with during their term because the only point of their term is to fix the real shit all Americans agree on (hopefully that person would have support on all sides) who also promised to have some official polling website (with a thumbprint and whatever security is needed) where citizens can vote on every issue, and the person who gets into the office of POTUS, senator, congressman, promises to vote the way the poll went, which would be a vote for what the people actually want. Is this something that could possibly work or is this the craziest pie in the sky idea?</p>

<p>Okay, what if that person (who might be mildly suicidal and doesn&#39;t mind the risk) also publicly says &quot;The deep state can&#39;t afford to give up its power and doesn&#39;t want it returned to the American people, so they can&#39;t afford to let me become POTUS in order to do that, so don&#39;t be surprised if they kill me because I&#39;m trying to return the country back to the American people.&quot; Would that help raise awareness with the head-in-the-sand types when the inevitable happens?

    <div class="md"><p>Why am I not surprised people are already posting about how it&#39;s just this one side getting away with it?  Or that the mods have decided to favor certain topics over others.  What many of the shills here don&#39;t realize is that we are ANTI ESTABLISHMENT.  If we followed a candidate because they presented themselves as anti establishment, that should not come as a surprise.  Maybe those of us with hope for change were duped, but when you have mainstream media OPENLY calling for a deep state overthrow of a democratically elected president there is a HUGE problem, and there are far too many posters coming on here siding with the establishment, MSM, and the deep state.  I don&#39;t care if we elected Mary fucking poppins, if she was elected, she gets her chance.  It is simply unamerican to try to overthrow the president no matter what you believe.  </p>

<p>Do you mean impeachment? Because that is not a deep state coup, that is one of the checks and balances this country was founded on. You are seeing downvotes because it looks like you are an &quot;anti-establishment&quot; Trump supporter who is complaining can about shills taking over the sub just days after a giant pro-trump botnet was exposed on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Pro-Trump botnet&quot; is the farthest thing from either neutral <em>or</em> accurate.  </p>

<p>First and foremost it was not a &quot;botnet.&quot;  A botnet is typically hundreds of thousands if not millions of Internet connected devices which have been compromised through malware, used to either promulgated infectious code or to be used in a DDoS attack.  This was a few alt accounts with &quot;bots&quot; (really just a few lines of code available for all the world tocpick up) copy pasting from popular posts.  There is a world of difference between a botnet and what this was.</p>

<p>And furthermore, they were blatantly reposting garbage from T_D, that does not automatically make it &quot;pro-Trump.&quot;  You are making that assertion yourself and passing it off as fact.  As many others have pointed out, they were <em>so</em> sloppy about it, it was as if they were asking to get caught.  At the very least they certainly weren&#39;t trying to be sneaky about it.</p>

<p>Once again, you speak of an unknown as an absolute and expect me to just accept it.  That is both disingenuous and insulting of my intelligence and I don&#39;t appreciate it.  </p>

<p>Would you like to provide proof of your claims?  Or would you like to admit that we don&#39;t truly know the origin of the alt accounts&#39; user(s) and therefore can not use them as evidence as right wing brigading or shilling?  Because those are really the only two options if you are here for a serious discussion.</p>

Within a week or so you will see a paradigm shift in how certain people post. Almost like they were being guided! Huh.</p>

<p>I am getting tired of it. Worse, I am getting tired of being manipulated where I start questioning my own sanity the way some of these people do things. </p>

<p>rmwe... The neocon/neolib continuum are all against Trump right now. You can actually see the lines pretty much crystallized. Certain democrats and republicans specifically working to take down Trump using all the old tricks in the book. Even using foreign  and domestic resources to do so, both from outside and within government. The Deep State is not going to ever expose themselves. They are going to work within the lines to take down Trump. The way you see them expose themselves is in what resources are being used, how they are being used, and who is using them.</p>

<p>Such a weird thing for a 3 month old account that spends most its time defending Trump to say. You can simply label everyone who opposes Trump as a neocon/neolib deepstate agent if you want, but Trump makes is responsible for his own actions and words, and if you cant understand why he is deeply unpopular for them, I don&#39;t know what to say.</p>

<p>It is impossible to have a discussion without brigading and shilling. I think the only possible solution is to get rid of rule 10 in regards to calling people shills.</p>

<p>Then all conversations will devolve into shill accusations. The same as it was when the rule was made. </p>

<p>But I definitely feel where you are coming from, and agree to a point. 80% even sounds right, I just don&#39;t think it is hopeless. </p>

<p>I have done a few things that have greatly improved my experience here. First I try to treat everyone with a little respect. Also, getting to know usernames of the people that are genuine and contribute, tagging suspicious accounts with RES, and learning to walk away from unproductive conversations. With all that, the sub is still completely usable for me. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve accused people of being shills and then they&#39;ve responded with things that you think are manufactured just for sympathy? How many &quot;shills&quot; have you confronted?

<p>Really now? Point me to another instance. Or you can PM me a screenshot or something if you don&#39;t want to discuss it publicly.

    <div class="md"><p>One of the mods <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6diw9w/some_thoughts_on_how_to_use_this_sub/">said</a> it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This sub might best be seen as a mess of obfuscation and disinformation where sometimes, the truth is able to slip through a crack. We can&#39;t fight that obfuscation without sealing the cracks. The best we can hope for is to catch a glimpse of that truth and help it find it&#39;s way to others. This sub is not and cannot be some beacon of truth, be it your truth or mine; at it&#39;s best, though, it can be the last large refuge on this site where that truth has a chance to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political astroturfing on the internet exists largely because of a loophole in FEC rules. I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5v82uq/if_you_were_to_write_your_representative_about/">posted</a> about it a few months ago.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that if this loophole is closed, CTR/Shareblue would not engage in massive astroturfing operations like they are doing now.</p>

<p>Say what you will about US political process, but it is largely legal. I am actually more optimistic about convincing our representatives to close that loophole as the most effective solution to the problem than any other approach.</p>

The reason I have so much is because I comment early on threads and I did that when I was binging on news. If you really really cared for my well-being, and you were interested to find out what&#39;s going on, you would check this stuff out: see the number of comments I&#39;ve posted close to the article&#39;s posting two weeks back and compare that number to today. Or the last few days. It&#39;ll be significantly fewer. Because I&#39;ve been getting better and <em>not</em> binging on politics. Trying to get out and enjoy life. Trying to hike. To go to the gym. To grab a social dinner. Things like that.</p>

There are a lot more pedophiles walking amongst the shadows than we realize, they live on the internet and they are very comfortable here on reddit. The first night pizzagate broke I saw that all the pedophiles hung out at the me_irl forum, first two posts was like 25000+ upvotes of a shirtless ~8 year old with all the commenters slobbering over him, it was disgusting. These people already have the front page planned out tomorrow hour by hour, and they have their <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> attack plan which mainly involves the attitude of &quot;how do you idiots believe this bullshit?&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder what kind of content we would see on the sub if only self-posts were allowed? That seems like it would cut down on the spam and require that users provide context for whatever it is they want to talk about in the post. Do you think this would promote more original content on the sub?</p>

<p>Perhaps we could trial it at once or twice per week... Self-post Fridays/Saturdays would be cool imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shit... I assure you I am a real American, and have held teh views that I do now for a very long time. Longer than the last election cycle. You cannot delegitimize our views by saying we are not real. You know damn well that the shilling is primarily from a few specific groups at the moment. Most here have never denied that Russia is indeed a dangerous enemy, but when Russia is being used as a prop to stifle dissent and question the patriotism of those questioning their motives, something is seriously wrong. OP, why don&#39;t you try seeing things from our perspective? I have tried for so long to see them from yours and many others. So far the only real subversion I have seen comes from the destruction of family and traditional values, and the destruction of jobs through an increasing reliance on technology. I have seen even the subversion of what it means to be a man or a woman. We are heading down dangerous paths, and only a fool would think it will stop here. This kind of thing snowballs. Now you have the left, which by the late 80s and 90s had been largely co-opted by corporate interests, lose their souls. These neoliberals are one and the same as neocons. Both sides are using divide and conquer tactics, and this Russian narrative is one of them. Please wake up, OP. You are either falling for the propaganda of the west, or you are willfully aiding that propaganda. Right now we have to weigh all information that comes from all sides, not just the Russian version of things. Sadly we live in a twisted globalized world and we can no longer trust our side since our side is a figment of our collective imaginations. National boarders are being decimated and national pride is becoming a thing of the past. Our very leaders are lobbying for foreign powers throughout the world, and we can honestly no longer call our politicians Americans. We are in a lot of trouble, and your post is muddying the waters. </p>

<p>That completely depends on the topic at hand. Some threads seem to be 99% astroturf, others appear to be 99% legitimate. I would say that other than the ones that get brigaded hard or ones that get hit from r/all, most still has a majority of legitimate users. The vote manipulation is basically systemic and unavoidable, but votes don&#39;t really matter anyway. </p>
