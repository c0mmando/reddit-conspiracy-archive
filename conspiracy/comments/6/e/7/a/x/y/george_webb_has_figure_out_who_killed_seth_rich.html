       The Pakistani's are the Awan brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same Awan brothers that were hired for IT and are now being investigated by the Capitol Police. It was one of their laptops that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was threatening the police chief to try to get back. Espionage, theft, blackmail..they're involved in a lot of shadey shit.

       Yeah except that's not what you did at all. You gave "constructive criticism" saying the OP should post a summary of the videos and asked which one is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone responded and gave you the information, you linked to a mocking image about the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry that you think concern trolling ('constructive criticism,' lol) and then mocking a sincere response is the same thing as "asking about details."

       You linked to an image, mocking the connections made. You offered zero rebuttal, and instead just dismissed it. Which, again, is something you do often on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least own what you do instead of pretending you're just some truth-seeker. The gap between what you claim you're doing and what people can plainly see you doing is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       What, specifically, do you find so mock-worthy about the information provided here. If you're going to demand a level of sophistication from other people, you could at least make the effort yourself instead of just dismissals and mockery.

      <p>
       How about someone provide some actual proof that Seth Rich was killed by the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did anybody every provide proof of Pizzagate to Hillary Clinton or Podesta? Nope. Just a bunch of random youtube, 4chan, voat posts attempting too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with this Seth Rich fiasco. I'm not the one who has to demand a level of sophistication because as I said, I remain skeptical about the whole thing. Until someone shows me something otherwise which could change my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that Seth Rich was murdered. I agree the Awan brothers are real and had access to Democratic computers. I'm not dismissing individual facts. I am simply not agreeing with and remain skeptical of the theory that the DNC had Rich killed.

       How about you refute the claims in the video you watched?

       Again, you're comfortable making demands of

       people and how they should respond, but you just summarily dismiss information/theories you don't like with zero explanation.

       You "remaining skeptical" is not a refutation.

       Tell me how Alpha Jollah set up the murder? The guy in the video just says "Alpha Jollah is the one who set up the murder of Seth Rich"
      </p>
      <p>
       He then goes on to say that Pakistani's set up Jollah.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is he coming to these conclusions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the proof that Jollah hired two MS-13 guys?
      </p>
      <p>
       He says "again, I've got lots of foot-prints" (connections) But he doesn't list any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he goes on the say that Jollah is Boko-haram or Al-Qaeda.
      </p>
      <p>
       he doesn't even know anything about this guy. He didn't even know which one Jollah was in the picture (as he admits).

       Well that's a pretty disingenuous summary of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly why I don't understand you being a mod of this sub. It's a conspiracy sub. By its very nature there are often times when assumptions must be made based on the best information available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Webb doesn't have me fully convinced, but he's provided a long chain of information and analysis leading up to this. You're free to disagree with it, but watching one video and then saying
       <em>
        wow he doesn't have definitive proof of the conspiracy this is so ridiculous!
       </em>
       really misses the point of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, feel free to disagree with particular connections he made, but the lack of definitive proof is why the story is in
       <strong>
        this
       </strong>
       sub and not on a news sub at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is what motivated my original question. If you think that a lack of total proof is grounds for mocking users and different conspiracy theories, why do you want to be a mod on this sub?

       This argument within the video has 0 factual information and going back to my original point of even commenting in here, the submission had 0 context to go along with this post/video.

       I read it all. It's okay to be skeptical of things here, but I agree with you. Out of all the crazy things posted here, a mod here trying to call this post fake is suspicious. And by nature of this sub, it's smart for us to be suspicious of our mods. He is entitled to be skeptical of your post, but he is not immune to us being skeptical of his intentions. I would think a mod of a sub like this would encourage users to be skeptical of any mod who posts polarizing opinions. It's only fair for that to go both ways.

       TBH it's tough to summarize because it's a 15ish minute video that not only contains a ton of info (not saying it's all accurate, just that there's a lot of it), but is also built upon previous videos.

       Skepticism is quite simply "doubt" and consists of refusing to make-up your mind or to commit one way or the other until more is known and quite possibly not even then because the actual answer may in fact lay somewhere else altogether which is another possibility that any skeptic worth being called one always takes into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Disbelief", however, isn't. It is an obvious commitment to a contradictory position because that is "believed" in the same sense and manner as what it opposes is, instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were an honest skeptic you could accept and admit that what's under discussion is within the realm of possibility but unlikely from your perspective without more definitive proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not need to dismiss or discount it, and if you were actually as skeptical as you claim, you wouldn't, but rather await any further and more convincing developments.

       I'd agree and I wish that's what was happening. Instead, there's a tendency for "skeptics" to just summarily dismiss and mock the claims and then demand absolute proof of the claims when pushed back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is a standard that, by the very nature of this sub, is almost always impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point is what I responded to here, when a user asked for context, it was provided, and then they linked to a mocking image in response.

       Well, the timing works and that'd explain the crazy chase and shootout in DC on July 13th --the three men supposedly arrested were Keyante Edwards, 19; Alpha Jalloh, 18; and Keith Jones, 20.

       It would be ironic if Jalloh did contract a hit on Seth but why would some petty MS-13 gang members randomly shoot Rich and not steal his wallet. It seems like they would at least take his cash.

       It's also sketchy that an 18 year old would be in charge of a high level DNC hit-man operation.

       It is possible that they weren't sent to kill him, but to scare him or rough him up. Drunk Seth fights back and is scuffling with 1 of the guys while the other pulls out a revolver and pops him a couple times. Thugs get scared as they were not expecting to have shot him and flee as fast as possible.

       Possible, yes.  Likely, no. This hit was planned to the nth degree. However, they didn't take into account the volume of sheer hatred for Hillary and didn't even consider she could lose the election. Had she won the details would have been skewed so twisted she would be using him as a poster child for gun control.

       Objectivity is good, but if this sneering is what we should expect from you as a mod, it would be in everyone's interest for you to give up the position. If you as a mod won't take the high ground, why should anyone else be expected.
       <br/>
       And threatening enforcement of rule 12 when you are questioned is very worrying and suggests that you might very well enforce based off of how you feel and not what's in the best interests of the sub.

       I understand and agree 100% with wanting more information and context however sneering and throwing rules out to suit yourself is not the way to nurture critical thinking. OPs context is weak at best but it's not the worst that's allowed. You need to hold yourself to a higher level than the other users.

       that makes almost no sense.  MS-13 is the hitman of the Mexican Mafia (La eMe , "The M").
      </p>
      <p>
       MS-13 is a brutal gang and murders people in brutal ways.  They prefer machetes.
      </p>
      <p>
       100% MS-13 would not leave Seth alive.  I bet it was some dumbass DNC amateur hitman.  No real hitman would do just 2 shots to the back and leave the target alive.

       ...unless they were instructed to do so, for the purposes of extracting his organs. Which is what Webb is stating happened, based on the pings from Rich at the hospital that amounts to a black ops site. Plus, the initial line was that the parents were present at the hospital (and could thus sign off on the organ donor sheet) only for that narrative to later change. It's also congruous with other Clinton/deep state murders.

       Why do you keep directing people to the video? If this information is so important and mind blowing shouldn't it be converted into a more easily digestible format? I have a new conspiracy about your conspiracy. I think you are just trying to feed views to that YouTube channel.

       I've watched a few of his videos in the last week and it was all just rambling speculation. I'll check out this video when I get a chance, but I doubt that he "has figure out who killed Seth Rich."

       It's a very interesting article. I think the dam is about to burst. Those involved need to stop thinking in terms of how they can cover it up because I think it's too late for that.

       The European Union Times pulls a lot of content from Sorcha Faal. The EU Times not a credible publication at all. It's a weird combination of neo-nazi and more general conspiracy theory pieces with no attempt at fact-checking.

       It does seem that way, but he's provided a lot of evidence and sources for his information along the way.  It's hard to keep up with , and he doesn't seem to really want to do summaries that comprehensively recap everything.. So it's hard to get new people on board with it because they see him spouting stuff off and it sounds like he's just assuming a bunch of wild shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying everything he says is correct, but he's certainly been willing to admit when he was wrong and change his mind based on new evidence.  I haven't been able ot keep up with it like i Used to (i watched the first 140 days , every day).. and I feel a bit lost

       I have to jump in here as yet another random poster and say Dude... people questioning the narrative can't
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       be shills.  Some of us just don't want to get played as sheep falling for crap.  I'm ready to believe the facts.  But if you recall, just a few days ago there was a redacted FBI document that mentioned Seth Rich and for hours that was
       <strong>
        the smoking gun!!
       </strong>
       Annnnnd, then it was debunked as crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who was the fool/shill/gullible idiot that day?  The people that questioned or the people who wanted to believe so badly they got played?

       Nobody said all evidence should be thrown out.  I'm saying it's healthy to remain skeptical of the outpouring of information by people who seem to be buttering their bread with viewers/followers.

       Yes. "We" as in the grouping of random redditors you apparently think are all shills. You don't say "us" when you're using yourself and someone as a subject. "Who are us getting paid by?" wouldn't make much sense would it? Therefore I used the word "we".

       You're right about the war on drugs, but to pin it all in Nixon is absurd.  Every president, and most of congress, since 1914 has been on board with that war.  Obama was the only president who started to de-escalate it marginally.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Back when he was running for president in 2008, Barack Obama insisted that medical marijuana was an issue best left to state and local governments.
        <strong>
         "I'm not going to be using Justice Department resources to try to circumvent state laws on this issue," he vowed
        </strong>
        , promising an end to the Bush administration's high-profile raids on providers of medical pot, which is legal in 16 states and the District of Columbia.
       </p>
       <p>
        But over the past year, the Obama administration has quietly unleashed a multi­agency crackdown on medical cannabis that goes far beyond anything undertaken by George W. Bush. The feds are busting growers who operate in full compliance with state laws, vowing to seize the property of anyone who dares to even rent to legal pot dispensaries, and threatening to imprison state employees responsible for regulating medical marijuana. With more than 100 raids on pot dispensaries during his first three years, Obama is now on pace to exceed Bush's record for medical-marijuana busts. "There's no question that Obama's the worst president on medical marijuana," says Rob Kampia, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project. "He's gone from first to worst."

       Obama had countless opportunities to do something about cannabis, yet it's still a schedule 1 drug. Even hemp is still illegal to grow (WTF?). And the USA still leads all other nations in prison population. Obama is either really fucking stupid, incompetent, or he actually

       I said he has marginally de-escalated it, not that he ended it, or that he kept all his election promises, or that he was passing joints after white house dinners instead of vodka martinis.

DEA officials this week declined to discuss the rescheduling process, although agency leaders earlier this year announced they were again considering the change in a letter sent to Congress. They didn't specify a date by which they'd reach a decision.

       I feel this is more important because the ones who are keeping that war going are the ones who are currently in power now. We topple them and we start anew. We have to take out the ones who enforce idiotic and strict drug laws and invest in private prison systems.

       Personally, I'm not a fan of these kinds of videos.  I've been burned too many times by cheesy music and fantastic claims that turn out to be nothing, so 99% of them have been a waste of time so I skip them altogether.  I AM a fan of timelines and connections.  Care to break it down and ELI5?

       I'd like to, but it would read like a Game of Thrones script where it's easy to get lost in moving parts and it comes across as complicated and uninteresting. If you watch it, it's a lot more interesting and some of the things he says will resonate with a few conspiracies that you already know to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've suggested to others is to just start with the most recent day, 219, and then follow from there. That'll tell you if it's worth going back to watch the whole thing.

       That's why outlines are important.  I'm not asking anyone to spoon-feed info to me, but starting on day 219 and going backwards sounds like asking me to read a book backwards.  Honestly, it seems to me like this guy
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       it to be convoluted to keep people hanging with no real results.  And one can't expect to make the claim that
       <em>
        "George Webb has figured out who killed Seth Rich"
       </em>
       without providing some kind of synopsis for those who haven't been watching the first 219 days.

       Yes, it should be banned because the title is misleading. There is precisely zero evidence or proof in those videos. Just some rambling about used cars and CIA connection without any evidence. This is blatantly using Seth's death to promote his right-wing agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Web is sick. He doesn't care about Seth or the wishes of the people that actually knew him best, his parents. pleaded with us to stop using their son's death for political gain? If you cared about him, you wouldn't piss all over his body and parade it around the Internet to make your team look better. How shameful.

       If he had anything, I'd be the first to up-vote, but this is just garbage, no better than the FBI note that fool so many on this sub the other day.

       You are right this man has basically

        dug up Seth Rich's body and shat in his mouth,

       furthermore he has pretty much
       <strong>
        went round to his parents house and shat on their front doorstep.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       After that it would appear that he went and visited Seth's (ex) girlfriend and
       <strong>
        pissed in her mouth.

       This reminds me of the election season when I was helping the efforts to dig into the Wikileaks, spreading it around... and all I was seeing "out there" was Clinton having a 99% chance of winning the election.
      </p>

       Since then, I refuse to use the mainstream media as the barometer for reality. It's the propaganda arm of the deep state. I truly think more people know what's going down than we're made to believe.

       DWS security guys brother runs a stolen car ring that the DNC uses for covert operations,  and that he was employed by her to recruit a guy who is involved in the stolen car ring to murder Seth Rich?  Is this what's going on in this video?

       I don't understand the connection between the Democrat in Seattle driving a stolen car stolen from Seattle,  a car theif in New Jersey,  a brother of an IT guy for DWS.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... They have local car theif rings ran from many major cities in America?  Ran by a used car dealer in Virginia??  That ships out cars for DNC use? And what's the tie to the car theif in New Jersey?  How do we know they had any contact?  And what makes that car thief anyone of the thirty arrested a more likely suspect? And what proof do we have that DWS is involved in this in any way? Besides having employed two of his brothers?

       The small world experiment shows indication that everyone is connected to everyone else by on average 6 degrees of separation. Seems to me what's happening here,  pinning something to someone based on the fact that someone knows someone that knows someone....

       This is masterful disinfo.  He moves so quickly and makes enormous leaps, but he's dropping so many names and dates you get lured into thinking that it's proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says that his evidence that it's this guy is that Russian Intelligence was warning authorities about Jahlah. He then makes the (somewhat logical) connection that because he was released directly after being busted for the car theft ring in november- he must be an FBI informant.  I have no idea where he came up with an MS13 AQ connection for this guy, or where he came up with KimDotcom being an FBI informant who ratted out Rich to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't tell if this guy is schizophrenic or doing professional disinfo.  He makes a few good connections and calls attention to interesting characters (there's evidence that there are politically affiliated characters illegally exporting luxury vehicles, laundering campaign finance funds, and probably financing terror), but then he very quickly draws huge conclusions that are based on loosely connected bits of information.  It really prays on beliefs and the schizophrenic nature of a lot of conspiracy theorists.

       I think it's important to question the narrative. Trumps right wing propaganda narrative is so painfully obvious. Find a point to attack so you're not defending when the whole IC is saying "yeah he's fucked."
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not understand why the only narrative that's not ok to question is Trumps to his supporters. They are questioning WaPo, neocons,  NYT,  neo cons, dems,  liberals,  even fox news at times... But never the one fed you them by the Trump propaganda machine.

       Rote memorization has always been part of that misguided approach to education.  If you haven't looked into it, check out the Skull and Bones Society's role in education as documented by Charlotte Iserbyt (senior policy advisor on education under the reagan administration) and Antony C Sutton (Hoover institution Economics Scholar).

       I've noticed this recently, too. People are so overwhelmed with (dis) information that is too difficult to parse and is constantly being refuted, that it's become necessary to people to just stand strong on their beliefs and it's driving emotions. I suspect that it's just an aspect of tribalism and mass- psychology that's being used against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly been exploited by the group leading the "deplorables", who on reddit used the same meme and circlejerk strategies that we've seen successfully employed by other social activist identity groups on here.  But remember that what you are seeing there is a vocal minority which is deliberately taking up more space than they represent, to appear much larger than they are.

       "4d chess".  The Trump supporters see him as combatting the enemy, so they aren't worried about vetting the validity of his propaganda.  I think the core supporters you're seeing are "reactive" in that they're goaded into reacting AGAINST what they see as an existential threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's happening on "both sides" of the political dichotomy right now, though it's traditionally been a term reserved for "conservatives".  I'm seeing the dualistic bating being pushed very hard by the media right now and the divide is growing more and more between what the two sides believe.  Belief no longer just refers to values, but to FACTS and what is objectively true.  Pick a side or rot.  That's the postmodernist political sphere we're currently dwelling in.

       a lot of people say that conspiracy theorists are just trying to make sense of a complicated world.  we see patterns that aren't there (apophenia) because it would be too scary to realize that the world is just chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       that's true to an extent- it's human nature to categorize systems.  but patterns are real.  we all draw different determinations from those patterns.  Most of us think the JFK assassination was a conspiracy.  Some of us are very specific about the details of that conspiracy.  Some of us probably think it was moonbeavers who killed kennedy.

       and they make us look bad, so people are less likely to take our process seriously, and immediately jump to calling us "moonbeleavers" every time we make a cogent argument contradicting official narratives.

       Same conclusion i came to months ago. For me personally though, his disinfo is meant to obfuscate the truth about DNC corruption. The corruption is obvious to anybody watching the election... I'm no Trump supporter, i just want accountability for both parties if they plan to keep running for office.

       but i watched enough of his early eric braverman videos in consecutive order to be absolutely confident that this is either disinformation or he is mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's one of his early visualization videos which is clearly marketed to paranoid schizophrenics ("targeted individuals" who believe they are being "gangstalked" by government agents).  It uses all the right buzzwords, but is extremely convoluted while trying to appear linear and logical-

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUtyL0OW5GM
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had schizophrenia, I suspect this would all be very convincing.  His method of pointing to what are basically word clouds while verbalizing loose connections and very high level conclusions is a very effective technique for convincing people of associations based on feeling.  It FEELS similar to someone like corbet, whose analytical technique is more rational and linear, but borrows from the more scattershot approach that alex jones takes.  But alex jones is making the connections ad hoc and has this very big concept of "they", whereas webb is making planned presentations with a very unique format and associating very specific groups and individuals, which is a bit unsettling.

       I always tend to need an ELI5 around here, because some of this stuff is just so tangled and convolluted so bare with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that Webb has proved that the Awan brothers were running car dealerships in the US. However, he is
       <em>
        alleging
       </em>
       that they were stealing cars so that people within the DNC can use them. Why? I'm assuming they wouldn't want some random staffer driving around in a stolen car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I lost because I haven't watched all of Webb's other videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in his latest video (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWt84hwNZMQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWt84hwNZMQ
       </a>
       ) he mentions Michael Posillico getting ISI (Awan brothers) into the United States, which is also what

       When you start the studying the occult one of things they like do would be to "throw it in your face." These people realize that humanity does not see the connection or "oneness" of the universe. When they set something up business, false flag and really anything they do; it is littered with their symbolism and numerology. So yea it is a joke, on us, the people who call it out are made fun of and ridiculed to hell. While the sleeping masses have the "proof" thrown right in their face but could never see it. If you've ever wondered why LSD and psychedelics are so heavily controlled, well...it really is dangerous to have people all of sudden think they are one and everything "connects."

       Call it what you want. I'll say it like I told one of my coworkers, lets say I haven't woken up out of the matrix and I'm being played. If this is all we have to go by, investigating unsolved murders, then why can't we look into it without being bombarded with backlash?

       That's interesting, but when keeping healthy skepticism in my interpretation of things I can't be sure it isn't apophenia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if intentional, I think it's done in the spirit of disinfo. I picture being a regular person who knows nothing of conspiracy theories hearing these bits of 'evidence' and laughing them off before I really get into the meat of the information. It throws surreal absurdity into the mix.

       Ok, ignoring that Blackwater was founded and named "Blackwater" in 1997 and that they are a private company with no reason to hide such a thing anyways (they could have called themselves Oil Warriors if they wanted), I can see those guys being coy enough to name themselves after what could earn them more money.  Regardless, I can't see any logical reason any espionage group would so blatantly out themselves that civilians on the internet could look at the name of the company and see CIA in it.  The excuse of needing to let other groups know who they are does not make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was actually the case, that they would need to let other groups know who they were and what they were doing, they would use actual freaking code that only these agencies know, and any time one agency has a suspicion that a company is acting weird they would run their code and see it is the CIA doing something and they'd move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I suspect actually happens is one agency might see something suspicious and then they will go and, you know, ask the other agencies if they have any resources there.  The reason I believe this to be the case is because putting CIA or whatever in their name means whatever other agency has to notice that to leave them alone.  So if the other agency doesn't notice for whatever reason they are fucked.  It just seems like such a weird and inefficient, possibly even dangerous, way of letting another agency know you are there.

       Thank you for voicing this opinion. As you said, it seams inefficient and counter productive, even a complete failure to operate by being "hidden in plain site", while having obvious names like CIA in their names. I've been reading conspiracy material for a long time and this has never made sense to me.

       I have a fundamental problem with finding patterns in numbers, geology, buildings etc that being if any connection is made, it tends to require a lot of faith and interpretation.

       I'm a science &amp; facts type of guy, I need to be able to validate something several different ways and leave no room for other theories.

       I don't think you need faith of interpretation you just need the right 'tools' of interpretation. If you can find the time watch or listen to the whole video. The last 20 minutes are mind blowing you could just watch that. It basically verifies itself using examples from all over the world.

       I think it's related to Karma. Where they can technical by-pass the Karmic consequences by at least 'putting it out there'. That leaves more questions, since If we're being manipulated, how are we supposed to be aware?

       I've heard about this In the context of freewill -- the ultimate law of the universe.  Assuming It means the controllers have to subtly tell us what is happening so they are not imposing their will on us without our consent/knowledge.

       Basically they see it as a twisted sense of fair play, signaling to those 'in the know' - both to those like them, and to people like us, who see it for what it is and get ridiculed for pointing it out.  Contrary to what a lot of people believe, the elite are not completely evil people that actively wish to do us harm - they see it as their divine destiny, their "role" in the great game, and that the ends justify the means.  They can evolve either through a positive OR negative Harvest - they just happen to be negative.

       From what I understand as he explained it, they do this every once in awhile as some sort of internal decree with the Elite - he described it basically as a task that he was obligated to fulfill by his 'upline' to answer our questions, provided the 'right questions' were asked as not to impugn on our Free Will and right "not to know".  Possibly a rite of passage within the Luciferians?

       As I understand it, this "window" may have been allowed in order to avoid karma issues, similar to how they do the hidden in plain sight thing.  Although a lot of similar info has been spoken about elsewhere, maybe sourced from the "Law of One," his info was much more revealing about the dark one's agenda.  I do suspect that they are taught some things that AREN'T true, however.  One thing that sticks out is how in a universe of free will, they believe they have to be negative to ascend.  Why not choose the service to others path?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I've been trying to locate newer info (as some of his predictions were obviously off) but haven't found anything yet.

       Omnithought.org has plenty of materials. Essentially, free will cannot be violated by any entity whatsoever, and so our permission must be obtained. You can research 'predictive programming' for example, whereby movies tell us what's coming so that we are less shocked and more accepting when it happens.

       The objective is exactly the opposite of what you suggest.
       <br/>
       First there are a excessive number of conspiracy theories that have later been proven correct. So you are wrong out of gate - or do you choose to believe that Saddam Hussein had WMD and hid them really, really well to maintain your world-view .... in which corruption does not exist.

       This is a really great and valid question.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to recognize the pattern you need to do a lot of research before it starts to click. But, I think I can break it down for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Teenagers drawing pentagrams on things, rebelling against whatever... it happens all over the place. Consider this at one end of the spectrum of effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have to stop and think about are when adults are making intentional Satanic connections and patterns systematically and going through a lot of effort to do it. (I use Satanic loosely, btw, you can alternatively use "occult" but that doesn't capture the menace behind it).
      </p>
      <p>
       For example Odin and Baphomet are very intentionally painted the same way.

       It seems a clear reference that could go all the way back to Horus. And this is where people get stopped up. We can all go to the Luxor and get Ancient Egyptian looking crap. It seems unbelievable to most people that a cult going all the way back is secretly controlling the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more to it, than that. Again, watch the effort of adults who systematically project patterns of Satanic references.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a form of wordless communication and signaling to other similarly aligned groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am confident there is evidence to suggest a way to express this problem is to think of the people in charge as "The Infiltrators."
      </p>
      <p>
       War is theater. Politics is theater. Power is exchanged through infiltration and the figureheads merely pawns for those who, at any given time and place, are the best at infiltrating. This is a very simple concept for people and it has been employed throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am asking you to believe that the the Infiltrators have infiltrated other infiltrators, who all have a history of believing in "secret knowledge" that they can employ to control others.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why most people dismiss what is going on. You actually have to take some time to get your head around it. It takes cognitive effort because the logical conclusion of infiltrating behavior is that there are multiple groups who have created multiple groups for the specific purpose of infiltrating political organizations, religions... any group with the ability to move people to action.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Infiltrators go way back, but the Infiltration Movement that concerns everyone right now began with the Wednesday Psychology Group and Sigmund Freud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a quick peak at some of this evidence that I am presenting you. Suspend your judgment for a minute and pretend like a teacher in a university class. Because this is a history lesson that is out in the open, is easily traced and merely employs textbook psychological principles to control the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to start with a study by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in cooperation with the US Air Force.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Some principles of mass persuasion: selected findings of research on the sale of United States war bonds."

        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the creation of Tavistock, they have been studying how to better mass persuade people. They work with our government and many other governments. On their own site, they call it "change consultancy" and reorganize police departments, hospitals and schools. It is an international effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/change-consultancy-tavistock-we-have-a-problem/">
        http://www.tavinstitute.org/projects/change-consultancy-tavistock-we-have-a-problem/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        …. help us to raise the level of strategic leadership competence among our second tier senior leaders, so that they can step up and take the business/organisation to it’s next level of development in the next 5-7 years. We have surveyed the talent of the 2nd tier, and as the executive board, we have found them to be highly skilled operationally but deficient in strategic thinking.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, I don't want you to get too tied up with just Tavistock. They aren't the only game in town. They are just the best example to work with, since they've been around so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tavistock studied Social Dreaming.

       So, what has happened here is that Tavistock has taken a religious experience and gone on to replicate it in a slightly different context. Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church, utilized social dreaming to get his followers to "see" angels and golden plates in their "mind's eye." (I won't get into his ties to the Masons, but the symbology is also found in early LDS church history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tavistock took all these religious movements and attempted to replicate the profound religious experiences in different contexts. They created the Children of God cult, which used "free love" and young boys and girls to "flirt to convert," essentially. River Phoenix came from this cult.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also created the "Process Church of the Final Judgment" who infiltrated Scientology and co-opted the Manson cult after his arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't find it lickity split, but you can see Manson becomes careful with his words and even says he doesn't want to offend, "the Masons or other groups." He was talking about the Process Church.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Cults are the best at mind control. Heaven's Gate proves that cult members will go so far as to kill themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, beyond the "Mass Persuasion" using "Media Assets" you have people on the ground being controlled by cults where The Infiltrators are calling the shots, unbeknownst to cult members.
      </p>

      <p>
       So, the Infiltrators are in control of your political groups, your religions, your tv, your radio and your government. Again, Elections are just theater. War is just theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have entities like the Air Force doing studies upon the people, the economy and these secret actors are, likely, infiltrated and have massive secret powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are conducted unethical human experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, you see, there are techniques that have been studied and have been employed and are being employed to gain complete control over people and populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the "scientific" front, they call it "systems psychodynamics." It is based on Wilfred Bion's "basic assumption" theories. In short, whenever the news is messing with or confirming your basic assumptions, it is a tool of policy change or a tool of maintaining the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are being sold "authoritarianism" at every level. From the news you watch and read, to the games you play, to the music you listen to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond "systems psychodynamics" at work, the occult practices... the secret knowledge... has also been employed against the populace and we know because of MK Ultra.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary part about all of this is that black magic, while it doesn't work the way you were raised to believe, it does, in fact work.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who believe in black magic do bad things. That is a real world consequence. Even people who dabble in it, who just want to check it out, have to do bad things to get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, these secret occult practices were studied and employed in the infiltration game. Like with scopolamine. This substance basically robs you of free will and can prevent you from remembering the things you did while under "mind control."
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       You can buy it on Alibaba.

      <p>
       People empty out their ATMs or participate in their own rape, then can't remember anything. If used right. If used wrong, it will kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the story of Socrates? Perhaps it has been secret knowledge since that story was written that scopolamine kills the voice of reason and it has been an apt metaphor reminder to history that people's free will are actively being robbed by those in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets worse, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret powders, double speak, secret symbols... systems psychodynamics... they work and you are falling for it because they are employing concrete psychological principles or scientific principles to work on your mind. Black magic does work. It just isn't magic. It is breaking the law and ethical boundaries and controlling the minds of as many people as possible to make them slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Infiltrators know this and the more "Black Magic" gets normalized, the more effect it can operate right under everyone's nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       With voluminous evidence, it is clear the CIA has been participating in the drug trade at the highest levels. Meanwhile, the movies and news are showing you that violent cartel members are in charge. The cartels are pawns. But, putting it in your face and showing you that it ends at an Escobar or an El Chapo, means people will ignore the CIA's involvement because "they aren't the real bad guys." (They are.)

      <p>
       So, before I get back to my day to day, I'll tell you what it all, potentially, adds up to. (I ran out of text in the first post.) This second post involves some conjecture, but I feel I have come across real worlds examples of what I am presenting. It is what the patterns and symbols "all over the place" are putting out there, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       One occult religious practice was torture. Ritualized abuse. I suspect Tavistock participated based on their archivists "War Time Studies" comments and have seen writing indicating that Goebbels also experimented in torture/trauma based mind control... meaning Operation Paperclip scientists were likely aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       You take a child, you treat them kind during the day, but at night you wake them up and torture them with masks on in every conceivable way. Under the pretext of "witches" or "alien abductions" or what have you, the victim is already immediately going to look crazy. So, whether the practitioners believe in it or not, the ritual aspect works specifically to compromise the victim's credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is worse than that, though. A side effect of this is multiple personality disorder, or dissociative personality disorder. Prolonged abuse and the most horrific abuse splits a person's personality into many parts, where one doesn't remember what happens to the other. It's a defense mechanism. An established psychological principal that human stumbled on long before the could comprehend the field of psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what makes it so crazy sounding. But, when asked, Charles Manson gives you the answer to the real secret. The Many Faced God.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2oZWpqtNi4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2oZWpqtNi4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Many Faced God/Moloch (The Great King)/Baphomet is the personification of this psychological defense mechanism people have and it sometimes results in an eidetic memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       While most people become broken and useless after persistent torture, a few can stop operate out in the world, revolving back and forth between personalities, where one may not know what the others are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult patterns are a reference to this, but they morph and take on so many forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       One answer to the original question is we see this because this practice is old and it is a practice of infiltration and co-opting religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing new, the Pharoahs allowed their people to have their gods, too. But the Pharoah reigned supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who have infiltrated religions preserve the religion merely as preserving another face of Moloch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Process Church is a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Process_Church_of_The_Final_Judgment">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Process_Church_of_The_Final_Judgment
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Process believes that, to varying degrees, these "God-patterns" exist within everyone. The main doctrine of The Process is the unity of Christ and Satan, who exist as opposites. Jehovah and Lucifer exist as opposites and when Christ and Satan are united, this will unite Jehovah and Lucifer.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       MK Ultra is exactly experimentation into all of this and everything "mass persuasion" and "mind control."
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is for a more "suggestible" population every day, with several layers of controlled opposition over the "umbrella" of ideas presented by mainstream media and pushed on the Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemicals. Black Magic. Psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is all being used and the population allows it because of a variety of ideas and influences that combine together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moloch/Manchurian/Many Faced candidates that make it through make perfect politicians who may not even know they, themselves, secretly worship Moloch. It is controlled MPD/Dissociative Disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, people like Aldous Huxley put forth "Brave New World" where happy slaves are achieved through chemicals... "Soma" Prozac. His ideas were inspired by the Opium War, if I recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orwell's notion is to spread slavery through technology and surveillance. Increasing the influence of a few upon the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth combines all of these things and that is why is it right in everyone's faces.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is new. We've had Crusades and Inquisitions and Holocausts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, these ideas are advancing in understanding and technique everyday and the world is not keeping up, in a lot of ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, there is always potential for change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem we have right now is simple, and it exists whether you agree with what I posit about the Many Faced God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government transparency. Everything should be reviewable after a number of years, so that we can go back and see what happened and fix it. 25 years. 50 years. Whatever. As a population, the people can only make good decisions for themselves if they are informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone stopped arguing and focused on this one issue, it would create a long term solution for the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it stands now, the Infiltrators are organized crime and they have infiltrated every large group of people you identify with in order to further divisiveness and evade any kind of accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlled opposition may sometimes tell the truth. Controlled opposition may seemingly agree with you, but anyone promoting war and slavery are promoting economic agendas and are actively working against the benefit of the People.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it would be great if I were wrong. But organized child abuse happens and politicians participate and nobody is doing anything about it. Nobody. No matter how fever pitch the debate reaches, we have never seen anyone of any real influence jailed for corruption. Only small fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is proven that the establishment has covered up child abuse, that it is an international problem and the reason it exists is far worse than people just getting their rocks off. The reason it is exists is because it serves a political and economic purpose where programs have been employed to employ "mind control" and "mass persuasion."
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, we have to take a stand against Infiltrators and transparency of government is the only way to expose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their own theology promotes volition and transcending unto free will, being capable of anything and achieving great power. Their beliefs are crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infiltrating is a chickenshit way of taking power and these chickenshits need to be exposed and held accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't powerful. It is cowardly. It is Unconstitutional. It doesn't belong in our country and we would do well to drive it from the world.
      </p>

       I would just like to note that as someone who has watched and read up on SRA and MKULTRA for the last 15 years, I have come to the conclusion that it is for the most part BS. Yes MKULTRA existed, and no there is no great evidence that it was involved with SRA or trauma based mind control. The same sources are always cited and debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the "Infiltrators", and the "occult". I've also looked into this for a really long time and come to the conclusion that it's a gross oversimplification of geo-politics, economics, and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to offer this contrary opinion and suggest people research it for themselves while keeping in mind what a primary, and secondary source is, while also understanding how to properly separate the truth from the noise. No I'm not a paid shill or whatever it is being called at the moment.

       Bishop Pace, of the LDS church, interviewed children every week for a year and a half across multiple states. How do you explain they all have the same stories? How do you explain the Dutroux Affair? The Finders Case? The evidence list in the Norwegian politicians scandal?
      </p>
      <p>
       SRA does not have to be widespread. It could just be another infiltrated group that requires extra secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of run of the mill pedophiles who operate in the same circuit, using the same networks. We know child torture happens. We know ritual abuse happens. It is in video in every part of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also cannibals. Ever visit zambianmeat.com?
      </p>
      <p>
       These small groups certainly exist and these things certainly exist in human nature and human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the greatest potential for creating infiltration ever, it seems naive to think that most organizations aren't infiltrated once they reach a certain level of influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operation Mockingbird is a great example. CIA Instructions to Media Assets are a great example. The Media just makes more groups to be infiltrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occult groups would, likely then also be infiltrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Espionage goes back as far as the beginning of human civilization, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to believe that the Infiltrators are in control, that they utilize the Tavistock researched "Matrix of Power" strategy, where they overcome hierarchical structures by planting people in a matrix across the organization and there is more to cults than black magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just a sliver of espionage an infiltration as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       By and large, the protected political pedophilia, like in the Pentagon case, demonstrates clearly that there is a matrix in place that is specifically designed to protect people for political reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's forensic interruption and entities like the "False Memory Syndrome Foundation" are a perfect example.
      </p>
      <p>
       By planting the FBI honeypot sites on the deep web, they are in the perfect place to catch people on co-opt these networks. We already know this happens. They are letting the big fish go in exchange for political influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while you may disagree to the extent of what MK Ultra or SRA happened or happens, I provided some really solid sources about how mass persuasion techniques work.
      </p>
      <p>
       To deny that espionage and counterintelligence haven't been playing this game since Sun Tzu, is to deny what has happened throughout the history of espionage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conradus' Cryptographia Denudata was a book written in latin, in the 1700s regarding cryptography. It was never published, only hand written by students who copied the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret of Greek Fire is lost to history. So is George Washington's invisible ink.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secrets are kept by employing these techniques and history has needed these techniques for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       To deny the Infiltrators aren't the ones who are most likely to be in power is to deny the second oldest profession.

       So what do we do then there's obviously more people than just yourself who know and realize these things and can put them together in such a way where is isn't conspiracy or coincidence and is concrete, what can we do to help change this status quo? Obviously not everyone who attains wealth and power falls into this category of evil and must see these things as well, are they doing anything or care enough to try and do anything? What hope do we have? Obviously this subject and knowledge is becoming more common to the lay person, will that alone help? It's all discouraging for someone like myself, young, educated, with the world ahead of me but it's hard not to be discouraged and to just say fuck it and do what I can to ensure my personal security and then check out. It all feels so daunting and that no matter what I do what I become what I attain, nothing will change. Those gears will grind and there's nothing we can do to stop it, you know?

       Well, I'm glad you somebody understood it.  I thought it was about as well written as the wiki page on social dreaming. Which is annoying, as I've had a slight interest in the Tavistock institute since all those years ago when I learned (from experience) that you couldn't write the words in a GLP post without getting banned or at the very least the words being replaced with somethinf else.  Anyone else remember that?
      </p>

       Also, I have a feeling that it would all tie in with my thoughts on a particular grafitti artist.

       My understanding is that the widespread occult symbology is the symbology of infiltration and that each religion is infiltrated by the worshipers of the Many Faced God that believes each religion is just another face.

       Worshippers of Odin would have been no different in that they are an ideology that will be targeted for infiltration.

       i like this post a lot. However i would like to point out, you can do black magic without getting involved in bad stuff. it just rarely happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Priests become priest because they want to control the interpretation of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops become cops to control the enforcement of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who practice occult magic typically do so for nefarious purposes. But that doesn't make it impossible to do without being or doing something evil.

       The Christian book of revelations predicts tptb will create a system that works. Although it only lasts a short while before it's true purpose is revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tptb seek the perfect system to use it to control the masses, like communism and its non-identical twin fascism. They are excellent tools of control and mass killings.

       I suppose the owl goes back to Minerva, generally, but in heiroglyphics, it is the sound of "M" and is associated with death. The Minerva Owl, I feel is the Egyptian owl, specifically because it is the one bird that the Egyptians drew face front, rather than sideways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note the Bohemian Grove owl, or the owl built into DC.

       The dollar bill with the al seeing eye. The Capitol of dc itself is built as an occult symbol. The logos on many global businesses are occult symbols as well. A simple internet search will show you ample proof. I myself am Christian and don't even display a cross in my home. "They" build build whole cities as a monument to their beliefs.

       Follow this link after reading my last comment about psychedelics causing you to think reality is "one." Seems innocuous. Just a church right? Well. If youve taken a psychedelic you would look at it as "one" continuous object. Instead of seeing walls, glass, place to sit and listen to the preacher you would something entirely different. You would immediately notice the eyes, the head and actually where the preacher sits it appears to be the mouth. A snakes head if you see it as one and do not focus on its individual parts. That is what they do "throw it in your face" but this stuff takes time to read and really grasp. Hence why it is called "esoteric"

       Early Mark Dice documentaries are good for showing the occult symbolism used in Hollywood which is a good start. 
Also look for vids on the masonic symbolism in the town planning and architecture of Washington DC. It's all hidden in plain sight.

       Have you read anything by Alister Crowley? Advertising with symbols, numbers, acronyms is how the sigil gains "power."
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many ways to make a sigil but here is one:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Write out your desire or manifestation.
"I want to rule the world"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Remove any vowels and repeating constanants.
"WNTRLHD"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now start writing out those letters in various combinations -- some big, some small, letters inside letters, extending off letters, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Continue to refine this until you have something abstract and in your opinion "magical" looking.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now comes the "fun" part. Lots of ways to imbue your sigil with power but a fairly common one is to masturbate to the idea/manifestation with the sigil infront of you and imagining it in your head.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Now go show the world your sigil, and the more people that "believe" in it, wear it on their t-shirt, put it on their cars, etc. means the outcome is more likely to manifest itself for you.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Learn some information theory.
       <br/>
       The salient point here is you can learn from your 'enemy' every time they lie because their actions will not match their words. Over time you can start to create a logical boundary (or tolerance) around what the truth must be.

       Piggybacking off of this comment, there is a guy named RoundSaturnsEye on Youtube. R$E. He goes to great lengths to explore occultist symbolism as someone who escaped from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a slew of smear and character assassination campaigns against him, but the fact remains that if you start from the beginning, it's really weird ahit, but you won't be able to stop seeing the symbolism all around us and what it comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for instance covering one eye with the generally regarded "A-okay" symbol, the Eye of Horus. Skull and Crossbones. Specific kinds of imagery portrayed with the same script and mildly differing visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just branding and art. Then he starts getting into real-world businesses and people. Then into the occult religious ties the symbolism has.

       Hiding in plain sight is a tenet of the Luciferian Doctrine. It's so that if we fail, we do so by our own inability to see these messages, rather than being legitimately ignorant.

       I wrote this in another thread... you might like it:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       OK, Ill assume you're seriously asking for that;
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       It is widely known that online-sentiment-manipulation is of great interest to all structures of power. "
       <strong>
        <em>
         Knowledge is power
        </em>
       </strong>
       " as the adage goes is true. TRUE Knowledge is the utmost power.... as it allows for one to make the correct decision if they have the absolute most information possible to them from all angles regarding an particular topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       With citizens/individuals/people, knowledge of the true workings/structure/intentions/sentiments/policies/actions (lets just refer to all of that plus more as DNA) of governments, corporations, institutions, nations, societies, communities and individuals allows them to make different decisions than they would had they all the information on the DNA of the entity they are evaluating an action due to (a vote, opinion, task, support, denouncement etc... all of those we will just call actions)
      </p>
      <p>
       So actions, the best course of action, is determined by having as full an understanding of the DNA of the external/opposing entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has always been true. When governments use the term "
       <strong>
        <em>
         Winning hearts and minds
        </em>
       </strong>
       " --- this translates to "
       <strong>
        <em>
         Controlling the Emotions (hearts) and thoughts (minds)
        </em>
       </strong>
       " of a given population.
      </p>
      <p>
       They gain control over H&amp;M through a myriad of ways - overt, covert, mass-scale, nuanced suggestion (deep deep topic, but we will keep it high level - and we will generically refer to the total control space as PR. Watch these two Documentaries later, but watch them twice. [Self]() &amp; [HR]() -- HR will blow your mind...
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, so the above has always been true - its the nature of how sentient humans protag/antag for self interest at scale and on an individual level....
      </p>
      <p>
       so:
      </p>
      <p>
       With that foundation, we have entered the "
       <em>
        information age
       </em>
       " -- Why is that important? Well, because prior to this age, controlling the flow of information between two endpoints or many or all endpoints was far easier (deep reasonings why, but lets just say it was easy to hide/obfuscate/fabricate an entity's DNA from another, thus stunting knowledge thus limiting another's power).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that information is as fluid as it is - veiling one's true DNA from another is more difficult. (aside: in ancient mystery schools, religions etc.. they oft equate water==thought. Thoughts are as fluid as water, thoughts flow... I can go into depth on that one in another post if you like later).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as the mind gains more knowledge, thus more power, its a self-perpetuating motivation and desire
       <em>
        (we can do another aside on the nature of desire later too)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       With the advent of the internet and the infra we have built on top of it, you can look at something like twitter as a global sentiment litmus for certain things, the internet is in its infancy, we think its this massive powerful thing, and it is, but its still an infant. Seeing an infant start to crawl is a momentous event, then they walk, then they run, then they learn to speak, then they think! then they LIVE their own path....
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is still an infant who just learned to Walk.
      </p>
      <p>
       ok, now to the actual question:
      </p>
      <p>
       People inherently are averse to lies/manipulation/exploitation/evil in general...
      </p>
      <p>
       But those are the tools that HumanKind has wielded for eons to hold power, and again
       <strong>
        <em>
         knowledge
        </em>
       </strong>
       IS power - so if those are the tools used by the systems of Civilization to control power, then
       <strong>
        <em>
         that
        </em>
       </strong>
       is their DNA --- having an understanding of the nature of that DNA by the entities a system is trying to control depletes/destroys/diminishes the power that system has of that other entity's H&amp;M needed to be developed; enter online-sentiment-manipulation, based on the DNA that they only know: lies, deceit, deception, etc....
      </p>
      <p>
       So -- Eglin AFB, and many many other organizations and governments are evolving  the tools and PR machine used to manipulation the H&amp;M of populations, but recall that humans are innately averse to lies and deceit etc... so they have to use these new tactics, which obviously we are all now aware of, astroturfing, sliding, shilling, etc... etc... so that the sentiment-manipulation is done so such that the narrative desired by one entity
       <strong>
        <em>
         appears
        </em>
       </strong>
       to be coming from the
       <em>
        peer group
       </em>
       of the people being manipulated, as the under-educated mind who lacks critical thinking sills and a historic-memory of past negative actions of the manipulator will tend to go with that group-think....
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats what eglin and others and all the IC pretty much are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we layer in cyber war and conventional war-for-distraction-profit-population control, and the conversation gets even more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I have to get off the train now - ill come back and edit spelling and add links to the docs later today.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this helps though....

       I think it's important to note the difference between "throwing it in your face" and the idea that believers of the occult believe in the power of signs and sigils.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've posted it a few times but the idea of putting it out there for everyone to see is that the more people that see it, know it, print it, talk about it, etc. Gives it more power and helps manifest the true "intent" behind the symbol.

       That's a deep understanding of the occult tho. Not many are that far. That's why I chose "throw it in your face." But yeah you're right on the money.

       They wouldn't, even if this or any conspiracy theory was true they wouldn't do something the faintest trace. People want them badly, for psychological reasons, to be true so they'll simultaneously look for the most superficial patterns and justify their existence with reasoning that doesn't hold up to examination.

       Your "belief" that no one would ever do anything as obvious as that is precisely how the game, and all the cards in it, are stacked against you and the public in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "belief", for instance, that the US government, or high level officials within it, would never stoop to conspiring against and attacking it's own people a-la-9/11 strictly for their own political ends and private gain, in spite of how ridiculously obvious that was, is why there's never been a public outcry loud and long enough to have the entire affair thoroughly and publicly investigated before passing any draconian laws or taking any drastic measures against a problem who's validity should have been established beyond any reasonable doubt before ever doing anything as sweeping or far reaching as the so-called Patriot Act was. It wasn't any fact's, but that "belief", itself, that allowed that to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same problem that surrounded the assassination of JFK who understood the very real and ever-present dangers of a nuclear war in taking any hard-line positions and tempting fate with proxy wars rather than reaching some form of reasonable compromise and accommodation with any supposed enemies that had no more to gain from such a potentially devastating war than the US did, or exacerbating relations with them in a full-blown proxy war like Vietnam where the US even went so far as to actively participate in and fight a war that the vast majority Vietnamese people themselves wanted no part of and were unwilling to genuinely fight for themselves. And the list of such wars and events simply goes on and on in a world that no nation even comes close to the US in terms of making it as dangerous, unpredictable, and unstable as it is with hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on doing just that instead of using them to do just the opposite.

       And I'll just add to your excellent observations about the JFK coup, that the government made a point of executing him in broad daylight as a display of their power and a warning to others who might stand in their way.

       I've wondered that too, but maybe like another user said either a nod to their intentions or code for collaborators. I've also been curious if there really are random listings in newspapers @ Craigslist for certain "services" or clandestine operatives, like portrayed in Breaking Bad (the guy that gives you a new identity/disappears you) or The Blacklist (contingency communication method disguised as a random newspaper listing  Dembe would've used to find Red if he wasn't betrayed by Pee-Wee)

       His answer reminded me of BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Investigators in the US and the UK revealed that BCCI had been "set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection."
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to violations of lending laws, BCCI was also accused of opening accounts or laundering money for figures such as Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe,[11] and for criminal organizations such as the Medellin Cartel and Abu Nidal.[12] Police and intelligence experts nicknamed B.C.C.I. the "Bank of Crooks and Criminals" for its penchant for catering to customers who dealt in arms, drugs and hot money.[13]
       </p>
       <p>
        William von Raab, a former U.S. Commissioner of Customs, also told the Kerry Committee that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency held "several" accounts at BCCI. According to a 1991 article in Time magazine, the National Security Council also had accounts at BCCI, which were used for a variety of covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons for Iran-Contra.

       Huh? Look at my post history and if you still think I'm some kind of a shill then frankly I don't really care. This is important shit this guy's dealing with right now--he just outed a murder, an organ harvesting ring, and a Dem spying operation, and is trying to stay alive in the process.

       You thought you knew how dirty the people in the DNC are?  No, you didn't know.  This shit has been going on for years.  I think we need to put together a citizens protective force for George Webb.  He deserves protection more than anyone in the government does, and I'm not saying he's in the government, of course.

       I'm wondering why you want to expose a bunch of people to danger from the government, and why you're calling ME suspicious, for proposing an idea that keeps everyone anonymous and safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your actions are objectively suspicious, mine are objectively consistent with someone not wanting you to get arrested or killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn some tradecraft before you try to pull a stunt like starting a "citizen's protection force." You can't even tell the difference between COINTELPRO and someone who is trying to keep you safe. You should not, under any circumstances, be doing the things you're contemplating. You are not ready.

       We all have our own views of things.  I can readily understand that you presume your view is the superior one but perhaps you ought to make an effort to try to understand that there is typically enough sincerity and truth in the views that others hold that no one, least of all you, should be so smug as to presume the entitlement of pomposity which you emit.

       I just wanted to say that if anyone has not heard of George Webb and it seems like this is all coming at you quick, that is because he has been linking all this for 219 days.  So if he seems like he is making leaps, its because he has tied the cords on a previous day and is assuming that people watching his videos is keeping up.

       I haven't watched all the videos, but of the ones I have watched, he seems to always be latching on to the latest 4chan threads and just kind of regurgitating them as he had discovered this information. A lot which have no evidence backing them up or have been proven outright LARP.

       Every time I try to get into George Webb I just can't fucking do it, the guy oozes cringe out of every orifice and when I try to start watching his shit I get like 3 minutes in and have to turn it off. Not because I have a short attention span, because this guy makes like 5 videos a day and doesn't do a concise summary of anything he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not going to lie, when I see shit like this my first reaction is "this is just pure speculation and it is going to discredit the Seth Rich story." Well I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       I'm right on the first count - it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       pure speculation. I can only assume I'm right on the second count - reading the comments here.

       He went on and on about Libya and missiles and Haiti and stolen children, not really explaining anything just throwing things out their like he was having random creative ideas. He could easily be fed something to regurgitate to Infowars and discredit everyone

       Yes that is my impression of the man too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like you'd need to watch his entire YouTube channel consisting of what, thousands of videos, just to get an idea what the guy is talking about. Nobody has time for that shit, and I think it's by design he hasn't given us a summary of his findings, or even a summary of what the fuck he's talking about. Just a bunch of videos like "DAY 213.3" with slim context.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was going to intentionally make my YouTube channel/my messages hard for people to understand, I'd do them exactly like George Webb has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the video explaining the story in the OP even? I want to see where he "figures out" the Seth Rich killer. Pretty fucking bold statement if you ask me, I'm sure he put it out there and made it easy to find, right?

       It's a shame you were downvoted for this, as it's totally valid.  I said the same in a different comment.  I shouldn't have to watch hours of nonsense to get an idea of what's going on - he's just wearing out any audience that isn't a devoted viewer with constant "This is it!" or "The sky is falling!" videos.

       Exactly - that's my fear. That this guy has set up his YouTube channel in such a way that idiot conspiracy nuts are literally the only ones who give him the time of day. So when he says "HURR I FOUND OUT WHO KILLED SETH RICH" the only ones who know what he's even talking about in the first place are the only ones who were dumb enough to fall for it and didn't turn him off after about 5 minutes.

       This is the most significant problem.  It's so much like pizzagate, it's unreal.  Had people been

       more critical, and not burned out all the rational thinkers with completely irrational bullshit, something may have panned out.

       The problem here is that these people don't give a shit about seth and the investigation - it is about smearing the dnc and nothing else. So they will push anything and everything, true or not, to keep his name out there and the implication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would bet anything at all that if the killer(s) is caught and they are just some thug(s) that the right won't give a shit at all. There will be hundreds of posts here a day about he/she was a secret dnc member, they will find ties from 7th cousins to a democrat, etc.

       It's not even about smearing the DNC anymore. It's about creating an avenue of "What if Russia WASN'T Wikileaks' source". Their entire goal is to protect Trump by "disproving" the "Fake News" concerning Trump/Russia coming out of the "lamestream media"

       So shouldn't this murder be moving forward faster or more thoroughly than it seems? Aren't there a lot of inconsistencies? That doesn't seem fishy also? Not saying Trump Russia shouldn't be, but that that doesn't mean ignore other things that are equally fishy

       The police are working on it. But there were 64 other murders in 2016 those detectives have to work on as well. Then there are still some from 2015 and more murders this year.
      </p>

       They only have so many detectives for all of those cases. I bet the other murders are moving about the same speed investigation wise.

Whoever downvoted my middle comment basically is saying Seth shouldn't be investigated but Trump Russia should continue to be dragged out for all time smh. They are going for the high score

       I've said it a few times since this sub fractured into two halves, there's a movement, largely by the pro-trump crowd but not entirely one sided, in which people are trying to suppress actual sources and information in favor of circlejerking, or creating an echo-chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so set on their current story being proved right that they're literally happy to take a handful of comments by people who happen to agree with them as fact, and will ignore anyone proving that original post wrong with platitudes like "MSM can't be trusted", "a shill would say that", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure it's an attempt to make this subreddit even less believable, that someone somewhere decided this type of discussion has the potential to be harmful to them so they opted to start a movement in which facts are supressed and emotion comes out on top so that no one takes us seriously when we land on something real and big.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no point until 7 months ago was i ever downvoted on this subreddit for providing sources, or asking for a source, since then it happens a majority of the time.

       I've noticed this sub is letting the Team A vs. Team B polarized mentality creep in.

      <p>
       If someone posts something about Seth Rich, then they MUST be pro-Trump and anti-Hillary!  Then people start claiming they're all shills.  WTF sub?  It really is going downhill around here fast.

       I've been a more aggressive than usual in this sub, mostly because I watched it first break and the count was instantly at 64% upvote. My first initial statements were downvoted to (-5) within the first five minutes. Then I watched it get temporarily removed and a new one get put up that was a much more watered down interpretation of events.
      </p>

       Basically, there was a lot of bizarre stuff that generated a lot of the polarization that we're seeing play out.

       I did not put a new one up. Mods put it back up after I told them to resubmit it themselves.  Rule 12, I was too vague, they wanted me to post to the actual video. He/they/it put it back up then gave me shit about my grammatical error 'you're'.  I don't really get the rule 12 violation, seemed weird then it just got weirder.

       To be fair, in hopes of educating myself a bit on what's going on I went to Twitter and typed in George Webb (hoping I could find info without watching the video).  The first thing that popped up was @TruthinGov2016.  So I go there, because this guy appears to be all over the Seth Rich story.  He's
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       all over Trump.  #MAGA  #pray4DJT etc, etc.  Soooo ya know... it appears pretty pro-Trump to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it's not, it's unfortunate that some of the loudest mouthpieces for the Seth Rich story are pro-Trump shills, because the message is going to be lost for many.

       Sure, without a doubt.  All claims should be looked at independently. 
 But it's not outlandish for people to make the Seth Rich/pro-Trump connection, as
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       of the narrative regarding Seth Rich
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       pro-Trump.  Which is why those who are really (and seriously) digging into this should keep that in mind and try to separate it from partisan politics when possible.

       It's also worth noting that prior to the current death spiral this board has been in since last summer, every day there would be a post critical of Hillary Clinton. That by no means meant that this place was always pro Trump, Hillary just evokes a reaction from anyone who lends any credence to "conspiracy theories", and that reaction is usually not one that is good for Hillary or her fans.

       No he hasn't.

       He has his theory, which is still completely unproven and requires several huge leaps in logic. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       The leap of assuming that because two gangsters died that they must be connected. And assuming that they would contract out covert work like this to a couple amateur gangbangers who would snitch in an instant to cut their sentence if caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leap that a car dealership is used to provide covert vehicles when a dealership would require tons of paperwork and make the cars easily traced back to them. Even if they bought it with cash any identifiable information could easily be traced to them from the original owner. If they're stripping all that information then why bother having a fake car dealership, just buy beaters on Craigslist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my theory: Georgie here is trying to get in on that Alex Jones cash cow.

       right now contain the same English error, using "figure" when "figured" would be appropriate. I'm assuming the posters are mults of one another until someone gives me a better theory.

       Which video? He has over 200 divided into chapters which are divided into subtitles which are then divided into parts.

       Did you guys hear George knew/knows Julian Assange? Wow!! Why the fuck wasn't that disclosed early on?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like Georige. In fact, I have a crush on him (not really) but I've become a little dubious of him. I mean, if Seth supposedly got killed for leaking info, how is George (who is extremely visible) allowed to live to talk? (same with Alex Jones).
One has to be careful who they trust. Or at minimum, consider the source and the questionable agenda.

       This is very true when, as you say, sources make their material very difficult for the interested observer to sift through. I want to believe this George Webb guy, every time he's mentioned I eagerly visit his YouTube only to be reminded seconds later that
       <em>
        it's impossible to sift through this guy's shit to figure out if he's onto something.
       </em>
       I'd have to spend literally hours of my time just to figure out what the fuck this dude is talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that in and of itself is suspicious enough for me to not trust this guy. This is the internet age - make a summary of your findings for people who don't have hours to parse through your fucking YouTube channel to go and check out for themselves...

       Not sure if that has more of the 'wow' factor as him (George) being a Mossad agent!

       No offense to George Webb because he's being incredibly thorough but how does he expect anyone to follow what he's doing with all these uploads? With 10 uploads a day, it's tough to go back and glean useful information from these videos if you're coming in new to this. He should do weekly recaps of important information or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also doesn't it seem odd he's broadcasting exactly where he is in these videos? Seems like an easy person to make a hit on... but maybe that's his intention and the obsessive documentation protects him because if he's killed it only adds credibility to what he's saying and we'll know exactly where he was killed?

       I noticed that once he moved away from just filming his screen, and started showing his face, he'd always make a point to show where he was. He'd have his satnav on while driving, and draw attention to the fact that we now knew exactly where he was, point out landmarks and name locations, etc. (Even before he started to do more on-foot location-based investigations.) I think it's actually a more effective form of protection than keeping identities, locations and destinations secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that he makes it near impossible to pick up the series part way through. And to those who just began watching lately, and missed all the groundwork he laid out earlier, he's just going to seem nuts. Especially since he's understandably gone into the rambling, no filter, infodump mode of someone who's not sure if these will be their last moments. Earlier, he is calm and considered, explaining concepts well, etc. But those videos have kind of gotten buried.

       That is the first time I have heard someone put it that way. If I was alleging what he was, whether I was right or not, I would be paranoid. I didn't mind the way the videos were made, but I was a bit lost trying to play catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the comments I have read today seem to be from people who are also new to GW, who are just bitching about not understanding the videos because of the lack of context. Other criticism seems to be that he is just all over the place, and this seems to come from people who are more aware of GW.

       Well, no. I'm not sure what your slapdash diagnosis is supposed to mean, but I have known people who have paranoid schizophrenia and people who have schitzo-affective disorder, and that's not what's going on at all. I'd say he's either being honest and was scared as hell (what I believe), or he's faking it and pretending to be scared as hell. Regardless, the danger (real or faked) has blown over for now, and he is back to his usual self. The latest periscope streams have been full of good info.

       Huge amount of discrediting today across many forums and threads on George Webb. They're going after him huge. Make sure when you visit threads on him you use the sort tool to view "new". All the disinfo is being pushed to the top.

       I bet he found the last pieces of the puzzle a couple days ago. I say this because thats when there started to be 4000+ users logged on

       As someone who comes into this sub maybe once a week to see what's up, threads like this are incredibly unsatisfying and, in my opinion, do more to harm the validity of the claims than to cement them as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone says "Can someone summarize this for me?" and the best response is a link to a 14 minute video of someone pointing at his computer screen with a bunch of seemingly unrelated things, it all just comes across as noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if this guy is as close to finding the truth as people seem to think he is, there is nothing stopping him, or one of his supporters, from distilling all of the evidence into a super-concentrated executive summary video that ties it all together in a minute or two, nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, if that theory holds water, people can delve into the finer details to see whether or not it makes sense and can withstand scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it currently stands, it's kind of like throwing the ocean at people and claiming "Oh, there's a giant squid in there, you just have to find it!" Yeah, when you're trying to prove something with as much resistance as this has against it, that methodology is not going to work.

       Thank you.  This guy has way too many videos to watch for someone that just wants a basic idea of his work, and tuning into any single video doesn't provide much insight.  It would have been nice if he took the time to have a text post with a list of bullet points of his discoveries for each day.  (But I realize that couldn't really be monetized as easily.)

       Rote memorization has always been part of that misguided approach to education.  If you haven't looked into it, check out the Skull and Bones Society's role in education as documented by Charlotte Iserbyt (senior policy advisor on education under the reagan administration) and Antony C Sutton (Hoover institution Economics Scholar).

       I've noticed this recently, too. People are so overwhelmed with (dis) information that is too difficult to parse and is constantly being refuted, that it's become necessary to people to just stand strong on their beliefs and it's driving emotions. I suspect that it's just an aspect of tribalism and mass- psychology that's being used against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly been exploited by the group leading the "deplorables", who on reddit used the same meme and circlejerk strategies that we've seen successfully employed by other social activist identity groups on here.  But remember that what you are seeing there is a vocal minority which is deliberately taking up more space than they represent, to appear much larger than they are.

        I do not understand why the only narrative that's not ok to question is Trumps to his supporters. They are questioning WaPo, neocons, NYT, neo cons, dems, liberals, even fox news at times... But never the one fed to them by the Trump propaganda machine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "4d chess".  The Trump supporters see him as combatting the enemy, so they aren't worried about vetting the validity of his propaganda.  I think the core supporters you're seeing are "reactive" in that they're goaded into reacting AGAINST what they see as an existential threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's happening on "both sides" of the political dichotomy right now, though it's traditionally been a term reserved for "conservatives".  I'm seeing the dualistic bating being pushed very hard by the media right now and the divide is growing more and more between what the two sides believe.  Belief no longer just refers to values, but to FACTS and what is objectively true.  Pick a side or rot.  That's the postmodernist political sphere we're currently dwelling in.

       I've been a more aggressive than usual in this sub, mostly because I watched it first break and the count was instantly at 64% upvote. My first initial statements were downvoted to (-5) within the first five minutes. Then I watched it get temporarily removed and a new one get put up that was a much more watered down interpretation of events.

       Basically, there was a lot of bizarre stuff that generated a lot of the polarization that we're seeing play out.

       To be fair, in hopes of educating myself a bit on what's going on I went to Twitter and typed in George Webb (hoping I could find info without watching the video).  The first thing that popped up was @TruthinGov2016.  So I go there, because this guy appears to be all over the Seth Rich story.  He's
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       all over Trump.  #MAGA  #pray4DJT etc, etc.  Soooo ya know... it appears pretty pro-Trump to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if it's not, it's unfortunate that some of the loudest mouthpieces for the Seth Rich story are pro-Trump shills, because the message is going to be lost for many.

       Did I say demons? It looks like a snakes head if you look at it all at once. That's just an example of the being obvious thing they are all about.

       Sure.  And why wouldn't they?  The media will protect them.

       Seems like conspiracy go fish. Just drawing random lines to T_D's favorite conspiracies and calling them facts.

       Well, no. I'm not sure what your slapdash diagnosis is supposed to mean, but I have known people who have paranoid schizophrenia and people who have schitzo-affective disorder, and that's not what's going on at all. I'd say he's either being honest and was scared as hell (what I believe), or he's faking it and pretending to be scared as hell. Regardless, the danger (real or faked) has blown over for now, and he is back to his usual self. The latest periscope streams have been full of good info.
