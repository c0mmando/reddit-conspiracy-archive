    <div class="md"><p>anyone who makes it to that political level is absolutely a slime ball. What I find strange is that people still believe there are clean players of a dirty game, politics. I also think that anyone who see shade in Trump but not in Hillary is staring down the barrel of a shotgun. Hillary has lead the economic destruction of several countries with her stupidity. I also think that anyone who thinks socialism or its current filter of <em>Democratic Socialism</em> loves the yoke of slavery and deserves it because they have a mountain of evidence from history to show them the brand of govt. is a terrible idea. Mainly because you cant constantly grow as a populace in spite of people&#39;s self interest. But enough about what I think, why dont you point out a clean politician or 1 source of actual collusion between Russia and the RNC or Trump.</p>

<p>These types of rhetorical tricks don&#39;t impress me. We aren&#39;t talking about other politicians, and we certainly aren&#39;t talking about Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or 1 source of actual collusion between Russia and the RNC or Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, I made no such claim.</p>

<p>However, if you have been paying any attention at all, and still think that there is nothing suspiciuous about the actions of Trump or his campaign team or his advisors, in regards to Russia, than there is no point in me talking about it with you.</p>

<p>Multiple investigations, firing his NS adviser, Kushner&#39;s back channels, senate subpoenas, firing the head of the FBI while they are conducting an investigation into his campaign....</p>

<p>I mean, seriously, get your head out of the sand. </p>

<p>Socialism is defined by the workers owning the means of production. That&#39;s not a bad idea on its face, the problem is that authoritarian regimes that had nothing to do with that idea call themselves socialist. Like the Nazis or the USSR. They were NEVER about the workers owning the means of production, they were always authoritarian and controlled by a group of elites. But when your socialism is bound by the limits of democracy, there&#39;s no additional threat of authoritarianism than there would be from any other democratic system. We already have democratic socialism in plenty areas of US government too, like the police or fire departments that are effectively owned collectively by the citizens of the United States. </p>

<p>Also, you said &quot;anyone who makes it to that political level is absolutely a slime ball.&quot; That&#39;s only because the system is rigged against the more decent folks like Rand Paul or Bernie Sanders. Neither are perfect, of course, but to say that either of them are slime balls on par with the likes of Clinton or Trump is completely absurd. Furthermore, I&#39;d point out that these slime balls win because people vote for them. Stop voting for slimeballs, stop listening to the corporate media telling you that you HAVE TO vote for these scumbags, actively support the rare ones who are actually decent, and maybe we might be able to step forward out of the muck we&#39;ve trapped in.</p>
