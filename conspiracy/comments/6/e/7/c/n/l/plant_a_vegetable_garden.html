<p>Because you said to take control of my food supply. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The potatoes in a bucket is pretty neat, I was keeping &#39;The Martian&#39; film in mind when I made my comment so the potato theme is strong here. </p>

<p>Downside being, is it doable for most people? If it were, why is world hunger even a thing? </p>

<p>Your 2nd video doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>More people helping means more mouths to feed. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s just a small operation like potato buckets, more isn&#39;t necessarily the merrier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I messed up the link. Try the 2nd video again.</p>

<p>I can understand how it is a big task and how more may not always be merrier, but if right now you&#39;re at 0 potatoes and tomorrow you&#39;re at +1 potato then you&#39;re at least moving forwards. I assume that a person that was interested in undertaking this task would also be interested in optimizing it, so the kinks would be ironed out as necessary, and it doesn&#39;t take 20 people to grow one potato, so I think that ratio will usually be favorable... and while everyone is eating potatoes they can all wait for the orchard of apple trees to grow. Time is the biggest issue IMO... for anything that would truly resemble a &quot;food supply&quot; it takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>Absolutely, that&#39;s at the core of the problem. </p>

<p>For most people, their efforts will ultimately end up with probably only a days supply. But the amount of time and effort it takes just isn&#39;t worth it for most. </p>

<p>If you live in an apartment, good luck lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy in the 2nd video is definitely a hobbyist, so I don&#39;t think that he&#39;d consider the time + money as a loss, but it&#39;s a valid concern for people who wouldn&#39;t find enjoyment in the process itself, and it almost defeats the purpose if you&#39;re just dropping a ton of money on gardening supplies at Home Depot.  </p>

<p>Agreed that the time thing is difficult to surmount. The best solution is by starting today, but it&#39;s also very unlikely that&#39;s going to happen for either of us. It requires a long-term outlook as well. Why plant an apple tree if you&#39;re going to move away in a year? </p>

<p>I think the strength in the plan comes from the neighborhood aspect of it. Several people with several backyards full of food, that will all eventually have their own apple trees. It may not serve the neighborhood well today, but it 20 years it&#39;s gonna be the tits, and by then the community should be pretty tight knit + knowledgeable. Human drama has a way of undoing those types of things as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a difficult goal to achieve, but ultimately the gains are worth it. Imagine honeycomb communities, where each hex has what it needs to sustain itself through vertical farming + renewable energies. It&#39;d be nice to see. </p>

<p>Perennials, not annuals. Annuals you have to plant every year (tomatoes, corn). Perennials are plant once, harvest for years to come (raspberries, asparagus).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that annuals make seeds, so some of those (the ones adapted to your climate) will come up again year after year without any effort on your part. Not the same plant of course, like a perennial, but rather the offspring of last year&#39;s plants.</p>

<p>For this to happen you have to let some of your plants go to seed. Don&#39;t immediately pull up a plant when it stops producing for you, but allow it to grow through it&#39;s entire life cycle and reach maturity, then let nature do the work of seed dispersal. It&#39;s not tidy. You end up with plants sprouting randomly all over, but it&#39;s easy. Think lettuce, spinach, beets, kale, Swiss chard, radishes, carrots, kohlrabi, broccoli, cabbage...and of course it depends where in the world you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true for your warmer zones. I take full advantage of as many re-seeding annuals as I can. I have a fantastic variety of arugula that&#39;s running over a decade re-seeding itself. It&#39;s actually a biennial, but it just keeps on keeping on.</p>

<p>Most of the seeds you mention won&#39;t survive the winter in my area. This is exactly the type of knowledge that I was talking about needing to have success gardening. Best to find someone local to help you learn what varieties are best suited for your specific location. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, it&#39;s pretty neat to see plants coming back year after year. I wanted to add that when seeds are dormant (their tough seed coats are intact and they haven&#39;t begun to sprout) they can and do tolerate freezing. Where I live we get down to around -15°F pretty much every winter and -30°F at least once per decade yet the plants I mentioned above keep coming back.</p>

<p>The real limiting factor is how long your growing season is (your warm season). Most of the vegetables that reseed for me are actually cool-season crops and reach maturity relatively quickly without needing summer heat. They&#39;d work for people in a good portion of Canada and similar places, as well as pretty much anywhere in the continental US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, there are other considerations.  My soil is very clay and compact.  Plants need a loosened medium to grow well, so adding compost is more necessary than people think.  Working the soil is also pretty important, but tilling is not necessary.  It&#39;s now kind of old-school.  It&#39;s more about promoting worm activity and mycelium.  Many times people also get frustrated when they work their soil and a million weed seeds germinate.  It is a problem, but working through that first year is kind of tough.  Using black plastic or cardboard to smother weeds around your garden, mowing before weed seeds set anywhere nearby is also important.  Using a small forked tool to remove weeds by just scratching the surface on a sunny day will kill them near where you&#39;ve planted also.  Weeds steal nutrients from the plants you are trying to grow, so they have to be limited whenever possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, you usually just want to spray (gently) aphids off of your plants, knocking them down whenever you notice an outbreak.  When it gets pretty bad, then you break out the dish soap method.  Please note that it&#39;s best to use a gentle dish soap like Ivory, not one that says it&#39;s got antibacterial stuff in it.  One small squirt in a gallon is all you need.  Apply mostly to the bottom of leaves, but also all over.  It&#39;s best to do this on cloudy days, or about a couple hours before the sun goes down, with enough time for the plants to dry before nightfall.  Early AM is also good.  Doing it in the height of the day can be damaging to the plants.</p>

<p>Plant some fruit and nut trees. So easy! Plus you&#39;ll attract deer, squirrels, and all kinds of other wild meat.</p>

<p>Dig a pond. Stock it with fish and edible aquatic plants (cat tails, etc). Bam! Self sustaining meat and veg. Plus ducks and geese if you&#39;re lucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are reasons to feed the poor other than just for &quot;the warm fuzzies.&quot;</p>

<p>Starvation will drive people crazy.  Worry that their children are not getting fed enough more so.  Desperate people do desperate things.  They will rob, steal, and maybe murder to escape being caught.</p>

<p>Some times people really do just have a string of bad luck.  If you grow up poor, you can work hard and work your way up.  But what happens when you get laid off?  Factories in your town just start shutting down.  People get these benefits to hold them over until they can get back on their feet.  They get back on their feet, off the benefits, and contributing to society and paying taxes.</p>

<p>(There are always cases of people abusing the system, when you&#39;re talking about systems that span an entire continent.  They are the exception to the norm, and it just isn&#39;t cost efficient to make a abuse-proof system; you end up spending far more on fraud prevention then it saves you.)</p>

<p>I grew up in a shit poor family.  I didn&#39;t choose to.  If it weren&#39;t for government benefits, I would have been malnourished, and I would have suffered from permanent mental and physical ailments because of it.  (Malnutrition in children fucks them up for life.)</p>

<p>Instead I got the help.  Now I make 73,000 / year in salary, and about a third of that is paid back to the country that helped me, in the form of taxes.  I was a damn fine investment.  </p>

<p>I am much more common then you realize.  You don&#39;t hear about people like me, because who the hell walks around telling people about how they needed food stamps to live.  You DO hear about &quot;welfare queens&quot; who make bank from the welfare office because that story enrages people, and people just eat that shit up.  </p>

<p>(The politician who first sold the idea of &quot;welfare queens&quot; later admitted that the concept was a complete fabrication.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read up on how government spending really affects the economy.  You have some strong misconceptions about how the economy works.</p>

<p>All this money that is spent on welfare programs... where do you think they go?  Do you think poor people receive that money, and just pile it up and set it on fire?  </p>

<p>Or do they go and spend that money in their community, thus generating revenue for businesses, profits for the owners, and wages for those businesses employees?</p>

<p>Money spent on welfare programs directly injects wealth into communities, spurring economic growth where otherwise there may little to none.  And growth is good for everyone.</p>

<p>You should read a few books on economics.  You could <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Economics-Undressing-Science-Revised/dp/0393337642">start here</a> - it&#39;ll provide some very valuable insights.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still cheaper to buy and use a whole pack of seeds than buying seedlings. Unless its a gift (it&#39;s an awesome gift)</p>

<p>I also recommend letting at least one of your plants go to seeds so you have a supply for the next crop. </p>

<p>Have 2 different patches so you can rotate and mulch one while the other is growing food. This is very important. Soil prep is everything. </p>

<p>Try to grow things that cost you the most at the shop. </p>

<p>Stagger your planting times so that it doesn&#39;t all come up at the same time. This covers you so there&#39;s less wastage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All true. You know that, and I know that. </p>

<p>From the content of your reply, it&#39;s obvious that you have years of gardening under your belt, as do I.</p>

<p>But, for the beginning gardener, seedlings make sense -at least certain seedlings. Yes, seeds are cheaper, and things like curcubits should always be direct seeded in the ground. </p>

<p>But, take tomatoes, for example. Germinating the seeds, buying the pots and good soil (i.e. Fox Farms), and then repeatedly potting the seedlings up until they are ready for transplant into the ground - all of that may be more than a beginning gardener wants to (or can) take on successfully.</p>

We certainly see eye to eye on your last statement.

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I know of. At least not here in arkansas. Our Plant Board/EPA does nothing with that. They mainly focus on regulation to protect farmers from seed fraud and people using chemicals all willy nilly. Even if growing a garden and a nearby farmer sprays and kills it you can file and they&#39;ll be fined and you may even be reimbursed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in rural Arkansas and most people have their own gardens that provide them with veges most of the year and never have I heard of any agency actively trying to stop that. I also work at a local company that sells seed to farmers. However we dont sell seed for gardening. To get non-gmo seed is as easy as calling and saying hey I want conventional this type of seed. There are no regulations that prevent this. We mainly sell soybeans, rice, corn, and wheat. 90% rice we sell are non-gmo. In fact in order to sell rice in arkansas you have to have a lot trail showing its been gmo tested. The only gmo rice that can be planted is clearfield and most dont buy it as its $40-50 a bu instead of $10-12 like the conventional rice. Wheat is all non-gmo and last I knew no gmo wheat is approved in arkansas. Soybeans are different as you cant make money growing conventional beans unless you have a specific conventional bean contract.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love me some homegrown fruit!</p>

<p>Seriously though, I grow enough food to share every year. I put up a little &quot;free surplus veggies&quot; stand out by the road for neighbors to take advantage of. I advertise it on local social media groups - hey come get some homegrown free veggies! Mostly tomatoes and cukes, but sometimes flowers, asparagus, arugula, squash, chiles, beans... It mostly goes to waste (well, to the chickens so not totally wasted). Not for lack of traffic, either. People just don&#39;t cook at home very much where I live. It&#39;s a fairly affluent &quot;bedroom community&quot; where everyone leaves at 7:30 am and returns at 6:00 pm to live their two or three hours of &quot;free time&quot; before bed and doing it again tomorrow. </p>

<p>Maybe I need to find a place to move to that has a more agorist community already in place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This ideology is way too far gone to continue to be useful in this age. The introduction of large scale farm equipment has made the idea of home gardening for the purpose of anything other than a hobby useless. It is far better (financially) to obtain your food from the store, and work to have the cash to do that.</p>

<p>As far as the SHTF scenario... You better just stock up on canned food, non-perishables, and have some way to collect water. Gardening won&#39;t sustain your family for very long, and in the SHTF scenario you won&#39;t want to venture outside your home to try and &quot;trade&quot; with your neighbors... </p>

<p>I appreciate the sentiment, but the &quot;keep the money out of corporate hands&quot; ideology doesn&#39;t work at this point.</p>

But we can&#39;t wait for spring to start over. It&#39;s fun! It&#39;s pretty to look at, too. Buying organic is too expensive. I save seeds from year to year, too. Also learning how to keep food without refrigeration, just in case. Even the knowledge will be valuable. For instance, you can keep eggs, unrefrigerated, for up to a year by rubbing them with mineral oil. It keeps the air out. Lots of good homesteading info on Pinterest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree. I can more or less meet all of my needs for vegetables from my gardens and the foraging I do on our property. I don&#39;t do that entirely because I still enjoy many things I can&#39;t grow here, like avocadoes, lemons, bananas, pineapple and the like. </p>

<p>Last year I harvested thirty-six butternut squash, each averaging 4-5 pounds, and thirty-six pie pumpkins. I still have some of the squash left and they&#39;re still perfectly sound seven months after harvesting. The pumpkins I pureed and froze so I still have some of that. If the grid was down I would obviously have needed to use the pumpkin up first since it doesn&#39;t keep nearly as well as the squash, but that would have been fine--eating pumpkin through the autumn, then switching to squash for the winter and spring.</p>

<p>One year when I lived on a little postage stamp lot I grew 241 pounds of tomatoes, which I canned as ketchup, marinara, soup, spaghetti sauce, etc, sun dried, and used fresh. I still had some of that harvest left several years later.</p>

<p>I grow perennials that come up every year (rhubarb, horseradish, and asparagus) and many annuals that reseed themselves (mustard greens, Swiss chard, radishes, lettuces, carrots, plus annual herbs like dill, cilantro, holy basil, Hopi tobacco--that last one not for eating).</p>

<p>Each year I usually grow 30-40 different types of annual vegetables from seed (super cheap) and I have a culinary and medicinal herb garden with over 40 perennial and annual herbs. I have fruit trees too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely doable and not even difficult. Yes, perhaps there&#39;s a little bit of a learning curve starting out, but it&#39;s pretty basic stuff.</p>

<p>Toby Hemenway&#39;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaias-Garden-Guide-Home-Scale-Permaculture/dp/1603580298/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">Gaia&#39;s Garden</a>, is fantastic.</p>

<p>If you only care about growing vegetables in a garden bed, there are a lot of books on how to get started and any one of them would work for you.  Go to a used book store and see what they have, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find something you like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Community vegetable gardens are amazing.  We need more of these in urban settings.  Automated vertical indoor gardens are even better.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues with cities is that poor people don&#39;t have their own cars and often don&#39;t have great access to fresh produce.  They also don&#39;t always have access to full kitchens and food prep.  Immigrant communities do a much better job with nutrition than native poverty- they&#39;re communal and import their own inexpensive produce.  I firmly believe that community gardens and some form of education around growing your own vegetables is key to community health in poor and urban environments.</p>

I believe several of the large state schools have similar programs.  obviously they have relationships with the big-ag programs, but these have great potential for community programs and i think even greater potential as urban renewal programs.</p>

I was surprised. Hoping to have a bigger garden and become more self-sufficient when he retires and we move in a year. Actually, I&#39;m hoping to be able to take care of several families that way. Look on Pinterest. There are all kinds of gardening, canning and homesteading ideas. I&#39;ve been learning herbal medicine, too, just in case. Got a little herbal garden, and Pinterest has lots of free information on that, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the idea of a home orchard/forest garden.  Use all the layers of the forest and stack them with edible trees, shrubs, vines, herbs, ground covers, and rooters/tubers.  Plant for medicine, pollination, mineral accumulation, food.  Can be done on very small levels with just one or two fruit trees underplanted with several fruiting or medicinal herbs, ground covers shrubs, etc. or on a large scale like Martin Crawford&#39;s forest garden.  Might not get bumper crops of everything but you build in diversity and minimize major losses.<br/>
Its a great concept and seems to be trending up.</p>

<p>That was my garden last year. A lot of the first row ended up being inedible, I now know that lettuce, spinach and Brussels sprouts become too bitter when grown during the very hot summers we get here. I also learned keeping the lettuce and spinach in the fridge for a couple days eased off some of the bitterness. </p>

<p>The point I&#39;m trying to make is don&#39;t be too overwhelmed to simply even begin. No one ever grows a perfect garden, something always goes wrong. What works for others may not work for you. You have to work with your budget, your available space, I have seen lots of crazy garden pictures and ideas, chances are your situation is close to someone else&#39;s and there&#39;s already advice on how to go about it online. Read a bit, there&#39;s lots of information floating around out there. Someone in your family, one of your co-workers, a neighbor or someone in your friend circle is into gardening. Most gardeners like to talk about it, pick their brain if they let you. </p>

<p>Find out which zone you live in, this will help a lot and is an easy enough way to figure out what can grow where you live and when to plant it.
<a href="http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/">http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/</a></p>

<p>The gardening subreddit is friendly, I check it out daily while my garden is growing and I have never had to ask a question there cuz usually someone else is asking what I was wondering about. They are helpful and have good tips. I recommend keeping a physical notebook that you can write down your own tips and tricks you come across. Keep track of what works for you and what doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.simplycanning.com">http://www.simplycanning.com</a> is a good place to learn how to can</p>

<p>I do not garden to be self sufficient and I still consider myself new at it but it is very rewarding in many ways. Keeps you active, good way to spend time with your kids while teaching them, and allows you to help feed your family.</p>

<p>Plant some fruit and nut trees.  So easy!  Plus you&#39;ll attract deer, squirrels, and all kinds of other wild meat.</p>

<p>Dig a pond.  Stock it with fish and edible aquatic plants (cat tails, etc).  Bam!  Self sustaining meat and veg.  Plus ducks and geese if you&#39;re lucky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a LOT of great how-to gardening videos on youtube.  I&#39;ve learned a lot of basic information from them over the years.</p>

<p>One of the most important things people can do to just get started is to begin a compost heap.  Save all of your coffee grounds, carrot tops, old salad, grass clippings, egg shells, etc and put in a heap somewhere in the back of your yard.  It helps if you just make a circular cage out of some old chicken wire or something.  Avoid things like meats, cheese, bones, etc so that you don&#39;t give vermin a place to thrive.  Compost is a gardeners best friend.  Understanding how to compost well isn&#39;t that difficult, and there must be thousands of videos about it.  No need to buy a fancy rolling compost bin or anything like that.  Good compost will usually take close to a year to break all the way down, and it will provide a nutrient rich mulch for your garden in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a farmer and self-suffiency fanatic the last 10 years, here&#39;s some tips to beginners:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Focus on getting good growing easily storable, high productivity staple crops. Potatos, corn, beans, peas, pumpkins, grains, whatever is the traditional staples in your area. 500 tomatos won&#39;t fill you family long, 500 kg of potatos is a winter worth of full bellies. If you can, plant bushes and trees in available space that also gives a storable yield, ie nuts or storable fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>With staples covered, grow highly productive, nutritious crops. Potatos or corn is calories galore, but doesn&#39;t have very much in the vitamine/minerals department. Things like kale, tomatos, spinach, carrots. You are looking for growable vitamine pills basically.</p></li>
<li><p>Having a good steady food supply from the above, dedicate some space to spices, basil, oregano, chives etc. People have died from getting disgusted eating the same bland food day in and day out. At some point you/your body will refuse to eat it any more, and you starve.</p></li>
<li><p>Preservation and storage. Just as important as learning to grow is learning to store your produce. A dark roof, pavement or large stone can dry a lot of food in a full day of sun. A buried barrel is a good place to store root vegetables. Canning, making jams etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn to cook with what you grow. Your body will crave MSG, sugar, fast carbs and fats. Learn to compose a meal that pleases both the tastebuds and the body.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn what you can eat for free during each season. Nettles are both protein and vitamin/mineral bombs for instance. Chickweed makes a fine salad. Pigweed have spinach like leaves and produces a storable grain. So on and so forth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Last, chickens are amazing food producers, consider getting some, and figure out how to feed them:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m going to have to make this quick. Lots of work today. If you have more Q&#39;s hit me up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cultivation surface do you need  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of till free mixed-crop farming. The meat I eat is chicken with some hunted deer. Once you have the weeds under control, the chicken do an amazing job of weeding. The trick with that is to use portable fencing, and keep them out until the planets devel a good root system. Then let the chicken go at it. They eat the pests like squash bugs and bean beetles. Our ducks keep the slugs under control. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>to feed (100%) a family of 5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a family of 4, we have 17 acres and about 1/2 of that is garden space. 1/8 for chickens and ducks. We have a 2 acre field for oats and wheat for the chickens. ( It&#39;s too small and too much work for human consumption, but could be used in a pinch). </p>

<p>We also have a fruit grove, with apples and peaches that takes up a couple of acres. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it doable without a tractor?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not without a lot of hard work and great initial setup. While we try not to till, sometime we have to for crop rotation or if weeds get out of hand. Also use it to maintain the wheat and oats. Corn field can all be done by hand, assuming the soil is ready.</p>

<p>As other have said. So much is trial and error. Every year things get more efficient. We discover better ways of doing things. It&#39;s a constant learning experience.</p>

<p>container garden using food-grade 5 gal buckets (these things are great!).  </p>

<p>indoor tent with led space bucket lights (can work in tent or in 5 gal bucket) to get the plants started earlier in the season</p>

<p>a compost bin. racoon proof lid on a big wheeled garbage bin.  drill 1 inch holes all around for air.  Lid it and spin it to help mix the compost up.</p>

<p>a general big soil bin kept indoors in lowlight where you can drop seeds and see how they take</p>

<p>hoop-house it if you have outdoor space (works on roofs too).  metal electrical tubing curved to shape are the strongest, but you can do something lightweight with pvc tubing and plumbing connectors.  these things are awesome.</p>

<p>a water filter, and ways to collect water.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we live in a society where 1% of the population can grow many, many times more food than the entire country can eat. compare that to countries like india where more than half of the population is farming. it comes down to the scale and productivity of farming practices. if we were all to go back to subsistence farming at a microscopic scale, i dont think our quality of life would increase. in fact we would all waste so much time farming that we would start regressing as a society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy in the 2nd video is definitely a hobbyist, so I don&#39;t think that he&#39;d consider the time + money as a loss, but it&#39;s a valid concern for people who wouldn&#39;t find enjoyment in the process itself, and it almost defeats the purpose if you&#39;re just dropping a ton of money on gardening supplies at Home Depot.  </p>

<p>Agreed that the time thing is difficult to surmount. The best solution is by starting today, but it&#39;s also very unlikely that&#39;s going to happen for either of us. It requires a long-term outlook as well. Why plant an apple tree if you&#39;re going to move away in a year? </p>

<p>I think the strength in the plan comes from the neighborhood aspect of it. Several people with several backyards full of food, that will all eventually have their own apple trees. It may not serve the neighborhood well today, but it 20 years it&#39;s gonna be the tits, and by then the community should be pretty tight knit + knowledgeable. Human drama has a way of undoing those types of things as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a difficult goal to achieve, but ultimately the gains are worth it. Imagine honeycomb communities, where each hex has what it needs to sustain itself through vertical farming + renewable energies. It&#39;d be nice to see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s very cool. cornell&#39;s agriculture school is actually a public state school.  I believe several of the large state schools have similar programs.  obviously they have relationships with the big-ag programs, but these have great potential for community programs and i think even greater potential as urban renewal programs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I know of. At least not here in arkansas. Our Plant Board/EPA does nothing with that. They mainly focus on regulation to protect farmers from seed fraud and people using chemicals all willy nilly. Even if growing a garden and a nearby farmer sprays and kills it you can file and they&#39;ll be fined and you may even be reimbursed. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in rural Arkansas and most people have their own gardens that provide them with veges most of the year and never have I heard of any agency actively trying to stop that. I also work at a local company that sells seed to farmers. However we dont sell seed for gardening. To get non-gmo seed is as easy as calling and saying hey I want conventional this type of seed. There are no regulations that prevent this. We mainly sell soybeans, rice, corn, and wheat. 90% rice we sell are non-gmo. In fact in order to sell rice in arkansas you have to have a lot trail showing its been gmo tested. The only gmo rice that can be planted is clearfield and most dont buy it as its $40-50 a bu instead of $10-12 like the conventional rice. Wheat is all non-gmo and last I knew no gmo wheat is approved in arkansas. Soybeans are different as you cant make money growing conventional beans unless you have a specific conventional bean contract.  </p>
