    <div class="md"><p>Well because Russia has propaganda to promote their interests. America has propaganda to promote their interests. We&#39;d rather Americans listen to American propaganda than Russian.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have always kinda been in the cracks between any real government narrative. But the Russian and GOP narrative pushes disinformation about American politics. Trump campaign advisors made conspiracy theorists and anti-establishment voters a voice, all while being ironically,  fully in control of the establishment. They realize the power in this. Look over there at that conspiracy,  not over here. They&#39;ll push false narratives to spur their base on. </p>

<p>Lock her up?  Never going to happen. Rhetoric for the base that Trump doesn&#39;t believe in.</p>

<p>For me,  I see the danger in seeing people who I thought were anti establishment becoming complacent and <em>thinking</em> they&#39;ve found a solution to the establishment in Trump. </p>

<p>This is the GOPs new southern strategy is all.  Prey on those who are conspiracy theorists and anti-establishment. It&#39;s all disinformation,  and they know exactly what they are feeding you.</p>

<p>This disinformation has been done with the help of Trump advisors (Roger Alies: fox news,  Steve Bannon: Breitbart and Cambridge Analytical, Russia: social media and wiki leaks)</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the problem: we have the government feeding us bold faced lies.</p>

<p>The second problem is Russia has kompromat on the president of the us. Dirty money laundering and loans, mostly,  not something unusual for a casino owner and real estate mogul to have. But dangerous when in the hands of any country.</p>

<p>Russia&#39;s goals don&#39;t align with our allies goals. They&#39;re pro Iran,  pro North Korea,  pro Syria,  anti EU.</p>

<p>So no,  I guess it wouldn&#39;t be bad,  we&#39;d just have a different set of enemies.</p>

<p>I think the real loss here is complacency of those who question the establishment,  and the further division of America along political lines for the sake of keeping power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin is extremely cunning and conniving. He studied law, and got the opportunity to sharpen his social tools when he was recruited by the KGB at age 22. Putin and his team have years of experience playing social engineering games for geopolitical posturing. </p>

<p>Some believe Trump to be a chess master based on his own social abilities. Steve Bannon rightfully receives the credit he deserves for helping Trump translate those abilities onto the political stage. Unfortunately, that&#39;s about the only strength this administration seems to hold.</p>

<p>Most of the people closest to Trump are inexperienced in governance itself; that includes foreign diplomacy.</p>

<p>If the Russia-Trump theory is true, then that means that Putin had an incentive to put his efforts into helping Trump.</p>

<p>Why continue to deny the collusion if the only incentive was taking steps towards world peace? Trump made claims about never meeting Putin or talking to him. Putin says it&#39;s propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at Russia&#39;s trajectory over the past generation. No, I don&#39;t want America hitched to that wagon.</p>

<p>They are no longer a major force in the world as a whole, except militarily. Putin has been forced into military expansion to have any relevance at all.</p>

<p>Their economy is insignificant. Their culture is insignificant. Their science/technology is mostly insignificant.</p>

<p>Treating them as anything other than an annoying insect to be kept in check lowers America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s not a popular idea in conspiracy circles but it really doesn&#39;t take massive global power to affect small surgical damage. In other words, Oswald <em>could</em> have been a lone gunman. Nineteen nobodies <em>could</em> have pulled off 9/11.</p>

<p>All Russia needed was one good hacker. We did the rest for them. Anyone who has been paying attention more than a day knows that national level politics are universally dirty. You can&#39;t win at that level by playing clean.</p>

<p>So how do you take advantage of that? Obtain and dump the dirt of one side. The general populace won&#39;t look past what&#39;s staring them in the face. They&#39;ll hack away at the tumor on their arm, ignoring the metastasis that&#39;s through the entire body.</p>

<p>Viola, you&#39;ve now hacked an election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia has little to offer us.  Their economy is shit.  They&#39;ve annexed Crimea.  Their chief exports are vodka, oil, banking fraud &amp; sex slaves.  Their penchant for spying and global state sponsored hacking are well known.  Their only agenda is to weaken other countries through mass confusion via psy ops so they can expand further into eastern Europe with impunity.<br/>
There is a reason they&#39;ve been on the naughty list since the 1940s.  </p>

<p>David Cameron (UK Former Prime Minister) met with Francois Hollande before he became the President Of France in 2011(ish). </p>

<p>Merkel was friends with that Macron before he became President. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any News about any of that? That&#39;s political ties to other countries....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather have them leak authentic documents ( which they probably didn&#39;t anyway) than have them do whatever the u.s. did to syria and libya. 
If they influenced the election with pertinent information and it worked, then maybe the American people value transparency more than the establishment would like to admit. </p>
