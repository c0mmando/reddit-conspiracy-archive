<p>But I&#39;m getting sick of the fucking reason for defending Trump is because everyone hates him.</p>

<p>Everyone hates him because he&#39;s scum. He&#39;s a fucking idiot who&#39;s slowly ruining this country and he&#39;s not Making America Great Again.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not draining the swamp, he&#39;s filling it up with more swampiness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a fucking lie, his entire campaign was a fucking lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are not saying that &quot;everything&quot; they say is fake. What we are saying is that in certain circumstances they play fast and loose with the truth. They stretch and skew the facts and distort it hoping you will not see what they are doing. They especially do this in the titles of their articles. When you actually read their articles, you will see that they do finally reveal all sides of the story, but usually within a short paragraph two thirds of the way through the article. </p>

<p>The new right is doing this now as well and I hate it. Remember not too long ago when articles were claiming that Crowdstrike had backtracked on their Russian hacking investigation? If you read the article you found that it was only a certain aspect of it dealing with Ukrainian military information that was incorrect. The article eventually said the truth, but the title was completely misleading.</p>

<p>That is what the MSM is doing all the damn time with the Russian narrative and Trump&#39;s &quot;scandals&quot;! Why can&#39;t you see this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, headline are the worse. Always sensational. And I agree both the left and the right media distort facts like your Crowdstrike example. </p>

<p>I agree a lot of the attacks on Trump are media bias. But this is way beyond that. From government to tech firms, everyone is saying it&#39;s Russia, so I don&#39;t see how you can use that as proof that it&#39;s not Russia. Theories are fine, like Seth. But there again, I don&#39;t see any evidence to back it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I understand what you are saying, and Russia is horrifyingly corrupt. They do NOT have any interest in helping the United States or it&#39;s citizens. Putin is a former intelligence official with the classic underhandedness that comes from a person with his kind of background.</p>

<p>All I am saying is I sense that the Russian narrative is being used as a tool to silence the opposition. I have found the MSM&#39;s handling of all this to be reprehensible. I feel manipulated almost every time I read an MSM article dealing with this narrative. In fact I feel manipulated by almost all media outlets these days as they all have agendas. The worst part of it is America is not truly a self contained national entity anymore. It is all a farce. Politicians of both parties are lobbying for foreign governments and they are all tied in a vast web of corruption. </p>

<p>This Russian narrative has genuine holes in it. People cannot just bash the opposition by mocking any info that comes up in opposition to the Russian narrative as Russian propaganda. We need the truth. Not Russian truth, or American truth, or globalist truth, but truth. Nobody right now is serving truth and it is getting harder to pick the snippets of truth from the propaganda of all sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What holes? That was my point. I posted an article about it, and not a single comment attacking any facts, or pointing out hold. Just that it&#39;s &quot;fake news&quot;. name calling, i&#39;m a sheep for believing it..etc etc</p>

<p>Seriously, what am I missing that make it so hard to believe. You get a weak, divided US is good for Russia. You get Putin is KGB and thinks this way. You probably also know they both warned us about it before the election and have bragged about their capabilities after. Combine that with what our gvnt is saying and what information security firms say, and I just don&#39;t get why I shouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and I would agree. Russia has an amazing intelligence apparatus. I think it is only rational to assume Russia does mess with our politics domestically and internationally. Both the west and Russia have been going about it for awhile now. The west with the color revolutions and the destabilization of the Ukraine. Russia with it&#39;s annexations and it&#39;s destabilization of the NATO allied nations. </p>

<p>Yeah I would agree with you. I do NOT trust Russia and I hate it when other folks praise Putin. He is a monster. I just get really disgusted and irritated when the MSM is trying to push me into a certain mode of thinking for ulterior motives. I do not like it.</p>

<p>Fuck I do not have a coherent view of what is happening in the world. It is various actors and collectives playing power games. Some for supposedly noble purposes, others for truly nefarious ones. Behind it all I think there are a few that do quietly push the affairs of the world slowly one way or another according to their ends. I do not know who or what these groups are, but I suspect they are there, like a kind of mafia on steroids. Iran-Contra, the franklin cover-up, the dutroux affair, the G2 lodge, and other operations/scandals/conspiracies show that there is something deeper and more sinister. I just cannot put my finger on it. There are glimmers of things so dark I do not even like to think about it, but there is nothing definite.</p>

<p>What about you, man? What do you think may be happening that we do not get to see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Trump is a goon. Still though I think that this current presidency is being attacked by all the kinds of people I detest. The neocon/neoliberal continuum, the intelligence apparatus, and the MSM. Because of this I am against what they are doing to Trump. They are obviously not doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. </p>

<p>Equating Trump with Hitler is silly. If you do this, then you should call Obama and Bush jr Hitlers. Right now Trump is eroding the checks and balances of our government, but it is clearly different from the abolition of constitutional law by Hitler. Be careful using Hitler like this, because when you do this, it is like the boy who cried wolf, and soon it loses meaning. What if we do get a tyrannical ruler starting the real destroying, and you start making a just equation to Hitler, and it does not have the same power it could have?</p>

<p>There is a lot of weight to the idea that a lot of the most grievous of excesses claimed to have been carried out by the nazis/Hitler are made up. Made up because amongst other things, the National Socialist structure of a Nazi government doesn&#39;t adhere to the international monetary/central banking a systems being put in place internationally by all the Allied nations after the war. One way to make people not look at a political opponents literature is to attach a horrible stigma to their name. </p>
