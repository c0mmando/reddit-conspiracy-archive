<p>Understand that if you comment with something like &quot;It&#39;s just stupid bullshit taking up my time and space.&quot; Or &quot;People lack physics education so goddamn much here.&quot;, you automatically lose this argument and can go f-ck yourself with a cactus for being such an ignorant asshole.</p>

<p>Depending on if the OP believes it or if they just want to debate - that shows me how much skin the OP has in the game.</p>

<p>Not ONE flat earther can explain the star paths in the sky as seen in night time time-lapse photography when you compare what one sees when in northern hemisphere vs Southern Hemisphere vs equator.
So until then, I keep my energy in these threads to a minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>I don&#39;t know. Why does it matter?
It&#39;s no secret that us globe deniers don&#39;t have an accurate map of the world, mainly because we don&#39;t have the resources to map one.
You&#39;dd need high altitude planes, perhaps even sattelites if they are even possible (I don&#39;t know if there is a physical glass dome, or if it&#39;s more of a physics defying membrane), you&#39;dd need expensive camera equipment for each plane, ...
While alot of flat earthers are steadily convinced the earth is flat, I&#39;m more interested in a mainstream (open) debate about this, but it takes critical mass for the media to do this. (because it&#39;s round, no questions asked)
And we&#39;re getting there. This article is step in the right direction.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need an <em>infallible</em> map, all I would need is a working hypothesis of a map. Distances between continents and landmasses were largely known before the space program. People have been sailing around the cape of south Africa for hundreds of hears at least. With the information that is available (surface area of countries mainly) there should at least be a hypothetical map that <em>could</em> work. The equidistant azimuthal map (UN Logo) just doesn&#39;t do that. I always use South Africa as an example for this because it&#39;s the most obvious. I often see <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IAz6PvPsdsE/VYHjLyEQg_I/AAAAAAAAALk/62ZeP0awzgA/s1600/Gleasons%2BFlat%2BEarth%2BMap.jpg">this</a> used as an example of a Flat Earth map, and I always point out the relative size of South Africa in comparison to Europe. South Africa is much smaller than it is portrayed in that map, which can be seen with <a href="http://www.thetruesize.com">this</a> website by dragging the overlay of South Africa over Europe.</p>

<p>I understand the sympathy of needing advanced tools to create <em>and prove</em> that a map works, but we had at least workable globe models before we had high altitude planes and satellites.</p>

<p>I understand that the counter-argument to this is probably &quot;we don&#39;t know that those distances are accurate&quot;, but in all honesty, I have a very hard time believing that the entire seafaring shipping industry is in on this conspiracy, and clearly they are aware of the distances between landmasses and lengths of coastline on landmasses. I trust that this information is more than likely accurate based off of that.</p>

If you&#39;re at the top of the Earth and begin flying straight on an airplane, why don&#39;t you fly straight into space. How do butterflies fly, while gravity holds the entire ocean down. How do planes land on a runway. I think I get the basic understanding of why these things occur, but I still find them to be strange. Thank you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter how stupid they are, it&#39;s always better to ask questions and I respect you for that.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t see clouds behind the sun at all. I might know where you got that idea though, and the answer is no. Imagine a room filled with fog where you can&#39;t see anything, and then a spotlight shines directly in your face through the fog. You&#39;ll suddenly be able to see the light almost as if it were in front of the fog even though it&#39;s actually at the back of the room. The sun is simply bright, you will sometimes be able to see it through the clouds despite not being able to see anything else, giving the impression that the clouds must be behind the sun when they aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Because of gravity. Same reason if you attach sling around a model plane on the end of a string, the rope is always pulling the plane down. Because it&#39;s pulling both the nose and tail of the plane down at the same time, the plan will always have its belly facing towards the earth, so even without course corrections you still won&#39;t fly off the planet.</p>

<p>Butterflies fly because they are not nearly as dense as the water in the ocean, and the less dense something is the more it will float. That&#39;s why helium balloons go up, because helium is less dense than the average air composition. A butterfly, of course, isn&#39;t less dense than air, but it&#39;s much closer than the ocean. As such, all it needs is a little extra boost up which it gets from pushing down on the air with its wings and it can fly. That&#39;s how everything flies, by compensating the difference in density between itself and the air with an additional boost upwards. Also, gravity effects each individual atom, not each individual object as we define them. So the ocean weighs so much more than a butterfly because it has more atoms, despite them both being considered a &#39;single&#39; object that you might think would attract the same amount of gravity. Gravity is dependent on mass. The more mass gravity can &#39;latch on to&#39;, the harder it can pull.</p>

<p>Uh, what do you mean? They go down, hit the ground, and roll to a stop. They are less dense than air, so they will fall without that additional thrust up I mentioned before. Simply cut the engines and it goes down.</p>

<p>No problem. Some of these things are a bit tricky to wrap our minds around because we take them for granted, but that shouldn&#39;t be used as a reason for thinking that they must be false, simply because they&#39;re harder to understand than you thought. </p>

<p>My advice is to always think of a sort of comparison between a natural phenomenon and something a little more familiar to better understand these things. Like the ropes attached to the plane. If you have a rope attached to every part of the plane and not just the middle, then when you spin that plane around it will conform to the rotation and always have its belly facing the center. Same thing for gravity, it&#39;s not just pulling the center of the plane down, it&#39;s also pulling the nose of the plane down and the tail and the wings, forcing it to stay oriented with the surface.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I just did and have before to learn how to paint it. That&#39;s just the sun being bright enough to shine through the clouds though, clouds are not thick at all, a bright light behind them just exposes this.</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t believe me on that account, think of it this way. If the sun is really at cloud level, then it travels hundreds of times slower than a plane. A plane at <em>higher</em> than cloud level can cross the sky in a matter of minutes, and still not reach its destination for hours. If the sun takes about 12 hours to cross the sky, and a plane at an even higher altitude 5 minutes, then the sun is going over 3,600 times slower than the plane, meaning it if it takes a plane 12 hours to go from America to Chine, it would take the sun 43,200 hours to go from America to China, and that&#39;s just around half the earth. It still has another 43,200 hours to go before it would reach you again. That would make each day 86,400 hours long, but they&#39;re only 24. Are you seeing the problem with this?</p>

<p>Gravity is related to density. You float on water right? That&#39;s because water is denser than you, meaning gravity pulls harder on it per square inch than it does on you. This essentially gives water priority over you, so that gravity will pull it down first and you after, causing you to float on top. Same concept goes for air, you&#39;re denser than air, so you have priority. That&#39;s not the best way to think of it if you want to study in the field, but hopefully it at least makes sense. </p>

<p>Because that plane is going at the exact same speed as the earth. Everything is, in fact. If the earth suddenly slowed down, it <em>would</em> crash into the ground. But since both speeds are perfectly synced, it appears as if neither are moving. Again with the comparing abstract ideas to more familiar ones, think of a paper airplane in a moving car. You throw the plane and it doesn&#39;t suddenly crash into the car at an abnormal speed because the car is moving quickly, instead it&#39;s just as if you were to throw it in a house, because so long as it&#39;s in sync with the speed of whatever object it&#39;s going to land on, you can&#39;t tell a difference.</p>

Flat earth theory is so stupid that only reyarded/brainwashed/paid off people would believe in it.

People who actually believe in fe would  ot have the brain capacity to become a scientists. </p>

<p>And if it is one thing (the most important of all actually) that I have learned from this sub is that the occult is a huge part of our lives, but especially the conspirators that run this show. Flat earthers cannot point to any occult literature that even remotely touches that subject. In fact it is the exact opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of things you (and I) observe all the time that let us know the Earth is not flat.</p>

<p>1) You can watch the sunset twice if you watch it first by lying down and then immediately jump up after it dips below the horizon.</p>

<p>2) Timezones</p>

<p>3) Ships disappear bottom first over the horizon.</p>

<p>By no means is this a comprehensive list, but here are easily verifiable phenomenon that we all have direct access to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they do. You&#39;ve no doubt seen the evidence I&#39;ve posted of this multiple
Times now? When you see videos of people zooming in to &quot;pull them back&quot; they aren&#39;t magically making a ship reappear in front of the horizon, that ship never went over the horizon. </p>

<p>When things get very far away they can become invisible to the naked eye before they actually cross over the horizon. That is what is happening in those videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) You can use those observations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. How would you explain this on a Flat Earth model? </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a walk through of how to calculate it:
<a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/%7Edns/teachersguide/MeasECAct.html">http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~dns/teachersguide/MeasECAct.html</a></p>

<p>2) I guess you didn&#39;t want to provide a counter argument?</p>

<p>3) No they don&#39;t magically reappear. Just because something isn&#39;t visible to you doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s fallen below the horizon. Cameras allow us to perceive many things we can&#39;t with the naked eye, that does nothing to establish a lack of curvature.</p>

<p>Here you can see the ship disappearing bottom first:

<p>Unfortunately I have spent more than 2 hours looking at all of this, and If by &quot;heavily defending&quot; you mean providing explanations as to why a globe model is accurate, sure whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) When you stand up, you can see further away, so it&#39;s possible to see a sunset (and rise) twice. This is true for both flat and round earth. (Because light doesn&#39;t carry infinitely far due to atmosphere) The math doesn&#39;t prove or disprove anything.</p>

<p>2) Time zones exist on a flat earth. The Sun doesn&#39;t light up the entire plane at once, or there would never be night. At this point, I know you&#39;re trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) So it&#39;s just a coincidence that using basic observations we can accurately determine the same circumference found with other calculations?</p>

<p>2) So if your working theory is the &quot;spotlight&quot; sun? Why then does the sun appear to slide behind the horizon? Shouldn&#39;t it just get smaller and smaller in the sky as it grows distant and then become
Too far to view?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s an example I use every now and then: Grab a water glass and look at it. Do you see the bubbles of air floating to the top? Note their shape. They form into little spheroids because that is the most stable form for the air to compress down into under the greater pressure of the water around it. These same physics are why planets form into spheroid shapes due to immense pressures of gravity, because all of the pull is evenly distributed across the shape of the planet when it is a spheroid. There is an equal pull of gravity from the center at every point on the planet. Why don&#39;t we fall off of the bottom of the planet? The gravity is pulling us towards the center of planet just like everything else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you explain the tides of the ocean? You can travel around the world and measure the tides in as many areas as you want quite easily. </p>

<p>Even though these tides you can witness with your own eyes can be mapped to the movements of the Earth relative to sun and moon&#39;s respective gravitational pulls... It&#39;s just coincidence?</p>

<p>So you believe...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Earth is a vast plane ‘stretched out upon the waters,’ and it will be seen that it must of necessity slightly fluctuate, or slowly rise and fall in the water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thus we have been carried forward by the sheer force of evidence to the conclusion that the tides of the sea do not arise from the attraction of the moon, but simply from the rising and falling of the floating earth in the waters of the ‘great deep.’&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>-Samuel Rowbotham, “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!”, 1849
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Tides are caused by the gentle and gradual rise and fall of the earth on the bosom of the mighty deep.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>T. L. Cullingworth, &quot;Zetetic Cosmogony&quot;, 1899
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By what means the tides are so regularly affected is at present only conjectured; possibly it may be by atmospheric pressure on the waters of the Great Deep, and perhaps even the Moon itself, as suggested by the late Dr. Rowbotham, may influence the atmosphere, increasing or diminishing its barometric pressure, and indirectly the rise and fall of the Earth in the waters.”</p>

<p>But there is something protecting it!??! The Earth&#39;s strong magnetic field is the very reason we have an atmosphere while Mar&#39;s atmosphere has been nearly stripped away. </p>

<p>The tilt is the very thing that gives us seasons, as the angle of the earth becomes parallel to the sunrays <a href="http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2002-09/atj/feature/images/SolarElevation1.gif">the same amount of light has to cover a greater area</a> thus heating it up less than when the sun is hitting the earth head on, like near the equator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earth is not flat though dude, it&#39;s not even in the realm of possibility. I say that after having thought it through multiple times, I&#39;m not just saying it because everyone else does.</p>

<p>How do satellites work? We see them all the time at night, are you expecting me to believe they have infinite fuel sources? They need to be in orbit to stay up there.
A popular theory among you guys is that the sun and moon move in a circle on top of a disk. If this were the case, we would always have a half moon, and the moon wouldn&#39;t change phases over the course of a month, it would change phases over the course of a single night. The sun would also look smaller on the horizon as it would be farther away.
Why the massive multi-billion dollar cover up? I&#39;ve not heard anyone mention a good reason. Also, if there are so many guards around Antarctica, why have none of them leaked the info? This would be the biggest secret the world has ever known, you don&#39;t think of thousands of guards, at least a few would have talked and provided proof?
There are different constellations below the equator than there are above the equator.
You can see the curvature of the moon as the craters become more oblong around the edges when viewed through a simple telescope. This would imply that the Earth too is round.
The International Space Station has a live feed here. There is also a 24/7 live stream of earth here if you want to watch it for repeated footage or whatever.
What of the other planets in the sky? With a cheap telescope anyone could purchase, you&#39;ll be able to see the curve of the shadow on other planets like Jupiter, or even the rings of Saturn. I&#39;ve done so myself, it&#39;s really cool and I highly recommend it if you really want to know the truth.
Why does the sun set and rise in different places over the course of a year.
How is it possible you can see the moon in the day. What about solar eclipses. And lunar eclipses? Blood moon? Anything?
I could go on, I haven&#39;t even broken out the old google yet, this is just stuff that comes to mind, but I want to end on 10. The horizon. If the earth were flat, then the ocean should fade into the distance due to the atmosphere, not suddenly cut off. A good way of proving this is taking a plane ride over the ocean. You&#39;ll notice that there is a clear cut line where the ocean should simply fade into the distance, meaning it disappears due to curvature, and not atmospheric fog slowly covering it up or any optical illusions that sometimes happen when you&#39;re on the shore almost parallel to the ocean and not looking down from a plane.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a little surprised you could have an astrophysics degree, and I assume study exo planets, as well as the well understood physics that apply to them all, and still think there&#39;s even a slight possibility the earth could be flat. There is just so much wrong with that.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s go withhhh how dark moons are possible if <a href="http://lionsground.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/flat-earth-theory-sun.jpg">this map</a> is the case. From what I can tell, there would never be a totally dark moon, at least not in North America which is where I&#39;m from, and I&#39;ve indeed seen dark moons. </p>

<p>Oh and to add on to that, blood moons. I&#39;ve also seen blood moons, which if you didn&#39;t know, is when the earth is perfectly between the sun and the moon, so that the sun&#39;s light makes a circular sunset from the moon&#39;s perspective and illuminates it in a reddish glow. I don&#39;t know how that would be possible either.</p>

<p>You say these questions have been answered, but I don&#39;t know where, and if you already know the answer surely you could take a minute to enlighten me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a big difference between these two types of questions. The questions about 9/11 that you&#39;re talking about have possible answers, they may be ridiculous answers, but they are possible. We may not know which answer is true if any at all, but we at least know of some <em>possible</em> answers. </p>

<p>My question is about a physical impossibility that doesn&#39;t even have a possible answer, let alone an answer that&#39;s true. It&#39;s not so much a question as it is a glaring flaw in the flat earth theory, or at least that particular one. </p>

<p>So you got an answer or you gonna keep dodging the question/glaring flaw?</p>

<p>You rattled off a long list of questions that are not proof of either the globe or flat earth model. They are simply gaps in your understanding of the model (and ours, too). Again, it doesn&#39;t prove your mainstream brainwashing as the truth just because I don&#39;t feel like addressing all of your questions right here, right now. I&#39;m not your mother and I wasn&#39;t offering to be a spokesperson for the FE community. I&#39;m pretty sure this is my thread and I actually asked YOU the most simple question so far: Where is the evidence that Flat Earth is a CIA psyop? I don&#39;t care about your feelings and subjective opinions on the matter, thanks.</p>

<p>You linked me to a 3D model which is not a map. There is no agreed upon flat earth map. This is why I was implying that you&#39;re a moron, because you&#39;re assuming there&#39;s some kind of textbook model out there that we&#39;re all referencing. Thus these questions are stupid and pointless. That model is also showing 2 flat discs pointing straight down at the earth. I&#39;ve never seen such a model before so if you&#39;d like to explain it yourself, go for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you trolling? I don&#39;t have evidence? I literally see curved planets through the telescope, I can tear apart literally every flat earth theory out there in multiple ways yet I can&#39;t find a single flaw in the idea that the Earth is round. It fits everything, the reason we have the Aurora Borealis, the reason we have tides, the reason we have a blood moon, the reason the moon has phases over days and not nights, the reason I can see that other planets are round through a telescope, the reason we have seasons, the reason we have days and nights that change length over the course of a year, the reason the stars are different on the southern and northern hemispheres, <em>everything</em>. </p>

<p>That&#39;s <em>all</em> called evidence, both for a round earth and against a flat one. I don&#39;t just have faith that it&#39;s true, I observe my reality and put together the most logical conclusion. </p>

<p>Because I have no reason not to believe in a round earth, and multiple reasons not to believe in a flat earth that you said yourself no one knows the answer to (btw that&#39;s because there is no answer to a physical impossibility), you now have to give a reason invalidating the round earth in favor of the flat earth before you can say the round earth fact is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The curve of the earth is not visible even from 120,000 ft. I can see the full image of objects that should be over the curve and out of sight according to the globe model mathematics. What you see through your telescope are only planets because someone in grade school told you so. You don&#39;t actually have the evidence to say that we are also on a planet. Gravity isn&#39;t magic and doesn&#39;t hold liquids perfectly motionless while the object they are resting on is spinning 1000 mph. The atmosphere can&#39;t magically stay attached to a spinning ball while being right up against a perfect vacuum. Physically impossible. Planes don&#39;t have to account for earth&#39;s curve when maintaining their horizon line. Planes don&#39;t have to worry about which direction they are flying when they land or take off which would be logical on a spinning ball. Even your pseudoscientists that you worship say the earth is actually an oblate spheroid or pear shape, not a perfect sphere. So why are all our formulas for perfect spheres? Why do you believe gravity is magic? Even Neil Degrasse Tyson says we don&#39;t really understand gravity. Basically everything hinges on the theory of gravity and if scientists are saying we don&#39;t fully understand it, and they still call it a theory, then why place so much faith in it to explain literally everything else about the globe model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The curvature of the earth is visible at 35 thousand feet, go see for yourself.</p>

<p>And a banana is only a banana because someone in grade school told me so, that&#39;s how names work, unless that&#39;s a conspiracy too.</p>

<p>I do have the evidence to say that we&#39;re actually on a planet as well, it&#39;s called the blood moon. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right about gravity not holding water motionless. The earth&#39;s spin pushes the water in sync with the spin, the inertia takes care of the rest. Same reason if you put yourself in a washer machine you&#39;ll stick to a single point on the wall as it spins.</p>

<p>Yes it can, physically possible. A lot of people have a fundamental misunderstanding of vacuums. Think of it this way, if you have empty space and plop down some air in it, that air won&#39;t be going anywhere. There&#39;s no pressure difference in space. Now if you plop down an object that pulls that air inward, the air will go towards it since it had no acting force on it prior.</p>

<p>Of course they don&#39;t, gravity acts like a bunch of strings attached to every individual molecule on that plane. If you took a paper airplane and attached 50 strings to it evenly dispersed, the paper airplane would always have its belly facing the center, where the strings are attached. This misunderstanding comes from the assumption that gravity is pulling the middle of the plane down, like a single string, but not the rest of the plane, giving it 3 degrees of rotation when it really only has 1, the one perpendicular to the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>No planes don&#39;t have to worry about that, it&#39;s an isolated system where everything is moving relative to each other. Same reason a paper airplane in a moving car acts no differently than a paper airplane in a stationary house. You should know this at the very least.</p>

<p>Because the earth is so close to a sphere that it might as well be one for all our scientific purposes. The error is minimal and shouldn&#39;t effect any experiments except for possibly a few very very precise ones. Like perhaps the one that measured gravitational waves just last year.</p>

<p>Gravity is something we know exists and can measure with 100% predictability, we just don&#39;t yet know exactly how it works. It&#39;s an observable and sound answer to all our questions, which is significantly better than a non-observable, nonsensical &#39;answer&#39; to all our questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked around, and the general consensus is that there are no records of that statement from Einstein. And if it were true, it would be a joke, because Einstein knew Tesla vigorously disagreed with his theories on relativity since many scientists were skeptical when it was a new theory. It represented a radical departure from the understanding of physics at the time, and worse, relativity predicted extremely unintuitive results which made it even harder to believe. But by 1934, the theory of relativity was entirely beyond doubt among mainstream physicists. Einstein had published the Special Theory in 1905 and the General Theory a decade later. There was already a mountain of experimental evidence. Tesla was just being a crackpot here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s a very well known fact that Tesla was a very weird/eccentric individual, I&#39;m not saying he was a crackpot in general, just on that particular subject, as well as a few of his other far out ideas. He&#39;s known as a mad scientist for a reason.</p>

<p>But, let&#39;s pretend he was both a genius <em>and</em> perfectly sane. Even if that were the case, he also believed the earth was round, just like literally everyone throughout the past few centuries of history. If the smartest and sanest man in the world, according to you, believed the earth was round even before the government could possibly have the resources to cover such a fact up, then is that not yet more proof that the earth is round, and not the opposite?</p>

<li><p>How do satellites work? We see them all the time at night, are you expecting me to believe they have infinite fuel sources? They need to be in orbit to stay up there.</p></li>
<li><p>A popular theory among you guys is that the sun and moon move in a circle on top of a disk. If this were the case, we would always have a half moon, and the moon wouldn&#39;t change phases over the course of a month, it would change phases over the course of a single night. The sun would also look smaller on the horizon as it would be farther away.</p></li>
<li><p>Why the massive multi-billion dollar cover up? I&#39;ve not heard anyone mention a good reason. Also, if there are so many guards around Antarctica, why have none of them leaked the info? This would be the biggest secret the world has ever known, you don&#39;t think of thousands of guards, at least a few would have talked and provided proof?</p></li>
<li><p>There are different constellations below the equator than there are above the equator. </p></li>
<li><p>You can see the curvature of the moon as the craters become more oblong around the edges when viewed through a simple telescope. This would imply that the Earth too is round.</p></li>
<li><p>The International Space Station has a live feed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtU_mdL2vBM">here</a>. There is also a 24/7 live stream of earth <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/104822440">here</a> if you want to watch it for repeated footage or whatever.</p></li>
<li><p>What of the other planets in the sky? With a cheap telescope anyone could purchase, you&#39;ll be able to see the curve of the shadow on other planets like Jupiter, or even the rings of Saturn. I&#39;ve done so myself, it&#39;s really cool and I highly recommend it if you really want to know the truth. </p></li>
<li><p>Why does the sun set and rise in different places over the course of a year.</p></li>
<li><p>How is it possible you can see the moon in the day. What about solar eclipses. And lunar eclipses? Blood moon? Anything? </p></li>
<li><p>I could go on, I haven&#39;t even broken out the old google yet, this is just stuff that comes to mind, but I want to end on 10. The horizon. If the earth were flat, then the ocean should fade into the distance due to the atmosphere, not suddenly cut off. A good way of proving this is taking a plane ride over the ocean. You&#39;ll notice that there is a clear cut line where the ocean should simply fade into the distance, meaning it disappears due to curvature, and not atmospheric fog slowly covering it up or any optical illusions that sometimes happen when you&#39;re on the shore almost parallel to the ocean and not looking down from a plane.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So yeah, it really very much isn&#39;t &quot;We all know the earth is a globe therefor it&#39;s a globe.&quot; It&#39;s &quot;We all know the earth is a globe because of the bloody mountains and mountains of evidence, not only scientifically researched evidence, but common sense every-day evidence that any fool should be able to see for themselves.</p>

To me the fact &quot; they&#39;ve &quot; got everyone to believe in a higher power, GOD is the biggest push of them all...</p>
