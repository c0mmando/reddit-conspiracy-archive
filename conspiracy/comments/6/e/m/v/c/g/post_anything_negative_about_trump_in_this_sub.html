       You've been appealed to,  quite purposefully,  by the Trump propaganda machine. Political advisors have seen the potential in tapping anti-establishment and conspiracy theory types for political gain. They've made the movement mainstream, and gave them a voice in Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I'm quite certain DJT has no interest in pursuing any of the "lock her up" rhetoric he spouts off. He understands the value in mainstreaming this type of voter,  something never done before. Ingenious, by him and his advisors really.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is no longer telling you not to look at the man behind the curtain. They're pointing to a curtain across the room,  lifting it up to show the ankles and saying investigate this man!
      </p>
      <p>
       And everyone is doing what they ask because they feel enfranchised by a man that seemingly listens to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump can lock her up,  get any classified info on Seth Rich,  and on wire tapping,  and he knows what narratives he pushes. But he refuses to act,  not out of malice,  but out of any actual conviction or belief in the bullshit his administration pushes.

       Why can't we discuss both like adults tho? I agree Seth rich was murdered by a humans and I don't know why, neither do you, and let's find out. I also think we should legitimately look at curropt actions by Trump and associates. Doesn't have to be a mute point because there isn't a smoking gun yet. Last I checked of there was solid evidence in the Seth rich investigation someone would be arrested. Either way I think both can be real issues.

       Of course, I love eating up data, I'm pretty active in the new queue too so I look at pretty much at everything incoming, from ancient history to aliens to political stuff, I check a lot of stuff. From the looks of it, the Trump witch hunt seems to be merely no more than that and he's working against the deep state right now, so that's ok in my book. Kushner is next on the chopping block so that's good

       To add onto this: I downvote a lot of it because it's incredibly low effort. Threads like this for example.

       People will post a very low effort anti-Trump thread and then cry conspiracy/shills if it's downvoted. It's not because it's anti-Trump, it's because it's a terrible thread.

       Why narrow it down to the dnc? Why not just say government officials are behind the Seth Rich case? I'm sure this type of thing happens all of the time by both parties..... just like all of the other horrible things that have come up recently. By pinning it all to one party not only is ignorant but also dangerous. If any one party was guilty why wouldn't the other call it out? Maybe because it's just business as usual?

       It's bots doing the upvoting and regular users downvoting obvious astroturfed content.  That's why it ends up in controversial.

       It's only been mentioned to you a few hundred times. You just keep keep reposting
       <a href="/r/poltics">

       and operate as an MSM propaganda pusher. You don't represent a person's opinion, you represent every thing that this sub is against.

      <p>
       No one will ever change their mind as a result of anything you post. They will only dislike and downvote you more.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this though...and yet, you post on. Until you decide to switch accounts or get banned again and then another account will step in and keep pushing. The propagandists will not be ignored...

       Is there anything other than the Pissgate Dossier?

       I'm not being sarcastic it's a real question.

       <p>
        On Wednesday, committee Chairman Devin Nunes asked the agencies for details of any requests made by two top Obama administration aides and the former Central Intelligence Agency director to "unmask" Trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top-secret foreign communications intercepts, according to congressional sources.

       It seems everything is working against you in this argument.

       Are you just going to ignore that the other 4 subpoenas that went out were for Russia connections?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday issued seven new subpoenas in its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four of the subpoenas are related directly to Russian meddling, which is also also the subject of probes from the Senate Intelligence Committee and FBI.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's to bad people focus on the piss part of the dossier to try and discredit it, rather than focus on the things like Rosneft deal that matches up perfectly to unknown people(s).

       TLDR:. The dossier talks about a 19.5% oil deal.  A 19.5% oil deal went down with some very shady elements involved.

       Gee, it's almost like those people in years past who tried to discredit "conspiracy theories" by asking someone exposing something questions like, "Do you also believe in aliens and the flat Earth?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, these same anti-conspiracy deflection and ridicule tactics are being used IN r/conspiracy to BLOCK discussion of current conspiracies.

       And, supposedly, the "conspiracy theorists" themselves are doing it.

       I don't think it's bots.  There's just a lot of Trump supporters here.  It all happened around the time Pizzagate exploded.  A lot of crossover happened between here and T_D.  A lot of Trump folks stayed.  I'm active on both subs, but I was active here long before T_D.

       Here is a cut and paste comment I made a few days ago on this topic...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What I find funny is that no one gets uppity when you don't believe in Bigfoot, but if it is a partisan political conspiracy, it is an imperative that everyone believes RIGHT NOW and if you don't it is justification for the most petty types of attacks.
That is what makes this all the more suspicious. They are PERSONALLY insulting people for not wholeheartedly believing what ever articles they post, or even have a lingering doubt about their sources.
It all degenerates into whataboutisms and ad hominems.

       I'm not a bot but I downvote a lot of MSM anti-trump talking point posts.

      <p>
       I voted for Trump, I don't agree with everything he does but I didn't expect to agree with everything he does.  I expected him to upset the strangle hold that the deep state has on our country.  So far I'm pleased.  I also have a right to have any opinion I want, I'm not required to sign up for any form of groupthink regardless of if it from the_donald or from MSM.

       I do not think he is part of the deep state.  I don't think the deep state would be freaking out and leaking like a 120 year woman's bladder it he was.  I also don't think the media would be united against him if he was.

       Fair. My unsolicited opinion is they're all colluding to keep our attention away from the Real important things - things no one is talking about, including us; I don't even have a clue what these "things" might be. They have more control than we think. I have to admit, it's hard to swallow that morpheus' bosses are Tptb.

       Rest of the world is bored of hearing about people's thoughts on Trump, you murican kids seem to think if you go on long enough he will give in, just like your parents did!. Just as a helpful hint, I don't think it works that way!. No doubt you will just continue.

       Trump fans have been here all along. They're regulars here. It's unfortunate that they're partisan fools who want to cover up criticisms of our horrible president, but that doesn't mean they're bots or shills or anything else. Were you here last year throughout the election? We've NEVER been free of the Trump fans, I think they've always had a  slight majority here. In fact, the only new thing around here is the heavy pro-Democrat vote manipulation and astroturfing. We had some Clinton shills during the election, but it was never like it is today. I've been downvoted just for saying "Clinton is corrupt".

       Are you just going to ignore that the other 4 subpoenas that went out were for Russia connections?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday issued seven new subpoenas in its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four of the subpoenas are related directly to Russian meddling, which is also also the subject of probes from the Senate Intelligence Committee and FBI.

       It's to bad people focus on the piss part of the dossier to try and discredit it, rather than focus on the things like Rosneft deal that matches up perfectly to unknown people(s).

       This looks like a good breakdown of it all.  Don't get me wrong, it's not 100% verified, but many aspects of it are.

       TLDR:. The dossier talks about a 19.5% oil deal.  A 19.5% oil deal went down with some very shady elements involved.
