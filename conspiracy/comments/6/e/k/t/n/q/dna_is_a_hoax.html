        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of the stories surrounding DNA, whether the flawed experiment to prove that it carried genetic information, or the Polymerase Chain Reaction hoax, show DNA to be the scam that it is.</p>

<p>When you isolate <a href="https://borntoscience.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/strawberry-dna-041815.jpg">‘DNA’</a> from strawberries, you are actually removing the white pith</p>

<p><a href="http://www.go-ontap.com/media/Slide1(11).jpg">http://www.go-ontap.com/media/Slide1(11).jpg</a></p>

<p>Think of it this way, the purpose of fruit is to spread seeds. The strawberry flesh does not contain DNA, the DNA is contained within the seeds. Expecting to find DNA in the strawbery flesh is like expecting to find DNA in watermelon flesh instead of the seeds. The genetic material (if it exists) is clearly contained in the seeds...</p>

<p>When you isolate DNA from cheek cells, you are actually isolating bacteria/fungus in our saliva.</p>

<p>Genetic science is filled with implausible ‘facts’ and information that defies all logic.</p>

<p>How is it possible that 80% of DNA is junk? Is this meant to be some kind of sick joke? So we have the most important bio-molecule in the world, the blueprint for life no less, yet almost all of it is essentially a waste of space?</p>

<p>Is 80% of my skeleton junk? Could I remove 80% of my liver, lungs or colon, and experience no change in function whatsoever? NO!</p>

<p>So why would it be any different with DNA?</p>

<p>As seen <a href="https://youtu.be/8n2LvJ-m0n0?t=19m52s">here</a> scientists who sequence DNA are simply looking at software, they don’t observe the reactions in real time, but read numbers off a screen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory.  This reminds me of my college anthropology class. I hated it.  Sure, it was interesting, but it was all an obvious fairy tale.  They find pieces of pottery and rock arrow tips and knives and then extrapolate all kinds of facts about the civilization from those artifacts.  Or find 5 weird bones and claim they found one out human ancestors.  What a bunch of &quot;hogwash&quot;.  And if you question the narrative, the professors and TA&#39;s get angry because they have literally based their identify off of this profession.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the fossils are just completely made up.</p>

<p>Take the Nebraska man hoax for example. They combined a jaw from a pig with the cranium of an orangutan and tried to pass that off as being a human skull.</p>

<p>Anthropology consists of made up stories. Historians 100 years from now will be promoting the mainstream narrative of 9/11 and the fake &#39;War on Terror&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking as a microbiologist and somone who studied genetics and evolution in acadamia.  </p>

<p>First I have to state that in the sciences (although not readily admitted by the orthodox scientists) there is a large amount of faith and dogma that do tend to enter into the scientific community.  Especially when money enters into the equation, there are many &quot;facts&quot; that are in deed contrary to truth.  Many instances have occured where mainstream sciences actually acted to stop progress in the field, by failing to admit there is evidence that doesnt fit the current model.  When you ignore evidence you become dogmatic.  </p>

<p>Whenever using scientific method (trial, error, revise repeat), you cannot know absolute truths, you can however make models that seem to reflect truth accurately.  Cellular and molecular bio are no different.  </p>

<p>First off to address &quot;junk&quot; DNA.  The first scientists to analyze dna used what all humans use to interpret, pattern recognition.  Many patterns were picked out and seen over and over again across individuals and  even between species and kingdoms.  Much of the sequences they studied however didn&#39;t appear to follow any particular pattern, and so it was concluded that this was irrelevant or &quot;Junk&quot;.  When you look at something and you dont understand its usefulness, it appears without purpose, or junk.  This is however a simple explanation, and in hindsight it appears that this DNA does serve a more complex purpose. </p>

<p>WHen you isolate DNA from a strawberry, and you run its sequence you get a unique code, which is unique as a snowflake and does not exist anywhere else.  If you run DNA from the same strawberry a second and third time, you will find similar DNA sequences, but they will be different.  Each of of our cells contain DNA which is related to the other human cells in our bodies.  This is why DNA testing is should NOT be used as 100% in criminal cases.  Cells are like you and your family and your cousins, there are similarities, but variation.  In fact taking into account mutation and cell death (apoptosis) your mean DNA sequence also changes throughout your life.  </p>

<p>Anyways there is allot I could talk about.  But to address the conspiracy.  In order for DNA to be a hoax, you would have to design and control all sequencing software.  This software would have to have some bases to connect related &quot;life matter&quot; by degrees, accurately and precisely to other living things based on how closely they resembled one another.  </p>

<p>In my opinion the odds of this are nil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>The idea of junk DNA reminds me of the vestigial organs scam. Scientists claimed that the spleen was leftover from previous evolutionary origins, this was later found to be incorrect.</p>

<p>I thought that the DNA in each and every cell is the same, but that signalling determines which codons are expressed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNA is inherently too unstable.  Especially during DNA replication, but even during gene expression and at rest(G1 phase), you can end up with all kinds of mutations.  From second to second, many of your cells are spontaneously mutating.  </p>

<p>Maybe the powers that be tried to convince us that we are made of the material so that we see ourselves as nothing but part of the material scenery they prescribe. Instead maybe we are those made of spiritual matter that can ultimately decide and create the reality </p>

<p>we want to live in. Giving us a real chance at freedom of expression, love, compassion, empathy and the ability to live out our own destinies, adventures and lives.</p>
