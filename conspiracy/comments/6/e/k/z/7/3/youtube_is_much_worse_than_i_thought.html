    <div class="md"><p>We thought it was a psyopl. The problem is, it is so massive and intricate. This would have taken years to create and would have been created years ago.</p>

<p>It gets way worse. There are some nude children videos(no sexual acts ..yet..) on some of the commenters accounts. These people are communicating via ceasar cipher. This whole thing is super complex and the amount of data that needs to be looked at is insane.</p>

<p>I hate reddit because of the botters and paid shills, but I hope you normal users can help look into it. Here is some info for you guys to check out. I&#39;ll leave it up for a few minutes. Hope this helps</p>

I haven&#39;t watched OP video so I don&#39;t know if the toddler is compliant but my guess is no.</p>

<p>She might believe she&#39;s playing a game. She might even think it&#39;s &quot;fun&quot;. That has little bearing on the possibility of this being abuse, or this being used for some sick pervs to get off to.</p>

I personally love the idea of people subverting all TV programming into the pile of shit it really is. Maybe these people are nothing but comedians, like MAD magazine or National Lampoon magazine. 
If parents let their kids search for videos online at this point, they are just plain stupid. If they don&#39;t find programming videos, they will find XXX prono level videos of all of their favorite TV stars.  </p>

<p>If continue to post these videos to this subreddit something bad is going to happen. I never said we shouldn&#39;t expose or discuss. But putting these links everywhere gives it more views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By posting them here it gets the topic more exposure; yes, more people are going to see it, but that also means that more people can work on contacting their local authorities if needed (I didn&#39;t watch), or just investigate to find out WTF is going on. If we all see something horrible and never say anything about it for fear that someone else may be exposed then you could say goodbye to the news, discussions, trial by jury, pretty much everything and unfortunately we can&#39;t live in Bikini Bottom so we have to talk about what is wrong in the world to try to solve it, even if it is unpleasant. Also I see (frequently) people complaining about the topics posted in Conspiracy but they&#39;re conspiracies...upvote threads more to your liking and give them a chance to be at the top.</p>

<p>Any Russian readers able to translate the comments?  I am curious if it mostly people freaked out, proving the video is just for views and ad revenue?  Or are people enjoying it?</p>

<p>I wonder if that&#39;s not the goal. You would eliminate all user-created content, overnight. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but to prevent pedophilia, you have to submit your video to our team of raters, which we offer for the low rate of $99 per hour of video. No refunds if content is deemed unsuitable for all audiences&quot;, then they censor with it. Like say you&#39;re George Webb, they could just say &quot;I&#39;m sorry but your video is unsuitable for a larger audience&quot;, and then that would be that. Sure, you could still talk about anything online, but that would separate the internet into politically correct and fringe. </p>

<p>And guys, that might be the key here. Perhaps, we bring this to the attention of businesses who are unknowingly Advertizing in these videos. If these videos get big businesses in there, screen shot it, report it to these businesses who will demand to not be involved in such shit, and demand better standards from YouTube? </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the same exact excuse used by that family that just got &quot;busted&quot; for making &quot;pretend&quot; videos of them beating their son, being mean to him, making him stay home while they went on vacation, etc? (I forget the channels name now).</p>

<p>This is actually incorrect. Children cannot even fully comprehend length of time, let alone the concept of something scary being &quot;acting&quot;. It&#39;s something my 6 year old has just started to understanding (acting). </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean they couldn&#39;t be able to cope with it. Of course they would. It won&#39;t kill them. Children are pretty resilient. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still not something that&#39;s appropriate for children to watch. Just like it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for my children to sit down and watch ISIS beheading videos. It being inappropriate has little to do with their emotional maturity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking through these videos to make any sort of sense to them after seeing that other thread on the Elsa and Spiderman videos; they&#39;re fucking weird.
Like, they&#39;re really fucking creepy weird.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a bit much to call them pedophiles without knowing the truth though, it honestly just looks like some Russians / Eastern Europeans have found a new &#39;reply girl&#39; thing, but for children. Children will watch the ads and will watch random shit of their favorite superhero / cartoon character even if it&#39;s retarded shit.</p>

<p>The ones with the children are really fucking creepy, but I still think it&#39;s just them trying to target other children for views and ad-money. </p>

<p>Maybe I am giving them too much credit, but I feel that if this was a pedo thing they wouldn&#39;t be quite so open / exposed with millions of views and SEO shit. </p>

<p>Still, people who use their children to make youtube money are fucked up.</p>

<p>I agree, though (as you can see in my comments here) I don&#39;t rule out that possibility at all. </p>

<p>My question was actually a legitimate one -- why try and attract children to these videos? Most kids aren&#39;t going to want to watch the video linked, and many others like it. Yet they are purposefully advertising it as &quot;for children&quot;. </p>

<p>Why? One conclusion could be that they are targeting adults. Another could be far more sinister. Another could be totally harmless fun. </p>

<p>Kids will consume anything that resembles their idols from the big screen movies. Fuck, I mean Star Wars Oranges were a thing at one point among other weird merchandised things, but hey they still sold because of the association with Star Wars.</p>

<p>Though I did just go have a look at the full channel because I assumed there might be some sort of backstory, like this being some series or something, and most of the popular uploads are the child bound with a knife / gun to their face... Pretty fucking weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically I pull up YouTube for him and find a video of Ninja turtles or something. YouTube has that feature where it plays the next video automatically so sometimes that will lead him in a certain direction, but from the times I was with him, he will sometimes watch about half of a video and see a video of spiderman or a superhero on the side bar and click on it. Obviously he can&#39;t read so he&#39;s just going off of pictures. I think it&#39;s a combination of the auto play and him clicking on random videos that had led him to some of these videos. We&#39;ve only seen him get to videos that I would classify as inappropriate a couple times so it may be that he&#39;s only seen a couple or he&#39;s seen more. </p>

<p>So to answer your last question, I imagine they if you just went through a bunch of kids videos and sort of let YouTube take you asking the way as a child would, you would eventually run into some of these. </p>

<p>My 3 year old would disagree. And I doubt kids that young are going to have YouTube accounts, so it&#39;s plausible a lot of the activity coming from adult accounts are actually the kids using their parent&#39;s accounts to watch YouTube (like my kid does).</p>

<p>I try my hardest to steer him away from content like this, but if I&#39;m at work, there&#39;s not much I can do. Tried talking to my wife about it to get her on the same page, but it&#39;s always &quot;there you go with the conspiracy theories again...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a sub culture of people who take pleassure in terrifying and torturing kids online. Even when pizzagate was first revealed I somehow did not understand that it is a subculture of the online community. Much like furries are a subculture. A simple google search of duct taped children will reveal so many people who post photos of their own children duct taped and tortured. These parents have been arrested. The photos are actually similar to the famous comet ping pong photo of the little girl taped to a table. These videos are that subculture that enjoys terrorizing children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking at the video, perhaps we as humans just find taping someone abusive but they have a bunch of videos with the same girl and family on the channel. </p>

<p>I dont find the dragging on the floor thing a big deal, my brother used to hold me upside down just to play around with me.</p>

<p>So looks like a kids channel but Im sure pedos probably are into watching kids shows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) there is a lot of shit going on on youtube with fake cartoons depicting extreme violence and targeted to children (ie unlike &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot; variety)</p>

<p>2) this video IS NOT the same shit. This is obvious some sort of homemade &quot;movie&quot;, the girl tries hard to be an actress (coming off as cute more than anything else), and while the tape was unnecessary and might have hurt a bit when they took it off, it is nothing more than acting. </p>

<p>TL;DR Youtube is being flooded with violent cartoons targeted at children. The video linked is just some stupid youtube homemade video, and much better than our shitty &quot;child beauty pageant&quot; (now that shit is scary, thank you TLC)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a thread the other day with one of these channels (freaky toys I think it was called.)  But the guy kept talking about Easter Eggs in the video.  People were trying to figure out if the eggs symobilized something.   </p>

<p>It seems to me this is a more likely explanation:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)</a>       </p>

<p>Basically, what I think he was referring to was hidden sexual messages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TLDR, bug my mission after reading that Spiderman n Elsa stuff was to get this shut down. If YT dies it dies. Anyway thus us what I posted on guys channel, &quot;4chan and Reddit have united to take down this gross pedophile ring on YouTube. Cyphers have been decoded. Anonymous will win this war. Upvote if you have kids and are concerned about what they watch or just for Internet safety.&quot; Post something similar l. I have 2 daughters 5 and 8. They have access, but luckily don&#39;t watch this shit. I want Pol to get names. I&#39;m only 30, but I&#39;ll kill anyone who directly targets my daughter and let the court of opinion decide if it&#39;s OK or not. Let tax payers provide for pedos or just kill them? Our system is fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am in no way saying there isn&#39;t. But we exposed the twitter pedes and nothing came of it. Just gave them publicity. We need to be careful when just promoting these links. I get that the user say the word promoting and took it as me saying he was pro pedo. He&#39;s just giving them a platform. Even if unknowingly. </p>

<p>If continue to post these videos to this subreddit something bad is going to happen. I never said we shouldn&#39;t expose or discuss. But putting these links everywhere gives it more views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By posting them here it gets the topic more exposure; yes, more people are going to see it, but that also means that more people can work on contacting their local authorities if needed (I didn&#39;t watch), or just investigate to find out WTF is going on. If we all see something horrible and never say anything about it for fear that someone else may be exposed then you could say goodbye to the news, discussions, trial by jury, pretty much everything and unfortunately we can&#39;t live in Bikini Bottom so we have to talk about what is wrong in the world to try to solve it, even if it is unpleasant. Also I see (frequently) people complaining about the topics posted in Conspiracy but they&#39;re conspiracies...upvote threads more to your liking and give them a chance to be at the top.</p>
