       I, OR OTHERS WHO POST SIMILAR IDEAS or questions about the formentioned, will be downvoted into distant memory or propelled into 15 minutes of fame, seemingly on a whim, or, in my most recent opinion, thrust upon a discedited or flimsy excuse, trivialized by an artificially inflated top comment  or chain of misdirection which almost always is a Subversion. In either case to be dumped into the sea of silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we (or I, or us, or you) do differently to catch the attention of the near half-million subscribers in this sub, or the attention of the near half-million shadow subs, so as to help them ALL realize we are one in the same and being blinded by small, temporary, seemingly big at the moment but competly trivial distracions? Certainly there are auto-up and auto-downs happening, but if we cannot get an actual discussion and/or debunking of things to add or remove to the list above, we have been reduced to the whims of keywords and auto actions of (people) accounts which are not even actually here.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO, my question is, which way does the wind blow and will we, the USERS of this sub, lean with or against the wind which wishes to scatter us into itself?

       Also consider that this list is not complete or incomplete but a compilation of things I strung together out of frustration and love for this community, in hopes of uniting  (and honestly dividing) this community into what my dad would often say... Those who live reality and those who are willing to accept the reality that they live in. Thanks for reading and good luck on your journey!

       This post is about the law of averages and the willingness of the real life people to speak up, out, or inward about these topics. We commonly discuss these 'common topics' which you have so eloquently pointed out in my obviously long list of common topics. I am trying to help the community break apart from amd rise above the pack which has taken us over and, discuss on a deeper level these and other issues. Does tha make me or my ideas wrong? There is NOTHING average about the list which I have presented, except your response to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a simple multi-part question for you, do you want to help, do you want to dissect, do you want to help advance this community and the discussions we should be having on a daily basis or do you want to solidify yourself as one who is only wiling to pass over the most obvious for that which makes you most comfortable?

       Please, speak up and out! We rely on each other and ourselves to pull out of this with clear minds and determination. I appreciate your encouragement but we need your input and expertise, broad or narrow as it may be, to bring to light that which others may not, cannot, or are not willing to accept. We truly need each other and the others, however they may feel, need us. A picture is worth a thousand words, but if a thousand, or ten thousand of us can paint a picture, how many words is that worth?

       Oh, I do. Even posted a link for the first time yesterday. But I have been for many months trying to infuse reason and skepticism with my comments, and too often had to defend the sub and even the mods. You can look at my history for fun. Thanks. I appreciate your post and believe it should be sticky for a few days...or at least part of it.

       You can't catch anyone's attention unless they are first willing to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are willing to look, then they probably already know much of what you speak of, or at least are willing to look if you are willing to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice is simply to do your best to educate individuals where you see an opportunity to do so. Reaching one person is far more effective than trying to break through a wall of lemmings.

       Very cute comment. -1. We are willing to view different possibilities. If you are unwilling to even consider the possibility of the powers that be collaberating on ways to increase and maintain those powers, then you're already balls deep in the "catnip". Enjoy the Bliss of ignorance. When your children are without essential freedoms, feel free to blame yourself and others like you. Open your eyes. Take a look for yourself. Form your truth intelligently based on what's going on around you and who benefits. Or continue to formulate one-line criticisms of those who are concerned with the state of things country. Have a nice day.

       Wow. You couldn't be anymore off base than that.  I thought it was rather a very intelligent observation that OP made.  Not all of us have the time to investigate.  Mr. Fkit,   I am part of the masses that are just trying to survive on this planet and you were incredibly quick to judge and verbally maime.   At least I  cared enough to read it but I'm not a kid in the basement of my parents home with time to spare.   Grow up and learn to laugh a little.  Life is too frickin short to be hateful and ignorant.  "Knowledge speaks. Wisdom listens."  Jimi Hendrix

       Not loving your neighbor as yourself creates the chain reaction we see today. (partially of course)

       Lefty reportin in, because im not so partisan to ignore what the hell happened in 2016
      </p>
      <p>
       The shill bombardment won't make the pizzagate or seth rich stuff go away, atleast for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been here since post-DNC nomination, im not a real member of this sub, more like CTR-cranked-up-to-11-on-r/politics put me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seen't things while Ive been here, but I have just one question
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the former president meet with james alefantis, a pizza parlour owner?
      </p>
      <p>
       The co-ordination that goes forth everyday to try and destroy this conspiracy is like nothing i've seen, anchors and pundits doing a pile on. (coming from someone who believes theres shill efforts to establish racism/anti-semitism as part of the conspiracy theorists mindset - That we're just a bunch of Nazis)
      </p>
      <p>
       Being against the wholesale destruction of middleast means your literally hitler, absolute insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just dont know what to believe anymore, perhaps assange before he went MIA when his net was cut, so pizzagate and seth rich
