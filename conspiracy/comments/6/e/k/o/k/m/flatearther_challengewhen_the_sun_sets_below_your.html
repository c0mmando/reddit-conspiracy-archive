Its effortless and empirical. You are a nice intelligent civil person, like i mentioned yesterday, and my intuition was correct looking thru your post history this morning. You are about the only FE Ive seen thats accualy asking for evidence either way and the rare individual who can say &quot;I dont know&quot; with confidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, if a person would do the experiment it is very simple and not threatening.  However I don&#39;t see how it proves anything besides the sun shining in different places at different times.

<p>Nope, it is physically impossible. The thing you seem to not understand is how perspective works.</p>

<p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdTkZ2pjVgQel0s/giphy.gif">A flat earth sun moving away from the observer</a></p>

<p>Here you can see what the flat earthers claim is happening. The red lines delimit the edge of an observer&#39;s field of view. Because the sun is moving away, it appears to get smaller and drop down in the field of view.</p>

<p>But if you watch closely you&#39;ll see that at not time can the sun actually touch the bottom edge of the field of view. It will be too small to see long before it touched the horizon. This is why the &quot;vanishing point&quot; is said to be at infinity. The sun will appear to get lower and lower without ever actually touching the horizon, until it simply disappears from view.</p>

<p>We can even calculate the distances involved.</p>

<p>At noon when the sun is directly overhead, it has an angular diameter or 0.5 degrees. The flat earthers say the sun is 3000 miles above the surface.</p>

<p>Using these two numbers we can calculate the angular diameter and angle above the horizon for the flat earth sun at various distances from the observer.</p>

<p>If the sun was over a spot on the flat earth 12,000 miles away, it would have an angular diameter of 0.121 degrees and be 14 degrees above the horizon.</p>

<p>That means if the flat earth sun was directly over the North Pole, and you were standing about 360 miles north of the South Pole, the sun would appear to be about 1/4 the size it is at noon, and would be over 115 times its own diameter above the horizon.</p>

<p>Sunset is a physical impossibility on the flat earth.</p>

<p>My point is, lots of things on the spherical model are physical impossibilities, but sometimes what seems impossible can actually be possible because of something we don&#39;t yet understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>No, it is not. You admitted that there is a physical explanation for why this happens, which by definition makes it not a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>Having said that, there is zero evidence of anything that should not be visible becoming visible due to zooming in. The flat earthers love to play a little trick using the zoom feature of cameras to make ships that are visible apparently &quot;disappear&quot; over the horizon.</p>

<p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btUXP1FCFjynf20/giphy.gif">But here is what they are actually doing.</a></p>

<p>The ship in this animation is rendered in front of the horizon. But by zooming out it appears to get smaller and smaller until it can no longer be depicted with the pixel resolution of the image. It does not go below the horizon, it simply &quot;vanishes&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of &quot;evidence&quot; the flat earthers use. Either they are too ignorant to understand what they are doing, or they are being intentionally deceptive.</p>

<p>You will never see a video where the camera is zoomed in on the ship so it can be clearly seen to drop below the horizon, then rise above the horizon again when the camera zooms in further.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Standing on a spinning ball and not falling off the bottom is also a physical impossibility</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, no it isn&#39;t. There is a simple physical explanation as to why that happens, as you admit. If something can be explained using physical laws, it is by definition not impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My point is, lots of things on the spherical model are physical impossibilities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And your point is utterly wrong. None of the things you mentioned are physical impossibilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdIZiMKjZdboHOE/giphy.gif">But here is one for the flat earth</a></p>

<p>If the sun was 12,000 miles away and 3,000 miles above the flat earth it would be clearly visible 14 degrees above the horizon and 1/4 the size it would be when directly overhead.</p>

<p>There is no physical explanation for the sunset given the flat earth explanation for where the sun is. That makes it a physical impossibility.</p>

<p>It can&#39;t simply disappear because it can not get far enough away from an observer on earth while still being visible overhead on another part of earth.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> physical explanation for what we observe is that the earth is <em>not</em> flat, but instead some sort of solid shape. They only solid shape that fits <em>all</em> our observations is a spheroid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, seems that there are different equations.  Which doesn&#39;t make sense, but whatever.  I used this:</p>

<p>Square root of 5776 = 76.  square root of 3264 = 57</p>

<p>76+57= 133</p>

<p>133 x 3.57= 474.81</p>

<p>The only way to make the majority of the distances on this page work is if you use the maximum diffraction of 8%.  Which doesn&#39;t make sense if at higher altitudes, the air is cooler and there is less diffraction.  You are not viewing the mountain in the distance through hot air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean refraction, like light passing through things like glass and water? Diffraction is something entirely different. Refraction occurs when light passes through media with different refractive indexes. For example, light passing through warm air and then cold air will be refracted, but light just passing through warm air won&#39;t.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re at the top of a mountain viewing the peak of another mountain far away just above the horizon, you are viewing that mountain through the cold air around you, the warm air near the Earth&#39;s surface on the horizon between, and then the cold air near the other mountain. It&#39;s absolutely plausible that refraction could occur under those conditions (in fact, that&#39;s what you link says about refraction).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;maximum [refraction] of 8%&quot; though. I assume 0% refraction means no refraction, but I have no idea what 100% refraction could mean, or what any percent would mean. Refraction isn&#39;t something you describe in percentages, but if you could justify your description I might be willing to use it.</p>

<p>p.s. this is the complete wrong thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>May I suggest to you, you may enjoy the hundred years of historical arguments and debates that occurred after Newtons Laws came out , how Newton and  the other christian scientists (they were almost all christian)  and theologians , how they viewed Newton Laws/universe  and Natural Sciences, how they resolved the conflicts and fit it within thier christian faith. I really enjoy the old science history and arguments  if only because the concepts are approachable and less abstract than modern science, and the christian theology I am very familiar with too so its easy for me to relate and understand the arguments and understanding the mindset.</p>

<p>In a way its not much different than reddit, except you have the greatest minds of the day whose 17th and 18th century  writing and communication skills are far superior than modernity</p>
