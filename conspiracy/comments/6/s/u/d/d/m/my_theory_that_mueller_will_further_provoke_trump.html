        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Mueller has nothing. They have been investigating this nonsense for over a year. Every so often they make a move so the headlines can portray it like the investigation is real and working towards exposing the Russians. </p>

<p>But it all is a false narrative from the start. Mueller&#39;s investigation is really a team dedicated to finding a way to pull off a coup and delegitimizing Trump.  </p>

<p>Since they have nothing the best case scenario would be for Mueller to systematically over step his bounds until he provokes Trump to interfere... Then they can say &quot;we were about to blow the Trump Russia thing wide open but Trump stopped us. This proves he is a Russian agent&quot;.</p>

<p>Since there is no evidence for a real trial then the trial by uninformed public opinion will have to do. </p>

<p>The Mueller investigation has nothing to do with financial crimes. Trump has not even been accused of financial crimes. </p>

<p>Mueller has one directive. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is not a word about financial crimes in Mueller&#39;s directive. Therefore you want to expand the investigation, but Mueller does not have that authority. This isn&#39;t a &quot;take Trump down&quot; investigation. The investigation has a single purpose.</p>

45&#39;s main concern over most of his life has been one thing: money. If there is proof (and I believe there is...whu else is he not willing to release tax documents, but also do pissed off at Mueller for this) it will show that Trump may have received quite a bit of money from the richest dictator in the world: Vladamir Putin.</p>
