I believe that there is something very wrong with this. I posted this as a reply in another post, but wanted to see others thought&#39;s on this idea I have.</p>

<p>We are supposed to accept people who are transgender because that is who they are. But at the same time they changed because they could not accept who they were!</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but we have laws for people that harm others, even, indirectly, and we have emotions that turn into social structures for things that harm society directly, which is why there&#39;s a stigma in most places around the world surrounding the various disorders (if you define order as a productive and sustainable society) which you now champion. I&#39;m not saying we should shame gay people because of how they were born, but maybe we shouldn&#39;t allow various forms of societal neutering to be made fashionable by the MSM at large.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there really are only a few trans people. Just like black people only make up 10% of the population, yet when you search for any generic term like &quot;family&quot;, or &quot;doctor&quot;, or &quot;inventor&quot;, all you get are results with black people.

<p>The fuck?  Where are you doing these searches.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a small percentage of people whose brains do not align in the usual way with their genitalia.  Being polite to those people (such as using their preferred pronouns, the comment I originally replied to) and respecting their ability to participate in society despite the particulars of their birth should not be some huge ask of a moral person.  That people like you feel compelled to &quot;well actually&quot; and go to great lengths to defend people&#39;s inalienable right to be assholes to transpeople without consequence is something that&#39;s hard to wrap my head around.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve got your reasons, but a hatred of transpeople is far and away the most coherent and rational explanation for why someone would protect such vitriol.</p>

<p>As scientific knowledge advances, language should reflect that.  It doesn&#39;t, or it least it shouldn&#39;t, stop the nation for people to acknowledge the physical reality of people&#39;s bodies.  If we are to &quot;attempt to make things easier for everyone,&quot; as you say, we should allow people to get treatment for medical conditions, and not force them to pretend they&#39;ve never gotten such treatment.</p>

<p>But it does. It&#39;s people not meekly saying &quot;I would most humbly appreciate you using my name, sir.

It&#39;s small, and petty, and forced, and damaging to the fabric of society, which seems like an alien concept in today&#39;s world. &quot;The fabric of society&quot;... lol We&#39;re all so selfish, now.

<p>I would say something is fundamentally wrong about forcing 7 and 8 year olds to comply with arbitrary bullshit gender norms. What advantage is there to forcing your son to have short hair? What advantage is there to forcing your daughter to play with dolls? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you are a religious dogma believer it could make you feel more comfortable that you are doing what you can to influence the choice of homosexuality or heterosexuality.</p>

<p>Dogma is to blame for the belief that homosexuality is a choice. If you believe God said its wrong, either its a choice or God is draconian and unfair. Who would want to worship or even follow such a being? This is how religious people come to believe homosexuality is a choice, this unacknowledged logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. What is the biological basis for being trans? There is no gene or biological developmental moment that has been determined to flip the switch so to speak. Gender incongruence seems to be still very much a social/mental phenomena and not one stemming from a biological reality. Sexual dimorphism is pretty hard wired into our species and into mammals generally. </p>

<p>Can you point to any other analogues of trans like behavior in the animal kingdom that isn&#39;t due to things like environmental pollution or changing environmental conditions? No, because being trans relies on the existence of human social reality, and therefore, more and likely, has no biological basis. If it has no biological basis, then it is exclusively comes from the mind and the mental conception a person has of themselves. Right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 5 years of watching him go from highs to lows as these &quot;experts&quot; you quote played guessing games (multiple suicide attempts) he is fine. Actually just graduated college very proud of him. Definitions change all the time bud. Other posters noted that it was considered a mental illness in the past then you went off on your millennial-esque rant about cell phones. Nice whataboutism. So what do you think the chances are that they changed it to save face? Im curious if thats something the psychiatric association could get sued for... Not respecting &quot;feelings&quot; on a sexual issue. Hmm. Then theres the whole new age bullshit belief of &quot;nix masculinity&quot; when they completely ignore the negatives of the sacred feminine and positives of the sacred masculine. Seems like you have have gotten lost on reddit. This is r/conspiracy dude. People base their opinions on a lot more than the mainstream view of an association started by nazis during mk ultra. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believing people are insane is not the same as hating them.  I personally believe that both transgenders and religious people are (in the clinical sense) insane:  they show demonstrable psychoses because the things they believe are not compatible with the reality of how things actually <em>are</em>.  </p>

<p>Transgenderism seems like a fairly harmless psychosis to me, but it is psychosis. I don&#39;t hate transgenders, or even have a problem with them, except that their issues keep getting shoved in my face, which is fucking annoying.  My number one issue is that I don&#39;t want gender reassignment / hormone therapies to be covered under socialized medicine.  If they want to get sex changes that&#39;s fine, just don&#39;t ask me to pay for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at Islam for instance. Without its rigid rules some tribes from the desert could have never ever co-operated and built a large civilisation because their environment wouldn&#39;t have supported a mutual cooperation.</p>

<p>Our western civilisation is directly related to the catholic church and later protestant churches. Architecture, art and even science despite all the dogmatic nonsense was deeply influenced by the religious structure. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also common when any other network fails that&#39;s what people fall back to and re-organize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I think is problematic about trans-ideology is that trans-people demand that non-trans people accept trans- reality as the only acceptable version of reality.</p>

<p>There are plenty of neckbeard looking types who claim they are women on the inside and want the rest of the world to call and treat them as women, when they are obviously men. Your mental reality is not physical reality, and the onus is not on non-trans- people to recognize or support your conception of reality.</p>

<p>Trans- ideology is a lot like religion in that regard. </p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll call this hate speech, but how does it qualify as hate? If some 40 year old man starts claiming that they are a woman (or even a little girl) on the inside, I&#39;m not going to call them she. I&#39;m probably not going to call them by whatever feminine name they choose for themselves. Because, frankly, I don&#39;t have too. </p>

<p>Also, I support the concept of women only spaces (like domestic violence shelters), and trans-women are not women and should not be welcomed as such. Womanhood is first and foremost a biological reality. Trans-women will never have ovaries or uteruses, nor will they ever ovulate or menstruate or go through menopause. The bleeding caused by dilation is not menstruation, it is the opening of a surgical wound to keep it from closing up. It is not a process that is due to biological sex.</p>

<p>While gender may be a social construction in many ways, there is also that biological reality of sex, which is chromosomal and genetic, as well as developmentally determined. And as much as trans-women try and demand that the rest of the world accept them as women, it just isn&#39;t so, and never will be (at least in my lifetime). </p>

<p>Be who or whatever you think you are, I don&#39;t care. But you shouldn&#39;t expect the world to accept you for it or ever consider it normal. And you definitely shouldn&#39;t expect your chosen gender should give you any privileges or protections that people born with the sex basis of said gender receive. Not like women have that many privileges in this patriarchal society. </p>

<p>Like I said you are free to be who you think you are, and I&#39;m free to disregard it however I choose, so long as I don&#39;t discriminate against on that basis. Having women only spaces that are trans exclusive is not discrimination in my book. And I think, eventually, the courts will agree with that assessment. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I think there are different layers of this and different problems associated. For example, demanding to be called &quot;xe&quot; or other manufactured pronouns is bad, because you&#39;re making a demand on another person when there&#39;s no reason that they could have known. However, on the flipside, if a person sees a trans woman who is clearly presenting as a woman and who clearly wants to be called &quot;she&quot;, going out of your way to call her &quot;he&quot; instead is just being a hateful asshole. And by the same regard, if you&#39;re unsure of what a person might prefer, particularly with non-binary people, &quot;they&quot; has been used as a singular pronoun for literally hundreds of years. </p>

<p>The thing is if a person is named &quot;John&quot; at birth and later decides that they want to be called &quot;Jack&quot;, a decent person actually calls them &quot;Jack&quot;. An asshole would say &quot;You were &#39;John&#39; when you were born, and even though I know you don&#39;t like it, I&#39;m going to go out of my way to constantly remind you of that.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well let&#39;s look at the facts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The official reclassification as gender dysphoria in the DSM-5 may help resolve some of these issues, because the term gender dysphoria applies only to the discontent experienced by some persons resulting from gender identity issues.</p>

<p>The American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the DSM-5, states that <strong>&quot;gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the American Psychiatric Association, the critical element is not the gender nonconformity in itself, but it&#39;s manifestation in an individual&#39;s life.</p>

<p>Now what would be considered &quot;significant distress&quot;? Surely an increased in suicide rates would fit the bill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adults with GID are at increased risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem and suicide. Studies indicate that transgender people have an extremely high rate of suicide attempts; one study of 6,450 transgender people in the United States found 41% had attempted suicide, compared to a national average of 1.6%. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are there any other common mental disorders associated with gender nonconformity?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transgender people are also at heightened risk for certain mental disorders such as eating disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard gender referred to as being a spectrum, or non-binary? This is literally true, at the biological level. There are genitals ranging from completely formed vaginas, to combinations (intersex), to completely formed penises. This happens in animals as well. Our anatomy and our sex hormone levels affect everything we do- how we feel about ourselves, who we&#39;re attracted to, everything.</p>

<p>So when parents and doctors deliver a baby and look at the genitals, they are sticking that kid in a certain box based on very limited information. &quot;You have a penis, you must be a boy who likes trucks and the color blue!&quot;.</p>

<p>The &quot;traditional&quot; values in our society are really what damages kids. They promote bullying of boys who are sissies and girls who are butch. They advocate for division and willful ignorance. I&#39;d be willing to bet that if our society was just kind to everybody and ignored gender roles, there would be many fewer people who felt the need to have gender re-assignment surgery or attempt suicide. So of course the friends of these people want to protect them from bullying and cruelty (assuming they&#39;re not bullies themselves), and that&#39;s where this movement comes from.</p>

<p>TL;DR What you&#39;re calling the trans agenda is just a reaction to a society that inserts itself into everyone&#39;s sex lives in hurtful ways. Just be nice to everyone, and don&#39;t worry about what gender they want to be.</p>

<p>Because of sentiments like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are supposed to accept people who are transgender because that is who they are. But at the same time they changed because they could not accept who they were!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parents telling their kids that the binary gender roles are correct, causes kids to bully gender outliers. But the binary gender roles are not correct, because people have all different combinations of genitals and hormone levels. It&#39;s a spectrum.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they changed because they could not accept who they were!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They changed because society (including you) tells them that their assigned gender is real and important. They struggle inside with the knowledge that you&#39;re wrong, so they change. Then you post making the implication that they&#39;re hypocrites so you don&#39;t need to be kind to them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are supposed to accept people who are transgender</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Transgender people will stop having an &quot;agenda&quot; as soon as society (you) stops seeing them as being different from anyone else. Stop having an opinion on them, and the problem disappears.</p>

<p>You&#39;re missing the point. <em>Assigning</em> certain traits to certain genders is what <em>causes</em> trans people distress in the first place.

<p>That&#39;s reversed gender roles. I&#39;m trying to help you imagine <em>no</em> gender roles. Just individuals, choosing for themselves what facets of life are best for them. Not society choosing a set of options that don&#39;t fit them (or any individual, really).</p>

<p>We forget how bathed all our interactions are in the concept of gender. We don&#39;t own our genders, we are owned by our genders (having specific pronouns, cultural traditions). There is no reason our language needs gendered pronouns at all. So why have we had them for so many years? We didn&#39;t vote on it, that&#39;s just how it&#39;s been done. And we all know, the real reason was because women were being traded as chattel slaves between fathers and husbands. For a long time. That&#39;s not a noble tradition to uphold.</p>

I do not remember the name of the specific video or I would link that too. There was another one I recall that flashed young girls (maybe 9-11yr old non nude) During a segment that talked about how great it was to be a woman. I want to do more research on this an the creators of the videos, but at the same time i do not wish that kind of stuff to be associated with my computer. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a social issue. It causes psychological trauma in the individual through social pressure. If society weren&#39;t hateful toward people who express gender outside of the strictly defined binary, trans people wouldn&#39;t really have issues. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If transgenderism is a condition is the best treatment to get invasive surgery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not all trans people experience body dysmorphia, and surgery isn&#39;t even necessary for all trans people who do. The best treatment would be changing society to not be hateful toward people for no good reason, but body modification can have a positive effect for people who experience trauma over their body feeling &quot;wrong&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forcing people to use obscure pronouns based on your perceived association is ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this. Gendered pronouns themselves are fucked and the solution to that problem isn&#39;t to add even more fucked gendered pronouns. How the fuck am I supposed to know what manufactured pronoun you want to be called? Singular &quot;they&quot; is a good counter to this, since we already have a gender neutral pronoun that&#39;s been in use for hundreds of years. </p>

Encouraging people to do as they please is not a bad thing, so long as them doing so does not hinder anyone else&#39;s human rights. And them being trans does nothing to you. Individual liberty is an agenda that we all should be in favor of. You shouldn&#39;t care if that person wants to wear a dress or if that person wants to cut their hair short. If someone has body dysmorphia, as some trans people do, they should be free to modify their body how they see fit. You don&#39;t go up to someone with a lot of ugly tatoos and say &quot;you can&#39;t do that to your body&quot;, do you? No, because it&#39;s their body and they can do whatever they want to it. </p>

But it is definitely not something to encourage as it has been in children in this last year. It&#39;s just child abuse to my eyes. I&#39;ve had personal dealings with a few trans people in the past. Some acknowledged there mental disorder others did not. Some were completely normal minus the dresses, some were insane. My example; I will never forget the girl who went off on me for saying excuse me miss in a bar. Apparently this woman who was dressed like a girl going to a punk show in a short skirt and tiny blue top was supposedly a boy though still dressed like a girl and was into men. The &quot;miss.&quot; set her and her friends off and I pretty much b-lined out of that situation before it got any weirder or messier. I had almost thought it was just a big joke at first but I could see the seriousness in there eyes. I still to this day can&#39;t believe how ridiculous the whole situation was. Honestly if he/she hadn&#39;t started going off on me I may have even bought her a drink. Guess I was saved on that one lol.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We are supposed to accept people who are transgender because that is who they are. But at the same time they changed because they could not accept who they were!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You make a good point. The huge influx of trans people started with the Millennial generation, a generation full of anxiety, depression, and a significant lack of confidence. They think if they change their outward appearance, they will change their feelings about life. This is not true, and more and more trans people are regretting their choice. &lt;<a href="http://www.sexchangeregret.com%3E">http://www.sexchangeregret.com&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>Changing one&#39;s outward appearance does not get rid of one&#39;s own demons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s go with social as you say. Most species on this planet are social. But for any of those species to thrive and continue they have to have order within the society. An to do that makes an females have roles they have to fulfill. When males act like females and vis versa the society falls. Look in to the mouse experiment.</p>
