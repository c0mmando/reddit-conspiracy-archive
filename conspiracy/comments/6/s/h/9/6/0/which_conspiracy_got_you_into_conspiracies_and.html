<p>For me it was the JFK assassination. I am only 25 but about 5 years ago it interested me and decided to read up and it just, well I&#39;m sure you are all familiar with the story. </p>

<p>This made me think, well they lied about this... So...... Hmm. Then of course after that I had a look into 9/11 I was what... 9? I missed it at the time and that was the extra massive unneeded nail in the coffin. Today I feel so informed but yet so belittled by what I don&#39;t and what I will never know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you like could comprehend at the time how much bullshit they were spewing. It really doesn&#39;t make sense, plus I heard about they tried to re-enact it with simulators with experts and such but couldn&#39;t. There&#39;s so much about 9/11 it would be a staggering task to go through it all. As I said I was 9 I remember watching it on the TV I think I was at school?</p>

<p>Also the aftermath makes little sense (unless you know the inside baseball and the goals etc)</p>

After they said it was al Qaeda and they were declaring war on terrorism, I remembered thinking that was convenient especially since Bush just spent a crap-ton upgrading the military.

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am serious. When I first heard that there were people who actually believed that we lived on a Flat Earth I said &quot;No way! You have got to be kidding me?!? People will do anything for attention! Fuck that shit!!&quot; Then, one day out of curiosity, I watched a video on The Flat Earth Theory, and I have been fucked up ever since! Listen. For those of you who do not know what the Flat Earth Theory is, and you do not want to end up crazier than you already are, DO NOT WATCH ANY VIDEOS ON THE FLAT EARTH THEORY!!!

    <div class="md"><p>See I had a similar attitude and I watched a bunch of documentaries that support the theory. I still think it&#39;s silly and impossible. I mean, I guess it&#39;s possible I can&#39;t say for 100% but nor can you. Unless we go to space.</p>

<p>Fair play to you but I can&#39;t see it man. There are provable experiments that show the earth is roundish. I mean if the earth was flat couldn&#39;t I in theory get the Hubble and look all the way to the other end? </p>

<p>Fuck I don&#39;t think I wanna get into this now man it&#39;s late aha! Also I can&#39;t like fathom why it would even be conceivable to anyone even after all the &quot;evidence&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t rip me apart here guys.. But aliens did it for me.   </p>

<p>Why that of all things???  </p>

<p>Because no matter what major conspiracy you dig into.. It always leads back to aliens.  </p>

<p>Michelle obama is a man? Barry tailored to be potus from birth, forced to marry mr. Michelle who is his handler, who is controlled by the illuminati, who serveto do the on planet bidding of off world puppetiers..  </p>

<p>JFK? Shot because he was going to reveal illuminati plans.. See above..  </p>

<p>False flags and 9/11? Put in place to divide and conquer the world to keep us as sheep.. Controlled by the illuminati and see above.  </p>

<p>Why have we not had formal contact with aliens? Because they dont want us to know they are there. Because they control our world and all of us.  </p>

<p>We would expect help and relief, technology and infinite energy.  </p>

<p>It is not in the interest of the biggest fish in the pond to teach and allow the little fish to get big themselves.  </p>

<p>Dont want to believe it? Find youre favorite conspiracy theory, dig and dig and dig until it leads to aliens.. Its the same with everything.  </p>

<p>Once you go down the alien rabbit hole, you cant climb back out.. Conspiracy theory in general is just hanging one foot over the edge until you get to the aliens....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with some of this. However I would not say that EVERYTHING leads back to aliens. And even if it does the pawns here prolly wouldn&#39;t even know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when i say &quot;everything&quot; - what i really meant was &quot;main/big&quot; conspiracy theories.. Not things that would be very fringe such as flat earth (no offence to believers).. Or berestein bears kind of thing. I mean like the zionist regime, 9/11, chemtrails,  big stuff..  </p>

<p>To be honest, the exact reason for why they would be puppeteers is foggy at best. In all my research and reading over the past 7 odd years, bo clear answer has come up - only that there are 100 plausable reasons to control us, and most are not pleasent.  </p>

<p>What i know is that from being a non-thinker/non-believer 7 years ago - to today, i can say with 100% confidence that i truly believe aliens are real, they interact with our elite and shadow governments - and that the aliens themselves, as well as our elite enslavers are doing their very hardest to keep it a secret, and to discredit believers.  </p>

<p>Ive always been a fan of following breadcrumbs.. And most of the time the trail leads back to some form of alien intervention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read &#39;Behold a Pale Horse&#39; and turned a few of my buddies onto it back in the early to mid 90&#39;s. We were deeply involved in the underground dance scene in those days and would unload esoteric diatribes onto open minded, or particularly intoxicated unsuspecting ravers. Our knowledge base grew as we began to follow the printed works of burgeoning &#39;conspiracy&#39; researchers... Sitchin, Icke, Cathy O&#39;Brien, Jim Marrs, et al. Our interest in those days was kind hearted, snarky and somewhat tongue in cheek... perhaps just an added mysterious theme or aesthetic for the types of parties we curated- which we sometimes held at rented masonic temples and other off beat locations. 
Then 9/11 happened, and my perspective of the world changed completely. It was the experience of having all this trivial knowledge of what I considered off the wall ideas suddenly coalescing into not only a reasonable worldview, but the only one that seemed congruent with objective reality. </p>
