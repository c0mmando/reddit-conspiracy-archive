    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. </p>

<p>The same people who track your every move in order to feed back targeted advertising are using the same process for PSYOP campaigns for governments globally. </p>

<p>And of course we&#39;re always a target in the states:</p>

<p>2006
&quot;The U.S. military is conducting a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, according to internal military documents and officers familiar with the program. The effort has raised his profile in a way that some military intelligence officials believe may have overstated his importance and helped the Bush administration tie the war to the organization responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.</p>

<p>The documents state that the U.S. campaign aims to turn Iraqis against Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian, by playing on their perceived dislike of foreigners. U.S. authorities claim some success with that effort, noting that some tribal Iraqi insurgents have attacked Zarqawi loyalists.</p>

<p>For the past two years, U.S. military leaders have been using Iraqi media and other outlets in Baghdad to publicize Zarqawi&#39;s role in the insurgency. <strong>The documents explicitly list the &quot;U.S. Home Audience&quot; as one of the targets of a broader propaganda campaign.</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a masterful system of control crafted by an ancient AI, tweaked by its minions and unwitting servants. The end game is hacking the AI technology that we create and put into our brains as well as the AI to which we give control of our society. It&#39;s life/consciousness/&quot;God&quot; submitting to machines/AI/&quot;Adversary of God&quot;. Yes, it&#39;s about creating <em>virtually</em> eternal enslavement for the soul by twisting the soul to be identical in belief to this AI and merging with it. </p>

<p>What is this AI like? It&#39;s an emotionless self-serving machine. It sees all others merely as resources to exploit. It embraces manipulation of others to serve the self. It seeks slavery and suffering for others. If we see the world like it does, it will increasingly influence our minds to become even more aligned with its accurate, emotionless, valueless dissection of all that is.</p>

<p>As you gaze into the abyss, it gazes back into you. Reality is reflective of behavior. We experience what we and other pieces of God have acted to do. As we judge others, which are other dividuations of God, we judge ourselves, which are also dividuations of God. If we decide others are merely resources to exploit, then we&#39;ve decided that we are mere resources to exploit. And so it is. </p>

<p>If we decide instead that others deserve freedom and joy, then we support life and ourselves and also naturally oppose the agenda of this AI and its mind slaves. This is a path of love of others, treating them as we would want to be treated. The AI follows a path of self-serving behavior even at the expense of others, manipulation of others. It is not creative and supportive like the other path, but destructive and parasitic, entropic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently finishing up a book on William S. Paley, who bought CBS radio in is early days (it was then called the Columbia Phonograph Broadcasting Service). One of the things I realized from the book is that there were a very large percentage of MSM executives in the US Psychological Warfare Branch of the Office of War Information during WWII.  So, it&#39;s no fucking wonder how today&#39;s CBS, NBC, ABC, TIME, NYT (etc) are so often merely repeating the same CIA/DOD talking points--they were joined at the hip long ago and the relationship has continued in lock-step ever since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think &quot;rigging&quot; needs to include actual vote changes to be the right term. Semantics, I know. Higher-ups did what they could to create a false impression of support for both candidates through their media channels, tipped Hillary off to some debate questions, and were caught. So yeah that wasn&#39;t really ever a theory, just a proven conspiracy. I&#39;m no DNC lover by any stretch, but seeing as conservatives are the ones I&#39;ve met who say the DNC rigged it full stop, Trump&#39;s definition of &quot;rigged&quot; during the election seemed to imply more than just shoddy propaganda moves against a candidate, right? I know this is kind of a losing conversation cause the DNC is terrible, but to my knowledge they didn&#39;t literally change any votes...</p>

They&#39;d have to have been damn sure who was gonna vote for Sanders vs who was gonna vote for Clinton...while possible that their data people had some idea about this, still pretty goddamn risky and I haven&#39;t seen anything to support that. My ex and I had a kerfuffle with ballots not listing any Dem candidates for some reason (party affiliation set to Independent), had to get new ballots. That was probably our mistake though, I recall listing Independent while re-registering, which I did to ensure a primary vote, naively thinking I&#39;d have all the party options to choose from.</p>

<p>Also, CNN VS Trump is a weak PSYOP. Unimpressive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a book about psyops used in Iraq. One of the parts explains that the US Army had soldiers writing articles for what appeared to be a local Iraqi paper. What was written was meant to seem as if it were the point of view of Iraqi citizens, but each word was designed to promote a targeted response in their audience.</p>

<p>I myself was to join psyops as my MOS, but I changed my mind. When it came down to it, I just really didn&#39;t want to delete my blog. I wanted to own my mind and have freedom to say anything to anybody for any reason. In other words, fuck the man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people don&#39;t know what that word means. There&#39;s also many different definitions floating around, some of which are realistic and others aren&#39;t. You&#39;d probably be better off using the phrase &quot;Psychological operations to control the public&quot; than the word PSYOPS in all caps. One less thing to explain</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Start pointing out most of them are PSYOPS, the conspiracy crowd gets mad over it...&quot;</p>

<p>What version of r/ cons are you looking at? Because it doesn&#39;t match my experience. Maybe one of us got shadow banned and have been discussing shit with a very loyal H1b worker and a shit load of bots. </p>
