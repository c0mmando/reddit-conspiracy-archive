       These are both in the US and the moon's shadow from this past August eclipse went from West to East. This one 7 years later will be going East to West, making an X somewhere around Missouri, I believe.

       I predict, that every single time an eclipse comes around, somebody will whip out some verses from Revelations, and preach about the apocalypse.

       I know I'm really going out on a limb here, but I'm gonna go with my instincts on this one.

       Gonna need some links or more details, I have no idea what you're talking about regarding September 23rd. I'm not sure what the significance of the eclipse being 7 years apart either, there's a solar eclipse like every 18 months or so

       Oh boy, lets get into this a bit. IMHO, People are seeing what they want to see with this. This isn't directed at you personally, but the information in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sun spends a month in each Zodiac, not a huge deal for the sun to be in Virgo, Moon is at the feet of Virgo once or twice a month. So, every single September-October, the Sun will be in Virgo with the Moon at her feet at least once or twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets add Jupiter. Jupiter takes about 12 years to orbit the Sun, so it spends about a year in each sign. So, every 12 years in September-October, the Sun will be in Virgo with the Moon at her feet and Jupiter in the womb for 9ish months. This happened in 2005, where was this prophecy then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Leo doesn't have 9 stars? Leo has like 15 stars in it. And even so, why would 3 planets be added? If you're going to add 3 planets, shouldn't  you add every visible star in the area? It's more than 12 regardless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if this is supposed to be a prophetic sign, none of us are going to be able to see it. Good luck seeing Virgo with the Sun out lol

       This is actually more of a case of people seeing what they don't want to believe and desperately trying to debunk it, regardless of the proof/evidence of it happening. Leo officially has 9 stars. Look up any picture of the constellation on Google images and you'll have trouble finding the Lion drawn with 15 stars. But now we're just going to say that it has 15 because we need this sign to be debunked, I guess.
      </p>

       Planets have been referred to as 'wandering
       <em>
        stars
       </em>
       ' for a very long time now. So it makes sense to include them in the crown that Virgo will have over her head in September. I mean the planets are even aligned perfectly straight. The sign didn't happen in 2005 and it has never happened as far as we know. I'd love to see some pictures or something so I can tell you how it didn't match the prophecy. Virgo has had the moon at her feet, she's even been clothed with the sun at the same time. But Virgo has never had those 2 things happen
       <em>
        while also
       </em>
       crowned with 12 stars and 'pregnant' with Jupiter for 9 months. Just because we can't physically see it because the sun will be out doesn't mean it won't happen, luckily we have software like Stellarium to check what it will look like and when it will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try and prove me wrong, I'll be happy to check Stellarium and confirm/debunk whatever you throw my way, I've done it before and I'll do it again until you guys realize this isn't a joke, this is happening.

       He may well have walked the earth and been a great prophet - maybe the greatest - but his teachings and legacy have been hijacked and bastardised by the Catholic church. Have a read of the gospel of Mary which is part of the Apocrypha which are the books left out of the bible. In other words the good ones

       All the world is a stage by luciferians and elite psychopaths. They are probably some sick 911ish ritual false flag as the black sun crosses ours. All this foreshadowing "aliens" invasion in MSM may mean some fake invasion too.

       I know lots of people think this indicates the Tribulation and the Second Coming of Jesus, but I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think the Bible is not meant to be taken literally. I think it is all about astrology and "Finding God" in ourselves. So many Bible verses say that our body is the Temple of God. I think it means we need to activate our pineal gland to "know the truth" (which I have not done).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think the book of Revelations is about astrology and how we are now transitioning into The Age of Aquarius. I believe this is a good thing too. It means TPTB that were in control during The Age of Pisces will not be in charge for this age. This is an Age of Awakening!

       The stars and planets are not aligning according to Revelation 12. This was debunked a lot.

       This is right up there with, on May 5th the Moon will be closer to the Earth than any time before, in 10- bazillion years.

       Never been debunked. People have tried and failed miserably. But whatever makes you sleep at night.
