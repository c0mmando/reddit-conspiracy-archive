<p>Just for the record, I don&#39;t think it means the end of the world or the 2nd coming of Jesus. But lots of people seem to believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, lets get into this a bit. IMHO, People are seeing what they want to see with this. This isn&#39;t directed at you personally, but the information in the video.</p>

<p>Sun spends a month in each Zodiac, not a huge deal for the sun to be in Virgo, Moon is at the feet of Virgo once or twice a month. So, every single September-October, the Sun will be in Virgo with the Moon at her feet at least once or twice.</p>

<p>Lets add Jupiter. Jupiter takes about 12 years to orbit the Sun, so it spends about a year in each sign. So, every 12 years in September-October, the Sun will be in Virgo with the Moon at her feet and Jupiter in the womb for 9ish months. This happened in 2005, where was this prophecy then?</p>

<p>Also, Leo doesn&#39;t have 9 stars? Leo has like 15 stars in it. And even so, why would 3 planets be added? If you&#39;re going to add 3 planets, shouldn&#39;t  you add every visible star in the area? It&#39;s more than 12 regardless.</p>

<p>Also, if this is supposed to be a prophetic sign, none of us are going to be able to see it. Good luck seeing Virgo with the Sun out lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually more of a case of people seeing what they don&#39;t want to believe and desperately trying to debunk it, regardless of the proof/evidence of it happening. Leo officially has 9 stars. Look up any picture of the constellation on Google images and you&#39;ll have trouble finding the Lion drawn with 15 stars. But now we&#39;re just going to say that it has 15 because we need this sign to be debunked, I guess.</p>

<p>Planets have been referred to as &#39;wandering <em>stars</em>&#39; for a very long time now. So it makes sense to include them in the crown that Virgo will have over her head in September. I mean the planets are even aligned perfectly straight. The sign didn&#39;t happen in 2005 and it has never happened as far as we know. I&#39;d love to see some pictures or something so I can tell you how it didn&#39;t match the prophecy. Virgo has had the moon at her feet, she&#39;s even been clothed with the sun at the same time. But Virgo has never had those 2 things happen <em>while also</em> crowned with 12 stars and &#39;pregnant&#39; with Jupiter for 9 months. Just because we can&#39;t physically see it because the sun will be out doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t happen, luckily we have software like Stellarium to check what it will look like and when it will happen.</p>

<p>Try and prove me wrong, I&#39;ll be happy to check Stellarium and confirm/debunk whatever you throw my way, I&#39;ve done it before and I&#39;ll do it again until you guys realize this isn&#39;t a joke, this is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know lots of people think this indicates the Tribulation and the Second Coming of Jesus, but I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I honestly think the Bible is not meant to be taken literally. I think it is all about astrology and &quot;Finding God&quot; in ourselves. So many Bible verses say that our body is the Temple of God. I think it means we need to activate our pineal gland to &quot;know the truth&quot; (which I have not done).</p>

<p>I just think the book of Revelations is about astrology and how we are now transitioning into The Age of Aquarius. I believe this is a good thing too. It means TPTB that were in control during The Age of Pisces will not be in charge for this age. This is an Age of Awakening!</p>
