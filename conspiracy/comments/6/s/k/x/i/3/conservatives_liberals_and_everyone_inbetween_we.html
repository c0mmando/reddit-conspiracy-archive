       Its hard to know what North Korea is actually like outside of the propaganda. Defectors stories from North Korea have again and again been proven to be falsified in many ways (

      <p>
       North Korea is not a paradise and the Kim regime has committed flagrant abuses of human rights, but we have zero moral high ground to claim here, and invading the country or bombing them into submission would only cement the US as an evil imperialist power, as history seems to show as well. In demonizing North Korea while refusing to look at the abuses committed by your own country, you are proving yourself to be heavily indoctrinated by actual US propaganda, which hopes that you don't look any deeper than the latest CNN feed.

       Apologies on the American accusation! I'm American myself and I get tired of the controlling influence of nationalism that I see in this country

      <p>
       My point is just that even if those stories are true, NK has done less harm to the world than the US empire has over the past 50 years. The Korean problem shouldn't be solved with war or intimidation, which is what US politicians have been pushing for years.

       I'm pretty sure Russia and China would not appreciate the potential fallout from such an ordeal. And I would care. Diplomacy and sanctions have done a fine job for the last 30 years. We don't need a global conflict because I guarantee you, that if we use nuclear weapons, that's what will happen.

       You're right. I thought it was. But then again that was two presidents ago. I'm sure the program has been updated. In the past we have always treated nuclear nations with respect. But maybe not this time. I just looked it up. They've been nuclear since 2006. And still no respect. They're just trying to get attention. But when we just keep ignoring them at some point they'll act. I just hope that they don't end up acting like Japan did.

       We also must not forget that this North Korean crisis would not be what it is without Obama+Clinton's decision to remove Gaddafi in Libya.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2002, Gaddafi set an example by surrendering all his weapons of mass destruction, becoming the hero for a day in America's eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       By invading Libya in 2011 under "humanitarian pretenses" and then removing Gaddafi, America made a very symbolic statement that there is no protection nor inherent right to sovereignty to those who comply by giving up their WMD's. Instead, the countries that comply are now vulnerable to the full force of the Western military and they will be defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any surprise North Korea isn't going to give up their nuclear intentions? Is there any reason to believe that they will be left alone if they comply to the world's wishes?

       I don't think that you can say the same about Russia's involvement to Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons in 1994. Russia was also promised that NATO would not expand eastwards around that same time. Over time, NATO broke that promise and converted all ex-Warsaw Pact countries to their Cold War-era military alliance, eventually knocking on Ukraine's door around 2012-2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came the Western-backed coup of 2014, which was clearly instigated by Western intelligence and friendly Ukrainian Neo-Nazi groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is also dealing with being on the other side of the greatest military buildup since World War Two along Russia's western border. The West has also built an anti-missile shield in Romania AND installed missiles in all of these new Eastern European NATO countries. Why provoke Russia like this? What is to be gained?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no cheerleader of Putin, but it is clear who the aggressors in Eastern Europe are right now.

       Highly debatable, and NATO not expanding eastwards was never part of any official agreement. You are referring to remarks made by several politicians that expressed that NATO wouldn't expand eastward, but there was never any official document that stated those terms

       Yes, there was no official document, but these were promises made by the US President at the time (George Bush Sr.) and his representative. Hardly just another politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       The promise was that East Germany would be allowed to have special NATO privileges, and that would be it. Central and Eastern Europe would be demilitarized in order to provide a bridge from East to West.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it. America bested the Soviet Union. Nothing was on paper and the US took advantage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point remains that by starting the new chapter of Russo-American relations with this sort of deception, America ensured that the relationship would remain tense as all hell unless Russia bent the knee. Yeltsin did at the expense of the Russian people's livelihood. Putin didn't.

       Thus, during the press conference following the February 24–25 Camp David meetings, Bush declared in general terms that “the former territory of [East Germany] should have a special military status, that it would take into account the legitimate security interests of all interested countries, including those of the Soviet Union.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor did a telephone conversation between Bush and Gorbachev on February 28 help clarify the issue. During the call, Bush told Gorbachev that “the united Germany should remain in NATO; that American troops will remain in Europe as long as the Europeans want them; and that there needs to be a special status for the former territory of the GDR.” Further, the president pledged that the United States would recognize the “legitimate security interests” of all parties. Notably, in highlighting limits to NATO’s future role in Germany and recognizing the need to acknowledge Soviet “security interests,” Bush was echoing comments by Baker and Gates during their February 9 talks with the Soviet leadership. Combined, the new terms could be interpreted as explaining how NATO would avoid expanding eastward if Germany reunited within

       Yes I have read that, Bakers explanation for what he meant is unconvincing and I do think he meant that the US wouldn't expand eastward. However he didn't have anywhere near the authority to guarantee that, and I think it's clear that Bush never said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall I think it is pretty scummy by both Baker and Genscher, but I'm not overly sympathetic towards the Russians in this situation since I don't think it comes close to meeting the requirements of an "agreement"

       That's fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, even if we remove American deception with regards to NATO expansion from the Russo-American discussion, we are still left with American provocation, manipulation of information and aggression. What is the purpose in encircling post-1991 Russia with NATO besides provocation and aggression? What is the purpose of placing missiles in all of these countries? The US are playing war games that can easily result in a nuclear standoff.

      <p>
       Robert Gates, CIA director in 1991, has written in his memoir Duty that with the collapse of the U.S.S.R., Cheney “wanted to see the dismantlement not only of the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire but of Russia itself.” I'm afraid that most of Washington are Cheneyites now, and have been building up to this since it became clear that Putin wasn't going to be their puppet.

       Considering the fact that this is the first time I've ever seen the narrative, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we need to invade North Korea because their country is asian nazi germany, not because I believe they have the capacity to fight a war with the U.S. and endanger our security-a story I haven't even been following, because I have no reason to believe it is true, whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If North Korea is actually a communist paradise, it would be one of the largest and most unfounded conspiracy on the planet. From everything I've seen, they are the greatest violators of human rights, and need to go.

       You can have one of those, either strong air defense or dated air defense....

      <p>
       NK's tech is so far behind NATO and China would have complete air superiority, they haven nothing that can even endanger modern planes.

       You can but it's useless. It doesn't matter if you're shooting a tank with 1000 rifles, you're not damaging it. You can have thousands of SAM batteries, if they aren't even able to target the plane they are completely useless.

       Not really, even your article says the most modern system they are confirmed to have are S200, which are horribly outdated. They might have a cheap knockoff S300 but that again is very outdated, even modernized Russian S300 can't reliably track modern stealth planes such as the F22 and F35....

       Little to none, especially those assets already in the region.

       Do you even have any understanding of military strategy?
      </p>
      <p>
       You send in F22 and 35 to destroy SAM radar sites, after that the rest comes in. Then there are also the Bombers, B1, B2 etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wont be a single sortie but it will be over in a week, with little to no loss of life to NATO and China. NK is just so extremely behind in every single aspect it's not even a challenge.

       Yes I do. Im wondering if YOU realize the difference between expected Equipment capabilities and the realities of who has what equipment where, and how much of it. The overwhelming majority of the heavy lifting is going to be done by the f-18s on the carriers and f-15s and 16s in South Korea, and big conventional bombers from Guam not the 22s and 35s in the limited numbers there are on active duty at this time and in theatre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides a lot of that equipment is camouflaged or in bunkers and caves, and won't be rolled out until after the first wave of strikes. That's something the military acknowledges.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also saying the second this kicks off there's gonna be a lot of damage done to military assets along the DMZ, and a lot of your air support will be devoted there initially to control the damage there.

       It's an attempt to copy the S300, not an equivalent. And even modernized Russian S300 with a well trained crews are not effective against modern stealth planes such as F35, F22 etc.

       Most of the NK artillery (Their main form of offense) is outside of range of Seoul, SK has extremely advanced anti missile systems, as does Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK would be able to sustain maybe a few hours of shelling before most of their offensive capabilities are wiped out. SK knows exactly where their invasion tunnels are and have them rigged to collapse if anyone tries to move equpiment or soldiers through them, SK has literal kill bots on their side of the border with millions of mines in between. SK keeps jets idling on the runway so they can neutralize any NK incursion immediately.

       Apparently NK has "thousands" of artillery pieces aimed at Seoul (SK), so if they get attacked... Seoul feels the heat. Too many to disable them all before they inflict a lot of death and damage, and they do have some anti-air capability which is actually decent according to some reports.

       no i'm pretty sure he's implying that the US has created some impetus for them to invade North Korea to 'free' them, but nothing of the sort has even been theorized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is real is that North Korea could attack Guam, and the US could retaliate. Not some US invasion of North Korea because Trump.

       no - that's what you're trying to say while attributing it to others.

       you're also completely skewing the point of the original comment. The point is that nobody in the US has called for an invasion. That is complete hyperbole, but here you are trying to defend it.

       No, you are making assumptions. A conflict can be handled in many ways but primarily this is a situation that will be much more isolated if is handled now. Waiting for them to actually produce nuclear weapons would cause many more innocent deaths, to add to this. If they do manage this I imagine Russia and China will find much leverage against the West and could lead to a global conflict with nuclear weapons.

       Yes that is a valid point and will not contest it, my argument lies more in the fact that there are decades of human rights abuses in North Korea in conjunction with a leader which is disregarding agreements made and is attempting to create weapons (is also likely using nuclear materials previous US administrations gave) which could harm the US and it's allies, to make matters worse they have made repeated, direct threats.

       I'm no fan of the MIC, but the US is not being an aggressor here. Sanctions is not the same as an aggressive stance towards war. You are making things the absolute worst version of reality.

       "Trump's desire for war against Korea", you say, without mentioning North or South. But moving on... where are you getting this information from that he wants war?
       <strong>
        They threatened to nuke a US territory.

       What's he supposed to do? Have a beer summit with Kim Jong Toadboy?

       Trump has always said negotiations come first, but he will not take any options off the table. This is the only logical position to take. You don't take any options off the table when someone is threatening to fucking nuke you. This anti-Trump insanity has gone so far that thousands of people on Twitter right now are basically taking North Korea's side just in an attempt to hurt Trump. It's madness.

       I agree with you. It has been happening for years. But now Trump is president, so he's Hitler starting WW3 and global nuclear annihilation just for fun.

       It's the difference in reaction from the extreme anti-Trumpers (or maybe not so extreme, considering how many people on Twitter are going nuts with this) that annoys me, as if Obama wouldn't have nuked the shit out of NK if they launched something his way during his term.

       dont bother being realistic.  i've come to realize in the past couple months that trump derangement syndrome is definitely a real thing. first i thought it was a joke, but no, it's sadly not.  we have a pretty large, gullible and hyper misinformed population being fed massive amounts of clickbait and getting extremely out of touch from reality by it. the over reactions are unreal. trump had 2 scoops of ice cream! and just look at that guy that went on a public twitter meltdown claiming that trump jr meeting with that russian woman about dirt on hillary is the greatest political scandal in US history with nothing even coming close.  he was dead serious. unreal. apprantly he never opened a history book? and he's a college professor.  i can't even look at my facebook newsfeed anymore, it's beyond depressing such a large portion of our population is simply this easily enraged with no ability to handle their emotions and actually look at the big picture.   the networks are making a killing taking advantage of this. my entire iphone news app is trump articles. there is no other news. it's ridiculous.

       The "two scoops" story was one I had forgotten. Pathetic stuff. But then CNN made a second-by-second analysis of Trump's handshake with Macron in France. I'm not even slightly exaggerating. They did this.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is CNN:
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/14/politics/a-second-by-second-analysis-of-the-trump-macron-handshake/index.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, the same CNN guy (Chris Cillizza) who got called out for "fake news" by the Polish president over another handshake:
       <a href="http://people.com/politics/polish-president-fake-news-trump-wife-handshake-snub/">
        http://people.com/politics/polish-president-fake-news-trump-wife-handshake-snub/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris has an obsession with Trump... and handshakes.

       Oh, come on, the ice cream thing was funny.  It's cute when he has a tantrum because he thinks he's better than anyone else.  It's just like when he ordered meatloaf for Chris Christie.

       And I'm sure he gave Chris two servings of mashed potatoes.  Probably also took away Chris' spoon so he wouldn't try to get extra ice cream but still very thoughtful on the potato servings.

      <p>
       i'd also suggest you maybe try and listen and here them out vs coming in with a i have it all figured out mindset.  and back to the insults, the less fucks or name calling / labels like snowflake or whatever else you like to use, the more likely you'll have a productive conversation with another human. respect is a 2 way street.  best of luck to you brother! cheers.

       Here's the problem.  You initially said "dont bother being realistic. i've come to realize in the past couple months that trump derangement syndrome is definitely a real thing."  That doesn't sound like you want a discussion; you're just dismissing anyone's arguments by saying they're deranged for not liking Trump.

       thank you for your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       it might be maybe i don't understand how reddit culture works but i was replying to the initial user's comment and agreeing with him/her that there is a general overreaction to everything trump. i wasn't actually in my head attempting to engage in a discussion with anyone but them. however, i welcome it and thank you again for your input as it's actually constructive. and you're right, that opening line is not inviting for conversation but in my action i was simply supporting that user's comment.  should i have direct messaged them?
      </p>
      <p>
       for me at least, if i wanted a general discussion i would have posted top level and worded it differently.  again, maybe i don't understand reddit, i'm fairly new to it and probably fairly older than the median.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for "you're just dismissing anyone's arguments by saying they're deranged for not liking Trump".  i have to politely strongly disagree.  i think there is an overall ridiculous overreaction to everything trump in the networks and social settings i navigate.  the news, if you can even call it that, is manipulating and capitalizing massively on this. i've never seen more clickbait garbage in my life. it's more TMZ than journalism. it's cheap and more entertainment based.  and this is no way suggests that i even support trump, i lean left. i'm just disgusted with the state of our media and more so our population that eats up this garbage. it's pathetic to be honest and depressing regarding our future.

       It's irrelevant what you want, many Republicans under BUsh didn't want war either but they were so dedicated to their leader that they would repeat the same neocon talking points. You want what they want you to want and you have no choice.

        N. Korean missile threats worry some on Guam
North Korea, which has missiles capable of hitting U.S. territories in the Pacific and possibly mainland USA, has ordered its rocket and long-range artillery units to be combat ready after joint military drills by U.S. and South Korean forces.

       I've had enough with the hysterical antics around this issue. It's because Trump is president now. That's the only reason people are getting all worked up and the media is hyping it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one fucking mention of Obama back in 2013 in that article. Zero. Despite him being ultimately in command of joint military "war games" and whatnot. Compare that with this week's hysteria.

       You would have to believe that Obama wouldn't nuke them in retaliation if they nuked Guam. I don't believe that. The threat of retaliation is always there, and has been since WW2 and the development of such destructive weapons. This isn't a new concept we're talking about here. Use Google and restrict your search to pre-2017 if you need to do some research on the topic.

       Trump has ESCALATED by opening his big mouth, he isn't just using military exercises as a deterrent, he is talking about a pre-emptive attack, that's not even close to what any previous President did.

       Of course it was an option. It hasn't been done - it's an option. Just stop digging yourself deeper. I gave you plenty to read, and told you how to find more. I understand that a lot of people think politics just started last year... but this stuff has been going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where was the panic and hyped up media when SK threatened to preemptively nuke NK last year after Obama's war games? Where was the talk of Obama provoking WW3? If you can't see the difference in reaction now... I don't know what to tell you. You keep saying I should stop being an apologist, but you don't seem to think that relates to you at all. Look at yourself here, jumping through hoops backwards trying to make it look like Trump is the first to say anything about NK... like they were just over there minding their own business and nobody in the world talked shit before.

       You are literally lying to defend a politician, you lied blatantly when you made up the poll numbers, what kind of person does that?

       I didn't get mad, I explained how this is a common debate tactic when someone loses an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       'LOOK AT ME I AM LAUGHING AT YOU' is BS, if you are laughing, you don't tell others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You lost the argument badly so now you are starting the personal attacks. Next time try not to lie so much, you wont need such piss poor lines of argument then.

       You'd be laughing too if you weren't furiously reading your self-help books about "how to be right", desperately flailing around as the hole you dug yourself with lies comes crumbling down on top of you.

       The fact that you still call me a liar, with no proof, after being blatantly caught in a lie yourself, suggests mental illness. We're on record here. All of the comments are available to look through, but you won't find any talk of Trump polls from me, for obvious reasons. You're just a pathetic liar who can't admit defeat.

       Trump was alleged to have ridden on the plane once with an unspecified location, odd to think new York billionaires would know each other and be friends and the allegations of the 13 year old provided no evidence and was dropped, so I mean again there's no actual evidence just more baseless allegations look how many women came out all at once and not a single shred of evidence or filed reports anything you can't damn people with ZERO EVIDENCE and it's fully based on opinions or word of mouth

       When did he admit sexual assault? I beg you to say the grab em by the pussy line, the wasn't evidence that's why it got squashed you want there to be evidence but fact remains there isn't any, I also don't believe there was anything to do with courts but yes the only confirmation of him on Epsteins plane was from his brother but again there's no mention of where they went where as the Clintons were tied to his island.

       Yea grabbing a women's genitals is sexual assault, however Trump has never been shown to ever do that he made a comment when you are rich a powerful women would let you, spoiler alert floozies throw themselves at rich powerful men myth busted. Again I will revert back to the fact there has never been anything more than allegations and every one of those allegations had nothiing of substance more than someone saying it happened like 20 years ago and nothing was reported then and it was never a big deal until all these women came out at one time and none of them had anything credible

       I'm saying that's not how law works, I can't sit here and say 20 years ago Hillary Clinton groped me, there's no video of it or record by the police or any official are you telling me that didn't happen... and he didn't admit to anything he very specifically said when your rich and powerful women throw themselves at you as if you could grab them by the pussy and theyd let you not at all that he had ever done that

       People refuse to testify to things all the time it dosnt mean guilt or literally half the Obama admin would be in jail haha, I can't prove he didn't go to the island but I also don't have anything saying he did, again your trying to make someone guilty because it's not impossible they did something not based on any ACTUAL fact or evidence to show guilt.

       Hilary Clinton deleted over 30000 emails after they were subpoenaed, she had aides smash devices with hammers after they were subpoenaed and also lied about both, these are both perjury and obstruction of justice on a massive scale.

       He has maintained his position since the 90's as far as I can find. What always baffles me is how back in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s every news agency and talk show wanted Trumps input, and encouraged presidential runs. What the fuck happened?

       Yes, I saw that interview, from Meet The Press in the mid 90s, wasn't it? He has turned out to be surprisingly consistent on the issue of NK over the last 20+ years.

       As for why they wanted Trump on TV... ratings. Particularly on political talk shows like that, he's guaranteed to at least give a more interesting interview than 90% of other commentators.

       The shills will downvote you. No doubt, some of these same shills who are downplaying the objectively atrocious nature of the NK Communist regime as some kind of Rothschild conspiracy to eliminate NK's hopes of remaining independent of the international banking monopoly (I'm sure they'd be a central asset to the usurious international criminals otherwise, uh huh), are the same pushing the "Russia must die!!!1" nonsense. Utterly absurd how backward this is. To be clear, I'm anti foreign entanglement, even in the case of North Korea, but this is not simply a scenario where I accept something like "we should all just come together and oppose Trump" as an end to the argument.

       Geopolitics has zero room for your feels or a desire to react to insults. We need to act in the best interests of our country and I can tell you it is not in Americas best interest to get into a war with NK, no matter how trivial the actual fighting would be. It would weaken and destabilize the region, hurt the economies of the countries in the are (Of whom are our allies), unleash millions of malnourished uneducated individuals over borders to neighboring countries and weaken American interests in the area.

       First link is an appropriate response, not feeding into their rhetoric and imposing additional sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive already explained that while NK threatens to do this shit they never ever would. They arent suicidal. look at their track record, they routinely make these claims and nothing ever happens. You know why? Because they arent dumb and they want to remain in power. Launching an attack against any of their neighbors or America will result in the end of their country will little to nothing to show for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to actually address this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second link is about a SK response, Im not sure why you would want to move from our geopolitical response compared to theirs. If you cant understand the difference there Im not sure I can help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third link is an OP ed... Not exactly a great resource.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Korean crisis has now become a strategic threat to America’s core national interests. The best option is to destroy the North Korean missile on the ground before it is launched. The United States should use a precise airstrike to render the missile and its mobile launcher inoperable.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       SK is already all over this, we dont need to be policing a situation that is already well under control. Its not Americas problem because NK is no threat to us. Unilateral intervention would piss off every single country involved, a lot. China would be rip shit that America decided to occupy a country they share a border with, like more pissed than we have seen them in decades. It would hurt our economy and theirs, you do know China is a pretty big trade partner, right? How do you think they would recoup their losses? They would fuck our trade deals and we would have to eat it. Same with SK and Japan, the sheer influx of refugees will hurt their economies and again they would look to reclaim some of it by hurting the US. This is why I said you need to take your feelings out of it, geopolitics is about strategic superiority not responding to slights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last link supports my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its from 2006 and talking about imminent strikes against the US. That never happened. Carter is a big interventionist and supports America sticking its guns in places it shouldnt. I mean there is a new dictator in office, many of the same policies but not the same person.

       Also read this paragraph

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         North Korea could respond to U.S. resolve by taking the drastic step of threatening all-out war on the Korean Peninsula. But it is unlikely to act on that threat.
        </strong>
        Why attack South Korea, which has been working to improve North-South relations (sometimes at odds with the United States) and which was openly opposing the U.S. action?
        <strong>
         An invasion of South Korea would bring about the certain end of Kim Jong Il's regime within a few bloody weeks of war, as surely he knows.
        </strong>
        Though war is unlikely, it would be prudent for the United States to enhance deterrence by introducing U.S. air and naval forces into the region at the same time it made its threat to strike the Taepodong.** If North Korea opted for such a suicidal course,** these extra forces would make its defeat swifter and less costly in lives -- American, South Korean and North Korean.

        Mattis told reporters that this week's missile launch didn't threaten the U.S. He said it doesn't change the administration's determination to pursue diplomacy to resolve the nuclear threat, but he suggested North Korea might eventually push too hard.
       </p>

        Bruce Bennett, a North Korea expert at the Rand Corp., a federally funded think tank, said a fully effective U.S.-led bombing campaign would require precise intelligence about the locations of the North's nuclear and missile storage and launch sites, a number of which are dug into mountainsides.

       I don't think we even disagree on much... I pointed out that track record of threats from all sides that you're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been saying that shit-talking is normal, and threats of preemptive strikes as far back as the technology existed basically, and I never pushed the idea that NK was going to do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of what you're saying justifies taking options away though. There could be a scenario. But I doubt the intelligence (data) that officials have anyway, since they're so often wrong, but again this isn't new with Trump.

       Mostly because I never said that. Im just pointing out why some options are retarded. I mean one option is to launch our entire nuclear arsenal at NK and completely glass the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that a valid option? Sure by your definition. Will it ever be implemented? Never.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reread your original post to the OP. You are the one accusing people of taking options off the table, you are the one buying into hysteria and rhetoric. Everyone else is just pointing out how ridiculous it is to buy into that rhetoric and tell NK that threats will be met with "Fire and Fury" when every single person who knows the least bit about this knows that NK will do nothing and telling them shit like that only stokes imaginary fires that will lead to real war.
      </p>
      <p>
       You simply cannot afford to show emotion at this level of international relations. You cant feed that fire of rhetoric with your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump not understanding the situation and speaking out of line does no one any good and puts us closer to a confrontation while at the same time making appear weak to the top players in that part of the world. We have a powerful army and could fuck NK into the stone age, everyone knows this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk softly and carry a big stick. We dont need to talk shit because we can actually back up our threats which is why we need to not threaten countries with fire and fury, America should never make a threat, it should act.

       The difference being what Obama did, and Bush before him, is a projection of force, a real projection of force. Not a tweet.

       Its basically a game of who throws the first punch. The results will be the same but one of those first punches hurts America more than the other.

      <p>
       If NK responded to completely joint exercises with shelling Seoul, they cease to exist. This is best case scenario in a lot of ways, we immediately have the moral high ground and no country would dare stand in Americas way if we were intentionally attacked.

       A preemptive nuclear strike would make NK launch all of their nuclear payload (probably artillery shells with a nuclear warhead). Which would lead SK to be uninhabitable as well as trigger many other countries' nukes and fear of nukes.

       Either the left will destroy the West or the West will destroy the left.  This has been festering since at least the 60's.  Last year it was all brought to light as the left was finally in a situation where they would actually lose an election. Identity politics, open borders for all the brown and black people of the world, protecting black and brown criminals while demonizing working white men, socialist agenda, control and collusion with the MSM, this list gets long.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's Obama's true legacy.  He woke the world up to the true nature of the left.  Now that it's been exposed the vast majority of Americans are vehemently against the left.  Mark my words, the Democrat Party will not exist after 2018 and liberal will be a dirtier word than communist by then.  You will pretend you were never a leftist, just like the rest of your ilk.

       If you think either side will be annihilated, you're drinking the partisan kool-aid.  Neither side will "win".  The only way we can go on is having 2 sides endlessly fighting or to figure out a way to get along without blaming the "other side".

       Man, so many people are sooo ignorant on what liberal VS conservative really is.
These people keep flooding from T_D, a zionist controlled hangout where anti-liberalism is encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those outside the U.S. see the lib VS con thing even more retarded because they don't
use "liberal and conservative", they tend to be more specific and say left, right, centrist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kind of people who keep hating a group (hating liberals, conservatives, LGBT people, poor people flipping burgers, etc.) just keep pushing "muh ideology"
divide and conquer. It's just sad.
When has this partisan hate fueled sport ever accomplished shit except division?
I seriously hate conservativism (anti-worker ideology) but I hope to teach people the truth about pro-establishment conservativism and so called "liberalism". (What the establishment calls liberal and conservative, is actually NEOliberalism and NEOconservativism, although normal
conservativism is still shit.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites keep winning if we keep thinking this is a sports match between "da liberalz and da conservativz".
While most of the so called lib/con players (politicians) laugh all the way to the bank.
Many people still confuse cultural shit with politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I have faith in humanity, hence I'm working on a visual project to show people the truth about politics,
the stereotypes, the B.S. talking points, corporate media lies, etc.
There is no dominant left wing in the U.S.
The word liberal is nonsense and doesn't explain where on the spectrum anyone is.
Left liberalism, NEOliberalism, classical liberalism....these ideologies take the liberal name
and yet they're all so different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political science is the way to see past the corporate media's
stereotypical identity politics agenda of divide and conquer.
I hope the person you responded to, wakes the hell up
and stops hating on people he [currently] doesn't agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the alt right (alt establishment) supporters want what the real left want.....jobs, pro-worker policies,
etc.
It's the alt right leaders (Alex Jones, Trump, Breitbart, Fox News, T_D shill mods, etc.) that are zionist shills.

       Great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried to understand this "new age" as well. I'm an Australian and US politics bewilders me; it's like TPTB have convinced the TRADITIONAL left (the workers and generally soaking, the masses) that progression is their enemy. Therefore the traditional left is now the right. At least that's what the US looks like from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       The traditional right, is the powerbase of TPTB. They have the money, they are the actual "globalists" (they instituted the neoliberal economic movement - known in the U.S. as Reagonomics). They increase profits by moving operations to third world shitholes. Yet now, the conservatives think globaists are left...bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       However TPTB architectured this deliberately, they created extreme left culture and extreme right culture, they lay both sides media. My theory is this is all down to dumb down general society and allow most people to simply get lost in white noise.

       Hi, thanks for the reply.
You're right.
Corporate media stereotypes like implying "left wingers are all feminists"
which is nonsense. I'm a center left humanist (although I don't care much for ideologies, if something sounds wrong, I reject it, whatever the ideology).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people unfortunately don't see their own cherry picking.
Some people BELIEVE the corporate media when they lie, calling
Bernie Sanders a "dictator communist/dictator socialist/anti-business/state capitalist/lunatic/sexist bernie bro/unpopular with minorities/etc."
but then they DISbelieve the anti-Trump stuff. 
The partisan mentality is still there, in denial. (IMO, Trump/Clinton are both shills, I don't really care about the Russia distraction.)
Or maybe it's just the shills who deviate from common sense, I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real progression is not the weird crap that the establishment push.
Progress is about making things more equal than the messed up
anti-worker history humanity has had.
TPP is the opposite of progress for example.
Just because it's new, doesn't mean it's progressive.
I think some people INcorrectly assume new deranged ideas = progressive.
But the new kids on the block, NEOliberalism and NEOconservativism are definitely anti-progress for workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservativism = conserving a low waged population. (Other interpretations could be "conserving the way it was before
the unions gave us workers' rights) Without the unions, we'd all be working ALL WEEK, NO WEEKENDS.
Unions are US, the PEOPLE/workers (there is always a possibility of groups getting compromized but unions are usually good protectors of workers).
Corporations are THEM, the parasite elite beurocrats/elite bankers controlling the financial system and politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberal is a pointless adjective.
It's about liberty, but liberty for who?
Many ideologies claim the name.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Classical liberalism (that's the free market Laissez-faire crap right?)
would be liberty for the corporations to screw us ALL (workers, consumers, etc.)
by removing all regulations (safety, ethics, worker conditions and pay, etc.)
Corporate dictatorship. Sort of like now, but with the INSANE TPP shit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Left liberalism (a very general region of the spectrum, includes democratic socialism, social democracy and to an extent centrism among a few others)
is liberty for the workers/people, by protecting workers and awarding them what they are owed for their labor
(not necessarily ALL fruits of their labor, but at least a more reasonable amount).
Socialism/capitalism CAN co-exist in a better ratio.
But elites push "capitalism baby!" and "eew socialism".
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         NEOliberalism, is one of those ideologies (like conservativism, and NEOconservativism) that champion crony capitalism.
Favoritist to corporations. Free tax money to Google, Apple, etc. etc. etc.
        </p>
       </li>

       Well then you're going to be wasting a lot of time by not "Standing by." There's no arguing with those people, right or left. We need them in our society to show us that we can never ever purge a certain belief. I understand where you are coming from but I think you don't understand them. They certainly won't understand you

       Why is everyone acting like this wasn't an eventuality? Haven't NK been flexing for literally decades about how eventually they were gonna smash up some Western Civilization? And haven't tehy been working on that, tirelessly, day in and day out for those past decades? And doesn't it stand to reason that somewhere along that timeline they're gonna develop something that causes worry?

       Lol, they havent been working tirelessly, they are barely a functioning state. Even if they develop a nuke capable of fitting on the head of a missile they will never be able to hit N America, they have to go through 5+ of the worlds most advanced missile defense systems from multiple countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK knows that as soon as they attack their country will be wiped off the map. No one can defend them if the lash out at America and they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its 100% posturing and Trump playing into the "raining fire" fire rhetoric does nothing but validate the NK position (At least to its citizens and military).

      <p>
       Just to reiterate it will never ever happen... Unless we hit first. If we preemptively strike NK they will have no options left but to use any means to hit us back. If we hit first we lose the moral high ground and we will force them into a corner where they will use any nukes they have. Then Asia will be pissed because we just destabalized the entire eastern part of that continent, damaged SK, China and Japans economies which they will not be cool with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best way to handle NK is with counter propaganda. Show the people that the west is prospering and not the villains.

       Kim and most of the higher up in the NK government are all educated abroad. Kim spent years in Switzerland being educated, him and his generals know exactly how out gunned they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they know exactly what the odds are and how fucked they would be if they attempted a military action against anyone why give us this insane "Raining fire" rhetoric?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they can turn around to their under educated, malnourished brainwashed society and say "Look! I told the Americans we will rain nuclear fire down and burn their country until it sinks below the ocean and they do NOTHING! WE ARE STRONG AND THE FACT THEY DO NOTHING IN RETURN PROVES HOW STRONG NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP IS! THEY FEAR US AND OUR MASSIVE TOTALLY LEGIT MILITARY!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas in every other part of the world we all know how insane that sounds and how impossible it would be. We dont respond because it would be like a toddler telling you he is going to punch your head off so hard its going to hit the moon. No one wins if you feed into that nonsense.

       Because it doesnt affect us at all. You have to remember that in geopolitics personal feelings and reacting to insults based on emotions is the one thing you do not do.

       Every threat needs to be handled objectively. Objectively NK isnt a threat to us at all.

       What's to fear monger about? NK makes threats against everyone, tests nukes without repercussions, and tests ICBMs in Japan's waters.

       Exactly. Why would they sacrifice their country to do no damage to America?

       No they arent. Nuclear power? Yes, kind of. Unhinged? Yeah, kind of. They know exactly what game theyre playing and its all very intentional. They arent acting crazy because they are crazy, they are acting crazy because its been working. They have been autonomous for 50+ years playing the crazy card, thats a track record better than most dictatorships.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fire and brimestone rhetoric isnt for the West, per se its for their own population. When they make bat shit insane claims as to their capabilities and threaten us with those (We will nuke your continent into the sea for example) we know thats bullshit and they know they arent able to. What it does do is give them propaganda material to use, now they can turn to their civilians and say "Look at how powerful we are! I told them we would rain hellfire down on them and they did nothing!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The last thing they want is to be taken 100% seriously. If we took them seriously they lose their crazy card.

       At the end of the day decisions need to be made using cold hard facts with us coming out on top. It doesnt matter is Kim said he fucked your mom or if he threatens to rain hellfire down on his enemies, this is calculate and you fell for it, because of your feels.

       Lets revisit this statement. NK
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       and this is the smallest of mights, be able to shell parts of SK for an hour or two before their ability to attack is neutralized. Seoul is outside of most NK artillery and Seoul citizens train for this exact scenario. Some infrastructure damage is about the best outcome for engaging SK.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know this, SK knows this, we know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would they sacrifice their entire country to
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       bruise SK? As soon as they attacked their country ceases to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe the rhetoric Kim says? Youre an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think NK is suicidal and is willing to destroy a decades old dictatorship to annoy the western world? It would be like having a neighbor that you hate and you throw a rock through his window knowing full well he will come over, shoot you in the face and burn your house down if you do. So is it worth throwing that stone?

       Well 230 miles, but whos counting... Once more I dont think you realize how advanced our systems are vs theirs. Seconds after that launch it was most likely tracked by multiple countries who all had the ability to shoot it down if it were going to hit anywhere sensitive.

       Yeah that was a real dick move but its by design that they do this shit. NK knows exactly what its doing when they act like this.

       So two weeks later and a middle sailed over japan from NK. Is there a reason either the SK defenses or the Japanese defenses didn't shoot it down? I know that they didn't announce a satellite launch bs story like they usually do, so an unexpected ICBM just flew through their airspace with no resistance. Not trying to be a dick, just genuinely curious...

      <p>
       Yeah, they didnt have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple countries and multiple missile defense systems were tracking it but no one wants to reveal how capable they are at shooting down missiles unless they absolutely have to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan doesnt want Russia and China to know how quickly they can react, the type of system they have and how capable those systems actually are. They also dont want NK to get any kind of idea about how these systems work or what they are capable of.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because there was no threat, if that missile was going to hit mainland Japan it would be dropped by any number of the missile defense systems it had to travel through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern missile defense systems are pretty good. The only way to get through is to either spam so many rockets it overwhelms the defense system (Which NK will never be able to do) or to use those extremely advanced mach 30 ICBMs of which only a handful of countries have and is well outside of NK tech. Those puppies travel so fast they turn the atmosphere in front of them into plasma and most modern missile defense systems dont have the ability to intercept something moving that fast. I actually wouldnt be surprised if there were defense systems for those but again no one wants to show their hand in terms of how capable they actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially NK is neutered and every country doesnt want to share just how capable they are at defending themselves.

       Oh great, more one-upmanship between idiots with nukes. Those lovely new sanctions are doing exactly what they were supposed to do by the look of it. I'm guessing thats why they included all 3 countries in a "shotgun" strategy just incase one or two didn't take the bait. You can always rely on the North Koreans I guess. Fucking morons inching the world closer to armageddon. At least the republicans are honest about being warmongering stooges controlled by the MIC, the democrats foaming at the mouth with bloodlust further cements my choice of demexiting. I pray to jebus a third party comes along to end this charade. We need a billionaire backer to help primary everyone possible in 2018 and replace them with anti-war candidates (regardless of political party).

       Yes let's leave North Korea people to starve to death till Kim has a kid and they continue the trend of tyranny for another generation. I personally want Kim removed from power, but hey let's allow them to wipe South Korea and Japan off the face of the map so we just avoid war. /s

       Trump doesn't want this war you idiot, he's just responding the only way he knows how; peacocking and brute force. As many of the top voted comments will tell you, surrendering your nuclear weapons will lead to assured destruction. OBAMA LEGALIZED STATE PROPAGANDA. WASHINGTON POST HAS A $600MIL CONTRACT WITH THE CIA. WASHINGTON POST IS CLAIMING THAT NK IS GOING TO NUKE GUAM. IT'S ALL BULLSHIT THEATRE

       To all these people that are trying to put the blame on a certain presidential registration: Stop. It really doesn't matter who's fault it is anymore. That's not going to change anything. We need to join together, regardless of how we identify politically, and like this post says, do everything in our power to prevent any possibility of a pointless and deadly war from happening. Everyone needs to get off their bullshit and focus on the more important issues.

       I don't think that you can say the same about Russia's involvement to Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons in 1994. Russia was also promised that NATO would not expand eastwards around that same time. Over time, NATO broke that promise and converted all ex-Warsaw Pact countries to their Cold War-era military alliance, eventually knocking on Ukraine's door around 2012-2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came the Western-backed coup of 2014, which was clearly instigated by Western intelligence and friendly Ukrainian Neo-Nazi groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia is also dealing with being on the other side of the greatest military buildup since World War Two along Russia's western border. The West has also built an anti-missile shield in Romania AND installed missiles in all of these new Eastern European NATO countries. Why provoke Russia like this? What is to be gained?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no cheerleader of Putin, but it is clear who the aggressors in Eastern Europe are right now.

       Yes that is a valid point and will not contest it, my argument lies more in the fact that there are decades of human rights abuses in North Korea in conjunction with a leader which is disregarding agreements made and is attempting to create weapons (is also likely using nuclear materials previous US administrations gave) which could harm the US and it's allies, to make matters worse they have made repeated, direct threats.
