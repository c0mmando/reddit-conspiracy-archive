        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok Reddit detectives, any help at all would be appreciated. I tried looking into this a few different times and I had completely forgotten about it until recently.</p>

<p><strong>Scene:</strong></p>

<p>My grandfather had severe Alzheimer&#39;s disease and was forgetting how to walk and talk and feed himself.</p>

<p>He is laying in bed and my cousin is feeding him.</p>

<p>Between bites he says:</p>

<p><strong><em>&quot;The truth lies on Cherry Street&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>My cousin questioned him for a few minutes, but gave up.</p>

<p>After further talking and later saying goodbye and saying &#39;I love you&#39;, there was no response from him.</p>

<p>As far as we know, he never said anything again. Within a few days later, he became completely bedridden. Probably about a week later, he passed away.</p>

<p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>

<p>My grandfather passed away in April 2016.</p>

<p>Edit: He&#39;s lived in Seattle, Washington; Walnut Creek, California; Arnold, California; and retired to Texas.</p>

<p>He was in the Navy from 1945 to 1947 (WW2).</p>

<p>He was a Navy aviation machinist from 1948 to 1951 (Korea).</p>

<p>He started working at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1961 and worked there for 31 years.</p>

<p>He was a business manager for the physics department and retired after becoming the head of the technical information department.</p>

<p>Through these positions he had the highest clearance level and also worked in the printing department for years where he saw photographs being developed and anything that was printed.</p>

<p>He spent several months on Christmas Island taking pictures and filming above-ground bomb tests.</p>

<p>I remember seeing him tear up reading about his coworkers at a museum; Ed Teller, Edwin M. McMillan, J. Robert Oppenheimer and Louis W. Alvarez.</p>

<p>Picture at my grandpa&#39;s retirement party. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2ar7y2Z.jpg">Grandpa (Left), Owen Chamberlain (Right)</a></p>

<p>A stipulation of his pension was to keep every secret he knew.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: <em>&quot;The truth lies on Cherry Street.&quot;</em> Any information or help figuring this out would be much appreciated.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Not Oppenheimer in picture, was misinformed. It was Owen Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Found this info on Luis Alvarez (Grandpa worked with in the 60s). </p>

<p>&quot;In November 1966 Life published a series of photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could be learned from the film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President&#39;s head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1785, the four-story mansion at 3 Cherry Street was leased by the Continental Congress to serve as the Executive Mansion for Richard Henry Lee, President of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation. It continued to serve as such for the next three Presidents and, in April and May 1789 served as the first Executive Mansion of the President of the United States and Mrs. Martha Washington. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Street_(Manhattan">source</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assure you that I am not trying to be insensitive, but some part of you must accept that the Alzheimer&#39;s could have played a role in the &quot;cherry street,&quot; information. Sure, it could also be a memory from things he had seen and never forgotten, but let&#39;s not rule that out. Personally, I am intrigued by what this could mean, given your grandfather&#39;s history and career! I am sure he saw some interesting things... I hope you find something!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cherry is symbolic of virginity. Virginity is synonymously tied to being naive, lack of experience or absence of knowing. The minds of most individuals within the herd are not like shepherd overseers &amp; are thusly more like virgins that are naive due to not verifying the verity[truth] of information that is fed to them without knowing the complete full deeper details that bust the cherry of knowing allowing one to decipher if information fed is factual pure nutritious or unhealthy junk food.</p>

<p>Most people know where a cherry comes from &amp; know the process of how it goes from seed to mouth, but a less wholesome tooth rotting possible diabetes inducing sweeter maraschino cherry is a very complex process most are oblivious to. </p>

<hr/>

<p>truth <em>can often</em> = lies</p>

<p><em>when people walk third eye blindfolded towed by leash along the government maintained road paved with cherry picked information</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>It is maybe possible your grandfather knew of many govern<em>mental</em> lies painted as factual truths than he was free to speak of &amp; this burden on him was coming to the surface as he neared death in an attempt to safely tell his loved ones without specifics to be careful of what is FED by three letters types that lie to children with cherry picked truths placed on top of much fouler bullshit to make the stack of lies placed over reality worthy of eating what otherwise would be rejected.</p>
