       What do you guys think? Trump is so ubiquitous I am like, 100% convinced something else is going on right now that we should know about. Or maybe he is a catalyst for another war? This guy should have never made it to office and I simply do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       believe that the Republican party was just being idiots in initally supporting him. We ALL knew this public figure to an extent yet despite all the negatives, he was still a viable candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either I am so very naieve of the level of ignorance in this country or something else is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on BESIDES Trump?

       That is what I think. That Trump is a cover for something else but I don't know what exactly. I noticed recent music/music videos are showing more and more esoteric symbolism. Marijuana is being promoted more heavily. Small things like that that I know subtly effect the psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already firmly believe that much of the 1%, entertainers included, are involved in some esoteric, mystic shit. They feed off of our energy. Hence the perpetual fear mongering of the media, the thousands of people who will throw up the trinity for "Hova the god of rap" etc. I think they are up to something to truly bring in the new world order in such a way, we won't think twice about whats happening.

       I am not sure why everyone thinks Trump is not "qualified" to be President.

       The President is just supposed to be a charismatic speaker to the people.

       He's like a parent that tells a little kid that the dentist isn't going to hurt and that you will get a lolipop at the end.

       His job description by design is: great deceiver.

       Trump was an interloper, very much an outsider who unexpectedly upset the Republican convention and literally turned it on it's ear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to that there wasn't much of likelihood that the Republicans would do well let alone win, least of all with any of the other candidates all standing there mouthing the tired same-old, same-old. The delegates all knew that and then Trump took front and center and quite literally chewed them all up and spit them out over that.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave a voice to what the delegates were thinking, not that they'd dare to say it, and he put some real hot button issues on the table and managed to sway them over with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enough that it might resonate just as well with other Americans fed up with the same-old same-old to possibly make a difference, even if that was a bit of a long shot, where they didn't see that possibility with any of the other candidates or what they had to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as to the Republican Party supporting him? The delegates obviously did, of course, but the organisation itself, those who run the party, ran against him at the convention, and members running for election or re-election, not really, some still argued against Trump all through the campaign and even went so far as to openly endorse Clinton as a protest, while the others merely said as little as possible with only a few openly stating that they were solidly behind him, or at least they were during the campaign and while it seemed to be bringing them a steady stream of unexpected supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also an issue over how very little financial support the party was willing to provide for Trump. As a result he had to rely on his own money and some  large private donations to cover much of the costs of a campaign that he spent far less on advertising and media coverage by taking it directly to the people on his own private jet in all the large rallies that we saw. A gambit with a rather old-fashioned way of doing it on the cheap in modern times that apparently still works but hasn't been used for ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple truth is that the Republican Party has an unpublished agenda, just as the Democrats do and it's not one that they publicise or ever dare to run on. Campaigns are simply about getting elected and getting into power. Once in power, they pick-up that agenda right where they left off and that's precisely what they're doing now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn't a cover, he's simply out of the loop. He gratified his own overblown ego by winning and he can play at being President all he wants. If it suits the party they'll go along with it and if it doesn't they won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may have ridden into office on Trump's coat-tails but they don't feel like they owe him anything. It was simply the means to an end and the end was as it always is, getting back to that agenda of catering to the top 10% off the backs of everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same hidden agenda as the Dems, the only real difference lies in groups among that top 10% that they happen to favour and cater to over and above the others.

       I think Trump is much smarter and probably even more cunning than that. His entire ego/dumb shit is basically what it is: a cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Republican still follow through with their plan, Trump sure as hell doesnt make it easy. Misdirect, shitshow, press shit-slinging so that the entire public could focus as much as possible on the corruption from the neolibs (And subsequently, the neocons as well since they are pretty much the same) and the MSM bullshit 2-faced propaganda (everytime he posed up for a war, they hard cheerleading him, everytime he doesnt, they shit-slinging him).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats investigation and the Seth Rich story is also on the table for the "shits that goes under the nose of the enemy" most of the time. Trump knows something, but currently the character assassination doesnt let him say about it more. I bet the 9/11 and JFK files will get out soon enough, after he has dealt with the "Russia" hysteria and calmed down the other half of the political spectrum that now has 75% want him dead, and 24% want him impreached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shits like this are dangerous for him tho.

       just a distraction. all they need is time now. We need a bit more debt for the TPTB to make any huge moves. Also as time goes on, they only become richer, more advanced with tech, better prepared for once they shit kick the fan and escape to new Zealand or antarctica.

       Obviously there are most likely more immediate goals with him or things they are distracting us from, but really they're just distracting us from the fact that shits really fucked up. And they're doing really fucked up stuff. And their media companies just keep you placated with content and reassure that anythinf you do just makes you more in debt.

       The likes of Cheney and Rumsfeld brought us the imperial Presidency, envisioning it as a short cut for the deep state to rule. Things are often more than one thing, which is something r/conspiracy tends to forget. Trumps is ultimately an insider and an outsider. He wants to weaken the traditional governing systems to make was for corporate control and the Presidential power to enrich himself and his friends. He is bolstered by the "what I say is the truth" disregard for facts that many people respond to because they are emotional, not intellectual. The deep state is adjusting to this variation and realizing it's stylistic not substantive. Funnel the money to the right people and toss some social issues into play to keep every one to busy to know they're being screwed. I'm sure some organizations and people within the deep state are angry about changing power structures, but basically it's about where the graft and war is focused, and not whether it is still policy. As far as his election is concerned; our political process is a lie, which he pointed out by mocking it and making exaggerated claims. Hillary was not going to get her coronation. She made Trump look normal by comparison. Oh, and the global financial structure is collapsing, so people who know anything are a little freaked out. Their go to solution is war.
