    <div class="md"><p>Since I&#39;ve asked this question myself, I&#39;ll tell you what the answer is.</p>

<p>To hide that fact that we were created, and that we have a creator. By promoting the heliocentric model, it shows that we are not special, thus creating a division between us and said creator. If the earth is flat, or even a sphere in the geocentric model, then that means we are the center of the universe, and thus special. It implies intention behind our existence. If there&#39;s intention behind our existence, then that implies intelligence.</p>

<p>I could go on, but I think you get the point. By hiding flat earth, a creator is being hidden from us, which is apparently the goal.</p>

<p>This is an argument that doesn&#39;t square with me. If God can create a flat earth, he can create a round earth. Furthermore, a flat earth doesn&#39;t imply intelligent design any more or any less than a round earth. One does not necessarily depend on the other.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a ridiculous argument, but it&#39;s what you will hear most often to your question.</p>

<p>If we believe God to be infinite in power and knowledge why would he create a finite place for us to live that perfectly simulates an infinite universe? Why would he design our prison to be a perfect replica of an infinite universe? </p>

<p>This to me seems to imply that he isnt capable of it if you subscribe to the FE idea that God created this terrarium for us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a flat earth believer.</p>

<p>However, I can think of a reason why they would want to lie about the Earth being round.</p>

<p>Believing in a flat earth is closer associated to intelligent design. In the sense that, if you believe in flat earth than you believe the earth is the center of the universe as the sun would have to revolve around it.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re part of a Satanic elite that is pulling the strings, wouldn&#39;t you want science to &quot;prove&quot; religious beliefs wrong?</p>

<p>The idea is to get humanity as far away from God, his scripture and morality by deeming it illogical. </p>

<p>You already see it in the law system.</p>

<p>If someone rapes your daughter, it is illegal for you to murder them in return. Why? Because it not a &quot;logical&quot; reaction. It is an emotional reaction.</p>

<p>They want you to forfeit the part of the brain that displays: instinct, creativity and feeling for scientific, logical brain that does not question anything.</p>

<p>The Earth has been &quot;proven&quot; to be round by &quot;scientists&quot; that would never lie or be mistaken because they are &quot;smarter&quot; than you.</p>

<p>So instead of wondering or questioning anything, just get back in traffic and go to work so you can make billionaires more profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Some people claim there is no motive for such a grand-scale deception and that flat or a ball makes no difference. By removing Earth from the motionless center of the Universe, these Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the Universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent. But if the Earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars in billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence become highly implausible. By surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist Sun-worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there is no God, and everyone is just an accident, then all that really matters is me, me, me. They have turned Madonna, the Mother of God, into a material girl living in a material world. Their rich, powerful corporations with slick Sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their “science,” vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism. To quote Morris Kline, “The heliocentric theory, by putting the sun at the center of the universe ... made man appear to be just one of a possible host of wanderers drifting through a cold sky. It seemed less likely that he was born to live gloriously and to attain paradise upon his death. Less likely, too, was it that he was the object of God’s ministrations.”</p>

<p>Some say the idea of an inter-generational world-wide conspiracy to delude the masses sounds implausible or unrealistic, but these people need only familiarize themselves with the works and writings of Freemasons themselves, for example John Robison who exposed this in his 1798 book, “Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried Out in the Secret Meetings of the Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies.” Supreme Commander of the 33rd degree Albert Pike was quite forth-coming in several letters regarding the Masons ultimate goal of world domination, and in the Zionist “Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion” the exact plan by which this would be and has been carried out is completely disclosed.</p>

<p>From “Foundations of Many Generations” by E. Eschini, “The one thing the fable of the revolving Earth has done, it has shown the terrible power of a lie, a lie has the power to make a man a mental slave, so that he dares not back the evidence of his own senses. To deny the plain and obvious movement of the Sun he sees before him. When he feels himself standing on an Earth utterly devoid of motion, at the suggestion of someone else he is prepared to accept that he is spinning furiously round. When he sees a bird flying, and gaining over the ground, he is prepared to believe that the ground is really travelling a great number of times faster than the bird, finally, in order to uphold the imagination of a madman, he is prepared to accuse his Maker of forming him a sensiferous lie.”</p>

<p>And finally, from Dr. Rowbotham, “Thus we see that this Newtonian philosophy is devoid of consistency; its details are the result of an entire violation of the laws of legitimate reasoning, and all its premises are assumed. It is, in fact, nothing more than assumption upon assumption, and the conclusions derived therefrom are willfully considered as things proved, and to be employed as truths to substantiate the first and fundamental assumptions. Such a ‘juggle and jumble’ of fancies and falsehoods extended and intensified as in theoretical astronomy is calculated to make the unprejudiced inquirer revolt with horror from the terrible conjuration which has been practised upon him; to sternly resolve to resist its further progress; to endeavour to over-throw the entire edifice, and to bury in its ruins the false honours which have been associated with its fabricators, and which still attach to its devotees. For the learning, the patience, the perseverance and devotion for which they have ever been examples, honour and applause need not be withheld; but their false reasoning, the advantages they have taken of the general ignorance of mankind in respect to astronomical subjects, and the unfounded theories they have advanced and defended, cannot be otherwise than regretted, and ought to be by every possible means uprooted.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give the bullet points because others have already gotten into it *Hide intelligent design, TPTB are satanic, we know that. *To make sure everyone has a religion. Religions are parts of TPTB, Zionists, the Vatican, etc, are compromised, but they control the hearts and minds of billions and extort their wealth. Atheists blindly follow a religion too, with Neil Degrass Tyson as their pastor, it&#39;s not science, it&#39;s sciencism. Helio-centrism is a religion for a lot of the reasons Atheists don&#39;t like religions, and are just as resistant to questioning their core beliefs. *Separate the enlightened from the proletariat. People born, or carefully let, in the know, like the status quo. They know they&#39;re souls piloting intelligently designed bodies, and they&#39;re laughing at how y&#39;all think you&#39;re evolved monkeys on the third rock from a small sun. *Set the stage for other deceptions like human evolution, global warming, fossil fuels. They&#39;re distracting and degrading, fear-mongering, and eroding while robbing society. *To launder billions upon billions of tax dollars.</p>
