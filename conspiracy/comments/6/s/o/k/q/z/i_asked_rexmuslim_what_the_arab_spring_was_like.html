       Here was the answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience, it was like being Cassandra during and after the Trojan War. I knew this was disastrous and suspicious and wouldn't end well and was being orchestrated and egged on by Americans, and no one believed me until Libya burst into flames. And the Muslim Brotherhood had taken hold of Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah. It was a terrifying experience. 6 years later, I still have nightmares about the media circus and the lies Obama and Clinton shat out about President Mubarak and the 'revolution' they staged in Egypt to hand us over to Hillary's pals, the Brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still remember bombs going off in streets near me, everyone going off the rails once the jails were opened and emptied in one night. Girls getting gang-raped in Tahrir Square, people disappearing and getting run over by cars, foreign workers and residents fleeing by the thousands, schools shutting down. School buses of private institutions being kidnapped whole and held for ransom. All the men in my square sitting watch during the night with weapons to protect their buildings, gunshots and screams at 3 in the morning, airports shutting down, the police disappearing and then the army coming in with tanks to keep us safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arab Spring my fucking ass, lots of us were North African and our lands were set on figurative and literal fire and our economies are beyond repair.

       I asked a follow up question too:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That sounds terrible - and terrifying. I literally feel like Cassandra right now.... :(
Can you tell us more? I feel like this process is being repeated in the USA.
What was the media circus? We currently have one going on in the United States right now, and I can't help but feel like it's the prelude to something similar.
Can you take me through exactly what happened, what the signs and stages were, etc. I'm trying to understand what is going on so I know what the process is.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Seeing as the media circus I'm talking about was created by the USA and, to an extent, UK and the very same news outlets still spewing fear-mongering shit daily (CNN, BBC, etc) nothing is going to happen to the US.
The US destroys countries, it itself won't get destroyed.
The signs were people in society starting to act weird by the hundreds.
Primarily in schools and universities. Odd 'liberal' but very Islamic groups began popping up, going around preaching and persistently telling people that they're oppressed and have been oppressed and that if it weren't for -insert event or person that actually advanced the nation- we would be fucking Switzerland right now.
Also, lots of communism and socialism sympathizers, LOTS OF THEM.
Lots of religious interference in schools, culture and laws, even when the law itself is secular.
The news outlets, both native and foreign, started peddling blatant lies and people ate them up. They started egging people on about Palestine since I was in kindergarten, they had us singing songs about Jerusalem and history classes glorified our communist president Abdel Nasser and the Six Day War with Israel. Lots of Palestinians started popping up along with branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. They inserted their agendas into our schools, our discussions and sometimes, our values.
Egypt is a secular country, legally. My mom recalls not seeing a single veiled woman in her youth and now they're the majority, despite the law not calling for it society, especially in bigger cities became so conservative and religious. So, once girls in my school started getting veiled by the dozens from 10 to 14, my Arabic classes basically became Religion, the brainwashing to hate all Jews and Israelis and not think of Christians as real Egyptians tipped me off that there was something weird going on.
One of my cousins also got a pretty good job despite an awful track record, that's when he grew out a beard and started acting very devout and religious when we know he's really not. Turns out Brotherhood members employed thousands of Egyptians in exchange for allegiance.
Also, when I was 12, it was the last time we took Egyptian historical figures as the subjects of our lessons in Arabic Literature and History. It went from Queen Shajaret-el-Durr to Islamic figures like all of Moe's pals and the people who led the Islamization of Africa and Spain. Rewriting chunks of history to make the Crusades 'an oppressive force' and constantly sucking up to the Turks and atrocities of the Ottoman Empire.
Also, the weird alliance between Islam and Liberal values cropped up too. Lots of the so-called courageous youth that led the 'revolution' were bank-rolled by the Brotherhood. All of these young girls with their 10 lbs of makeup, tight jeans and form-fitting clothes and ridiculous hijab styles were so 'modern' and 'chose the hijab because it's feminist to respect yourself'. Hipster guys with long hair and acoustic guitars wrote songs screaming at our government, they came to my school and we were herded into the theatre to listen to their 'protest songs' about the police 'literally killing us'. Us being literal fucking criminals who later got caught when the jig was up.
There is just so much culture-heavy detail that rose over the years until it exploded in 2011. Mostly devaluing our army, our ethnicity, our history, our own culture and pandering to Arabs, mostly Palestinians, and extremist Muslim sects and to American politicians and their Egyptian counterparts, basically an empty shell renting out to amuse the public by being 'charming' like Obama or Trudeau or a complete monster dressed up in a shiny liberal packaging where if you didn't vote for them you were -insert insulting claim here- like Hillary Clinton.
TL;DR
-- University and school becoming centers for brainwashing rather than learning.
-- Different opinions being ostracized to an almost religious extent. Fervent anti-Semitism/Pro-Palestine and Pro-War against Israel screeching in the news and gatherings.
-- Women claiming they're forwarding the Women's Rights movement by actually taking it back several steps with horrific acts that guarantee regressive backlash (walking naked in the streets / getting pregnant out of wedlock and championing being a Single Mother / as well as pressuring girls to wear niqabs).
-- Mainstream Media being obsessed with vilifying big UN allies like Russia or flat-out lying
-- Celebrities endorsing and capitalizing on so-called 'movements' with protest songs/merch/their worthless opinions on Twitter endlessly
-- High-profile foreigners from countries that are literally leagues worse than yours shaming your leaders for not being 'progressive'.
-- Historical revisionism to fit certain agendas
-- Communist/Socialist sympathizers and ideals

       Yep. You can read about the downfall of many nations. Communists/socialists/liberals begin metastasizing throughout society in obscene ways at incredible speed.

       You can see the same things happening all over developed western nations today.

       IDK, I agree with your follow up question at the top of this statement, that sounds A LOT like what's happening in the US now, especially when condensed into bullet points. And he's pry right, we pry won't get destroyed, but what DOES come next?

       All of them push narratives for different countries, same with NGO reports from areas with different human rights bodies. Mostly just there to sling dirt, they all actively cover up their own peoples misdoings in regions.

       Syria started in 2006 when they rolled out media people for radio and TV to plant opinions stateside and publications to point to in syria to craft narratives.

       They all pick up contracts with various propagandists outlets that push stories. It's mostly the various intelligence agencies doing so, propaganda departments, and they'll use papers or opinion pieces in papers or passed on to big news agency writer contacts who either just straight up publish a ghost written PR piece, or in the case of the whole Cheney leaking info to the press about fake weapons that started Iraq, false scoops.

       You want to start by reading about operation mocking bird and understand that this is how all governments work. Also, about the early uses of the printing press. That stuff is fascinating how people used technologies to their advantages.
