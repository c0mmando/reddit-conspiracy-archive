       There sure doesn't seem to be any voting manipulation anywhere ... it has 200-something votes over six or eight hours. I would love to hear an explanation of why this and other stories that criticize Dear Leader Donald Trump get put into contest mode but no other threads ever do?

       It goes against their narrative, but it be too blatant to actually remove it like they'd like. Next best is to stifle discussion by setting it to contest mode.

       We are experimenting with possibly putting all current political related posts into contest mode via Automoderator in the near future. The posts that have recently been put into contest mode by mods are somewhat of a trial of this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The details are still being worked out and debated. It might not ever materialize into anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all quite sick of seeing the RNC/DNC spam that gets posted here daily. And the thoughts behind Automod are that the posts going into contest mode will help to deter those who create the threads as an agenda and deter those who post politically biased comments for upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said it is still a work in progress at the moment. Does anyone have any feedback regarding Automod and political posts? Ideas?

       That's one of the points of debate we are having. This also isn't a
       <a href="/r/politics">

       We are most certainly aware of what is going on, hence the reason for my explanation of possibly doing
       <em>

       to curb "it."

       Nope, there's real conspiracies going on at the highest levels of government that we should be discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when one side has circumstantial evidence based on blogs and unsourced ideas.. and the other side has multiple government agencies investigating, a special counsel investigating, the senate and house investigating..
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we can all use our brains to figure out which was are valid, and should be taken seriously.. and which ones we can ignore.. or put into contest mode.

       Well if you're seeking out that one-sided discussion, you should check out r/politics. That's been their thing since about August 2nd of last year. As much partisan hackery as you could possibly dream of and more!

       Ah, the source junky. You will fit right in over there. All the big names in media are covered extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, we discuss theories (not necessarily news), which is probably why you've been so hostile to the concept of opinions that don't match yours.  This may seem pretty off-putting to you, but there are people here who talk about 9/11 being an inside job. As you can imagine there is not much coverage of that theory on CNN, but it's a very intriguing conspiracy and we discuss that here.

       Well since you bring it up, I just saw some interesting evidence that the guccifer leaks came from a DNC insider. And yeah I think 9/11 may have been an inside job. There is a lot of material out there on 9/11 though. I am open minded about it.

       So we have that, and literally nothing of any merit that shows any of it came from a DNC insider..

       It doesn't censor things in the sense that it removes them.. It removes the ability for the community, or outsiders even, to know what the rest of the community actually feels. It takes the validity away from any good arguments and allows manipulative or false arguments to look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way to discuss, analyze, share info.. if everything is random and there are no votes.. it's pointless to even have a conspiracy sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you can manually decide which topics the community can eaisly discuss, and which they can't.. you're limiting the ability to freely discuss whatever is relevant... If the mods side one way or the other, they can simply create an environment where it is impossible to effectively share info on one topic, but not another.

       i really do appreciate the awareness of it. I have been critical and I want to see things handled fairly, even if contest mode is annoying to read (its a ton of clicking and you cant just scan a thread)

       How can they be even-handed when the manipulation is only happening to an extent where it actually matters on one side?
      </p>
      <p>
       Show me entire threads derailed by 100+ upvoted comments that just deride other users and offer shitty hot-take comments and jokes? I don't see this happening in any other space.
      </p>
      <p>
       and where are all the pro-Trump comments voted up over 100 votes that you guys keep talking about? I can't find them. So what are we talking about with 'even-handed' action? Any thread about Trump - pro or anti - gets hit hard by both sides. It's just clear one side is pushing a lot harder than the other. To act ignorant of that betrays your genuineness.

       How about letting people have their own opinions instead of trying to paint entire communities (almost half-a-million strong) with a single stroke of the brush. It's plain stupid - anti-intellectual would be an overstatement. Explain to me again how this place is T_D 2.0?

       Contest mode doesn't stifle any user's opinion. They are free to comment as much as they like. In fact, they have a better chance of actually having their comment read, as they don't have to compete against people on their 9-5 and bots anymore.

       Can you not set posts to "new" instead? Wouldn't that stop brigading but leave conversations more intact? Contest mode hides too much and constantly mixing up the posts makes it hard to find quality posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most notably, it rewards people who spam bullshit comments. Someone posting a dozen comments a second means they're going to statistically appear most often at the top of the comments upon refresh. There is one notable user who does this.

       Well I suppose Trump is an element of the powers that be, but do you consider it out of place for a conspiracy sub to think there are Shadow brokers that really run the show? Or is this place now expected to be lockstep with

       You really think the average Joe's belief in the MSM is unjustified?
 The amount of
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       fake news from Fox, Breitbart, Drudge, Infowars, etc. is astounding. And very rarely do they ever correct their articles or retract them except when faced with a lawsuit, while left leaning media organizations seem to be much more proactive and at least try to report facts.
      </p>

       It's fun to hate on the MSM because they skew left, but at the end of the day, the alternatives aren't much better.

       They don't determine 'contest mode' candidates by topic - they do it by voting and comment behaviors. If the thread is acting strange and there are clear signs of manipulation happening, should they ignore it?

       That's not an explanation. That's something they might do in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they first announced contest mode, they said it would be used when certain threads saw strange jumps in traffic and voting out of nowhere - which is usually a sign of vote/bot manipulation. If they have the same amount of page-views between 2 threads and one is seeing 500% more comments and votes than the other, it's normal to look into that and try to combat manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this spazzing out is over what? why is contest mode so offensive to discussion? All it does is slightly inconvenience the user so that they aren't being fed a steaming pile of bought opinion. For anybody who is truly only interested in having a conversation, this is a non-issue. For anybody who takes an interest in shaping the narrative or trying to convince people of their own (ego-worship), this is hugely offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So which side of things do you sit on? Is the ability to see things 'in order' more important than preserving chaos? Or should we just take our pills like the doctor says and let everyone have an equal shot (aka pay to play). It's not an easy situation.

       Maybe for other posts. In this circumstance, it was part of a trial based on content, as has been admitted by ShellOilNigeria. If it was due to nebulous point and comment behavior (still waiting for evidence on this point since it seems normal to me), I'm sure he would have said differently.

       Could be, but we've only received one reason. I don't really see a need to speculate further. If the mod who put the post into contest mode was going to state his reason, he would've done so by now.

       but do you really think its the topic that brings the option to the mod's  mind? Or do they suddenly see strange activity and look into it? I don't see evidence that the mods are unfair unless it was the same mod every single time on the same issues. That hasn't been the case tho. People can't even come up with examples where it should have happened. The people crying foul have nothing to cry about - it just shows how effective 'contest mode' is to manipulated responses and vote patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if you're a guy running an 'online opinion shaping' team and the thread you have poured 30 minutes of work into goes into 'contest mode' - you would be livid. 30 mins of your work would have been ruined, and you're too invested to just drop the thread. It makes for bad business, and that's why i'm all for 'contest mode' anytime there seems to be irregular comment/voting patterns.

       political makes more sense to me if those are the two options on the table as it's 24-hr cycle driven and easy to pander to, but I think it should be used on any topic in which comment sliding and vote manipulation trends are showing.
      </p>

       Again, I think it should be conditional on the behaviors in the thread - not on the topic of the thread. Going by topic is foolhardy because it is not the root issue here.

       we'll see how the criteria changes or evolves. I know it started as a vote/comment stat &amp; manipulation thing, but maybe they are debating contest for all topics because all the shills are whining like crazy cause they aren't gonna get more money for their business if we keep doing contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, if we do contest mode for everything, we end up down a weird, different hallway of censorship which also sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the contest mode criteria should be set by behavior in the thread in question. I understand they are testing doing it by different metrics, but I think the way they have been doing it (non-test) is the best way. I haven't seen too many threads that should have had it enabled, and I haven't disagreed with any time it's been used so far.

      <p>
       From previous mod comments, when they have 2 threads with similar clicks and views but one has multiple times the traffic and extremely high vote totals come in during very small windows, it matches behaviors explained to them as an outside influence or 'brigade'.
      </p>
      <p>
       For myself, this makes perfect sense. It's only in these hyper-partisan threads do the comments get to such crazy high numbers due to all the sliding and the hot air being huffed at one another. It's not consistent with the community's behavior, so why should I assume it is genuine?

It's a popular post, and if there are metrics or criteria that made it go to contest mode - fair enough. It's very clear there is manipulation going on, and that's coming from a long-time user.

       So why do you feel that post should have 'contest mode' enabled? We were talking anti-Trump vs pro-Trump and you gave me a cannabis thread. Nobody is going to argue against cannabis in 2017 except conservative fuddy-duddys. You are not being fair in your argument.

       Here is a better representation of my point:
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis thread you linked above:
      </p>
      <p>
       8405 upvotes, 485 comments
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort thread about subpoenaed emails:
      </p>
      <p>
       156 upvotes, 148 comments
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the difference in behaviors? One thread has about 5% comments to upvotes. The other almost has the same number of upvotes as comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is behavior that can sometimes mean there is manipulation happening. Why are people 20x more likely to be commenting in one thread over the other? It shows both a different conversation and a different audience. This is the 'difference' i am referring to.

       When contest mode first came into use, the mods said they were using it in context of thread behavior, like comment and vote totals that are not consistent with regular board behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we have non-political conspiracy posts with a 5% comment to vote ratio, and then all the political posts have massive comment sliding and engagement ratios that are completely out of whack with reality, we can deduce that there might be something fishy going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that 'opinion shaping' doesn't happen online? Do you think that 'shills' and 'brigades' are imaginary? Don't you think it's very possible that they only show up for certain topics?

       No, the mod said they were testing using contest mode for EVERY political post, but he did not say that was the only criteria by which they use contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look back at the first time they used it. The mods were clear - it has to do with vote/comment totals and strange behaviors on the board. When a thread seems to be hit by influencers, they activate contest mode to try to disrupt it. How is that a bad idea?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the mods didn't say what you say they did. You are pretending that they base this stuff on only one factor, which is not true from what I have seen from the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the mods are in open conflict. Whatever mod you spoke to may not represent the whole.

       not getting huffy, just tired of never getting to the point and trying to converse with you when you just backpedal everything... you spent 6 comments saying that the reason the mods put contest mode into play was because it was a political topic, and now you're claiming you never did that. It's dishonest, and frankly, I think you're just trying to distract me from having conversations with others.

       why are you so focused on semantics here? why are you not interested in actually continuing the discussion? like I said, you are just trying to bait me, and guess what? it's all good friend.

       I just don't think we're going to get anywhere by continuing this - I haven't seen you actually try to have a real discussion. Considering we are about 20 comments into this and only you and I are still reading it, I don't think it's magically gonna start happening now.

       there's your reason. there are more, but that's a good one. novelty. its fun doing the upvote/downvote thing when there aren't paid teams of bots/people trying to use that novelty against people as an information weapon. This is why contest mode exists - it is a tool to combat manipulation.

       But contest mode protects against paid intervention and manipulation.

      <p>
       Since you oppose contest mode for all posts, I can only assume that you don't care about paid intervention and manipulation.

       LMAO SURE! I'm all for that bc the shills hardly hit the important threads. It's funny, whenever there is a user sourced thread that connects the dots, the shills downvote hard as fuck but never show up in the comments...

       I think it's going to be very difficult to separate political conspiracies from non-political conspiracies. At some level, just about everything posted here is political. For example, is Seth Rich a political conspiracy theory? On one hand there are people who believe that it's a simple investigation into an unsolved murder. On the other hand, it's been a central part of pro-Trump messaging for the last year. I just think it's going to be more trouble than it's worth, and you're going to catch criticism no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how have these trial threads been chosen? I don't to to the front page here very often, but I don't remember seeing a contest mode thread that
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       a bad story for Trump

       Automod is able to sticky comments. Contest mode completely shuts down new discussion because no one can find other people talking about specific things, meaning every time Contest Mode is used, no one can discuss it. If they are going to harm new discussion like that, yes an explanation and the ability to freely and easily discuss that should be made possible without the community having to make new submissions like this one to do so.

       Feedback, flair posts as political and add filters. That way if users themselves don't want to see political posts the users can decide whether or not their posts related to politics are removed or kept out of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it stands, all threads that are being put into contest mode are ones directly connected to Trump. Its really obvious that there are efforts being made to stop users from posting about him.

       For a place that prides itself on allowing people to discuss ideas, this current modteam is doing the opposite when its about the president.

       First of all, thank you for actually responding and offerimg some insight into the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me (and I am sure others) this just smacks of an attempt to silence any criticism of the president, which is especially disturbing action for a conspiracy theory board that should always be critical of those in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest mode has only been used on stories critical of trump, and the DNC related stories posted at this point are pretty much entirely spam.

       To me it sounds like a good idea to put all political threads into contest mode.  The worst thing about this sub is that it's overrun by shills from both sides pushing their atupid narratives.  I want to have a discussion, not get downvoted into oblivion because I dared to challenge the narrative on whichever thread SB / CA is currently brigading.

       You can still have your conversation. Im willing to engage with people that get downvoted. And often I receive upvotes, so I know others are reading it.

       I think you are not being fair in determining what creates 'contest mode' conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are saying it has to do with the topic of discussion. However, I would argue that is just the results of the real effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real effect that determines the mods use of contest mode is voting and comment behaviors that are inconsistent with similar threads and historical norms. If they see behavior that is consistent with manipulation efforts, it makes sense to activate something like contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you claim that contest mode is only ever used in a single context, that might be because there is only a few influences that are actually powerful enough to trigger it's action. Go and post a pro-trump article with some substance to it and see how many comments and votes roll in. Then go do the opposite and see what happens. I think that's the difference - the type and intensity of attention. The reason other topics don't set off 'contest mode' is because they don't generate enough interest to even notice they are there.

       Thanks for being open and upfront. I personally do not like contest mode. Its tiresome to have to expand to read all comments. I would rather see a one post per topic rule. No duplicate posts, etc. But I honestly dont know how much work that would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean people still vote in contest mode, so vote manipulation is still possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about users that spam threads with off topic posts? I tried to report one but I dont really see any rules against this. Is it possible to do somethimg about this? I check some of these histories and I see one month old accounts with like -200 Karma. Can you just stop accounts like that from posting? If someone really feels like they need a throwaway account on this sub, at least make them put some effort into their comments or building up their throwaway

       Ahh, anything besides harmless Ancient Aliens or JFK assasination theories gets pooh-poohed as a "political" conspiracy by safe-space whiners and the paid help.

       Another mod told us it was because of brigading and yet another mod told us that there wasn't any evidence of brigading.

       I like the idea. Im sure its frustrating as F for the people who fall on one side, or the other of the hegelian dialect. But this is a place for free thinkers. People who should be able to see both sides of the coin, with no need to chose.

       Seems like it; you can search his username on the modlog (
       <a href="https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log">
        https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log
       </a>
       ) and find that Flytape approved that comment again. Creq seems to try and get some actual moderation in while other mods undo his work by unbanning previously banned spammers and re-approving comments previously deleted for breaking the rules. For example, MAGABolt was banned by Creq twice, and twice unbanned by DronePuppet.

       Looks like a shit environment to try and be an actual moderator without an agenda.

       Also it's pretty clear that the maga person is either a mod alt or a close friend as they've had numerous rule breaking comments and personal attacks.

       Which is a cowardly thing to do in my opinion. Similar to Hillary or Powell setting up private emails to avoid FOIA requests and transparency. Which is ironic they resort to using the same tactics that they claim to hate others for.

       They don't like Totes cause they say users here will brigade those subs, but then they say they are being brigaded and no one can actually check. I like to check totes and search "in conspiracy" to see what topics get linked to other places. Many times there isn't a link to anywhere or there are only a few with little votes and no discussion. Who knows where they get their brigading excuse from then, besides it's an excuse when votes/discussion doesn't go their preferred way.

       I'm not sure how to illustrate it any better. This entire thread is shills and bots talking to each other with a few real users mixed in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pointing out a single comment wouldn't do it any justice. It's an army of shills manipulating the entire thread by manipulating the vote counts and flooding the discussion with hundreds of comments. Any attempt at pointing it out quickly gets buried.
      </p>

       Why do one comment when it's the whole thread? But I have a feeling you understand how it works

       What if if it's an army of shills using the idea of shills to discredit anyone who thinks there's something to the Trump-Russia conspiracy? Of all the conspiracies on this sub, the Trump-Russian conspiracy is the only one that receives a massive backlash from a certain subset of users here.

       You are making excuses, not an arguement. Are you not flooding this discussion with throwaway comments? It may not be shilling, but when people say stuff they know isnt true they come off weak. Unwilling to provide examples or form an arguement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you how you could illustrate it for me. Because you seem to struggle with the idea that we might not have the same understanding. You say this thread is filled with shills. I only see a couple, yeah they make a lot of comments. But the scoring system seems to work with those people.

       Is this a rough estimate or a number you just picked? Can you show the math for your estimate? No you cant. That estimate isnt true without the math to back it up.

       I'm not harassing anyone. You're complaining about brigading when you have close to 10% of the comments there, and you're one of those Trump supporters that isn't very good at pretending they're not. Makes your comment funny as hell.

       Actually, the mods should turn ALL threads that hit 500+ comments. It's fun and it starts more discussions. Shills hate it bc, their upvote/downvote scripts are useless (hence why all the shill uproar everytime contest mode is implemented)

       Ahaha and herewego again always showing up, shitting on Donnie. Aha another great divide tactic. HereWeGoAgain loves to shit on trump and trumpets but who's got the laugh.. The constant trump hate is a shitty attempt to polarize and divide. That's fucked homie. That kind of attitude is what lead the dems to implode.. Yet you never talk about that.. Why not? Are the dems in any postion to be dishing shit on trump?? They have nothing left and yet they are still trying to spread further divide. How fucking sad

       Gotcha, yeah I'm sure he's been reported many times by many users, I remember u/trumprussiaconspiracy (is that it?) has noted it in the past. mods seem to have a vested interest in him and peyote and leaving them unbanned.

       I always see complaints about t_d here, and people claim that this sub is so pro-Trump, but then I see anti-Trump propaganda every day with like 75% upvotes.  So, either these post are getting to the front page via brigading or botting, or the people complaining about this sub being t_d 2.0 are lying and this sub is actually overwhelmingly anti-Trump.  It has to be one or the other, and I think it's pretty obvious which one it is.

       In something completely unrelated to your post, I once read an article that showed George Soros was funding an astroturf campaign through David Brock/John Podesta MediaMatters, Correct the Record and the scumbag, fascist commies at ShareBlue (aka progressives) to infiltrate sites like Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. They run about 50 accounts each to give the false impression that their view and ideology is mainstream, when in reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Those people are described perfectly in the book 1984. You know, the ones who proclaim "Ignorance is Strength!" It's funny because they actually think it's working. If it's true that this happens, it's completely desperate and pathetic.

       You must not frequent this sub very often. Haven't you read the CIA document instructing the media etc to manipulate the masses into calling anyone who questions the mainstream narrative "Crazy" or "Conspiracy Theorists" and to mock and ridicule them with petty, unintelligent diatribe? If you look hard enough, you'll see it everywhere. Those in the know are unaffected by such intellectually lazy slurs. It's comical and sad at the same time.

       The best part of this whole exchange is that no matter how matter how crazy and out there he seems, you are more than likely the one who is incorrect. It is a proven fact that Sorors funded CTR and ShareBlue, just like it is proven fact that these organizations run many fake "shill" accounts on social media. It is also more than likely true that they learned a lot of these plays from the CIA. This sub a safe space to talk about shit like that. Acting like you are right now just makes you look like the silly one.

       I'm on the right man, but I agree with shimmy, and even though I too make a lot of mistakes just like you just did (and worse) two wrongs never make a right, a simple apology and explanation why usually goes a long way.

       It's fucking pathetic, I agree, remember though this strife and breakdown is literally the goal of Marxist nihilism, to break down everything to cause a revolution to bring in their "utopian" communism.

       Except it's not. Ctr spent 6 million dollar's a fucking year ago. Meanwhile Cambridge analytica spent 60 million in support of trump and are now taking over local new in the majority of the country to try and change the narrative. You all have been accusing everyone what you're guilty of. Not surprising though

       You'd have to inject reality into the conversation to have a real conversation. Calling him a liar and a cheat means nothing. Absolutely nothing. Step up your game and be specific. Not personal attacks, not hyperbole. No "may have's" or "could be's" etc. The deep state has nothing outside of what they fabricate. Is he impeached yet? Tick tock. *yawn

       I read the mainstream garbage all the time. The difference between you and I is that I venture outside the propaganda and have learned how to quickly identify spin. It's so easy to see. Progressives are so predictable. Using the same words, slurs, attacks, demoralization tactics etc. I'm not in denial Mr. Alinsky, I know the truth and no amount of fuckery on the parts of the commies will send me back into my previous ignorance. Thank God almighty, I am free at last.

       I really became active when the mother load of conspiracies dropped. It was called Wikileaks. I'm sure you heard of it but as for me, I spent at least 14 hours per day sifting through the emails. If you would have done the same, you'd be just like this...

       It's going to get crazy when more and more of the once previously silent majority begin speaking up and the old tactics don't work. Look how fast score was pointed to. You have -12 I have +29, I'm right, you're wrong and everyone thinks so.

       more people are keen to the ability to buy votes, manipulate scores, farm a bunch of posters, create bots, etc.

       His account got deleted really fast. I've seen these tactics before from r metacanada vs r Canada drama a while back. It's been under brigade for a while now, this sub is going to be useless soon unless the mods do something drastics. Something tells me the sub barely survived pizzagate and it got pin pointed as a main dissemination point.

       Why the fuck do the pro-government people here keep spreading these lies without evidence?

       Everyone in the world that disagrees with you is some sort of shill or bot? It's not possible that people hate a proud racist who brags about sexual abusing women, says he wants to murder people's families, and has billions of dollars tied up with Russian interests?
      </p>
      <p>
       Get out of the box and have a look at the world around you. Look at the opinion polls, look at the internet, talk to people outside of your circlejerk.

       Trump is despised by most of the world and it sure as hell isn't sceptics that have decided he's pure and incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Koch brothers and News Corp have been around spreading lies and propaganda a lot longer and have had much more influence than the enemies they've invented to make it seem like your support for the government isn't an aberration.
      </p>
      <p>
       This comment was written by a real fucking human being who knows a lot of real fucking human beings who share this view, and I'm definitely not going to be surprised when it turns out that all of the "OMG so many CTR shareblue bots" people all turn out to be shills for Cambridge Analytica.

       Sure you can. The rules are long gone. If the mods/admins upheld the rules then there wouldn't be a massive campaign to manipulate opioions online and pin fellow country men against one another instead of focusing all the hate on 1 puppet lame duck president but here they are.

       BAHA dude I've been suspended for calling out CTR in the midst of the primaries. My comment got to the top and was calling out the mods and admins for letting this shit show continue. 7k upvotes then suspended... Do you think I'm going to let these dumb fuck shills attempt to censor us? They are here to silence and stop all discussions. We have exposed them and now they have hired online goons to "censor" anyone who speaks out

       This mod takes the approach of
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sdz0k/leaked_memo_shows_media_matters_share_blue_plan/dlc09iv/">
        'all MSM is propaganda and should therefore be suppressed here'.

       So I suppose if you want to talk about things being reported by the MSM, particularly the liberal side of the MSM, then you'd better post it to 4chan first and then link to that here.

       He has a number of pro-Trump statements and it would seem he has concluded the Russia narrative is false.

       Maybe we should remove the mods? So that "new" mods can step in and add more rules like submission approval. Then once things are being approved by the "new mods" maybe then r/conspiracy can move towards a "whitelist" approval system, where only "trusted MSM sources" can be submitted.

       Now why would media outlet care what a group of "free thinking" individuals discuss on the web? Would it be to manipulate and disrupt all the current ongoing discussions? Those discussions that lead to exposing corruption even when most the media turns a blind eye?

       But remember, they are just imaginary downvotes and they don't mean a thing IRL. Actually, the amount of negative downvotes only gives me confirmation that my words are nothing but truth. If what I said was false, there would be valid comments against my statement. But they never challenge the truth.. Only computer downvote scripts.. American propaganda is literal shit lol

       I would love for the mods to post a public list of all of the threads thrown into contest mode, and which mod put that thread into contest mode.  Every time a thread is put in contest mode, a pinned mod message by the mod that changed the mode should be made in the thread. Most of the time it is another mod that posts a pinned message, if any message is pinned at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the mods can please post a detailed guideline to how they determine whether a thread is being brigaded or not. Simply stating that many of the users in a thread come from another subreddit should be backed up by data that can be seen by the sub's users and a proper review process. People should be able to independently verify a mod's claims when they do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every time I see a major Trump Russia related reveal on this sub, I can predict usually if it is going to be put into contest mode or not. The mods should get a handle on this, because more and more of these reveals are coming and they are only going to get bigger and bigger.

       Although helpful, there is no proper criteria for mods to determine if something is being brigaded or not. There should be some sort  of public vote tally of all of the mods that voted on doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a public review process, it is entirely possible for a mod to do this because they did not like the thread's topic.

       Can confirm, a few days ago I messaged the mods about something, received a snarky answer from one, and when I posted our PMs publicly, I was banned.  No reason was given for my banning, so I assume it was due to this, even though the mod I was PMing denied it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually another mod apologized and told me they were discussing it in private.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was unbanned, given no message informing me of my unbanning, I tested posting the next morning and my messages sent fine.  So my ban was lifted at some point, by someone.

       That seems consistent with what I've heard from others. I tried messaging the mods once over a clarification on the rules. Rule 6 says no "shouting" with excessive bold and enlarged fonts and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was polite and civil and referred to a certain user who was spamming comment sections with comments like
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         This has to blow the liberal lunatics gaskets!
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You've been trolled by POTUS. I love it.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         MAGA
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not going to imitate it but both comments were using headers (#) before the text so the text was huge. Either way, multiple blatant rule violations that should be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I got in return from the mods was a bunch of attitude. One mod in particular was really disrespectful and would toss insults around while saying "go back to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       " while another would say that the rules are up to moderator's discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's clearly certain mods that are influencing the direction of the sub and how the rules are being applied. It's a shame that this community has to suffer as a result of it though.

       Yeah, I was super polite the entire time, I shared my portion of the private messages to the mods but was met with snide remarks and when I called his behavior "Childish" I was told to "not expect better" (paraphrasing, because I don't feel like searching my inbox for the messages)

       All I was doing was asking for clarification on why contest mode was installed on another post, and all I got was sass, then a glimpse into the moderator infighting, a ban, and a silent un-ban.

       Truly weird and gross to think you can just be banned for disagreeing or disseminating mod behavior. Especially on a sub that should frown on that behavior.

       Consistent with my experience as well, it seems like they take any criticism or questioning as an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       A user was banned "for shilling for paedos" so I tried asking the mods about it. At first I was told that wasn't the reason, so when I responded with a screenshot showing that as the ban message I was muted and reported to the admins because they thought I was the banned user. Every message I received was immature, it's like they've never been in positions of leadership/power before.

       We want to allow and promote free and open discussion - but the OUTSIDE FORCES you mentioned are intent on destroying open discussion by using brigading to manipulate the threads and subvert conversations to serve whatever agenda they may be promoting.

       Yeah, we've been doing that for MONTHS, and we've had several members chime in with ideas. If we had ADMINISTRATIVE tools - or at least their cooperation - we might be able to accomplish this illusive goal, but at the moment, we must do what can with what we have.

       I never accused
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       of banning me, so I find it curious that you're defending yourself from such an accusation. It was another mod who was throwing the most sass and being the least helpful and downright childish. I'm sure you could view his messages as well. That's what I was referring too when I said the moderators should at least be professional about their responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       My ban was lifted, but it took me sending a couple test comments the following morning to discover this. Like someone maybe didn't wanna acknowledge it? I don't know, maybe that's how you guys operate, but it seems like a conspiracy subreddit would want to be more transparent. Maybe I'm mistaken and you require cloak and dagger tactics to moderate a forum set up to root out clock and dagger tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I ever wanted, before I started questioning the moderator's actions, was some darn transparency on why contest mode was enabled. I've speculated it's political, but all we can do is speculate because no mods want to clue anyone in. All we get is vague accusations of brigading and each mod has a different degree to which they believe it's occuring. Official comments from mods become distorted and lost in a sea of unrated, unorganized, and hidden comments in contest mode posts. After contest mode, a flood of "why is this in contest mode?" posts blanket the topic and discussion, actual discussion about the topic, is buried. Spam reigns tall.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we're left to speculate. And then, we get this defensive nonsense from some of you guys. About how tough it is, and how hard you've been working on it for months. Obfuscating the issue by saying we want a hive mind moderator. And
       <em>
        still no answer as to why contest mode is enabled
       </em>
       . No specifics. No comments you can point to and be like, "Yeah, see these here?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But hopefully by the next day, we've moved on to a topic that's approved by whatever group is brigading and they don't attack it so you guys squash the discussion. We'll see what tomorrow brings, I guess.

       It could mean you are doing something right, but I think its more likely people on both sides(and the middle or no side) are mad because you are doing something wrong.

      <p>
       Just read the comments on this thread. Yes the people that also go to rpolitics are mad about contest mode, but it seems like alot of regulars are also. And the people that come from T _D want contest mode because it shuts down critics if their guy.

       Contest mode is not solving problems, it seems to create unneccisary drama.

       ugh magabolt is one of the people spamming contest mode threads, thus statistically increasing the chance that his posts get seen and other posts do not. This is fucking disgusting. We need to be able to vote on mods again, and remove powers from those who are incapable of enforcing the rules consistently and evenly

       No one's asking the mods to agree on everything without discussion, but having what are basically public petty fights between each other is another thing entirely, especially when it affects peoples' ability to participate in discussion on the sub. Not to mention all the unprofessional and downright abusive behavior towards the sub's users.

       Randomizes comments each time you refresh the page and hides all scores. There is no "top" or "best" comment anymore that shows what people agreed with.

       Basically when the points being made is going against the mods agenda they don't want people to see it. They'd rather delete the topic, but know they will get even more shit for doing that so they resort to contest mode to put the brakes on the discussion.

       Archive them at least and save all possible metadata for each screenshot you take. Compile them and release them when you feel you are able to. This kind of behaviour is actually true brigading and I would hope mods here would be interested in this.

       That's what's so interesting here.  They set these things to contest mode when they suspect people are manipulating votes, so logic holds, if you want to set one to contest mode... you manipulate votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you do it off of reddit, like in Discord, then you can claim deniability and protect the origin of the manipulation.  Contest mode solves nothing and has become a tool to defeat discussion.

       Why do you assume I used the same account name?  Even my writting style is different, totally different, enforced by a custom program I wrote to make my writings less grammatically complex and to introduce typing errors which I do not typically make.

       you're more than welcome to tell us which mods

       So what threads are you speaking of in terms of deflection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the martyrs here? What threads were not put into contest mode that should have? I've seen plenty of anti-Trump threads go into contest mode, but as soon as that happens you claim it as a 'pro-Trump' thread because there is an argument and duality exists. As long as there is a response, you can call it either because both are involved. It's not honest.

       Article used the term "included" previously turned over documents, but did not say "only consisted of" previously turned over documents. The pushback talking point is that whatever they got only consisted of stuff they'd just gotten, but the article doesn't claim that.

       a Trump supporter. But I mean what I said about he versus Hillary. At least we know he's a douche, and at least he is causing people to realize how fucked up our government is. Hillary would've continued the usual puppet show behind closed doors so everyone remained clueless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has that shit on front street for all to see, and it's causing even the wooliest of sheep to wake up. This scares the Deep State, the GOP, the DNC .. all of them are terrified that we will all wake up. Hence the mass effort to cause division and anger, and now an effort to start a war with the Norks. And what do they use to cause division? Shills and fear.

       That's not the case at all though. I'm not a shill, and I have a lot of problems with the way contest mode is being used to silence criticism of Trump and the government while ignoring all of the irrelevant crap about the DNC. Feel free to look through my comment history if that helps, though I'm not sure there's anything that would convince you I just feel this way and don't have to be paid to say this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idiotic and pathetic claim that everyone that disagrees with you is a shill is becoming one of the biggest problems on this subreddit - even worse than the brigades from T_D, even worse than the moderators being unashamed about their extreme pro-government biases, even worse than actual shills themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I'm almost completely convinced that every account that keeps repeating that anti-Trump/anti-government people are shills are in fact shills themselves, deliberately conflating the situation and making it difficult to differentiate between the organic users and the Koch brothers bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this means little to people who have been brainwashed by the lies and the divide and conquer tactics of
       <del>
        the MSM
       </del>
       Fox News, and it's hard to tell the difference between an uneducated idiot without coherent language skills, and a poorly programmed bot.

       You have a point. Multiple points, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except personally, I have no problems with differing opinions at all. I welcome those opinions and enjoy good, organic discussion and debate on those opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people I am referring to as "shills" are the ones who no matter what evidence you present, they will constantly deflect. They take over a thread with bots, and comments having only the purpose of division behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what you show them, or say, they will find a way to turn it around and fit their narrative. Yes, there is evidence of shady shit with the Trump administration, which should not go unchecked.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, those crimes do not, at all, negate the crimes of the DNC, Deep State and other members of the GOP. The Deep State are using Trump as a means to get the eyes off of their own crimes. What I have a problem with is mindless sheep acting like Trump and the right are the only crooked mother fuckers in DC.

       As for contest mode; I've been around here awhile. I've seen threads get brigaded and taken over, and I can say that the contest mode is curbing that to an extent. Look at all the jimmies that get rustled when a thread goes contest. That's a clue. "They" don't want votes hidden. Real users of this sub couldn't give a fuck less about votes. All we want is intelligent,

       Right. Except the DNC has no political power and the GOP controls every layer of government. You're yelling at ghosts while real people commit real crimes using the real power they currently wield.

       Once again, I'm a real person not being paid to say this, and I think it's fucking disgusting that self-proclaimed "conspiracy theorists" are okay with censoring anti-government stories in order to protect the feelings of the POTUS and his tiny band of vocal sycophants. Like I said, it's not stories critical of the DNC that get put into contest mode. It's not stories about aliens or JFK. It's only stories critical of Trump and his government.

       By censoring anti-government posts with contest mode or selectively applied rules, and at the same time leaving pro-government propaganda untouched, you're advocating for the opposite of organic discussion. You're advocating for a safe space.

       You go lumping me in as someone who is a Trump homer when I've clearly states the obvious.

       Where did I say I didn't want any investigations done? I do. I just think it's a fucking ignorant train of thought to believe that one side should face the music while the other side doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone who hates the DNC, you seem awfully okay with letting them get away scot-free just so we can bring down our current version of theater.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking the DNC has no power right now is fucking laughable at best. So I go back to what I said; they're
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       crooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       As smart as you are, I'm smarter. I've noted you making sure to repeat that you're a real person. You've also made it a point to make sure we all know you aren't getting paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you've lowkey defended the DNC by basically implying they have no power therefore we shouldn't worry about them. You've assured me multiple times that you're real. And you've made it a point to say you aren't being paid. Now, I have now doubts you're a real person and not a shill, but fuck me, can't you see how that's suspicious?
      </p>
      <p>
       In reading what I did of your reply to me, it appears as though what I said went right over your head. You still try to paint me up as a Trump homer when I said nothing remotely close to what you are saying I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a rule about getting sucked into bullshit pissing contests, which is exactly what you are trying to attain here.

        You go lumping me in as someone who is a Trump homer when I've clearly stated the opposite.

      <p>
       I didn't say you're a Trump supporter and I didn't mean to imply that, because I did see your earlier comment. But you're okay with the fact that people are focusing on the party that's not in power, the party that's been abandoned by their entire voterbase, and that's had a historic and almost unprecedented loss of political power in a single election. You seem okay with the fact that the DNC is getting
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       attention than the GOP despite the GOP controlling the whole government, and despite the GOP historically having been the primary party of war and stealing liberties in the name of 'security'.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For someone who hates the DNC, you seem awfully okay with letting them get away scot-free just so we can bring down our current version of theater.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm definitely not okay with the DNC getting away with anything, but focusing on the DNC while the GOP controls the entire government is literally letting the GOP get away with
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC is not controlling the CIA. The DNC is not in charge of the FBI. The DNC is not giving orders to the military. The DNC is not writing laws and executive orders. Those are all being done by Trump and the GOP right now, and that's much more important than Benghazi bullshit or whatever the latest Fox News distraction from the past is.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In reading what I did of your reply to me, it appears as though what I said went right over your head. You still try to paint me up as a Trump homer when I said nothing remotely close to what you are saying I did.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not what I said and I'm sorry if I implied that. I'm pointing out how you're "lowkey defending Trump" by basically implying that the DNC is equally relevant in politics to Trump and the GOP - the people that literally control the entire US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you don't want to be associated with obsequious Trumpets, but it's hard to dissociate everyone who yells "shill bot!" about anti-government conspiracy theorists when it only ever comes in response to the worst abuses and corruption of Trump/GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, you're either unable to grasp why the
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       powerless DNC doesn't deserve
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       scrutiny than the people controlling the entire government, or you're being disingenuous and deliberately trying to muddy the waters so that a discussion about Trump/GOP corruption can't ever be properly undertaken here. I'd like to believe it's the former because you've given thoughtful and detailed responses, but effectively the result is the same - the GOP and Trump get to fly under the radar while the relatively petty crimes of ousted Democrats are distracting from the GOP's own major and deeply concerning scandals and abuses.

       I think there is a pretty big split in this sub right now. A large chunk of users who view the Trump/Russia story as potentially one of the biggest conspiracies in our lifetime, and another group who views it as a witch hunt. I think the first group is very frustrated with the traction topics like Seth Rich receive and the other group frustrated by the amount of attention Trump/Russia receives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides accuse the other of vote manipulation, but I personally don't buy into that. I think you have almost half a million people subscribing to a sub, half of them agree with one narrative while the other half believes in something diametrically opposed to it. Since both sides are energized, you see a lot of voting activity on  those topics and between the two groups of users.

       It's still small, but we've almost quadrupled in size since I took the sub over a few weeks ago. It's been very fun to watch it grow and it seems to fill a niche people are looking for.

       TBF the Russian investigation hasn't been thoroughly debunked much like Seth Rich/Pizzagate/Hillary etc. It's an ongoing investigation with new
       <strong>
        credible
       </strong>
       information being released on a daily basis. It reserves the right to be called a conspiracy. While the others are as well, there isn't enough credible information. Yes I know this place hates MSM but at least it's verified and not a comment by someone on 4chan.

       Glad I wasn't the only one to catch that... This shit is seriously pissing me off. There are active conspiracy theories about all 3 of those topics and he's sitting here not only saying that they've been debunked, but thoroughly debunked. Get the fuck out of here with that bs!!! I don't care if we talk about Trump / Russia at all but so far I haven't seen anything impressive unlike the other topics he mentioned.

       Because one is actually real. And the other are right wing smear jobs by non credible known liars who edit their videos to push a narrative.

      <p>
       They hacked the DNC  as supported by all our intelligence agencies and our allies. They even did the same thing in Frances recent election. Hacking the only liberal partys emails and releasing them and spreading lies about said emails. They literally used the exact same tactic in another western election a few monthe later.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also hacked voter rOlla and purged voter registrations, while not directly changing votes, de-registering people has to essentially the same effect. We do not yet know the extent of their attempts or damage done as its still being investigated.

       Your allegation here isn't consistent with what France's head of cyber security said two months ago, how do you account for that?

       I'm sorry, how is it misleading? Is the Macron hack not the French election hack to which the other user is referring? I'll admit he made a lot of claims without sources substantiate anything so we may just be talking about different things

       weird how you took one throwaway phrase and tried to derail it, and your source said that "anyone could have done it"
      </p>
      <p>
       that  doesnt exactly exclude the fsb, and we saw the manipulation of russian bots on twitter and the hashtags posted. if you havent seen the evidence yet, id guess its because you want to ignore it and hope others do too

       What throwaway phrase? I'm not following you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The user I replied to stated as a fact that the hacks have been attributed to Russians, and that point was central to the rest of his post. I still don't see how that's consistent with the statement I referenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manipulation of bots on twitter isn't evidence for attribution of the hacks

       sure, its been explained multiple times. the problem is the same accounts who get these explanations keep expressing the same doubt all over the sub in an attempt not to understand, but to muddy the waters and to create the impression that there is a debate, much like the tobacco industry does, and climate deniers, and the sugar industry

       And LMAO at climate deniers. Sorry, but that's some more bullshit. But go ahead and conflate being against some scam derivatives market with being in favor of the tobacco industry. Talk about muddying the waters.

       Yes because north Korea threatening the US for the millionth time is something that the MSM wants to sweep under the rug. If the south Koreans aren't scared we shouldn't be either, when they become scared or familys start getting moved back to the US from bases in Japan and other Asian country's that is when to panic.

       holy shit is this true?

       i KNEW that trans shit was just a distraction. something thats not super important (i know it is very important for some people, but doesnt affect the country as a whole) but stirs up the base and typically dominates the news cycle
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought it would be to distract from the inevitable firing of sessions, but this makes so much sense. he probably thought the news would run with it as soon as it happened.

       I honestly have no idea on a large scale, I'm not a mod and certainly don't plan on ever being one. As far as I'm concerned, I don't look at opinions. You can have whatever opinion you want. It's the way you present it to others and engage in civil discourse to better understand the subject and the people involved in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a person is not capable of having a discussion or debate for the sole purpose of achieving better understanding, I don't really want to talk or be subjected to that person.

       Funny that you get voted down like this and the "why is this thread in contest mode crowd?" get more up votes than you would for posting video evidence of the Queen of England and the Pope breeding reptilian spawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why they use contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I love how these people who want to keep the "Russian Haxxorz" narrative alive are often just fine acting like Seth Rich, DWS, and Hillary are of no further interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       This started happening in about 2005-6 in re 9/11. Just keep up the good fight. I don't know if Trump is worth a damn, but I know most of his enemies in D.C. are not.

       What's amazing is that the VAST MAJORITY of posts in contest mode are about Seth Rich, Wikileaks, Awan Brothers, etc. with only a couple of Trump related topics barely sprinkled in. They are lying to our faces and creating a false-perception about the state of affairs in this sub by word of mouth alone.

       Every single thread put into contest mode by creq was done so by him to make a point. You really should just go read what he said because you don't have a clue what you're talking about.

      <p>
       That leaves only a handful of threads left. 1 of which was an actual contest to find mods.

       Another was set by AssuredlyAThrowaway about banning CNN.

       All you're doing is deflecting with this post. You can't even point to a single thread attacking Hilary in the months that the mod-log tracks threads that was put to contest mode. Meanwhile, there are multiple threads about Trump set to contest mode just in the past few weeks.

       i used to frequent conspiracy looking for, y'know, actual conspiracies (not hurr dur illuminati gangstalking lizard aliums im LITERALLY a prophet), and it seems delusion knows no political bounds. you get leftist nutbags and alt-right edgelords battling it out about which conspiracies are true and why they all involve/don't involve trump. a lot of it stems from the fact that the alt-right and vocal conservatives are particularly aggressive in defending against any perceived slight against God-King Trump, which naturally lends itself to arguments about him springing up out of nowhere.

       You can tell putting threads into contest mode works because of how hard it pisses off the brigaders
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual conspiracy users have no problem taking the extra minute it takes to read through every comment in contest mode. They hate it so much because it puts every comment on equal footing and they can't vote brigade to create a false consensus in this thread.

       You'd have to inject reality into the conversation to have a real conversation. Calling him a liar and a cheat means nothing. Absolutely nothing. Step up your game and be specific. Not personal attacks, not hyperbole. No "may have's" or "could be's" etc. The deep state has nothing outside of what they fabricate. Is he impeached yet? Tick tock. *yawn

        You go lumping me in as someone who is a Trump homer when I've clearly stated the opposite.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn't say you're a Trump supporter and I didn't mean to imply that, because I did see your earlier comment. But you're okay with the fact that people are focusing on the party that's not in power, the party that's been abandoned by their entire voterbase, and that's had a historic and almost unprecedented loss of political power in a single election. You seem okay with the fact that the DNC is getting
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       attention than the GOP despite the GOP controlling the whole government, and despite the GOP historically having been the primary party of war and stealing liberties in the name of 'security'.

       <p>
        For someone who hates the DNC, you seem awfully okay with letting them get away scot-free just so we can bring down our current version of theater.

      <p>
       I'm definitely not okay with the DNC getting away with anything, but focusing on the DNC while the GOP controls the entire government is literally letting the GOP get away with
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       .
      </p>

       The DNC is not controlling the CIA. The DNC is not in charge of the FBI. The DNC is not giving orders to the military. The DNC is not writing laws and executive orders. Those are all being done by Trump and the GOP right now, and that's much more important than Benghazi bullshit or whatever the latest Fox News distraction from the past is.

        In reading what I did of your reply to me, it appears as though what I said went right over your head. You still try to paint me up as a Trump homer when I said nothing remotely close to what you are saying I did.

       That's not what I said and I'm sorry if I implied that. I'm pointing out how you're "lowkey defending Trump" by basically implying that the DNC is equally relevant in politics to Trump and the GOP - the people that literally control the entire US government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you don't want to be associated with obsequious Trumpets, but it's hard to dissociate everyone who yells "shill bot!" about anti-government conspiracy theorists when it only ever comes in response to the worst abuses and corruption of Trump/GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, you're either unable to grasp why the
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       powerless DNC doesn't deserve
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       scrutiny than the people controlling the entire government, or you're being disingenuous and deliberately trying to muddy the waters so that a discussion about Trump/GOP corruption can't ever be properly undertaken here. I'd like to believe it's the former because you've given thoughtful and detailed responses, but effectively the result is the same - the GOP and Trump get to fly under the radar while the relatively petty crimes of ousted Democrats are distracting from the GOP's own major and deeply concerning scandals and abuses.

       You don't want a civil discourse. You've already launched several insults my way and use phrases like
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Reported, blocked. Fucking joke.
       </p>
       <p>
        absolutely pathetic and typical.
       </p>

        I'm pretty sure if I carry the one it might equal you being full of shit.

       This post of yours right here is yet another attempt to gaslight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad that you blocked me. People like you who feign interests in discussions only to try and gaslight and insult people are part of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least now I won't have to deal with you anymore since you blocked me. That's the only good thing to come out of this

       so all use of contest mode is 'controversial'? It's so new its only been used like 15 times. What are you using as a reference regarding its controversial index?

       Did you just put words in my mouth while complaining that I'm putting words in people's mouths? Don't think I ever said this is the only reason they use contest mode did I?
