    <div class="md"><p>I talk about other things as well, even if I mainly talk about Trump/Russia. I&#39;m just tired of seeing people blatantly lying about it or purposely trying to mislead others. Plus, it&#39;s a fun conspiracy to delve into and talk about.</p>

<p>What pisses me off, is people trying to shut down conversations and debate because they don&#39;t like their opinions on things. Instead of talking about the content or the points of the issue, they try to go for personal attacks or insults or do anything possible to try and discredit the other person or bring up completely unrelated issues/topics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had so many users try to rile me up or get me banned just because I talk about Trump/Russia conspiracy a lot. I personally think it&#39;s a collective effort where names are collected on a list, and those people are then targeted by anyone who has access to that list.</p>

<p>I&#39;d agree with you on that, but probably not in the way you meant it (and not directed at you).</p>

<p>For the rest of it, I really disagree with your assessment. I see a rotating group of 10ish users who appear in every thread and almost NEVER talk about the substance but instead whine about how it&#39;s not getting more attention on the board or claiming that everyone is out to get them.</p>

<p>If the substance of the conspiracy was deeper, there&#39;d be more to talk about. At this point it&#39;s not even clear what the fuck the conspiracy is supposed to be.</p>

<p>A list? Really? How are those people &quot;targeted&quot; in any way?</p>

<p>If the substance of the conspiracy was deeper, there&#39;d be more to talk about. At this point it&#39;s not even clear what the fuck the conspiracy is supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s supposed to be, than no offence, then you haven&#39;t really been paying attention.</p>

<p>The gist is that Russia wanted two objectives to be completed:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remove the Maginstky Act.</p></li>
<li><p>Sow political chaos and division through use of shills and trolls in order to spread pro Russian propaganda and to divide us through race, identity, and already existing political divisions.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first priority is already impossible, so they are going to do their best to try and destroy America through actual fake news and propaganda/trolls.</p>

<p>If you want to go into more detail, and how Trump&#39;s campaign is possibly involved, then I will be more than happy to do so as long as remain civil towards each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A list? Really? How are those people &quot;targeted&quot; in any way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve had a few people in comments and private messages talking about either adding me to their list or have removed me from their list (after realizing I&#39;m just a loser with a lot of time instead of being a paid shill)</p>

<p>And there have been times when within a short period of time, multiple users have started attacking me or baiting me into getting banned using multiple accounts to do so. It could have been the same user, but the personalities of the accounts were different, which lead me to believe they were different users.</p>

<p>Of course, these are all theories, and hard to prove of anything, and it&#39;s possible I&#39;m just paranoid. But, I do think there is a &quot;information war&quot; happening right now and I&#39;m just doing my infinitesimal amount of trying to get the truth out there.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I bring up Russian shilling efforts every now and then.</p>

<p>Well yes, seeing as &quot;Russia wants to do X&quot; has nothing to do with the &quot;Trump is a Russian shill!!!&quot; narrative constantly pushed on this sub.</p>

<p>The conspiracy went from Trump being a Russian agent of some sort to &quot;Russia is pushing propaganda to benefit themselves!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s just hard to stay worked up about a conspiracy that constantly moves goalposts while degrading as time goes on.</p>

<p>Well seeing as one party has full-on embraced identity politics in order to disguise the fact that they&#39;re becoming as beholden to their corporate masters as Republicans have always been, I fail to see what this has to do with Trump exactly. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, Republicans are terrible. Trump is mostly terrible. But after spending months mocking conspiracy theories, the general American media has jumped on board this one with all their support, even as the &quot;this is the one!!!&quot; stories keep fading into nothingness.</p>

<p>Have you watched the intelligence hearings? Have you read the official DNI report that was released in January?</p>

<p>Correction. Both parties do it. Democrats try to appeal to minority voters and SJW type issues, and republicans try to appeal to white (mostly evangelical) voters.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just not a serious thing to say. It went from Trump colluding with Russia to...Russia using fake news to influence America. Oh and if anything else pops up (which it hasn&#39;t), that&#39;s totally what we meant the whole time too!</p>

<p>Also, appealing to a base is not the same as embracing identity politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say it in the next sentence of that comment.</p>

<p>I will also add that (not so much on this sub, but on r/politics when I make the mistake of venturing into it), there&#39;s a lot of &quot;well we won&#39;t know what the conspiracy IS until after the investigation - Nixon&#39;s investigation took time!&quot;</p>

<p>It all feels like a general sense of &#39;I know something is fucky even if I can&#39;t explain it&#39; and that&#39;s been powering a lot of the Dem base for a year now. </p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t only hack Clinton or the DNC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government&#39;s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia&#39;s efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.</p>

<p>HURD: Good copy. And do you have a ball park of the number of private sector entities that you have to notify of these types of breaches?</p>

<p>COMEY: Hundreds and thousands. In this particular case we had to notify hundreds, I think maybe more than 1,000 entities that the Russians were hitting at the same time.</p>

<p>HURD: Admiral Rogers, do you have anything to add to that?</p>

<p>ROGERS: No, because as we pass the information to the FBI, what started all this was a pretty massive effort on the part of our Russian counterparts.</p>
