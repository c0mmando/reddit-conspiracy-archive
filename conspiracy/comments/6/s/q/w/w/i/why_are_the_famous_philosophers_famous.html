      <p>
       Now, this one has recently boggled my mind, but I didn't yet know this sub, so I thought I'd try to repeat my idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea, or rather the question, is: Why are famous philosophers famous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that any child on earth knows Diogenes who lived in a barrel and Sokrates who questioned everything (or Plato, whatever, I forgot, sorry)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the obvious answer is: They are famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, but them being known because they are famous is kinda circular reasoning, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, why are they so well-known?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well ... we all hear about them at school.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anybody ever wondered why? Why is it that we always hear about the same bunch of philosophers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this one boggles my mind the most: If schools did not uniformly teach about these select philosophers ... then they would not be famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following me so far?
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, they are famous, because everyone knows them, because everyone is systematically being told about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, they are not famous and well-known because of any inherent quality that they may possess over many others, but because a relative minority of people (school system) chooses to teach precisely about those and kind of make it the equivalent of a "philosophical education" to know about those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, they may have some quality that makes them special. But, that is not why they are famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question arises: Who decided that they ought to be famous?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this question is a tough one. Think about how much written work is produced. How much media, how much communication. Sure, it wasn't that much back then, but I can still imagine it must have been way more than any single person could keep up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, it is / was impossible for any person on earth to have had a total overview of all philosophical work produced, and thus make it impossible for any single person to decide on the "important philosophers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless ... this decision was again not based on quality, but on popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which again devolves into the circular question: What made them famous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who printed their work? Who sponsored them? Who made them well-known in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       And while most of this is speculation, I think that this kinda hints at the concept that this whole philosophy thing was/is much more calculated and well-planned than may appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that their genius has persevered and left behind any other thinkers, but we never even heard of any other thinkers - they weren't famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, what we learn at school is not somehow "representative of philosophy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, it's simply the philosophical equivalent of album charts. A select few get the chance, then the decent get chosen and marketed, and then the populace MAY perhaps decide which one of the offered ones it likes best. Except it's unlikely they had that much choice back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're gonna be more rude ... what if philosophers weren't really individual thinkers?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they were ordered by TPTB to write a very specific kind of philosophy back then, for populace control or similar things. Basically, what we today call propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what happens whenever you question something one of these people said centuries ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then people say "Yeah dude, I'm sure you're much smarter than [Aristoteles/Sokrates/Whoeverthefuck]".
      </p>
      <p>
       People just accept these dudes as some kind of philosophical unquestionable rocks and when you question them, you are immediately silenced .... why, you wouldn't question the genius of those "famous philosophers", right?
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, how do we know they were geniuses, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because everyone shares memes about what they said? Or because we learned about them at school and were told they were geniuses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those people who tell you not to question those guys' genius - do they even have the brains or have they even actually read enough of those guys' work to have any form of reasonable basis to judge those guys' genius?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not. Most people just hear at school "those guys were geniuses and important philosophers" and that's that. No further questions asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you question the geniuses, you must be super arrogant, because it basically means you are calling yourself a genius (which you of course aren't).

       And why did he do that? We learn that he refused to flee because he "believed in the justice system, even if it's wrong". Now, what a great message ... if you're the justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also ... how do we even know he truly existed?

       We don't know if he truly existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if he had fled the justice system then his philosophies would have been easily discredited.  Back in those days people had honor and virtue, they readily died for things they believed in.  We should learn from them.

       Why? "Honor" and "virtue" are also just certain belief systems or "codes of conduct". I don't see how fleeing discredits one.

       Serious question have you ever read some of the great works? People like Descartes, Kant, Whitehead, and Heidegger had detailed books on subjects that exceedingly deep and hard tackle. Many of the famous philosophers are badass because they developed original ideas that changed the course of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one chose for Newton to be famous. He became famous because he developed a mathematical framework for the laws of motion. The profoundness of one's argument, and their ability to communicate it to the world are what makes one a famous philosopher.

       Decarte and Kant were my favorites in college. When I studied Decarte, I finally understood that geometry was the universal language. Kant, don't get me started.

        What if they were ordered by TPTB to write a very specific kind of philosophy back then, for populace control or similar things. Basically, what we today call propaganda?

       Socrates may have never existed, nor Plato nor Aristotle. But there's a reason during the degradation of the Western Sphere "Gender equality" is no more important than philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophy is the foundation of science. Everything in those philosophies can be applied to the real world and used as a BS meter. Have the people who follow conspiracies are natural philosophers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything a framework was left in the open that is lost on 90% of people who study it. If "TPTB" are so powerful and simply want to turn you into a human McDonalds meal it would be done already. There is Natural Law at work or something deeper that creates the dichotomy that exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing in untold conspiracies blindly with the idea that you are a slave is not healthy either. Existentialism will help with this. Hence the term "existential crisis" in the 90s when people went on spiritual paths. Existentialism is built off the original philosophies simply noting the subjectivity of the world, and since objectivity is nearly impossible its up to the person to build their subjective reality.

       I think this is the primary purpose of agents infiltrating conspiracy fora: propagate the myth of your own powerlessness and increase the perceived power of the so-called "powers that be". Unfortunately r/conspiracy is ~90% posts that are either fear porn or downright disinfo; its transformation into this is what led me to my conclusion.

       This assumption is wrong. The quality they possess is the quality of their reason. The thing learning is based on. Hence why schools refer to them.

       Are you familiar with the concept of cultural literacy? The reason that there's a canon, that certain philosophers are famous, is that humans need context to communicate. And it wouldn't be particularly functional to have to rebuild that context with each new generation...so we have the institution of education to pass on/indoctrinate each new generation with the context, the culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people who have spent their lives attempting to answer just the question you've asked, why study some and not others? Especially since technology "shrunk" the world in the 20th century, bringing along the concept of multiculturalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/what-every-american-should-know/397334/">
        This article
       </a>
       is mostly about the interplay between cultural literacy and multiculturalism. The author envisions an American cultural literacy project which could be "an online, crowd-sourced, organic document that never stops changing, whose entries are added or pruned, elevated or demoted, according to the wisdom of the network", a "list of nodes and nested networks. It will be a fractal of associations, which reflects far more than a linear list how our brains work and how we learn and create."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some relevant excerpts from the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1987, a well-regarded professor of English at the University of Virginia named E.D. Hirsch Jr. published a slim volume called Cultural Literacy. Most of the book was an argument—textured and subtle, not overtly polemical—about why nations need a common cultural vocabulary and why public schools should teach it and, indeed, think of their very reason for being as the teaching of that vocabulary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hirsch, a lifelong Democrat who considered himself progressive, believed his enterprise to be in service of social justice and equality. Cultural illiteracy, he argued, is most common among the poor and power-illiterate, and compounds both their poverty and powerlessness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Literacy is not just a matter of decoding the strings of letters that make up words or the meaning of each word in sequence. It is a matter of decoding context: the surrounding matrix of things referred to in the text and things implied by it.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...an education that in the name of progressivism disdains past forms, schema, concepts, figures, and symbols is an education that is in fact anti-progressive and “helps preserve the political and economic status quo.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Literacy in the culture confers power, or at least access to power. Illiteracy, whether willful or unwitting, creates isolation from power.
       </p>

       besides the curriculum of all schools be programed to confirmation of authority and not confrontation, with have his part in this conspiracy, but to speak of philosophers as "famous" or "unquestionable rocks and when you question them" is ridiculous at best, or, at least in any classroom of philosophy, besides some parochial mastubations...
