       President Trump, facing a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, warned the country on Tuesday against any new provocations and issued his own threat of "fire and fury like the world has never seen."
      </p>
      <p>
       "North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,” Trump told reporters from the clubhouse of his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., where he was being briefed separately on the opioid epidemic. “They will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said, they will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments came after a report in the Washington Post on Tuesday citing a U.S. intelligence assessment that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can be affixed to missiles, greatly expanding the country’s range and power.

       The statement was directed at certain people who will understand the code. Although it was posted on FUCKING TWITTER, it was only directed at a tiny few number of operatives who know

       what he meant.

        No, Guam did not threaten to nuke NK and Trump's remarks were directly in response to NK threatening to nuke Guam. Kim doesn't like our airbases there.
Can't rewrite history to fit your anti-trump boner.

       Yes a mod wrote this. Yes, this mod said this after being disproven. His agenda, seeing everything as "anti-trump boner" material is so transparent.

       So what, I was wrong about which threat happened when.  It's a little hard to keep track of with NK since all they do is threaten.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love watching people defend NK now that Trump is against them.  Forget about human rights and totalitarian dictatorships, we gotta be against Trump now.

       In that case, they would attack with conventional weapons. The president has the nuclear launch codes. If the attack is nuclear, he orders exactly that and uses the launch codes. We have been stockpiling conventional weapons and missles in SK for decades. DoD would never mistake your scenario to mean nuclear.

       Words matter, especially on the world stage, and I wished I saved the quotes, but former military generals and intelligence officer have stated that it could only be translated into nuclear weaponry, and I'm sure that's what North Korea is thinking as well. You can take my words with as much as grains of salt as you like, because I don't have evidence or sources to back me up, but it was extremely dangerous and stupid what Trump said and how he said it.

       Uh, they didn't really need to.  The Korean war never ended. The US has been at war with them for 67 years.  That war was/is illegal under both international law and the US constitution.  The US is the only criminal in this situation.

       They don't like it when you remind them that Trump threatened war with NK after he bombed Syria and made a 110 billion dollar weapons deal with Saudi Arabia.

       I don't blame them. I'd also feel really stupid if Trump did all that after his fanboys said all throughout the election that Hillary was a warmonger who wanted to get involved in foreign wars.

       Trump was pressured to act because of "alleged" Darin gas attacks in the Ghouta of Damascus Syria (The exact same situation happening just 3 years earlier.... both times happening when the FSA was gaining ground on SDF and ISIS.  Suspicious, no?)

       SO Trump drops those famous MOABs on northern Syria as a warning to Assad.  Great.  But do you know what he struck?

      <p>
       An empty fucking airbase.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not even the airbase, he struck the runway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning North Korea, I sincerely hope he limits military action to a preventive strategy.  But judging on past presidential reelection war efforts, I hope he's not saving this one in his back pocket for 2020.

       Dont give a fuck which Assad air force base he bombed. He bombed Assads air force base. Look dude, this was even a huge deal to big time Trump supporters. When it happened, the_donald split in half for a couple days between people who were like "what the fuck" and the people who couldn't find it in their heart to criticize him for any reason. Obviously you're in the later camp. That's cool. Keep cheerleading for war.

       Uh, believe me, I was pissed for 3 days straight after that happened.  It wasn't until reports starting coming out of what he bombed and the ramifications of it became clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       He bombed an empty airbase (when a country is at war, you don't have empty airbases.  They likely have a warning...) and even then, bombed a landing strip.  It was repaired in days.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could imagine that since the entire senate and house were clamoring for justice for "those poor children" Trump was pretty much forced to act.  The president is not a dictator, no matter how much Obama convinced people otherwise.

       I agree. Just like Obama was responsible for HIS actions. Plenty of folks argue that Obama was "pressured" into drone strikes and certain moves in the Middle East...I don't give a shit. The buck stops with him. Same with Trump.

       FYI I'm not downvoting you, and again, I agree.

      <p>
       But if we're going to dig into bombings that result in civilian casualties. Do you know how many innocent civilian have died in Syria and Iraq since Trump took office? Over a 1,000. Those deaths come from strikes that, again, the President has authorized.

       MOABs weren't dropped on that airbase, matter of fact, no MOABs were dropped in Syria at all.  I guess you're confusing it with the 1 MOAB that dropped in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Trump had nothing to do with the MOAB mission. They didn't even tell Trump about the mission, which was in planning for months before they dropped it. The head General in Afghanistan has had approval to drop whatever he felt was needed for over a year. He asked for the MOAB months before Obama left office and it just took a while for the bomb to get delivered to Afghanistan.

       It's political Stockholm Syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       After giving up friends, social standing and even family, the ego cannot handle admitting it's wrong. Trump has, and continues to, make complete laughing stocks out of these poor fools. Backtracking on their professed beliefs and lying to themselves and others. All to avoid the massive self esteem hit on an already low self esteem pool.

       I proudly proclaim how ignorant people in southern California are? No sir, YOU project your ignorance and fear with these generalizing statements. We'll see what comes of the Manafort case, but I bet it'll be a big fat fucking nothing burger. Just like the all dumbass nothing burgers before. Don't you ever get tired of being wrong? Are you still clinging to this idea of Trump/Russia collusion LOL what a joke. Please fill me in on all the stuff I've missed in the last 3 months

       lol I honestly don't care at all what you think..

       In a few months you'll be deleting your account and claiming to all your friends that you never really supported Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no dog in this fight, my views change as new evidence is presented.. If Trump was innocent I wouldn't give a shit that he's a Republican..
      </p>
      <p>
       But based on his actions and everything that's come out, he's clearly going down sooner than later.

      <p>
       I'll enjoy being right.. because I closely followed the news.. and you can just lie like you have been all along.

       Yeah man, I'm a hippie from southern California but astonishingly enough, there are more important things then weed. The well being and success of this country come first. Also, Trump has stated several times he'll leave marijuana up to states. There's a half decent bill going to be introduced to legalize at a federal level, first real shot we've had in a couple decades.

       You people are so brainwashed its extremely sad... There are only two types of people on this conspiracy Forum.  There's  the people who  read the WikiLeaks releases themselves over the last year to made up their own minds about what the fuck is going on and to understand today's political climate. Then , there are those who are comfortable being fed information through mainstream media , proven liars and deceivers with no integrity whatsoever owned by all the same interest groups. Wake the fuck up.

       I did the second he announced his picks for his Admin. You run on talking shit about Clinton being in cahoots with Wall St then turn around and surround yourself with Goldman Execs and the former CEO of Exxon? Im not going to let someone piss on my boots and think that its rain you can enjoy that pitcher of koolaid to yourself.

       He's a businessman... he's going to surround himself with businessmen. Not politicians. He ragged on Hillary for being BOUGHT and OWNED by these people. If you would listen to his speeches and when he talks about these people you would understand the perspective. I can relate to your viewpoints and I'm not saying that I agree with or like everything Trump says and does. He was the lesser of two evils... and is a hilarious troll.

       I also agree that he was the lesser of two evils.  However, to me it looks like he's another establishment candidate just like Hillary.  He's doing things that benefit those same people that bought and owned Hillary.  Being the lesser of two evils doesn't make you a good choice.

       I live in Maryland and know plenty. The MidAtlantic Republicans are full of moderates or extreamists that want to be represented by good natured folk. Run down the conservative elected officials here and you are unlikely to find many "rootin tootin Grand Old Party" types. Pennsylvania wasnt won because of the rise of Rural PA and Steel Down going in support. It was won because staunchly Blue Philly suburbs came out in poor numbers, some even flipping considering their Red empathy. This is how places like Pennslyvania can flip back blue and create a major impact.

       Its through 2014 from us.gov sources, fact checked and highlighted by zerohedge. I think the only thing wrong on that is the estimated 14.5 tril in debt by 2018, we're much closer to 20tril... These will be the true test of an economic nationalist president like Trump. In the next 2 years you'll see most of these graphs turn around - foods stamps, home ownership, median family income. FED Debt accumulation will slow, (actually down 100bil+ since trump took office) aside from healthcare costs and fed debt. those graphs will turn. Time will show. As far as directly attributed to Trump? Consumer confidence, job creation, "Bull run" on the stock markets. Here is job growth expectation vs reality since Trump took office.

       Trump made a lot of promises in the run up to the election that I can think of off the top of my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       He encouraged "LOCK HER UP!" chants. Hillary's still free.  Trump could initiate an indictment against her at any time, seeing as how he's the Attorney General's boss. He hasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said he'd repeal the ACA "on day one."  It's been 8 months, it's still around, and Trump said he had no idea health care "could be so complicated."
      </p>
      <p>
       He said he had a plan to defeat ISIS "in 30 days."  Again, 8 months later, they're still around.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "big, beautiful wall" is now going to be see-through and only cover a portion of American's southern border. If it even gets built at all.  That's not making America great again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Muslim ban?  It keeps getting struck down in the courts for being unConstitutional, and they even rolled back the ban on bringing an iPad on the flight from Middle Eastern countries.  Lame!  Weak!
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh my god, there's just so much winning!  Meanwhile, Trump's coasting on the economy created since the crash nine years ago. Remember when everyone questioned those numbers?  Yeah, I do. They're from the same institutions that everyone claimed were "fake" when Obama was president.  Suddenly, the same numbers are magical indicators of Trump's economic prowess.  You're not fooling us.

       Yes Trump says a lot of crazy things - art of the deal. Hillarys time will come. He immediately rescinded the penalty for not purchasing Obamacare and has been pushing for repeal since taking office. ISIS has lost several top leaders and has been very rapidly conceding ground to allied forces. Please take a look at Mad Dogs strategy and the current situation. Surround then annihilate. It was never a MUSLIM ban you ignorant fuck, it was a travel ban targeted at 7 specific countries where there were documented terrorist occupation and activities. Trump has been shattering expectations for job growth and GDP. Paving the way for a massive infrastructure spending bill and breathing life into the manufacturing backbone across the country. BUT PLEASE KEEP PUSHING YOUR NARRATIVE, ITS TOTALLY WORKING

       This is fascinating to watch, since
       <a href="/u/SkyGrl377">
        /u/SkyGrl377

       had previously been a Trump supporter. She posted
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6o7ets/as_a_black_woman_i_wanna_say_fuck/">
        THIS
       </a>
       to T_D 3 weeks ago, which I tagged and marked with her username. Then attempted to delete.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was offered a free (online, I imagine) beer for the post by a user in that post:

       This is interesting, at least to me. I have most of T_D posters tagged, around 25k of them. And I am seeing more and more posts like these, people I have tagged because of their strong Trump Support. But who now are, seemingly, pretending it was never them at all.

       You want a conspiracy? I should share my tagged list. It would stun you to see how many are jumping off the bandwagon these days.

       One possibility is black propaganda. A user can pretend to be on one side, but post a very shitty submission that is easily debunked or makes that side look bad. They may then have forgotten they used that account for the Trump "support," and later post anti-Trump material. I'm not accusing OP of anything because I have not perused their history, but this is a possibility to keep in mind in general.

       This reverse psychology shit is how they got Trump elected. For example the whole pussy grabbing thing made him
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       popular, not less (most people aren't stupid enough to be outraged at something like this, they get mad at the fake outrage). Somehow we're supposed to think political strategists can't poll, and couldn't have predicted this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember the whole July 4 "antisemitic poster" controversy? Nobody in his right mind could think Trump is judeoskeptical; yet Americans were bombarded by the media with the poster (under the guise "look how horrendous it is") which read "Clinton Most Corrupt Candidate Ever" on the very same holiday week-end as Comey saying, in substance, "She's a criminal but she's above the law".

       In more wild world, it could be that these accounts were created to show the illusion of lost support, which is most likely what's happening imo. I do really wonder who is real here and who isn't a bot, for all I know even the original poster of this comment might be a bot.

       So your actual theory is that bots or hired hands are spreading Trump propaganda only to then turn into non supporters only to HOPE Trump does somthing like threaten nuclear war and that niche subreddits connect the dots on usernames.

       Can you tell me how you know differently? It's a perfectly logical theory. On a conspiracy theory board.

       I even said its a theory. I do find it interesting that the accusation is flipped now on me. It confirms several other things I've been watching.

       Well, does there need to be a mention when the facts are looking you in the face? I'm just deducing and probably wrong... I can't repeat how little stock I put into these theories since they're just theories. I have a feeling that'll change soon though.

       Not at all. It's publicly available information that is super easy to acquire and even easier to hide. The tools to do it are available to everyone and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       I post on another forum, with about 30-45 active users, and have for going on a decade now. I know so much truly personal information about everyone there (and likewise, they do of me) and it's purely from memory. Is that creepy? No.

       When participating in a community, the experience is amplified when you behave
       <em>
        like a community
       </em>
       which involves knowing a little bit about the people you're communicating with.

       I tag users with RES all the time. There is nothing creepy about it. However, your attempt to manipulate other people's thoughts and behaviors to conform to your nonsensical control scheme... I wonder what we could call that?

       How so? You can't deny that there is a high percentage of users that come out of T_D to post extremely biased and inflammatory posts. If he is tagging them with things that show that they are these kind of users, it gives him the ability to ignore/not respond to their comments when reading through a thread.

      <p>
       You could call it creepy I suppose. I think it's just an effective way to filter out the noise.

       They're trolls.  T_D is a silly place. It's like a PG rated 4chan dedicated to the president.  It's weird that people take it so seriously.  Tagging and doxxing the posters there just makes it weirder.

       As an avid trump supporter i can tell u that the blind circlejerking and coverup posts (that cover up real news like Hillary)

       Do not represent the majority of us

      <p>
       Its not organic its jighly curated by the mod team
      </p>
      <p>
       Any criticizm of trump or even of anyone mildly related to trump is banned and only circlejerking is allowed
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example: many people hated sessions for a long time but when trump criticized him we were finally allowed to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quickly after he decided to keep him on criticizing sessions bacame banned again

       Many people dont want war (although fire and fury doesnt necessarily refer to nukes)

       I can't think of any major promises, aside from the wall, that he has had to break. The healthcare bill was out of his control, really, but I suppose you could chalk that up to him breaking a promise if that's your thing.

       At least she was able to adjust her views based on new evidence.  People should never be mocked for this.  She should be praised being an adult about it.  No one is right 100% of the time and you tagging her like this will make less people want to openly switch sides.  Only do this if they are flipflopping for karma for sure.

       Oh the irony, you are trying to make fun of their intellect while you don't realize this whole "meme magic" thing isn't something they believe in. They understand the mechanics behind it. You don't think its funny? Sure, I get that, but thinking they believe in that stuff is laughable. They only use it as a way to breed a common culture. You should be able to see the power behind that.

       Except it is, for the most part, settled science and anyone who makes the "well [climate] is historically documented as cyclical" argument to hand wave away anthropogenic climate change is immediately outing themselves as being utterly unfamiliar with the science.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural cyclical changes in the climate aren't magic, they are a result of measurable, physical factors and those factors are simply not sufficient to explain the sudden and sustained increase in global temperatures observed in the last two hundred years. You know what does explain that increase? The massive amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere by human activities beginning with the industrial revolution.
       <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477%281999%29080&amp;lt;2631%3ADAAORC%3E2.0.CO%3B2">
        Even studies in 1999
       </a>
       and further back, relying on what now would be considered fairly primitive models, demonstrate the lack of a solid scientific basis for the notion that global temperature changes are attributable to natural causes. Yet you continue to parrot that belief.

       No. It isn't if it was it wouldn't be "for the most part". By your own admission climate change is a belief. For it to be fact it would have to be "for the whole part".

       Other people arent in on the joke whenever you do something "ironically". Worse yet, some of those people will start mimicing the same behaviour, without ever realizing it was a joke to begin with. Kekistan amd meme magic and talk of God Emperors may have started as jokes, but even if no one actually believes it's true in the literal sense people are sympathetic to the ideas behind the sentiment. Fact of the matter is there are a lot of people now who subconciously believe that Trump can do no wrong, and whatever your stance on politics it's not good to think that anyone is without faults.

       What do we all think was going to happen when we spent years making fun of the NK's leader?  We made Saturday Night Live jokes and segments.  We applauded a movie about how stupid the guy is and constantly say how bad he is etc.  Do you think that someone isn't going to come out fighting when they are attacked?  The American population has ridiculed this reign the same as a bully picks on students within schools.  Own up to you and everyone being the problem and stop placing the blame on one guy.

       Also many people must not realized that Guam is the home of Anderson Airforce base.  Remember all those times we all heard about how important a place called Andersons Airforce base was but many of us assumed it was located in the US?  Surprise. its Guam.

       Of course threatening nuclear war is not a sane response for any reason.  But with someone who is humiliated constantly expect that someone to come out fighting and responding in extreme forms.  As long as people keep making fun of someone there will be little chance for negotiation that can improve the situation.  One cant expect appositive forward result without offering some form of respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that one man (Trump) is not completely responsible for this NK BS.  We the majority of people within the US has spent years making fun of NK's leader's character and we all need to learn to back down.  This man is at the point that he is willing to use a nuclear bomb just to be taken seriously.  Its wise that we change how we talk about him and keep our negative opinions to ourselves  This must be defused..

       Yep. I am not a Trump supporter, but sometimes have synergies with them. I posted in there, a post that could be interpreted "Fuck Trump" but actually was "Fuck Them (meaning the political establishment)" and was instantly banned.  I messaged the mods a couple of times, explained my position, and offered to edit the comment. I got back a reluctant "Okay, but don't do it again" and they rescinded my ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't see that part of the messages, it looks like everyone is rah-rah-rah. What is actually happening is everyone who posts rah-rah-rah is allowed. Anyone who goes against message is banned instantly.

       the blind circlejerking and coverup posts (that cover up real news like Hillary)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not represent the majority of us
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not organic its jighly curated by the mod team
      </p>
      <p>
       Any criticizm of trump or even of anyone mildly related to trump is banned and only circlejerking is allowed
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example: many people hated sessions for a long time but when trump criticized him we were finally allowed to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quickly after he decided to keep him on criticizing sessions bacame banned again
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people dont want war (although fire and fury doesnt necessarily refer to nukes)
      </p>
      <p>
       But  mods only allow duck posts
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: as another reply. Youll find suspicious stuff everywhere
      </p>
      <p>
       If u go to r/esist and tag there top commentors youll find 5 accounts all talking to each other. And eventually getting shafowbanned. Then replaced with 5 new accounts
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps. If u look at it. Trump really needs to get rid of sessions kelly mcmasters etc if he wants to get advice that will actually help the american ppl
      </p>
      <p>
       Hes being duped by the neocons and democrats into abandoning his promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fake news and td is making it impossible for him to see ehat his supporters really want

       Definition of a cult:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others as strange or sinister.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Even if T_D sincerely worshiped the God Emperor, "strange or sinister" are subjective terms...but their echo chamber has created many strange memes. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they get pretty intense at times, to say the least.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or thing.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       100% this. If there was two things that defined T_D, it would be 1.) Cult of Personality (and not the song), and 2.) White Nationalism. I mean, they have taken "Cult of Personality" to extreme, bizarre lengths, and there is nothing rational about them.

       That "different user base" was always present. It's just that the voices of individuals are only sometimes artificially drowned out. Particularly when it comes to Trump's populist promises. I was banned from r/the_donald for arguing in favor of universal healthcare. I linked to articles where Trump himself said we should have universal healthcare in the US, that we'd save money that way, and that the government would pay for it.

       Maybe Trump is just TPTB's way of making us numb to glaring contradictions in leadership.  A way to condition the public to accept doublethink for the sake of defeating a terrifying enemy.  Think of how many contradictions Hillary has made her supporters willing to accept.

       This is honestly the dumbest thing I have ever heard and it keeps getting repeated as if its a line.... You're taking what Trump is saying literally AND assuming he actually means it/plans to do it? When was the last time Trump actually did or meant what he said? He's a stooge with a script. What we need to ask is who is set to make money off of a war with NK.

       The conspiracy in this case would be the subreddit controlling the narrative by censoring dissenters. The conspiracy would be people being paid to post pro-war bullshit even though most legitimate Trump supporters don't want WW3.

       There is a difference between being the aggressor in Syria vs. being the defender in the Pacific. NK's missiles have diverted civilian airliner traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's phraseology was not helpful, however. He should have either entered into missile test treaty negotiations with NK or taken the Reagan approach of unilaterally drawing a line in the ocean. As it is now, Trump matched Kim Jong-un's grade school name calling, and Kim Jong-un upped the ante with a specific and credible threat to launch near Guam. Trump lost that round.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Defending against NK good. Trump's approach fail.

       Standards? What standards? They change all the time! Liberals were once for free speech and have yet to define "Equality" or decide who gets to determine once it it reached! Puhlease!

      <p>
       This is the "ideology" that literally removed God from the platform in 1012 the only standards liberalism has ever had  is its eternal war against its own country, constitution, morals, values, laws and freedoms!

       Actually I think that Kim Jong-in replied with an equal statement when he said he was going to fire four missiles at Guam but this statement was taken as literal as we misunderstand the context.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number four is a VERY bad luck number.  They think of this number as being death, total destruction.  Basically the NK leader was posturing himself the same as Trump did.   'Mess with me and I will reign down fire and fury'.   He used different words to say the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But is important at this time to be very vigilant.

       Do you actually think Trump did not speak after a thorough psychological profile of Kim was presented? You are mistaken. Trump knows what he is doing. Kim is a bully, he is doing to Kim literally exactly what he did to liberalism. Knocking him mentally on his ass where he should be.

       ...Trump wouldn't know how to interpret a psychological profile if it was shoved a foot up his urethra.  Regardless of what you want to believe, that's so far out of his knowledge that you might as well expect him to understand schematics for a jet engine.  The man's not completely retarded, but let's be reasonable.

       None of that takes bring able to comprehend and react to a psychological profile.  Which is a good thing for Trump, because he can't.  He doesn't have the education or experience to do that for himself.  What he has is money to tell someone to do it and then tell him what to do.

       Why are you so defensive of someone who literally couldn't give any fucks about you personally?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you feel the need to speak up for him, because your personal views are being constantly challenged everytime you bring him, or the sub up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have access to the whitehouse and these briefings to make the claims you are making about "do you actually think". If you have to ask that question, don't YOU think it is because you cannot believe their are other people with views different to yours. It certainly would go a long way to explaining why you launched into a tirade at me for being a 'liberal', when I'm the furthest thing from it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're constantly challenged and questioned outside of your space in the T_D, maybe, just maybe, the community you're part of is an echo chamber, the same way as a repub/dem/labour/toryXdup/snp based sub would be?

       The military does psych profiles and presents options to president how to speak with them for projected reactions based on that profile. Wow you love to pretend intelligence while actually speaking the opposite. Let me guess, you're "liberal" right?

       If you don't say the right things, they ban you. Yeah, the mods are in on it. Even if you're supporting your stance with the words of Trump himself, expect to get banned if you go against their narrative. They likely also have some degree of astroturf pushing the pro-war message too, but the pro-Trump astroturf is basically impossible for me to distinguish from legitimate supporters due to the tone they employ. On the flipside, it's usually pretty easy to tell when someone who is pro-Democrat are clearly bad actors because they can't hide behind "meme magic" or whatever.

       You must not have dissented in the "right" way or maybe you've just slipped under the radar for now. I was super active during the primaries, but although I was only able to slip under the radar for a few months, they got me eventually shortly before the primaries ended (and the shill mods shut down the sub altogether). For me, they accused me of "fearmongering" because I talked about the fraud that was being committed against the Sanders campaign and backed up my claims with links to credible news outlets. I also made it clear that Clinton was wholly unacceptable to me and that I'd be voting Green in the general if I couldn't vote for Bernie, so that might have done it too. A ton of people at r/wayofthebern have also been banned under similar circumstances, so I know it's not just me.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The two sides are not the same", true, but that doesn't mean that both don't employ bans to censor dissenters. Also, although Trump supporters are frequently hate-filled and although Trump himself supports hateful policies, r/the_donald is not a "hate sub". The only things they hate on there are corruption, criminality, and Democrats. The users might be bigots and Trump himself is one without a doubt, but that sub is careful to not allow it. Obviously for public relations reasons, but even so, it's not a "hate sub".

       Don;t be disruptive and you won;t get banned. I was banned my first post on Politics, didn't even say anything at all bad when I asked why the official response was I had more than 70% of my karma in T_D, I was banned from politicalhumor for being conservative no reason given just this week, I have been banned from probably 100 subs even fucking HISTORY just because I am a member of conservative subs so shut the fuck up, if you get banned from T_D you're being an idiot, no other reason.

       I'll admit I'm not a Trump supporter, so technically that's against their rules, but I have literally never said anything negative about him anywhere on Reddit (except for a single comment which was a blatant joke, in another subreddit) or been at all disruptive. I even messaged the mods about it, and never got a reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other people have been banned from the sub for other completely stupid reasons, they seem about as ban happy as all the other political subs, just shilling for a different side.

       He didn't deflect, he added. You're the one deflecting his addition to the conversation by ignoring the content of his post and claiming whataboutism. Instead of contributing to the discussion or even having one at all, you just shut it down entirely by calling it an -ism.

       Yup, The_Donald definitely needs to rethink their support for this. Maybe ask them WWHRCD? What I think is interesting is that you can always tell what TPTB want when the media agrees with The Donald. Just so happens to always involve wars. Funny that.

       I agree with you. It's the same thing. Worshiping celebrities or politicians, believing they will be the answer to all your problems. It always leads to disappointment, or outright denial.

      <p>

       We'll always dream of our supermen/superwoman flying to save us. The closer you look at politics the more you want to believe it could happen. The sleazebag circus in Washington is so toxic and nasty who wouldn't hope for someone to sweep in and displace the lot of them?

       It's saber ratteling. N.Korea is a fucked up regime and they are talking about nukeing the U.S.
That's very different from unprovoked wars in the middle east and naturaly Trump and America will demonstrate to Kim that if he starts shit he will be the one that ends in a ball of fire.
That is actualy healthy, because if Kim gets that fact through his head he would 'bend the knee' and scrap his nuclear missile program. He has become used to years of toothless politicians and become emboldened.
The best way to prevent a war is to make Kim understand or at least believe the U.S is now perfectly willing and even eager to hammer him.

       Wait, so what's the correct response to NK?  Same shit since the 1990s?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't the definition of insanity trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result?

       Have you been to Korea?  Talked to people there?  You have a population that wants to embrace the future with a madman to the north who basically funds his country through three activities: opium production, counterfeiting currency and blackmail.

       Trump, love him or hate him, just told Kim Jung Un to go fuck himself.  America will not be shipping millions (NK must be so jealous of Iran's billions) ever again.

       What is likely going to happen in NK is the UN sanctions will lead to massive starvation this winter.

       Only if you're talking about genocide.  We've just spent almost 20 years proving that drone strike and air-based actions aren't capable of maintaining a hold on enemy territory.  We also don't have a great track record with land wars in far east asia.

       Yes, when the enemy are religious fanatics.  NK is entirely run on the fear of having yourself and your entire family sent to a work camp.

       China could end NK in 5 minutes.  They won't because at the highest levels of the Chinese government they want to totally destroy the US.

       Destroying America's manufacturing base, destroying our steel industry, having massive trade imbalances with massive debt payments, corporate and government espionage, proxy via NK.  China is at war with the US but we are too goddamn stupid to realize it.

       You use Cuba as an example, but I think it works better for me: by refraining from entering direct combat over Cuba, we might have sidestepped WW3 or complete thermonuclear apocalypse (and yes, there were enough nukes at the time to leave nothing but the roaches).  It's a big reason why we
       <em>
        should not
       </em>
       initiate anything with NK.  Likely scenario at that point is China claims a stray rocket hit them and they enter the war in force.  Everyone gets fucked.

       You know what funny to me.  When I talk to people who are "into politics" I always try to shift the conversation to Sports.  Because most college educated people think Sports are a way the Elite control the dumb, beer guzzling masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they fail to see is the two party system in America is a way for the Elite to control the masses.  Literally the same thing- An illusion of choice.

      <p>
       I don't care about Dems vs Republicans, because it's about as important as who will win the next Super Bowl.  Wake up.

       I was applauding him for not continue the absurd policy of meeting with NK and giving them millions of dollars for empty promises.

       Anyway, why do you think McCain and other senior republicans hate Trump?  Have you noticed that nearly all dems and republicans hate Trump?

      <p>
       Just to be clear though, if you agree with one thing a person says you agree with them 100%.  Is that your viewpoint?  All or none?

       No, I trust my eyes.  Lots of past NK launches have exploded at launch or shortly after.  Lately they've been doing pretty well.

       And to be perfectly clear- I'm for Kim being taken out with a surgical drone strike.  Not at all for a conventional war with NK.

       If it was as simple as assassination, it wouldve been done by now. You'd realize that if you actually had a solid grasp of global politics.

       I do not know of any American person who supports Kim Jong Un, regardless of their political leanings. Some people disagree with Trump's inflated rhetoric threatening DPRK because they think it threatens national security. Other people may want to avoid war because of the tremendous losses of life it would entail, and are therefore wanting tougher economic sanctions and more diplomacy. But I have heard not one news article, editorial, etc. actually supporting KJU.

       The left does.  N Korea thretened to nuke America.  President Trump retaliated.  The left are attacking it's own President instead of the dictator of N Korea.  The only way to truly make America safe is to destroy the left.

       NK will never nuke the US. The leadership knows that's a death wish. They are trying to use it as a bargaining chip like all the threats before. I'd fully support Trump using sanctions and other means to discourage this, but I would not support him attacking NK first. Being critical of Trump does not equal being supportable of NK.

       Apparently being a strong leader means Trump wants war. This sub has gone so far down the shitter.  That post about Trump's tweets about transgenders being banned from military service being a distraction for the Manafort FBI raid is borderline retarded. So Trump tweeted a few weeks ago to distract from a story that came out yesterday? I call B.S.  That makes zero sense.

       They've proven pretty easy to deal with diplomatically in the past. IIRC the standard protocol was they'd saber rattle, we'd give them some rice, they'd shut up for a while, and the cycle would repeat. IMO that beats nuclear war.

       First, Missles go into the air and take quite some time to go down. Second, every nuclear nation has contingencies to fire is struck so you have to destroy every site with perfection. Third, I bet China will at least put out a strongly worded statement though I suspect a little more than that. In the end, you generally dont shrug off the idea of "ahhh well only San Deigo and Hawaii blew up."

       any idea how close any of NK's major cities are to the border? Wouldn't dropping a bomb less than 100 miles from your own population be detrimental to yourself? Or do they just not give a fuck?

       There's one smallish NK city, Kaesong (pop. near 200k), near the border closest to Seoul but Pyongyang is much further north. I'm not sure how wide-ranging the bomb effects would be or how strong the radiation would effect Kaesong but if the US attacked they'd have a lot more to worry about than radiation in one city, I doubt it'd stay their hand.

       People like a show of power and to feel like their country is in charge. "Fire and fury" doesn't have to mean nuclear at all. It looks like war was coming no matter who was elected. It seems this was all planned 10 years ago. It is being pushed now by Congress, not Trump. I think a veto-proof sanctions bill that nearly doubles as a declaration of war would be just as veto-proof for Hillary.

       Trump is going to look bad if:

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         NK actually lands a nuke on NATO forces
        </p>

       <li>

         Trump nukes NK before they launch an overt attack

       <li>
        <p>
         Trump orders a more surgical strike, and likely sparks all sorts of power-plays.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If scenario 1 happens, then 2 or 3 happen too. If scenario 2 or 3 happens, he likely sparks an even greater refugee crisis.

       I think the fair thing to do, is divorce yourself from your knowledge of Trump as president, and consider the dilemma objectively. What the fuck would you do in his position? As someone entrusted with the lives of his people, I'd probably have nuked NK already.

       Nah I voted Trump to make sure all thats left in Washington after 2024 is a smoking crater. And please don't act like Trump is the aggressor here lol, he's just responding to Kim Jung Lunatic the only way he knows how. We've been waiting to invade North Korea ever since we found out what lies beneath.

       Trump has time and time again spoken on the dangers of nuclear war. Throughout all his years. No way will he ever launch the nukes. Bomb the living hell outta the eatablishment, that isnt so off the table, and would not have happened had Obama had a tougher stance on NK. I firmly believe a big part of way trump ran was so he could keep the nukes out of the puppeters hands.

       connect the dots you fucking idiot. Trump has been talking about building our nuclear arsenal since 1999. He has an itchy trigger finger and NK is in his sights.

       you clearly have not been paying attention. never in a million fucking years would trump nuke NK where the fuck to you guys pull this shit from. What about China? Russia? Both would be affected by a nuke. Most likely Alaska as well. Not to mention the retaliations.. Are you aware that NK is surrounded by missile defense systems? More spesifically USM THAADs, no way in a million year would a nuke from NK ever hit anything but NK. Its to dumb to even phantom. Get real, you guys are supposed to be investigative.

       I think the Syrian missile strike weeded out the ones who don't want war. They left after that event because it was a sign that Trump was just another neocon. So now, you've got the people who just love Trump and are enjoying the show.

       Hillary wanted to go to war with RUSSIA over a pipeline in Syria.  Russia was not threatening to nuke the United States. Trump supporters were against an economic war that would cost many their lives to line the pockets of the few.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea is run by an insane dictator who directly threatened the United States. Trump responded to that threat with a warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is lazy and ridiculous to compare two completely different hypothetical wars with two completely different countries and then claim to have proven that Trump supporters are blind idiots/hypocrites.

       That you think Trump is in the wrong for responding WITH WORDS to North Korea speaks volumes about you. Did you suddenly forget that North Korea threatened to attack the United States because of sanctions placed on them by the United Nations, and Trump was responding to that threat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was just supposed to sit back and let a little midget dictator threaten us, though. And if you truly believe Trump's comment will have any effect on whether NK attacks us or not, you're a moron.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea is not your standard little nation. It's not a matter of
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       they attack, but
       <em>

       As if we're even on the brink of nuclear war. If NK were to launch a nuke actually targeting someone there country would cease to exist with the hour. KJU knows this, which is why they've always been about threats, not action.

       If North Korea attacks Guam with a Nuclear Warhead would you not want us to respond.  I consider myself a  liberal and I did not vote for Trump, but also recognize thsa he rest of the world doesn’t play by our idealistic rules and maybe you need to step outside of your bubble.   Sometimes you have to just swing and ask if your me wrong well at least you’re still alive.  Keep in mind that N Korea has been threatening to attack us and here leader is literally insane and forces everyone to treat him like a god.  if they aren’t willing to overthrow their own psycho leader they must not have too much of an issue.  They are a problem, and you can’t just ignore the situation.

       You're either ignorant of the situation or are purposefully misrepresenting what happened.

       Trump was pressured to act because of "alleged" Darin gas attacks in the Ghouta of Damascus Syria (The exact same situation happening just 3 years earlier.... both times happening when the FSA was gaining ground on SDF and ISIS.  Suspicious, no?)
      </p>
      <p>
       SO Trump drops those famous MOABs on northern Syria as a warning to Assad.  Great.  But do you know what he struck?
      </p>
      <p>
       An empty fucking airbase.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not even the airbase, he struck the runway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning North Korea, I sincerely hope he limits military action to a preventive strategy.  But judging on past presidential reelection war efforts, I hope he's not saving this one in his back pocket for 2020.

       ah man Trumps doing such a horrible job with record breaking stock market, record low unemployment, absolutely shattering peoples expectations of job growth and GDP @ nearly 5% since he took office. Sooo twisted, what a bummer.

       Well, does there need to be a mention when the facts are looking you in the face? I'm just deducing and probably wrong... I can't repeat how little stock I put into these theories since they're just theories. I have a feeling that'll change soon though.

       No. It isn't if it was it wouldn't be "for the most part". By your own admission climate change is a belief. For it to be fact it would have to be "for the whole part".

       Liberalism is a marxist cult of belief, and climate change is a play for control of industry just like Karl Marx wrote in his manifesto.
