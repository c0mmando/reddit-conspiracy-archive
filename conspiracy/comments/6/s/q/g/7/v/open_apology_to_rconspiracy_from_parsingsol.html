        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>I attempted to crowd source here to build my advanced seismic prediction software.</strong> </p>

<p><em>(Since then)</em> I&#39;ve been stalked on my social networks, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6s6o42/65_70_earthquake_5_day_warning_new_zealand/dlan1f3/">harassed by multiple users</a>; Having <em>at this time</em> been labeled a &#39;scammer&#39; whom is <em>&quot;only wanting money for bitcoin&quot;-</em></p>

<p>There are actually threads outlining my efforts as such:
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sjbyx/basically_everything_ive_been_up_too/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sjbyx/basically_everything_ive_been_up_too/</a></p>

<p>My response is this thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sjbyx/basically_everything_ive_been_up_too/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit">&quot;Everything I&#39;ve been uo too&quot;</a></p>

<p>So I apologise for my attempt. If that offended you I do factually and personally / officially apologise...</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty broke and in debt. My gf just moved half way across america and I want to marry her.(<em>yes, truthfully</em>)...</p>

<p>I want to own a simple tiny home (like any bloke) and marry the girl! settling down; Working full time on this project into its completion; hoping to improve the world; and potentially/ someday maybe it could&#39;ve ended up leading to saving the lives of others? <em>who knows</em>...</p>

<p><strong>My intent was not to misuse the funds &#39;on bitcoin&#39;-</strong></p>

<p><em>Nor was my goal to spend an intolerable amount on my own self interests...</em></p>

<p>I just wanted to approach this from a more professional standing, by integrating paid users whom provided a level of professionalism necessary to vet the projects completion with a trustworthy result, and minimal complication. While indeed attempting my best at getting the girl...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6sjbyx/basically_everything_ive_been_up_too/">If you believe in this project, you have my permission to take it and make it-</a></p>

<p>I am happy to help you!!! By maintaining myself an advocate and working along side you as a consultant; to help you grasp any areas it may lack in its &#39;feasibility&#39;. </p>

<p>My terminology is not professional. Many terms if not processes are likely to be written poorly; </p>

<p>Yet the bottom line is that: <strong>The project does stand reason to produce a result in the end-</strong></p>

<p><em>One which may be more accurate then any one of us could imagine.</em></p>

<p>To me that is all dthe more reason why I ever stuck around in the first place...</p>

<p>I tried to move it forward under the suggestion of others-</p>

<p>I tried meeting with strangers, and dedicating all the time I could to elaborating the concept to others. </p>

<p><strong>Because I do believe it would work,</strong> and is <strong>beneficial in its erection...</strong></p>

<p>*(I&#39;ve even theorized methods to prove its validity). *</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a chemist, or a programmer, nor a genius-
Ive never claimed to be one-</p>

<p>Im literally just a poor dude with an idea I felt was fairly clever...</p>

<p>Ive done my best to help users all year; from earthquakes, to market crashes and amateur investing advice;</p>

<p>Ive really tried to help you all by being a caring and compassionate / dedicated user... </p>

<p>So I apologize again for the crowd sourcing campaign-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s certainly on the right track! However he is far too keen to make this theory &#39;his&#39;. There are published papers on earthquake prediction using solar observation with working models to explain the mechanisms behind the interactions. The same guy who wrote those papers has also published a working Earthquake prediction app following on from many successful predictions (all easily available online, in the app or in one of his published papers).
I would be far more keen to support ParsingSol if he hadn&#39;t decided to disregard this researcher and do it alone. Ben Davidson, the researcher in question, is years ahead of ParsingSol on his venture to understand the Earth/Sun connection and use it to help humanity. I cannot think of any reason to begin from scratch instead of building upon Ben&#39;s work unless he&#39;s just in it for the recognition/fame. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to agree with you but previous conversations with ParsingSol have made me doubt his motivations. ParsingSol has disregarded the work of another solar researcher who has actually published a working model to explain how Earthquakes can be caused by solar interactions. This researcher has done everything ParsingSol has failed to do- He has a working, explainable model. he has a prediction method that is nearly automated. He has a lot of statistical evidence to prove the accuracy of his predictions and he has also published an app that predicts earthquakes and other solar related phenomena. 
Literally everything ParsingSol wants to do with the £600,000 he wishes to crowd fund, has already been done. And if he is half the solar researcher he claims to be then he damn well knows it&#39;s been done already. He certainly knows of the researcher, Ben Davidson, and his work and somewhere along decided to discount and ignore this trove of information, opting instead to make his own theory up and try to make his own app. 
I&#39;m not sure if he is a deliberate scammer but as a long time solar researcher myself I am not convinced at all. He can barely explain his model, fails to make accurate predictions, fails to record his prediction stats at all and is asking for a stupid sum of money to make his app. 
The reason Ben Davidson managed to crowd fund his app in just days is because he had all these things ParsingSol lacks (namely a working models and prediction statistics). For anybody who is interested in the Earth Sun connection (because ParsingSol is absolutely right that there is one), take a look at the Suspicious0bserver youtube channel, Quakewatch.net or Spaceweathernews.com. Everything that is lacking in ParsingSols research can be found on these sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure?</p>

<p>Even the current test is hypothetical... We could guage it in two categories. First intensity, my scaling using solar data placed us at a 6.5 (due to a brief topping of 750km/s with a 700 firm reading. </p>

<p>Since posting a 6.5 and a 6.3 have struck earth. </p>

<p>I only preaume a location based on past sequences. Its full on probability with a high low system. Areas with more activity take higher account yet dormant areas lacking their standard activity are also likely to match a sequence due to expectancy. </p>

<p><em>Do we argue I am wrong to assess solar data when it compliments the expected range of magnitude?</em>
(per the area bing a missed location). </p>

<p>Factually the area choosen is a choice made by myself after 6 years of basically following seismic events. I basically just pop into a usgs every hour then go. Hmm new zealands lacking. Im expecting a range that comliments it. Indonesia looks up to speed. Maybe warn new zealand? </p>

<p>That isn&#39;t my intended location algorithm. The algorithm I&#39;d like to create would compare the factual incident to the accurate data in real time.  Then cross assess it to relevant past seismic events. (maybe 10- 20 years seismic solar incidents). With up to a billion frames of imagery which will match the live data. </p>

<p>Im literally just a guy attempting to do what I presume a computer will. </p>

<p>The part that interests me is how consistent it delivers. 
The magnitude range assessment is likely the key to the locating of seismic events. Its a cause and effect system in my opinion. </p>

<p>I am viewing seismic episodes like piano notes passing after a hammer pounds a harp string. Each following series of events taking after a solar incident in a unique pattern i.e. A C B. </p>

<p>I assess that the past recording of A C B. Is relevant to a future recording of live data. That goes on to say when we see a similar solar incident that weve recorded a similar solar incident, that the cordinating sequence of A C B may again be produced in the seismic data. This giving us an opportunity of an adequate warning. </p>

<p>I feel by backtracking the largest to the smallest seismic events. Then copying the previous solar data that corresponded to its sequencing. We can image the data and create an operable platform which then could be switched to a live stream. (voa solar data). This giving us a device to warn users of a potential match in past achived data. </p>

<p>It seems much more effective then what I deliver. Although my results prove to many to be compelling enough to show a correlation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The archived data will ultimately determine the practical value of my work.</p>

<p>My &#39;assessing events&#39; is not a valid priority in terms of what I am attempting to do and I feel that its contrary to what I wish to accomplish. </p>

<p>Users are more then welcome to maintain their own diagnostics, on my past history as a user here. 
I imagine anyone that cares in any extent (that matters to my moving forward via the project) would make their own at their own disgression. As a third ,or second party would be the only real trust-worthy source to demonstrate such a request in my mind...</p>

<p>Its also ironic the same users that labeled me a &#39;scam artist&#39; are typically the same users that demand myself do an introspective report on my user history... </p>

<p>What good would a report be from myself if thats the reality they believe in, in the first place? Obviously it&#39;s not; But its just as obvious that im not interested in creating a tool that ultimately leaves my project more vulnderable in the first place. </p>

<p>So Please feel free to create your own at your own accord. 
I just prefer to be forward minded...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me &#39;convincing&#39; anyone to make a contribution they &#39;aren&#39;t&#39; likely to make at their own accord is fraud.</p>

<p>My impression is 600k is not a vast fortune in this day and age. Any user that saw it as a &#39;significant&#39; cost. Fails to assess the complications this project must overcome; in light of: staffing, drafting, and developing a working system; <em>&quot;which meets the specifications of a reputable purchaser&quot;</em>. </p>

<p>The usgs just approved a 13 million dollar benefit to national colleges to improve a 1 minute warning system. 
Which costs millions to install in itself...</p>

<p>The system detects the very signal that I feel I am attempting to locate potentially 5 days in advance. <em>Should I be found successful</em>; I&#39;d literally be single handedly and forever changing the fields of both seismology and heliophysics as they stand. </p>

<p>My intent will always be to be myself- <em>to speak with the dialect, tone, and reasoning I am most comfortable with</em>. 
 While doing my best to elaborate the very complex goals I am attempting to accomplish. </p>

<p>Factually, i&#39;m doing this right. I couldn&#39;t begin to woth the foundation I have, even if I wanted too...</p>

<p><em>But I am doing it all the same</em>-</p>

<p>So thats why I hope users would have made a contribution in the first place. Not because im likely to succeed. But because there are very little things worth dedicating our time, money and efforts into. 
I&#39;d rather die having tried to do what I felt was ultimately important, pure, and wild with my life. 
Then ever having spent a dull moment wondering how close I&#39;d have came in the first place. </p>

<p>I admire your considerations, time, efforts, help, and concern. 
I am just in no position to meet the expectations you have.
(I wish I could). But it detracts from the direction and path I&#39;ve choosen for myself &amp; so, While it may ultimately hold my progress back. The strives I make in spite of the free&#39;d time, ultimately acts as a counter ballast as I direct my sails to the wind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s ok with me, and really quite understandable...</p>

<p>My impression is i&#39;ve been here a year. Every post Ive ever made from either account I utilized is exactly that: &quot;(basic evidence)&quot;. </p>

<p>Your factually talking to me based on my reputation and efforts; if those efforts have not impressed you, then you have no reason to contribute to this project in the first place. I am not the type of person to talk you /or someone else into doing something that you/they &#39;wouldn&#39;t&#39; do in the first place? Do you assume I deserve anything for the efforts I have already put forth? </p>

<p>If not. Thats always been your answer...</p>

<p>Your either on one side, or the other. If your on the fence, then stick around. The only foolish decision is contributing to something, or someone that intends to waste your time.  </p>

<p><em>Time being the most important thing in our lifetimes.</em></p>

<p>I am trying to fully make the best of my time. Please save your money and make the most of what you can in your own time. To me thats 100% a ok. </p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts time and consideration...</p>

<p>I just find it contrary to assume anything else id provide you would lead to you making a decision for yourself. That&#39;s in my opinion a foolish way to go about this. Which would ultimately leave you vulnderable to factual &#39;scammers&#39;. Whom may attempt to show a false data set which promotes them more heavily. (think car salesmen)...</p>

<p>If you wish to make decisions like these in the future...</p>

<p>My advice is: Its your investment, and responsibility to guage the system and its benefits. As well as generating the reasoning to commit to it. That&#39;s never been &#39;my&#39; obligation. Its merely my hope that others see the good in what I had attempted, or wish to help someone attempting something like this with their &#39;lifetime&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, seismology isn&#39;t really of particular interest to me, and I haven&#39;t paid close attention.  I looked back through some of your posts, and from a bit of casual research it looks to me like tour accuracy isn&#39;t much better than just guessing would be, but without tabulated data it&#39;s hard to judge accurately.  </p>

<p>In any case, what you&#39;re essentially doing is asking for a business loan that you&#39;ll never pay back.  If I went to the bank with your approach they would laugh me out of the room.  What you&#39;re doing could certainly be useful if there&#39;s actually something to it, but how can you expect people to judge if you refuse to provide data?  Half the community seems to think you&#39;re a scam artist, and the other half think you&#39;re a genius.  Me?  I don&#39;t know, because your business proposal is a shambles.  Anyway, good luck.</p>

<p>Give up your drive to make it into a professional system, and just focus on what is important - your GF and happiness.  Let this mission be a hobby.  Refine and perfect it.  Teach some of us to help you, to bounce ideas off of, to tell you when your logic makes sense or doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You might notice, this has been up for 4 hours now in the middle of the night and there are no haters.  Guessing the hate will kick in around 9am EST.</p>

<p>You are one of my favorite posters here, just because you care about others and devote yourself to help them for no good reason other than it is your nature.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t apologize for helping others, brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question to you- Why should I back your venture when there is another who has already achieved what you wish to do?
Ben Davidson has a published working model allowing accurate 
 Earthquake predictions based upon Solar observation, complete with statistical verification of previous predictions that have come true. He has already crowdfunded, created and published a disaster prediction app that is nearly fully automated and it&#39;s available for a couple of £ with no additional cost.</p>

<p>Why should I give you money so you can attempt the same thing but without the benefit of Ben Davidson&#39;s extra knowledge, experience and connections?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I want to support you but it just seems like a huge waste.
Instead of trying to go at it all alone, creating your own theory as you go along, build upon the work that has been done already! Ben&#39;s model works- it predicts earthquakes! And he can prove it! Which are two things that you really seem to be struggling with atm.</p>

I just feel differently, and I feel you&#39;ve given too much credit to his model; but thats my opinion/s.</p>

<p>To me he merely offers a text message repeater. His app isn&#39;t proven, and may ultimately be replaced by the very programming I am suggesting others take notice of. </p>

<p>My system is a fully hypothetical computatuonal model. Its probability engine alone would be an achievement in itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I give him a lot of credit its because i believe he deserves it. I have been following his channel for years and he has become my go to for space related news and debunking. The reason he is my go to is because he has been consistently making predictions, often different from those that NASA, NOAA and USGS etc make, and has consistently been right. Even without considering the Earthquake/Sun connections he has proven without a doubt to be an expert within his field. He routinely predicts CME, solar wind intensity surges and coronal hole impacts with a higher accuracy than the government funded agencies tasked with monitoring these events. 
As for the App not being proven, just download it and see for your self. It&#39;s a couple of quid for a life time of spaceweather alerts and you will be able to judge for yourself whether his prediction method works. 
Like you said, you just &#39;feel&#39; differently about Bens work with no factual basis to support your opinion. This will give you the information to create an educated opinion on his work. And if he is, like I say, further along the path of solar observing than you are then you could perhaps learn something.
Anyway, I do think you are doing excellent work regardless. However you approach this massive topic, as long as you do so with an open mind and try to educate people on the significance of the solar/terrestrial connection, then I believe you&#39;re doing good. You&#39;re obviously passionate which is great and if I&#39;ve been blunt it&#39;s just because i&#39;d like to see you succeed. It just so happens, as is common on the internet, we have differing opinions on how you&#39;d best do so. Anyway do keep it up but please take the time to at the very least learn enough about ben&#39;s work so that you can either accept or disregard it from a more informed perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/ParsingSol">/u/ParsingSol</a> what is your opinion on the recent earthquakes in Yellowstone? Around 1400 to 1600 within one week of each other. There is also this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6t40p7/earthquake_removed_from_usgs_yellowstone_map/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6t40p7/earthquake_removed_from_usgs_yellowstone_map/</a></p>

<p>Do you think Yellowstone has any potential to blow? Are /they/ going to make it blow? So many things are happening right now. What are your feelings for the near future within the next 2 months? We have the eclipse, Sept 23, North Korea, suspicious Yellowstone activity, and probably more. </p>
