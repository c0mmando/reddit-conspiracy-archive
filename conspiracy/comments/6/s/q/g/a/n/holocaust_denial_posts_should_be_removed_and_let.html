        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Holocaust denial violates rules 1 and 4 fairly clearly. The only motive anyone would have for claiming otherwise is antisemitism, period. And r/conspiracy should not be a place to peddle hate. That said, a cursory examination of most any comments section clearly shows that mods aren&#39;t currently enforcing their own rules right now in regards to bigoted slurs, so I suspect this&#39;ll be deleted and I will be be banned.</p>

<p>May I point out at this juncture the clear irony of rule 10, considering this is inherently a place where one would expect to be  questioning authority and convention?</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t follow your logic, Hitler&#39;s bad history isn&#39;t irreconcilably connected to Holocaust denial. Nowhere did I say we shouldn&#39;t talk about Hitler. Denying his attempts to achieve his genocidal goals, which I think is fair to say far more well known and documented than ideations of Atlantean peoples, IS hateful, fringe ideas about a  lost continent are not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to, but it puts it into context, and just like the way that people no longer refer to the Novemberpogrome as Kristallnacht, it shouldn&#39;t be the aggressors who get to chose the diction, it should be the victim. Rapists can speak all they want about how they view their crimes, but they don&#39;t ultimately get to define their terms, it&#39;s the victims experience and interpretation that&#39;s important in terms of justice and reconciliation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont know where you live but here it´s still know as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;</p>

<p>and your comparison was idiotic, and i dont know why in the hell Jews,gypsy&#39;s and all the other nationalities that was &quot;Holocausted&quot;  would describe what they went trough as a &quot; sacrificial offering which was burnt completely on an altar.&quot;</p>

<p>just to be clear, google says its an &quot;a Jewish sacrificial offering which was burnt completely on an altar&quot;</p>

<p>but there are other sources that say its an Greek &quot;sacrificial offering which was burnt completely on an altar&quot;</p>

<p>my best guess to who was really behind this kind of stuff would be the predecessors to the masons, the mystery schools</p>

<p>The burden of proof is on those who say it happened. They&#39;re the ones who can only conjure pictures of emaciated prisoners in labor camps and refer to the coerced testimony of German officers under extreme duress.</p>

<p>&quot;Deniers&quot; are those of us who believe the International Red Cross&#39;s official death count of ~270,000 Jews, realize that there is no physical evidence of any organized genocide whatsoever, and think that the entire scam jumped the shark sometime around the Stephen Spielberg movie featuring the lady eating her diamond and shitting them out over and over again. </p>

If the US got it&#39;s ass kicked a lot of those people would have died, too.  That&#39;s war, that&#39;s why it all has to end.</p>

<p>I was speaking specifically of the texts that advocate the mistreatment of goyim.  You&#39;re absolutely right in that Abrahamic religions have been bastardized, though.

My problem is with people who outright deny the Holocaust or actively diminish its cultural impact (i.e.: oh, it happened but it wasn&#39;t THAT many).</p>

So I ask you, two questions, 1) Who/how many people do you think DID die at the hands of the German State, and 2) for what purpose and for whose gain is it that the &quot;narrative&quot; of the Holocaust, as it&#39;s generally understood, exists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I&#39;m not following, let me know if I understand what you&#39;re saying?</p>

<p>1) You believe that the death toll of European Jews was much lower than widely accepted estimates. And you stated the reason for those deaths was because of Nationalist fervor.</p>

<p>But two is pretty much skimmed over here, but that&#39;s REALLY all that&#39;s important, no? Would it have been okay if Hitler had only killed a single Jewish person or family? I think we can agree, murder is wrong, no?</p>

<p>Now I suppose that the implication here might be that perhaps that &quot;one&quot; person or family were an enemy of the State, then that&#39;d be okay, even I&#39;d agree to that, but that&#39;s not what even you&#39;ve admitted. You say 2 million Jewish people were killed by the German State, that&#39;d be quite a large &quot;conspiracy.&quot; So, let&#39;s be honest Germany attempted to commit genocide, correct?</p>

<p>Now 2) I am lost you still seem to have glossed over the entire &quot;conspiracy&quot; aspect to which I find hateful to the point of violating sub-rules, the entire meat of the conversation. I&#39;m just a guy at his desk top on the East Coast of the US, I&#39;ve never been to Europe or Israel for that matter. How am I to gain from a vast global conspiracy to obfuscate the truth about Germany&#39;s history?</p>

<p>There are ways of discussing and asking questions about the Holocaust without evoking antisemitism, so you lost me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I answer your points, you are already losing this argument and conversation with me by insinuating that I am anti-semtic, let alone my remarks.   </p>

<p>That being said.  1)  Yes, and it is beyond fervor when an entire country supports the actions of the state.  </p>

<p>2)  I did not say 2 million jews were killed.  I said 2 million or less died in the labor camps.  I&#39;m also just a guy on his computer in the US.  I have lived in Europe and in fact traveled quite extensively and am a dual citizen.  So, the conspiracy that you insinuate, larger than the false claim you made against my statement in fact, is the very premise of your post is it not?  You wish for discussion to stop regarding the holocaust because you feel it is disparaging towards XYZ group of peoples?  Well, let me tell you something that is black and white.  Life sucks.  It&#39;s full of beauty and death.  Lies and truth.  This is the r/conspiracy sub, not Dr. Drew&#39;s love line.  We&#39;re not here to discuss what might upset someone.  We&#39;re here to discuss the bullshit were fed like the cattle we are.  Either to some God or some government.... it doesn&#39;t matter.  And the mere fact you wish to stifle discussion is incredibly asinine to the point of the obvious, not to mention the infringement upon American constitutional law that you (I would surmise) wish to respect.  Please educate yourself through worldly experience before suggesting silence to matters you have no personal experience with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Victims of 9/11 were a diverse group of Americans, not an ethnic minority. And as someone who lives in NJ and physically saw the smoke in realtime, are we talking about people denying the event happened, or denying the 9/11 commission report?</p>

<p>Denying it happened is roughly the equivalent in ridiculousness, but denying the story I would entirely expect, even encourage, here on this sub. Denying the Holocaust encourages violence towards those that present as Jewish. It implies not a conspiracy of individuals, but an ethnic conspiracy which implicates all Jewish people. Being ahistorical, it&#39;s hate speech which is why many countries outlaw it.</p>

<p>Are you American? Imagine a conspiracy theory in which &quot;there was no trans-Atlantic slave trade?&quot; That plays into the narrative that black Americans situation is not the result of generations of oppression, but one of their own making, red-lining and Jim Crowe aside. You can easily add to it, &quot;Africa is sending a &#39;sleeper army&#39; to our shores, that why they are all poor, they are undocumented immigrants.&quot; Variations and possibilities abound.</p>

<p>Denying 9/11&#39;s official narrative does none of that, it&#39;s a reasonable thing to inquire about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying the holocaust is presented to us falsely is the same as saying the slave trade is presented falsely. Both are true statements. Neither is denial of the general premise but is instead a rejection of the propaganda in favor of a more holistic view of situation. Looking back on history it would be false to say that the civil war was fought to make blacks and whites equal or to even end slavery at all. We still have forced prisoner labor in the united states which is just state sponsored slavery. We have numerous quotes from Abe Lincoln himself disparaging black people. A more nuanced view suggests that the south looked at the ending of slavery as beginning of universal slavery or wage slavery. Why would the average poor white Southerner fight for slavery when they never had a chance in hell of owning a slave to begin with? History should be constantly revised dispassionately or else its no better than a fairy tale. Lately i&#39;ve wondered if the negativity that has followed black people in america isn&#39;t more to do with the media than actual reality. Those responsible for the atmosphere in a society would be those that control the content people see. If you read a whole generation racist children&#39;s books and show them racist tv then they will be racist. In a situation like that it would be wrong to say that the racism is unavoidable but instead that it was manufactured. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is plenty of common ground to be had on this post. Anthropology is my academic background, so I see revisiting and clarifying history is certainly a worthy pursuit. And as someone who went through the public school system, I am well versed in the &quot;official&quot; story of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and, as you say, we get a sanitized version of it. The reality was far more vile, and slavery continues as still both a State sanctioned reality in American prisons, and trafficking is still practiced here and abroad.</p>

<p>Adjusting and settling on numbers in pogroms is always going to be tricky, the victims are dead enmass and the witnesses are often implicated one way or another and there certainly going to be instances in which falsehoods arrive. There is a difference though, in say, misidentifying a work camp with one set up specifically for the purposes of extermination or vice versa. And it would be important to clarify and identify those situations. It is entirely different than say, buying into Hitler&#39;s delusion of scapegoating the economic troubles post WWI on the German-Jewish people, and claiming that an act of genocide was a defensive and defensible position.</p>

<p>Making claims that the German State didn&#39;t commit industrialized genocide implies not only that survivors are lying, but that European States tacitly sanction that lie in vast ethnic &quot;conspiracy.&quot;
That is the inherent, and unavoidable implication of Holocaust denial. I am all about picking through and picking at the past for posterity and clarity. This has nothing to do with that.</p>

<p>And communist thinkers have made very valid and potent critiques of the power structure and class system. I do think there is truth there. And that is what the TPTB are afraid of.

<p>Is that so? Please explain how &quot;Holocaust Denial&quot; violates those rules, and be specific.</p>

<p>First, I suggest that you DEFINE the Holocaust, then you should create an exhaustive list of those things that YOU believe might constitute &quot;denial&quot; of the Holocaust - that you have yet to DEFINE.</p>

<p>If that be the case, would banning Holocaust be an act of SEMITISM???</p>

<p>It sounds to me like you HATE &quot;Holocaust Deniers&quot; (though you have yet to define these terms), and you using this platform to peddle and promote your pet hatred.</p>

<p>Should <strong><em>Haters</em></strong> be banned? What about <em>Hate Haters</em>? And what about those who <em>HATE Hate Haters???</em></p>

<p>Tell you what, bro, if there is ONE thing that grinds my gears, it is the people who HATE HATE Hate Haters!!! Those guys really PISS ME OFF!</p>

<p>Wow! That didn&#39;t happen, did it??? </p>

<p>Now quit your sniveling, and get busy crafting a the definitions as I outlined above.</p>

<p>Also, tell me why** Semitism** <em>(prejudice/ bigotry that tends to FAVOR Jews)</em> is any less offensive than so-called <strong>anti-Semitism</strong> <em>(</em><strong>opposition</strong>* <em>to prejudice/bigotry that tends to FAVOR Jews)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulation on finding a dictionary that subscribes to your diction, it is not universal, but if you want to frame the world in as being black and white, you do you. That said - </p>

<p>First, I want to say I am morally apposed to the Jewish State of Israel as it stands, I am not myself Jewish, and many people that I know and am close to who are find Zionist ideology as you so clearly view, as equally immoral. Is it a worldview, absolutely. I think you&#39;ll find many religions have distasteful soteriological and eschatological views. The fact that you feel the need to frame me as such speaks far more about you than it does I.</p>

<p>Secondly, I was just about to start annotating some examples of bigoted language in the thread that inspired this one, but before I did such I lokked through your own history, in which I realized that 1) you yourself are a mod, and one that certainly likes to invoke rule 10, and 2) you yourself liberal equate Nazism with Zionism. So, like I said, I don&#39;t think there is much room for productive conversation.</p>

<p>Are both those ideologies distateful, yes, are they at all alike. Absolutely not, the only sociological connection I can make is that that kinda of cultural trauma sure would fuck up a lot of survivors psyche and instigate a terrible cycle of violence, like the one we see in the middle east today. But that certainly doesn&#39;t mean we should equate a perpetrator and their victim, regardless of what the victim goes on to do.</p>

<p>Now, you know Mr. Mod, what they say about assuming right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who in God&#39;s name made you a moderator of anything, but you certainly have neither the tact nor the objectivity to do so honestly.</p>

<p>Do what you will, but at least now I know how this place got so fucked up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even use that word (goy or goyim). None of my Jewish friends use it either. To be honest, I&#39;ve never heard any Jew use it.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ve never heard about Jews wanting to enslave people either. I&#39;ve heard it on the subreddit, but that&#39;s the only place. So you are right, I don&#39;t want to enslave anyone.  :-)</p>

<p>And I hate the elite Jews (the Globalists/NWO) just as much as you probably hate them.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#39;ve just recently started believing that the whole Bible (Old and New Testaments) aren&#39;t meant to be taken literally. I seriously believe it was about astrology and &quot;finding God&quot; in our own selves (through meditation, pineal gland, etc.).</p>

<p>&quot;Six million Jews&quot; have always been in peril, and the number&#39;s been thrown around since the turn of the century, at least.  It supposedly has its roots in a misspelling of a word in Leviticus, and seems to be from a kaballistic philosophy, applying numerology to verses in the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a copy pasta from a post I made about 6 months ago on antisemitism... I hope it contributes to this topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure it [antisemitism] is a trap for people who get close to the truth. There was an effort during the election to brand anti-globalism as a code for anti-semitism. I think that is a REALLY big hint.
The concept of everything being the fault of &quot;the jews&quot; is intentionally reductive, because such simplified ideas are naturally appealing. This serves well to catch anyone going down the rabbit hole in a sort of gravity well that will get them branded a racist/nazi/antisemitite. The Truth is that there are a subset of people, some of which are jewish, who control a ridiculous number of very important industries and hold a great deal of political and financial control. They aren&#39;t exclusively jewish though, but there are enough that you can point to it as a trend and people will go in that direction.
There is a massive difference between the little old lady who lives down the road and Mossad. Yet you see that anyone who is critical of Israel&#39;s influence on domestic or global politics, on either side of the political aisle, get branded with the antisemitic label.
Are you Critical of Israel&#39;s treatment of Palestinians? ANTISEMITE!
Are you wary of the influence that global bankers and hedge fund managers hold over our politicians? ANTISEMITE!
Ever notice that nepotism runs rampant in the media and in Hollywood? ANTISEMITE
Have you ever asked the wrong questions about WWII? ANTISEMITE!
Are you a gentile who laughed a little too hard at a Mel Brooks movie? ANTISEMITE
All I can say is don&#39;t fall into the trap because it is designed to invalidate anything you say. Do I think this is a jewish conspiracy? No, I don&#39;t. I think it is simply a form of political expedience that has worked effectively for more than a century, so why would you stop? It is no different from how the left ran the word &quot;racist&quot; into the ground for people who work against their agenda, except the antisemite label apparently has longer legs.
All that said, instead of blaming nebulous groups of people, name specific names. That is what TPTB don&#39;t want you to do.</p>

It&#39;s the internet, you could be sentient pickle or an elaborate algorithm to waste my time, or an alt for the mod, used to justify his actions.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care who you are, I care about the content of your ideas, which I am finding lacking. </p>

Don&#39;t question the Holocaust, dont question why everyone but israel must accept wholesale immigration, don&#39;t point out that nearly the entire financial and entertainment elite are jewish.

<p>The question was, &quot;Tell me what you learned about the Jews that makes them so bad.&quot; You said that Palestine is what makes you think that Jews are bad.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think that Jews in general are bad, the correct answer would have been, &quot;I don&#39;t think that Jews are bad, but I disagree with Israel&#39;s conduct in Palestine.&quot;</p>

<p>I disagree with most of what the Russian government does, but when someone asks what it is about Russians that makes them so bad, I don&#39;t list the issues that I have with the Russian government. I say that I don&#39;t really have an issue with Russians, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re any better or worse than anyone else.</p>

   Is that why you fear them? 
   You do realize that the Torah is the first five chapters of the Bible? That Jews and Christians and Muslims are all from the House of Abraham? 
They do have differences, but so do different Christian Denominations. 
      Why not try to overcome fear and loathing? Try a bit of acceptance of those that are peaceful within their faiths? 
   Those that commit violence in the name of religion are not really His followers. Even if they say they are.
 Their actions prove that they are really of evil, darkness and chaos. And their are plenty that are this way without claiming to act for religious reasons.

    <div class="md"><p>Saying clearly doesn&#39;t make it so.
Rule 1 refers to slurs. Holocaust denial is refutation of an historic event, there are no slurs. Ergo, holocaust denial does not violate rule 1.</p>

<p>Rule 4 refers to abusive or threatening langage. Holocaust denial is refutation of an historic event, there is nothing inherently abusive or threatening in it. Ergo, holocaust denial does not violate rule 4.</p>

<p>Prefacing your claim by claiming that anyone who disagrees with you can &quot;only&quot; have one motive is simply designed to shut down discussion. 
So what you really want is a platform to spout your opinion unchallenged. Fortunately many western democracies still believe in freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You point out the irony of rule 10 which is ironic as you&#39;re attacking other reddit users by ascribing motivations to them based solely on a narrow interpretation of who questions history and why. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Discussion on Reddit about Holocaust denial has nothing to do with constitutional rights, how is this not obvious to you by now, even with no fore knowledge of basic civics, have you commented here without reading virtually any existing posts? This is just another dense, and (un?)ironically hollow argument espoused here dozens of times, thank you for contributing nothing.</p>

<p>I am not saying, as they do in other countries, &quot;adopting this position publicly should be legally punished,&quot; I am saying &quot;hey r/conspiracy aren&#39;t we above this sort of trash, and how about we focus on something either real, or at least &#39;unreal&#39; but fun&quot;</p>

<p>The implication to Holocaust denial is that there ought to have been one - you cannot imply there is no Holocaust without implicating entire populations of people with lying on a global scale.</p>

<p>I am interested in it cause not only am I interested in the subreddit conceptually, but this claim offends me as a human being and as an Anthropologist - aware not only of the facts of European pogroms, but also the affect of this sort of rhetoric historically, and particularly in our current sort of political climate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wouldn&#39;t be the first time people lied as a group. The reason revisionist history became a thing is due to native peoples taking umbrage over established history of colonialism and more recent conquest.</p>

<p>A modern example of a group lie is the claim by Albanians in Kosovo that they were being exterminated by the Serbs. The complaint seemed credible based on Serb atrocities a few years earlier in Bosnia. They didn&#39;t hold up in this instance though and it was the Serbs who were ethnically cleansed from Kosovo. At the time the KLA, who were regarded as terrorists and an organised crime gang by Interpol and various intelligence agencies, were pushing against the Serb authorities to expand their control and to implement an islamic state. Jihadists from around the world later joined them. The Serbs were held up as being nazis and NATO bombed the hell out of them. UN troops were sent in but failed to protect the Serb minority or the destruction of historic Serbian churches by the moslem Albanians.</p>

<p>You can also look at the rhetoric during the Rwandan genocide where the UN stood by and claimed ignorance of what was going on until it was too late to do anything about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an actual example in regards the holocaust. I was taught at school that the nazis made lampshades out of human skin and soap out of human fat, specifically from Jewish victims.
It was a lie, never happened. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre has confirmed that there is no evidence for this happening. It was an example of the big lie. </p>

<p>Going back to at least WWI, the British employed well known authors to fabricate propaganda during the two wars. Lies are generated for wartime use but are then passed down to the next generations where they become part of accepted history by the masses. 
It&#39;s why history should always be fact checked, and periodically too to ensure the most up to date interpretation possible.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m aware, the holocaust is the only bit of history that people are not allowed to debate. It is also rendered down to being Jews killed and all the others who perished, five million non-Jews I believe, are totally ignored.</p>

<p>&quot;Six million Jews&quot; have always been in peril, and the number&#39;s been thrown around since the turn of the century, at least.  It supposedly has its roots in a misspelling of a word in Leviticus, and seems to be from a kaballistic philosophy, applying numerology to verses in the Bible.</p>

<p>But whether it&#39;s from an ancient text, or a modern invention, it&#39;s false propaganda, and has been, for over 100 years.</p>
