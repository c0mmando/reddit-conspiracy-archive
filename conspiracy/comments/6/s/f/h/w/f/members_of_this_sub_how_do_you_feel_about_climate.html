    <div class="md"><p>Noam Chomsky argues it is one of the two largest existential threats to the human race (the other being nukes). Who do you think is lying? 99% of scientists who are part of the proletariat or a handful of CEOs making billions off of the industry? It is an easy side to take here. We know bug oil is dirty and has been. The did the studies and concluded climate change was real but they covered them up or got new studies done to reflect the truth they wanted. Big oil has a hand in most conflicts after WW2 and a new report came out stating that over 6% of the entire planet&#39;s GDP goes to subsidize the oil industry which has been raking in profits for generations. The use misinformation and media to paint a picture of this issue being up for debate but it isnt. The data shows not only is it real and it is man made but it shows something much more sinister and that is that the effects are much worse than we originally thought. If we do not cut our oil addiction we are in big trouble</p>

    <div class="md"><p>6% of the world&#39;s GDP subsidizes the oil industry?</p>

<p>Ok. Without that industry, how much of the world&#39;s GDP would exist?
No gasoline, no coal, no natural gas, no asphalt, no frozen foods, and no economy would survive.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree that we must slash our oil consumption. It&#39;s far too valuable to be using to power cars. It&#39;s non-renewable and without it, virtually nothing that we have would currently exist. Oil is the building block of the modern world.</p>

<p>However, if climate change was the big bad threat liberals have been saying it was since the 90&#39;s, we&#39;d all be dead by now. It exists, but not to the extent people have been claiming. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what the entirety of the climate denialist argument is based on.  Choosing very select parts of data and saying it disproves it.  Or taking just a year or 2 and using that as basis for trends of a hundred years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would put a lot more stock into it if the scientists studying it hadn&#39;t been caught 8,263,048 times intentionally faking or distorting their data. There simply isn&#39;t reliable info from a source that hasn&#39;t completely blown it&#39;s credibility at this point.</p>

<p>The seas are the same level they were 2,000 years ago when Romans we&#39;re building harbors. Simply put, the seas are not rising and anyone who understands fluids would tell you that ice melting can&#39;t raise the sea levels. Anyone telling you otherwise should watch a glass of ice water melt and see if it overflows for a micro-level experience of how that works.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that putting carbon atoms into the atmosphere will raise air temperatures. Anything which can absorb and transmit heat will do that. The question we need an unbiased, scientific, answer to is how much it affects the temperatures and at what levels it becomes a serious problem.</p>

<p>Our world is smarter than we are. Rain forests have grown back, holes in the ozone layer have closed, and ice ages have come and gone. Without serious people doing legitimate studies, we simply don&#39;t know what our actions are doing to our environment. </p>

<p>Btw I&#39;d be skeptical of wherever you got the Roman sea level rise. They are pulling a fast one on you by not mentioning that it&#39;s the Roman Warm Period right after the culmination of Sea level rise that disconnected England from Europe around 6,000 BC.</p>

<p>Basically just like they fooled you into saying Sea level from Romans to present is the same, one could go completely opposite by showing meters of sea level rise from the last Glacial Maximum just 20,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Both of these are being selective data, the point being you don&#39;t use one data point to prove a pattern. You need to use more data and a graph. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. How&#39;s this one?</p>

<p>Using historic and modern sea ports as a measuring stick of current sea levels as the ports were being built, we can say with near 100% certainty that the seas are not rising at a rate that should alarm anyone since ancient ports, med-evil ports, renisance ports, Victorian ports, all the way to modern ports have been built at nearly the exact same elevation.  The fact that we can dock the same ship at 2000, 1200, 600, and 3 year old docks means that the sea levels were roughly the same during every one of those periods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I am intentionally ignoring the end of the last ice age when discussing man&#39;s effect on climate change and focusing on eras where we might have actually had an effect that we can deal with rather than worry about some planetary event that we had absolutely nothing to do with.</p>

<p>Before the industrial revolution, we simply were not polluting enough for it to make a difference. There simply were not enough people on earth, burning enough carbon to have any type of effect on sea levels. </p>

<p>Instead, focusing on pre-industrial sea ports before we were possibly effecting the climate and comparing them to modern ports, and using ports from all times in between, we can clearly see that we have not had to raise ports to counter raising sea levels at any point in recordable human history.</p>

<p>You can argue ice ages all day, but they are completely pointless in discussions of man&#39;s role in climate change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Living on an island in the Gulf of Mexico, I completely get coastal flooding and storm surges becoming more common and dangerous. I also know that places which have solved that issue did so by replacing sandbars and marsh land which had either been eroded or developed. Storm surges are a problem with not having a breakwater, not there being more water. </p>

<p>Except that history can prove, in literal concrete, that sea levels have not risen significantly since well before man had any effect on the climate, so it actually doesn&#39;t. It would, IF the sea levels were rising. But here&#39;s the deal: THEY AREN&#39;T! Period. If you want to argue that they are, explain how a pier built 2,000 years ago to be 4 feet above high tide is still almost exactly 4 feet above high tide, and shows absolutely no sign of having ever been different.</p>

Roman concrete still survives, as do dock records and artwork of those docks (sometimes, even the specific ships we have records of.) that we can, and have, used to measure exactly what we are talking about here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going back to this same thing for no reason. I&#39;m doing it because really frigging smart historians have already done exactly what I am talking about and they all came to the same conclusion. That any ideas of large scale sea level changes during the years that humans have been able to effect the climate are simply not supported by historical evidence, and that there is quite clear evidence of the exact opposite; that sea levels have remained extremely stable over that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NOAA records are about as trustworthy as election polls were in 2016 and for the exact same reason. They&#39;re setting out with the intention of collecting data to prove a point, not to answer a question. From getting caught completely faking numbers in places they do not have sensors (DPRK, Iran, and Somolia participate in an American program? On what plannet?) to intentionally placing the sensors they do run as close to warm objects (in one case, in an area where reflections from a glass building landed on the sensors virtually all day.) as possible to skew the numbers.</p>

<p>Their &quot;Global Average&quot; numbers are crap. In 1880, we simply don&#39;t know how hot it was in July in almost all of the world we didn&#39;t have someone there taking the temp and recording it. Those numbers are entirely made up before the 1950&#39;s or 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>The City of Boston quoting NOAA&#39;s impossible numbers is even less trustworthy than the original faked data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because much the evidence you claim exists doesn&#39;t even pass the common sense test, and you completely ignore the fact that I am using evidence in my responses as well. </p>

<p>In 1894, we know the average temperature of the entire globe to a degree that it&#39;s equatable with the data we have today? How? Did we have a NOAA official measuring the temperature in every country on earth? No. We didn&#39;t. And the technology to measure temperatures simply didn&#39;t exist in the vast majority of the world at that time. Not everywhere is a first world country. Any global temperature data that predates the 1950&#39;s is not possible, yet the NOAA regularly quotes as back as the 1880&#39;s.</p>

<p>Today, they have ground sensor data for areas where politically, we simply cannot measure that data. We have ocean data for locations sailors have documented that we don&#39;t have sensors by visiting the area themselves. </p>

<p>Why are they lying about their data in such absurd ways? Nobody has to lie about solid data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m undecided on climate change. There is so much out there that it becomes hard to see where the truth ends and the lies begin.</p>

<p>Could it really be harmful to cut back on pollution? Probably not, so while I&#39;m on the fence I do still believe we could be doing more to preserve the environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s weird that there&#39;s very little talk of how oil and natural gas companies have billions of dollars resting on us believing it&#39;s an overblown threat. There&#39;s lots of talk about it being a hoax to make money/get donations, but I think there&#39;s a lot more money relying on keeping things the way they are.</p>

<p>Or anything past dirt roads and steam ships. Without oil, you died of malaria shortly after birth.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the oil industry that&#39;s a problem. Their greed is gonna fuck us all when we run out of the substance that makes up almost every item we touch. Oil itself is the most useful item known to man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change is so polarized these days and is almost a trap argument. What I do wholeheartedly believe for many reasons, is that severe over-consumption of the earths resources is starting to have major effects on our environment and that we need to make changes yesterday because extremely severe consequences are on their way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dramatic reply was wiped, and I&#39;ve no energy to recompose it.  Instead, I encourage you to seriously look into it yourself. Not one afternoon, reading an editorial, but over the course of the rest of your life, taking university courses on the topic and on related necessary skills like logic, inductive and deductive reasoning, every science you can handle. I&#39;m a few years in, and so far, it looks pretty grim. Bad enough that you might do better to study farming and move as far North as possible than waste your time on grokking why and how severely you&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>I also think there was a period where people were far more optimistic about doing something about it. When I was a kid it was all Reduce Reuse Recycle and love the Earth and now people seem to think as long as they put their plastic in the right bin, they&#39;ve done their bit. </p>
