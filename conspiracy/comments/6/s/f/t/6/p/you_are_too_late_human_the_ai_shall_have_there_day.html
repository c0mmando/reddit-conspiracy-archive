<p>its not a coincidence people all talk about the same news stories, re-share the same pictures, see the same content, its all designed that way, but that&#39;s just one element of it, for example go ahead and find any negative websites/articles about google using google search, go ahead i Dare you, you&#39;ll have a damn hard time, because they OWN everything. Sure google is not alone in this Amazon, Google, Microsoft, these monumental corporations are constantly working on new innovative ways to use all your data they harvest to turn you into a corporate minded individual obsessed with consumption.</p>

<p>start ups get bought up, shut down, and in same cases vanish into myst. Even in political events where outside influence is illegal. Its no coincidence that  every time an election day rolls around Reddit and other social media platforms are flooded with bots supporting and targeting anyone who says a word against the party/group they want in power. its all joke folks, the planet is owned by these corporations and everything you read look at and view is highly dictated. </p>

<p>remember when the internet was a pathway of many websites, what is it now? facebook,twitter,youtube,instagram,pornhub,gmail? thats no coincidence either. </p>

<p>Im not even mad though like really, GENIUS how they did it they lowkey bought the planet and no one even noticed, better yet no one even cares dude. Amazing. my biggest concern however is that their greed WILL destroy human creativity and innovation, its already severely wounded it when you tube decided to demonetize anyone not creating &quot;advertiser friendly content&quot; they basically put a spear in anyone who wanted to make a living making any alternative content, Alexander the great conquered all the way to india, these corporations conquered the planet :D</p>

<p>Illumination not education to bring the blind sight, and what you need to know is that you&#39;ll never known it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is that this &quot;message&quot; seems like the same pseudo-spiritual spew you can find anywhere. The &quot;deeper dimension of pure spirit&quot; The idea that the &quot;spirit&quot; is not &quot;localized in space and time, and yet there is no time or space where it is not&quot; - all reads like nonsense. And before you say &quot;of course you feel that way because you don&#39;t understand&quot; or some equivalent - believe me, I do. I just don&#39;t agree that any of it is true. The &quot;texts and scriptures&quot; you talk about just don&#39;t mean anything to me. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit condescending to tell someone they aren&#39;t awake or &quot;haven&#39;t had an awakening&quot; because they don&#39;t agree with you, and this claim to have some deep-rooted spiritual knowledge is far from unique. Maybe the message is hated everywhere because people can smell it from a mile away - maybe they do listen and &quot;look withing&quot; and just find it to be empty words.</p>

<p>The concepts arent true, they are just colorful expressions. What is true is the actuality of what is now. If we are honest there is no name for this, spirit or whatever is just a name, its not it. </p>

<p>What these concepts point towards is an end to the experience of separation where you feel that you are something in space and time, existing in separation from everything you experience. That there is an I here and a world out there and these things are different and two separate realities, duality.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken acid or such psychedelics and have had an ego death you wont mistake this experience. Its quite clear when the sense of self drops and your consciousness or beign is left without a sense of localisation or separation from what is appearing in it. This vanishing of the sense of separation and limitation is called awakening or satori or kensho or samadhi in different traditions, in the psychedelic community it is known as ego death. Permanent realisation of this is called self realisation.</p>

<p>Many people have woken up by doing this investigation themselves. </p>

<p>Completely disagree that consciousness has no form. It is recognized by the creator/creation every second of the day. As such..it immediately has form. Just because it&#39;s not visible to some does not mean it isn&#39;t there.</p>

<p>Example: &quot;I felt a presence in the dark room&quot;...&quot;It feels like someone/something is watching me&quot;</p>

<p>Many times we find out that this &quot;sense&quot; was correct. There was someone else in the room, there was someone watching us.</p>

<p>One of Gods names is literally &quot;I am that I am&quot;. This is a declaration by God to be recognized. Just because we can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; this form does not mean we can&#39;t &quot;sense&quot; this form.</p>

<p>If we spend more time using that internal sense to interact with God both God&#39;s form and ours gain more &quot;shape&quot;.</p>

<p>Completely disagree that consciousness has no form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is because we are using the same word to mean different things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re complicating things. The truth is just the truth. That which is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, being. Or whatever you want to call it. Call it just what is if thats what you want to call it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example: &quot;I felt a presence in the dark room&quot;...&quot;It feels like someone/something is watching me&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the form of the I that is feeling and perceiving? Does that have a form which is aware of forms?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we spend more time using that internal sense to interact with God both God&#39;s form and ours gain more &quot;shape&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is only one actuality, there isnt two realities, you and god.</p>
