    <div class="md"><p>Trump&#39;s shown little indication he actually knows what his agenda is.  To the extent he actually has one, Congress has been pretty supportive.  They&#39;ve approved the vast majority of his nominees and regulatory proposals.  They didn&#39;t get him a health care bill, but that wasn&#39;t because McConnell or Ryan opposed him, it was due to Trump&#39;s lack of direction and the incoherence of the Republican position.  Have you forgotten the beer bash Ryan and Trump threw at the White House a few weeks back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both parties have been obstructing his agenda??? How is that?  The Left, yes, for obvious ideological reasons but the house passed his crappy healthcare repeal and the Senate only missed by 1 vote.  The problem is Trump is a terrible politician.  You CAN&#39;T run government like a business because congress can&#39;t be fired.  A good president learns how to work with congress and get legislation negotiated and passed. Heck, Republicans controlled both houses for 6 years of Obama&#39;s presidency and he got legislation through.  Trump will have to learn what it really means to negotiate before he can be effective.  Hint, it doesn&#39;t mean tell people what to do at some high level and make them figure out the details, it means getting in the weeds.  maybe play less golf too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see two posts from you on this sub. One is recognizing that r/conspiracy was recognized as a hate sub; the other is a Paul is Dead YouTube video. I don&#39;t bring this up to be disparaging, so much as to draw attention to the three fingers pointed back at you as you point one elsewhere. Make the post you wish to see on this sub! </p>

<p>This place did used to be awesome, but in many ways it still is! The number of real users compared to fake was much higher back in the day, or at least seemed to be. So much of the left/right dichotomy seems to be spewed rhetoric aimed at widening the gap between two imaginary teams and doesn&#39;t come from facts based in reality. We all need to work together to drown out the deliberately politicized garbage and get back to looking for the truth, independent of preconceived notions or perceived political boundaries. </p>

<p>Exactly, which is why I have a problem with this sub supporting Trump.  A conspiracy sub shouldn&#39;t support any administration - unless that administration is actually exposing the conspiracies taking place - and we know that&#39;s not going to happen - so yeah, no conspiracy sub should support ANY president.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so that&#39;s a helpful clarification.</p>

<p>I can understand why you would feel that interest in those topics is supportive to Trump.</p>

<p>As a progressive, I&#39;m interested in those topics because I desperately want a democratic party I can trust again.  I quit the party last May, but it&#39;s been hard not being part of a party.  I was a democrat my whole life.</p>

<p>So, I would love to see some sort of smoking gun which would absolutely force some harsh sunlight into the DNC and drive out the leadership.  Then, we could re-claim the party from the corporate donors and consultants, clean it up, and start our fight against corruption in government.</p>

<p>Some of us have other agendas that have nothing to do with Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also agree.  It seems we have a political see-saw of corruption.  Right now all the attention is focused on the Republicans, and I imagine a house cleaning for them is on the way (the 2018 election doesn&#39;t look good for them at the moment).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democrats fly under the radar, allowing corruption in <em>their</em> party to grow.  There should have been a house cleaning after the DNC/Bernie fiasco last year - but it wasn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m one of those on board for just firing EVERYONE and starting from scratch.  And honestly, I think that&#39;s coming.  This last election irritated everyone - and I personally know a lot of young people on both sides who have been inspired to go into politics.</p>

<p>Now - whether or not they stay clean by the time they get where they want to be is the real issue.  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington remains more relevant than ever.</p>

<p>This sub has a bias against the establishment, and particularly the establishment democrats.</p>

<p>You should know, though, that some of us were democrats (now progressives).  I quit the party last year out of rage towards the party.  I came to this sub during the primaries, and found myself agreeing with republicans and independents about the state of the DNC.  </p>

<p>The left/right paradigm is really limiting, and if you lock yourself into that perspective, you will miss the important dynamics taking place politically.</p>

How is that better?  A political candidate doesn&#39;t have to be a 100% perfect fit, close enough is fine for me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a corrupt system.  So, the &quot;it is what it is&quot; line really doesn&#39;t work for me.</p>

<p>Honestly, when will the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; argument go away?  It <em>doesn&#39;t work</em>.  It&#39;s old.  She didn&#39;t get elected, but still you use talking points that failed then, as though they would work now?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The accusation frequently thrown around here is that liberal organizations engage in astroturfing. It&#39;s literally a daily discussion in this sub, sometimes with multiple threads a day devoted to it.</p>

<p>Rarely do similar discussions about astroturfing from Trump supporting organizations/supporters make the front page, and they don&#39;t appear here in general <em>nearly</em> as frequently.</p>

<p>Trump does not represent the right, he represents <em>Trump</em>. </p>

<p>Trump is not the right; the right is not Trump. They&#39;re two distinct things.</p>

<p>Trump supporters and the right are two different groups. There is at times some crossover, but they&#39;re not the same thing. Trump people and conservative people, two different ideas, concepts, and groups.</p>

<p>Therefore, this has nothing to do with a left/right dichotomy. It&#39;s specifically about <em>Trump&#39;s</em> side of things and questioning what social media manipulation they engage in that we rarely talk about.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not left/right, that&#39;s specifically about one man and his followers.</p>

<p><em>Thread about Trump shills</em></p>

<p>Steve Banno was on the board and owned</p>

<p><em>Thread about Podesta shilling</em></p>

<p><strong>Top Comment:</strong> </p>

<p>&quot;I seriously encourage you to read the first amendment. Then please come back here and post it for the whole class.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>

<p>It seems that if you want to talk about shills, the place to do so openly and unaccosted is in a thread about Trump shills. If you speak of other shills, like the Father of Lies Shills, David Brock, others will remind you that, of course, they are simply exercising their 1st amendment rights. Interesting case study, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p>

<p>If you can ask anyone on this subreddit what the common theme of those outlets and platforms are I can almost guarantee you would hear the same response each time. I didn&#39;t say they didn&#39;t exist entirely, but yeah there are extremely few places. </p>

<p>The right has Fox and that&#39;s pretty much it. The left feels like the Washington Times is a joke, the NYPost doesn&#39;t report news and Breitbart is alt right along with every other single news site that isn&#39;t listed at the very top of this post.  That&#39;s the difference. Reddit especially is so keen on regurgitating the official narrative it has over on r/politics it truly doesn&#39;t matter what the source is as long as it fits two criteria.</p>

<ol>
<li>Negative about Trump</li>
<li> Outlandish claims supported by anonymous intel sources </li>
</ol>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whatsoever, they regularly upvote articles to the top from websites such as shareblue, teen vogue and vanity fair. I vividly remember seeing an article from hillaryclinton.com at the top and as soon as I called out the BS I had people trying to defend the reason it was there. Can you imagine an article from Donald trumps campaign website to reach the front page of r/politics? Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>

<p>People are absolutely losing their shit over at r/politics because apparently Breitbart got whitelisted into their new rules. It&#39;s funny because I didn&#39;t hear one comment about CNN, NyTimes or WAPO reporting fake news when we all know each one of them is dirtier than sin. </p>

<p>I appreciate you not jumping all over my back for having a difference of opinion by the way. Yes r/politics is a cesspool circle jerk but it was r/conspiracy that allowed for more open speculation and discussion regarding the campaign and everything that has come about of it so far. So I will give you that, and without this sub I feel there would be a lot less interconnected minds with everything going on and that keeps me hopeful. </p>
