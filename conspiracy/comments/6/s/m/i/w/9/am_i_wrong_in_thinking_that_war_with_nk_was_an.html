       Ok, so I'm gonna get some heat from this and I accept that off the hop. I know that the war economy is a thing, and I know that the US has been led into wars falsely for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       But...
      </p>
      <p>
       NK has been saying that they're going to fuck up SK, Japan, USA, etc for a very very long time, and they've been working on developing the capabilities to carry out those threats for just as long. Doesn't it stand to reason that eventually they're going to develop something that will be effective at accomplishing what they say?
      </p>
      <p>
       And wouldn't it be better to not sit around and wait while that happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that Trump just so happens to be the guy sitting in the chair at the time that NK develops the weapons they need?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we want Seattle or Guam or Seoul or Japan to get taken off the board before we act?
      </p>
      <p>
       ON the other side, we know that the MIC is a thing. The US economy is propped up by war, and always needs it boogeyman. IS it possible that I am being manipulated by media? (Yes).
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the most solid piece of evidence we have that NK is able to carry out their threats? Have we seen any solid evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is NK just a ruse, meant to pop up in convenient times to distract from bigger issues?

       They could probably intercept the shitty ICBM's that NK has right now. MIRVs are a different story but I don't see NK advancing there any time soon.

       The US has deployed
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_High_Altitude_Area_Defense">
        THAAD
       </a>
       in the region, a system that has been proven successful in recent tests. However even with the recent news that NJ has supposedly miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit on such a missile, it is still unlikely that they could successfully deploy it. They have never demonstrated the ability to detonate a nuclear warhead outside of ideal, laboratory conditions, and there are indications that they have not perfected a reentry vehicle.

       The purpose would be to prevent something worse from happening by intervening before it had the chance to occur. Like NK bombing Seoul or Japan.

       They're a threat to SK. SK is an economic ally. If SK gets bombed it negatively impacts the US. Pretty sure US has defense treaties, and foreign investments.

       You're ignoring the situation until it grows big enough that it needs to be dealt with. You aren't convinced it's a credible threat, and won't be until Seattle, Guam, Seoul or Tokyo are hit with a missile. The only way you will get involved with the threat is by

       So far that is all you have offered, I should be afraid of tiny North Korea while supporting a trillion dollar yearly defense/intelligence budget we are told will protect us.

       I'll repost what I said in a similar thread:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yes, these are empty threats. The regime largely derives its power over its people by painting the US as a powerful and evil adversary. The rhetoric coming out of NK is more about rallying and controlling its own people than actually threatening the US.
        <br/>
        Kims goal is to maintain his power and status at all costs. An unprovoked attack against the US would be an a-strategic move, as it would surely result in regime change through military intervention by the US and South Korea. Do not confuse Kim for someone who is irrational. Kim is rational but desperate. Imagine him as an escaped criminal who is holding a hostage in hopes of exchanging them for his freedom. Though his actions have been outrageous they have also been largely predictable.
        <br/>
        North Koreas nuclear and chemical weapons cannot win them an offensive war, nor can their conventional weapons, and they are not going to start one. They are insurance against military intervention by the US and SK, and bargaining chips to be traded for aid or reduced sanctions.
        <br/>
        The US will likely not intervene militarily (yet, anyway) for two reasons: 1.) US politicians and diplomats know these threats are empty and serious offensive action by NK is a-strategic. 2.) China would be deeply upset at the US gaining more strategic influence in the area by invading NK, and awakening the disastrous humanitarian obligation that reunification entails. This is why you see Trump and other politicians telling China to act on the matter.
