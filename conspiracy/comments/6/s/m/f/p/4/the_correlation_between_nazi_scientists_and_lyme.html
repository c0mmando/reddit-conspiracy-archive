    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t read his book yet, but I&#39;m aware of the theory. </p>

<p>I actually suspect I may have Lyme, and recently discovered I have a few mutations of my MTHFR gene as well. Many of the people with chronic Lyme have MTHFR mutations, and it&#39;s almost as if the disease is targeting people with certain genetic traits. Many of the people I&#39;ve talked to with Lyme also claim to be empaths, and there&#39;s a high correlation of empaths who later find out they have Lyme disease. Not sure if the disease targets empaths or the disease itself causes empathic abilities. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been avoiding the CDC approved protocols and instead using herbs in combination with various supplements and diet. Mostly following the Buhner protocol with the addition of cannabis tinctures (CBD in particular for neurological symptoms). CDC recommends 30 days of antibiotics which absolutely won&#39;t do anything. </p>

<p>Lyme is a spirochete and can corkscrew itself into tissue, joints, and possibly even bone. It can also form biofilms and go into remission during antibiotic treatment only to reappear when the antibiotics have ceased. If you have Lyme and aren&#39;t breaking up biofilms and detoxing you&#39;re doing it wrong. Supposedly Lyme is also twice as fast as the faster immune cells in the body.</p>

<p>Insurance won&#39;t cover testing or treatment. I&#39;ve got it managed to the point where I only have about 3-5 bad days a month now, but it still steals most of my energy and I am far from living a normal life. </p>

<p>The funny thing with Lyme is on good days I can go for a 5-6 mile run with my dog, and if you saw me in person you&#39;d have no idea I am sick. I do yoga almost daily, and I physically have an athletic runners body. </p>

<p>The worse thing with Lyme is also all the other co-infections. Candida, rashes, and all the different types of spirochetes that all have varying symptoms. Meanwhile, if I take anything that kills Lyme disease I get incredibly sick and suffer from herx reactions that cause a major inflammation response through my brain and body that can last days or weeks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in the process of boosting my methylation system to overcome my MTHFR gene mutations which should reduce my herx symptoms so I can get more aggressive with my treatment in the future but it&#39;s very possible I may need to get stem cell treatments to fully recover and repair all the damage to my nervous system. Unfortunately I can&#39;t afford stem cells as they&#39;re about $25k right now, and I can&#39;t even really afford getting a proper diagnosis. </p>

<p>Anyhow, the possibility this horrible disease was created by my own government and possibly even created at the hands of Nazi scientists working for the US government doesn&#39;t really surprise me. This is why insurance doesn&#39;t cover treatment, and why Lyme is so controversial to diagnosis, and even more difficult to treat. </p>

<p>All I know is when I came to the hypothesis I was suffering from Lyme and started treating for it I actually got better. I&#39;m not out of the woods yet, but in the past 6 months I&#39;ve been able to heal old injuries (some of which were 10+ years old), repair my digestive system, improve my energy, and manage my pain and nervous system damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;ve been meaning to try stevia.</p>

<p>I had a drink with stevia in it several years ago, and it made me incredibly sick to my stomach. I now realize I was actually experiencing die off, and having a herx reaction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;m on NAC, and Harataki powder nightly to disrupt biofilm formation. I think I&#39;ve cleared most older biofilms at this point as my flexibility is improving, and my joint injuries don&#39;t hurt as much. But I kind of feel like I&#39;m in maintenance mode where I can&#39;t stop taking the herbs I&#39;m on or it will come back. I haven&#39;t figured out how to eliminate it for good, just keep it in remission with my current protocols.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also planning on trying Teasel root soon which is supposed to pull lyme out of the joints and harder tissues.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the only cure I know of is stem cells, and as I mentioned they&#39;re super expensive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because it isn&#39;t covered by most insurance. A Lyme diagnosis basically means you&#39;re paying out of pocket for medical expenses for the rest of your life. It&#39;s not quiet a death sentence, but it basically means normal Western doctors won&#39;t take you as a patient, and you have to rely on Lyme literate doctors and naturopaths. To be honest, I don&#39;t even trust some of the Lyme literate doctors, as they charge ridiculous fees and essentially taking advantage of sick people.</p>
