    <div class="md"><p>I mean, could it be the reverse is happening too....that the McMaster rumblings are meant to detract from the Manafort story?  The Manafort raid story &quot;broke&quot; today, as in, it wasn&#39;t reported earlier.  I&#39;m pretty sure there have been McMaster stories going on since at least last week</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to go with this....more than one thing can happen at a time and neither one has to take away from the other.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story &quot;broke&quot; today about something that happened months ago, why today.  There have been rumblings about McMaster sure, but today claims that he is openly working for Soros to undermine the presidency come out; claims backed by anonymous intelligence sources (the same kind bringing you other news you believe).</p>

<p>And oh look, magically the front page is plastered with the same old story.  Totally natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>why today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Manafort&#39;s lawyer told someone at the WaPo about it.....</p>

<p>Let me ask you something.  Is it possible that Manafort is dirty?  Independently of everything else that&#39;s happening in the world, is it possible that he is dirty?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  I never said it was an impossibility.  Trump either for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy the whole RUSSIA HACKED TEH ELECTION narrative either.  I do think that there&#39;s some shady ass shit that surrounds Trump and his team. So I think maybe parts of the story are true, but there&#39;s also a ton of disinfo out there.</p>

<p>That being said, this wasn&#39;t a story generated by an anonymous source, it originated from Manafort&#39;s lawyer</p>

<p>Do you think that it&#39;s coincidental that the day of the raid Trump tweeted about the trans-ban in the military and suggested that McCabe step down?</p>

<p>I mean, something funny, something really weird is going in in Trump&#39;s world.  Maybe Trump ran an honest campaign but had been tangentially involved in Russian money laundering in the recent past?  Maybe those activities had nothing to do with the election.....maybe</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to dismiss everything, just because there are parts which are muddled</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re not going to know anything one way or the other until it&#39;s all said and done (even then probably won&#39;t know the whole truth) but, that hasn&#39;t stopped a massive push to discredit Trump&#39;s every breathe by people claiming to know the certainties of the situation.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened, none of us do.  My intent in this stuff is to just point out the hypocrisy of it all.  Let&#39;s say Manafort is 100% guilty of collusion with Putin himself.  Should news of McMaster working with Soros be completely ignored because of it?</p>

<p>Should the raid have been ignored the day it happened, even though Trump tweeted?</p>

<p>The answer to both is no.</p>

<p>Nothing is going to change either way and, I enjoy running my own &quot;social experiments.&quot;  I find this all facinating.</p>

The dems pushed and pushed... They even had MSM and an army of shills to shove their agenda... Yet, the dems pissed it all away.. Now we have a republican controlled government and captain Donnie in office... All because IT WAS HER TURN!  lol if only the dems, listened to the people... OHHHH WELLL!

<p>The Republicans who are trying to uphold the status-quo, like, most of them.  I&#39;m a registered Democrat.  Give me a Republican and I&#39;ll blast him for you.  I got a 24 ban from T_D months ago for calling out Sessions before it was the cool thing to do.</p>

<p>This &quot;breaking news&quot; happened a month ago and was released the day a Soros story comes out.  You have the distractions backwards.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha that&#39;s all I could read at first. </p>

<p>And I suppose it&#39;s possible, but this is the same press that couldn&#39;t help but report when Trump had two scoops of ice cream. They salivate over everything bad about Trump, his administration, and his campaign. Why would they wait to report on something like this? I think it&#39;s just more likely that they were unaware of it and no one leaked anything about it. So far most of the leaks we&#39;ve seen have been from stuff within the Whitehouse. Mueller&#39;s investigation hasn&#39;t really been leaking any info so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has a way bigger impact than filler pieces like icecream.  So, in my eyes, it would be a good one to hold on to; like the pussy tape everyone knew about or the golden shower documents.  Media is an entertainment industry so they hold on to the good story for the right time.</p>

<p>This is all guessing, I have no idea; like everyone else.  I just brought it up because of the Manafort story filling the front page.  I don&#39;t care if people talk about it but, this is /conspiracy, let&#39;s talk about Soros/McMaster too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, a month old story.  Known by the press but held to be released at a critical moment.  Story timing is nothing new.  Like when Trump&#39;s pussy tape was released an hour after the Podesta emails came out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re thinking you can bother me, but this is no skin off my back. Frankly I&#39;d rather people see how nakedly the Trump squad lies in order to throw attention off Trump&#39;s collusion with Russia.</p>

<p>So here are the quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>October 7, 2016: Wikileaks releases first batch of Podesta emails – one hour after release of Access Hollywood Trump tape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/look-at-the-timeline">http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/look-at-the-timeline</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oct. 7: WikiLeaks dumped a trove of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s personal email account. The release came just hours after a tape emerged in which Trump bragged about groping women by the genitals. The emails were widely covered in the American media, and the Republican National Committee touted them as evidence of “who Hillary Clinton really is.”</p>

<p>The Obama administration accuses Russia of deploying hackers to interfere in the presidential election. A statement from Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, says hacked documents posted on DC Leaks, Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks appear linked to Russian intelligence and accuses “Russia’s senior-most officials” of directing the hacks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotta admit, it&#39;s a bit fascinating to see how quickly the coordinated lies and attempts to take attention away from these stories come in response whenever they happen. I&#39;m definitely expecting a major Pizzagate or Seth Rich revelation tonight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look how easily they steered the conversation away from the completely false misdirection claiming this is not a month old story. By all means, continue to discuss Podesta vs Trumpgate, but do realize that this was mor or less a successful forum slide on their part.</p>
