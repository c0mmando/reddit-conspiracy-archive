       Porn, commercials, tv, movies, msm and google are all strongly pushing for white women to get together with black men, I dont know why, but I noticed this about a year ago. Also: should be clear I am of arabic descent and dont have a white nationalist bone in my body. I just noticed this more and more over time. Also before they did this with white people/black people, they did this with everyone and Christianity. I am not a christian but every single tv show/song/comedian/artist absolutely SHOVED atheism down everyone's throats in north america during the last two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again: am not white or christian but I read between the lines and this message is clear.

       Still trotting out that same, tired "kicked out of 200 countries" line are you? Not only is that claim, at best,
       <a href="https://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm">
        questionable.
       </a>
       There are also other explanations more nuanced than "because Jews suck." I'll quote a  post from another redditor who explains things far better than I ever could:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let's start at the beginning. In 722 BCE, the Northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians and the majority of its population was apparently expelled. These are the "Ten Lost Tribes". This sort of forced migration seems to be part of standard part of Assyrian management of newly conquered territories. In about 586 BCE, the Southern Kingdom of Judah (remember, that Israel had been divided into two distinct kingdoms) was conquered by Babylon, and only the notables led off (the "Babylonian exile"). In neither of these cases do the Hebrew/Jews seems to be particularly singled out.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Lets skip to the Roman Era. Here, the Jews are unique. Roman policy granted wide religious freedom--however, there were two exceptions. 1) secret "mystery cults" were widely suspected, 2) groups that refused to sacrifice to the emperor (first Jews, later also Christians) were treated as suspect. The Jews led a series of wars against the Empire called the "Jewish Wars" that ended up with the destruction of the Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War (67-70 CE) and ultimately the majority of the Jewish population of Roman Province of Judea being killed, exiled, or sold into slavery in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 – 136 CE). These are exemplary of the unique relationship Jews have within the Roman Empire, but is likely not what you're asking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what people think of are the Medieval and Early Modern expulsions from states in Christian Europe. One thing to note is that Jews existed in these places at all. No other religion besides Christianity existed in these states at all. Judaism had a special status that, say, Roman Paganism did not, and therefore they (often) were the only religious minority allowed to exist. So, it's important to note, they were the only religious minority that could be expelled from Europe (besides various Christian "heretics"). It's worth noting that the vast majority of expulsions of Jews were done by Christians, with a few isolated (and generally late) cases of expulsion by Muslim rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karen Barkey and Ira Katznelson have an interesting article, whose name I forgot, that argues that the expulsion of the Jews by England in 1290 and France around the same time were the result of "state formation"/"state making". Remember, for most of post-Roman history the centralized state as we imagine didn't exist. It was an overlapping series of domains where rulers claimed varying levels of sovereignty. Katznelson and Barkey argue that the Jews were expelled in England as a compromise between the royalty and the nobility in the process of state formation (primarily, the nobility owned Jewish bankers a tremendous amount of money, as Jews often formed the only source of credit). In France, they argue that they were expelled for a different reason (I believe because the King owed them money, but I can't be sure). But in both cases, though the exact reasons were different, the expulsion of the Jews was part of the same process of state formation, a result of negotiations around the clashing interests of royalty and nobility. This pattern, they argue, is repeated in other states (Western and Northern Europe is generally seen at the vanguard of modern state formation in Europe--see Charles Tilly's epic Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also worth mentioning that Jews were often the only available scapegoats. Many of the expulsions took place during plagues, especially in Germany, where Jews were often accused of poisoning wells. They were also often occurred after an accusation of blood libel. Historically, it's worth noting that blood libel accusation (which date back to at least the 12th century in Christian Europe) never occurred in the Islamic World until the 19th century, and even there, not coincidentally, the first several cases accusation were brought by Christians living under Ottoman Rule at the same there was expanding European influence in the Ottoman. But in general, the relationship with minority communities was different in the Ottoman World (much is made of "dhimmi" status, but there's a reason for that--especially in the Ottoman Empire, the "millet system" in both formal and informal forms was an important strategy for rule). In the Muslim World, Jews and Christians were often included alongside Muslims as (unequal) subjects in a way that they were not in Europe. Granted, even these limited rights were frequently violated, but this legal framework of (unequal) belonging provided the Jews (and minority Christians) with much more stability than they had in most of Europe of the same period. This situation remains essentially until nationalism arrives in the 19th century century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nationalism, the idea that the legitimacy of the state comes from its relationship with a titular "nation" (France is for the French, Germany for the Germans), generally dates only back to the French Revolution (this is the traditional starting date). There were of course other forms identity underlying the legitimacy of states before this--especially religion, as John Armstrong argues in Nations Before Nationalism, but this wasn't really nationalism in the sense that we see (a political demand for a Christian state for all the Christian, etc.). A few scholars--Philip Gorski, Liah Greenfeld, Anthony Marx--have argued, convincingly I think, that we should see nationalism as an Early Modern phenomenon, rather than entirely a Modern one (remembering that "the Modern Era" for political history is conventionally dated to around the French Revolution). Among these, Marx argues most convincingly that nationalism comes not just from union--gathering all the Rutherians into the Rutherian state--but from exclusion. He engages with three main examples (England, Spain, and France). In Spain, we see this process of expulsion--this Proto-Spanish nationalism--in the form of the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492 (and from Portugal in 1496). This sets the ground for the later Spanish nation state. Similarly, in France we see expulsions, but not of Jews. Rather, we see France kill and expel Protestants to create a purely Catholic realm (cf. St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572). These sorts of expulsions were common during the European "Wars of Religion". So nationalism, and the drive to create in theory culturally homogenous states, wasn't merely a process that affected the Jews, though it was a process that often affected the Jews. It's also worth noting that "Jewish emancipation"--Jew being able function as equal citizens--doesn't emerge until the French Revolution, and the question of whether Jews can really be members of the nation-state isn't settled until the 19th and 20th centuries (cf. the Dreyfus Affair in France, or the Nazi stripping of the rights of German Jews). Many of the expulsions of Jews (and Catholics and Protestants, etc.) that occur during the early Modern Period, Anthony Marx argues, should be seen as examples of emerging nationalism where cultural identity becomes tied to the polity (compare this to earlier empires which were inherently diverse).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, therefore, recent social science works argues that 1) since Jews were the most common religious minority in Christian Europe, they were the ones most commonly persecuted against, 2) that a lot of the Medieval struggles around nationalism have to do with negotiations of elites around the beginnings of modern state formation/centralization, 3) I forgot to mention also the traditional answer of the late Medieval religious revival, including the Crusades, that ultimately led to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, which mattered in some places (especially when tied to Blood Libel), just not the French and English cases I mentioned, 4) eventually the goal of religious homogeneity presaged the overall goal of cultural homogeneity of nationalism. Again, this is all primarily in Europe until the 19th century, though there were large populations of Jews in Anatolia, North Africa, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Persia who were mostly unmolested. This, I think, is evidence that the repeated expulsion of the Jews is not necessarily something inherent in the Jews, but something (or several things) that characterized the relationship between Jewish minorities and Christian rulers during this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: One final note. In the video, they often repeat the names of territories in a relatively short period. The reason for this is Jews were expelled, here for either reasons related to Christian religious revival or debts due to state formation, and then were at times often quickly let back in for economic reasons (i.e. the state needed lines of credit that only the Jews could provide in this period), and then quickly expelled either for economic reasons again (rulers had quickly racked up debt) or because of a deal with religious revivalists. But the reasons they were let back in hints at one of the reasons they were expelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       You obviously can ignore historical context and continue to see the world in black and white if you want, or dismiss it as Marxist Jew propaganda or whatever, but that should at least give you some insight into why most people no longer blame the Jews for the bad things that have happened to them. I thought it might be helpful to bring the info directly to you, since you would probably never take the time to Google or DuckDuckGo it yourself.

       I'm a white liberal. I believe in equal rights for all variations of humanity, sexual or racial. That doesn't mean I support one group abusing another, that destroys that which I am trying to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while I support equal rights for Jewish people, I don't support Jewish people if they are engaged in collusion to support their own group even at the expense of others. Unproven suspicions of such activity should not be dismissed due to fear of being labeled antisemitic. That behavior is blatantly protective of such suspected collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This group, a subset of Jewish people, clearly is the most influential group compared to all other groups, especially considering its proportion of the population. They have AIPAC, an achievement that China and Russia could never achieve. We'd feel insecure, outraged and demand an end to ACPAC or ARPAC, citing concerns of foreign self-interests conflicting with our own, a valid concern, thrown out the window just for the Jews. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Israel get no repercussions for attacking the clearly marked USS Liberty, in such a fashion that indicated they sought to do so knowing that it was an ally's ship. They targeted communication systems. At the time, they were in conflict with Egypt and its speculated that if the attack was successful, it could have been used to get the USA to fight for Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we tolerate dual Israeli citizenship in our congress? Would we tolerate dual US/Chinese or US/Russian citizenship in congress. No. So why is there is an exception for Jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       How come several governments in the world decided it was a good idea to restrict the rights of their people to boycott Israel? How exceptional. Again, who else would this occur for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there is plenty of evidence, in spoken word and writing, of a Jewish perception of racial and cultural superiority and not only that, an intent to collude to further their own self-interests even at the expense of others. Their holy texts even have content that supports this perception of superiority, texts that helped them form their belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at political cartoons and propaganda against Jewish people, you can't miss the theme of fear of insidious, manipulative, subversive, self-serving behavior even at the expense of others, aka evil. Other racist propaganda is quite different. It's not fear of proficiency of a race, but a fear of how they drag society down due to inferiority. Racism against Jews is born out of fear of losing freedom and prosperity due to Jewish collusion to serve themselves even at the expense of others, not out of fear of losing prosperity out of the incompetence of the Jews that live with us, as black haters suggest about blacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop being so easily controlled by fear. Fear is always caused by beliefs. Fear is appropriate as long as those beliefs are accurate. False Evidence Appearing Real is a big cause of unnecessary fear. Is it irrational to suspect Jewish people for colluding with their group against those outside of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of evidence that they exert disproportionate influence. To shut up just because of the fear of being incorrectly labeled a racist or antisemitic is to indirectly react to False Evidence Appearing Real. I know I am not a racist or antisemitic, no matter what any brainwashed fools tell me. The truth is what it is no matter how poorly our thoughts and actions align with it. I won't trust peer pressure over my own mind and I wish nobody else would either. The world would definitely be a better place that way.

       I don't support Israel, and I don't like that the US and many other governments do so blindly. My problem is that many people on this sub basically seem to believe that there are "only Jews at the top of the pyramid." To the point where rich and powerful gentiles often get deemphasized because there is supposedly always an even more powerful Jew above them, telling them what to do. To the point where everything is eventually blamed on the Jews, regardless of who actually appears to be responsible. This is such a lazy line of logic, and one that is, more often than not, clearly born of pre-held biases rather than honest truth seeking. Of course Jews hold a lot of power. They've been known for that for that for centuries. Just don't make the mistake of thinking they control everyone else.

       I agree with you. They are just tools of the hierarchy that has come to enslave us. There are other tools of a similar nature. Jesuits, masons, and other secretive organizations are useful tools that were infiltrated, corrupted, deceived and utilized to serve the agenda of the foreign hierarchy, which is to infiltrate, corrupt, deceive and utilize all that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the epitome of the path of service to the self even at the expense of others, the path of manipulation of others, the path of pure competition, the path of evil or whatever you want to call it. The hierarchy that came here is so far evolved on this path, they are akin to a spiritual force. They don't like to be reminded that they embody the principle of the parasite. They are completely useless to all that is except for, other parasites, who find them useful for being more effective parasites.

       Because when race is brought up in the news it has to have a context. Nobody ever talks about the plight of the White American Athlete apart from what that means for other races.

       gives a scroll along the top of Google's search results and Edison is 6th, which is a higher ranking than I'd give him to be honest, Alexander Graham Bell is 10th and Morse is 18th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm ecstatic that Madam CJ Walker and Latimer are being thought of as the kind of influencers they truly were, but you cannot deny this list has a heavy lean that isn't entirely historically justified.  Hell, Tesla is 24th, Ford is 28th, Jobs is 42nd (ahead of Einstein) and Gates didn't even make the cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is someone at Google realized that significant, and justified, legwork needed to be done to classify African-American figures throughout US history as "Inventors", "Athletes", "Scientists" explicitly in the public record  who were not given their credit before.  That has in effect pushed these figures to the top of the list ahead of folks from other demographics who probably need the same kind of "key word" update.  Just looking at some of the people on the Inventors list, it's clear "Inventing" was secondary to their main pursuits but it was a qualification that could be justified in most instances so it's now been added.

       And now that I've done some reading up on Latimer since writing this comment because he's a very interesting figure, he's moved down to

       It's quite possible the results are dependent on your search history adjusting the results to what you've seen before and shown interest in.  But given the recent policies over at YouTube where people searching for "inflammatory" content are directed to videos debunking or countering alternative narratives, the fact that you're seeing something so completely different than what a bunch of "conspiracy theorists" are seeing should at least raise a red flag, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to go off the deep end of tin foil, but I am genuinely curious if this could be a factor.  How "liberal" or "mainstream" would you rate your browsing habits on a scale of 1-10?  Also, do you take steps to hide your browsing history in any way?

       This isnt a conspiracy, heres my take. Alot of the pictures have white backgrounds and its picking that up in the process. Google can easily fix this but i think they let it go just because.

       If you look up caucasian american athletes you get results as expected. Same way you would with african american athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when you lookup black american athletes it reroutes it to african american athletes. This is why i say google could easily fix it.

        Presumably, Google must get a lot of requests for “African American inventors” and assumes that’s what you really meant when you ask for “American inventors.” After all, what kind of sick Nazi do you have to be to be interested in your fellow Americans irrespective of race? That’s racist!

       You're the closest (as well as
       <a href="/u/gay_frog_shill">
        /u/gay_frog_shill
       </a>
       ) to what I'm fairly sure is the reason: they're not just mostly photos on white backgrounds - they're photos from stock image companies that are very well optimized for search.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tags in the images will all include: athlete, american, white (because customers can search what type of background an image has to narrow their search before buying the rights to it).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why using "caucasian" instead of white fixes it, because caucasian isn't a type of background.

       Are those keywords from the stock image sites being included in the image tags or the file names? It's been a while since I tried to optimise an image for search, but for the images to rank you should still need the keyword in the alt tag, incoming hyperlinks (both internal and external site links) and filename (less important).
      </p>
      <p>
       I only looked at a couple of images and neither were from stock image sites so you're probably right. There's definitely instances of Google seemingly changing their algorithm to display more "white-listed" sites for certain topics. I don't think they're specifically modifying individual queries (apart from highly spammed and transnational terms like "payday loan" or "online poker" etc. It wouldn't make financial sense to have to modify individual queries. I believe this is their Google Raters reviews coming in to play. So there will exist a list of preferred or white-listed sites that they'll have (probably things like snopes.com) that are shown for any slightly controversial queries.

       I didn't look much further in to it. Just my guess. I'm not that great at SEO either and it's just so difficult with all of the competition, sneaky tricks, and whatever Google is doing on the back-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fairly sure this whole thing is due to the stock image sites having very high authority from both domain/website age and good linking structures. You have to assume a stock image site knows how to SEO images very well, since that's their business.

       Because when race is brought up in the news it has to have a context. Nobody ever talks about the plight of the White American Athlete apart from what that means for other races. This is a Bullshit Post by a pretty new account that is trying to paint this sub as racist. Look through their history and see if you find the consistency.

       Hmmm... the search algorithm at DuckDuckGo at least (not sure about Bing) is so bad that I'm not sure SEO is even possible. As far as I know, you can't even submit your sitemap to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, I guess it has to be something like that - some weird SEO / algorithm at work. Otherwise these other search engines just copied how Google works.

       BTW, turn off safe search on Bing and you'll see something... different... for that search term you linked.

       Usually the "alt tag" of an image is what search engines use to determine the topic of a picture. Not sure about the others, but Google would then use the text of hyperlinks pointing to that image to determine how high it's ranking will be. For example, if 50 websites linked to an image with the text "boxer", then Google will think that this many websites linking to the same image with the same or similar anchor text means that it is relevant for the term "boxer". If a high-authority site (such as, the BBC or NYT) that Google trusts links to the image with the term "surfer" then it might take that link/anchor text into more consideration than the 50 websites linking with the term "boxer"
      </p>
      <p>
       What's confusing with the few images I looked at where that the alt text didn't contain anything to do with colour. Check out this image:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &lt;img data-src="
        <a href="http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/56660a98dd0895fe268b478b-1200/muhammad-ali.jpg">
         http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/56660a98dd0895fe268b478b-1200/muhammad-ali.jpg
        </a>
        " src="
        <a href="http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/56660a98dd0895fe268b478b-1200/muhammad-ali.jpg">
         http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/56660a98dd0895fe268b478b-1200/muhammad-ali.jpg
        </a>
        " alt=
        <strong>
         "Muhammad Ali"
        </strong>
        border="0" class="slide-image-large"&gt;
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You can see from the alt text above  (and the image file name which is another factor that Google considers (although this is not weighted as heavily as the alt text) that it is "Muhammad Ali"
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless there are lots of websites (or one or two high authority sites) linking to the image uses terms like "white", "american" or "athlete" then it doesn't make much sense why this one is appearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's definitely an agenda from Google at the moment in terms of what it chooses to display. Check out terms related to "medieval warm period" and "medieval warm period emails east anglia" on Google and DuckDuckGo. They show totally different results. The emails from east anglia university were hacked in early 2000s and showed climate scientists saying things like "we need to get rid of the medieval warming period" as it showed that in England people were making wine, meaning that man's contribution to climate change might not be as significant as portrayed by some of the mainstream establishments. On Google the results are mainly trying to debunk this claim while on DuckDuckGo, the results are about the hacked emails and how it put the climate scientists in a poor light. I've started to use DuckDuckGo whenever there is a mildly controversial thing I'm trying to look up otherwise I need to wade through pages of results to find something critical of the mainstream position or else refine the query so much that I end up on sites where everything is written in all caps by a raving lunatic

       That's interesting because initially I thought maybe Google were taking the word black from the phrase to mean the color of the photo itself, like a shortened version of 'black and white'. But when you search for 'monochrome american athlete' it seems white athletes are under-represented there too.

       The race of white athletes often isn't directly addressed unless it's in contrast to a racial minority. Looks like the athletes Google is showing are athletes who were notable because of their race, like Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali. I would guess that things on the internet written about these types of people would discuss "white athletes" more than other material out there in the internet. When merely writing about a white athlete though, they're unlikely to be described as being "white". That's just how our culture works. Ateast I think that's a plausible explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said this seems really strange. I would have though Google's algorithm would be able to understand context enough to realize that Jackie Robinson is not a "white athlete". Has it always been like this?
