To pit an inarguable social ideal against policies that have to concentrate on the details and variables makes for impossible arguments and further division.</p>

<p>We have our demo/repub healthcare division, while they&#39;re killing and poisoning us with abandon. </p>

<p>They&#39;ve hidden the overseas wars from us so much, that the parties are nearly identical in that matter, as are liberals and conservatives both at the top and in the masses.</p>

<p>The biggest danger I&#39;m seeing is the &quot;right to free expression,&quot; the recent and very overt censorship/policies by Google, YouTube, the universities, SJW media whores, etc. are new, or at least the their thoroughness and openness are new, and we can&#39;t let that happen in our daily encounters. The more frightening thing is how the perceived &quot;safe space&quot; of discourse is creeping into our social/local environments. We&#39;ve already been instructed as to what our opinions &amp; attitudes of certain groups of people and events should be over the last century, and that list seems to have hit an exponential curve. If you frequent this sub, how many times have you bitten your tongue when someone strikes up a convo with you in public?</p>

<p>If someone claims to be one of those labels, or accuses you of being one for something you think, break through that as soon as you can and try to guide the interaction towards what is true (or what evidence towards truth we have available). We have to kill the labels. Language is an important key in dissolving their power to divide us. </p>

<p>The Radical Right Militia Movement has just as much in common with eco-anarcho-communists on the left and they often dont understand that. The government and big business use the mainstream media and misinformation to keep our groups unorganized. It is a divide and conquer tactict the ruling class uses against the wage slaves. Generational differences, gender differences, racial tensions, this is all used to get us to fight against each other instead of banding together to demand back the power of our futures.</p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about authoritarianism? Yeah, there are authoritarians on the right and authoritarians on the right. They often like to call themselves &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot;, but they&#39;re authoritarians as a personal philosophy. That&#39;s the issue. Authoritarian vs anti-authoritarian. It&#39;s support for the wealthy &quot;elite&quot; who control everything vs support for &quot;common&quot; individual people. </p>

<p>Many people want the government to do more, which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;more government&quot;. Also, the same people who claim to want &quot;small government&quot; are often false witnesses for that ideology (military adventurism, abortion, etc.)</p>

<p>The whole basis of a representative democracy is <strong>compromise</strong> and good-faith deliberation between many points of view. Irreconcilability and partisan tribalism is antithetical to that idea. Which might explain why congress has a 10% approval rating.</p>

<p>Not accurate at all.</p>

<p>People who like liberty for all want open borders. This includes libertarians AND the neoliberal scum you&#39;re thinking of. You also are ignoring the fact that most progressives on the left would probably not want open borders. I&#39;m a libertarian myself and I think it would be nice if our borders were more open. I cross the border frequently myself and it&#39;s 100% bullshit. It&#39;s a complete joke and it&#39;s just an excuse for authority figures to fuck with you when you&#39;ve done nothing to deserve it. Ever hear the term &#39;security theater&quot;? That&#39;s what our borders are. </p>
