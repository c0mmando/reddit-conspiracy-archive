       Guess WaPo will have to keep buying ads on Reddit...
      </p>
      <p>
       Top posts in r\worldnews often get 30K+ ...so having a stickied AMA with just 1,400 points over an entire weekend shows very low response/participation by users.  (AMA session began 11 AM EST Friday)

       Wow. Why is that AMA in worldnews, and why has it been stickied now for

       Heyho. Three or four anonymous sources confirming what each have said, becomes fact.

       So right my fellow conspiracy user! When such quality journalism from places without bias or a history of blatant corruption, like the Washinton Post, make it organically to the top of places with zero political bias and a base or well-informed, mature, educated users, like r-worldnews, then you can be sure that are reading quality information worthy of being presented by a completely fair and neutral platform like reddit's amazing "popular" page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, anonymous sources are a great way to test the allegiance of your followers. Since the strength of, accountability of, and very existence of an anonymous source is only as strong as the word of the person presenting you with their unverifiable testimony, two very clear options are available:
      </p>
      <p>
       One) You believe because
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         you are a stand-up citizen
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the news never lies
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         media outlets are free of political bias
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the media would never throw together a story based on presenting a conclusion they already decided to present before doing their totally unbiased "research"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Two) You incorrectly question it because
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         you are a member of t_d
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you are being paid by Putin to post on the internet
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you smell a bit and people don't like you enough to tell you
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         you clearly have an agenda to turn reddit into t_d ver2.0 because anything less than full cooperation with anything related to how awful Trump is makes you a Trump apologist, Trump voter, and person who walks around in public wearing a MAGA hat
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So I personally, and I am sure my
       <em>
        fellow conspiracy users
       </em>
       would also agree that when you have the trifecta of great journalism like
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the Washington Post
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit's prestigious "World News" subreddit
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reddit's totally unmanipulated "Popular" page
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       then it is very clear that only enemies of the
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         US
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Global Good
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Milky Way Galaxy
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       would ever dare to show dissent by questioning the anonymous sources that we know are genuine and we totally haven't reached a point where today's news (from anonymous sources) is being pushed onto people who will blindly believe it because of yesterday's news (from anonymous sources).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading my fellow conspiracy members. Now you know what to do in order to make sure this comment section becomes a perfect clone of an r-"politics" comment section. Another bastion of amazing journalism on this fine website we call reddit.

       I'm not saying to trust all anonymous sources. I am simply expressing that the notion that anonymous sources are what all journalism is based on. No matter what you use whether it be breitbart, CNN, your neighbors conspiracy blog. All of it in past or present was originally from an anonymous source. Over time sources become known, but it often isn't until years after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I do not hate or even dislike Trump supporters. I may think the  president is buffoon, but I think he was putting fingers on issues that had been bugging people for a long time. He personified the anger that stemmed from being lied to and conned by the government for nearly 60 years. So in the vein I can't blame people for voting for him. He also ran against the literal embodiment of government corruption in America which didn't hurt him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that we truly want the same thing for our country, to be prosperous and to be safe. However, we disagree on how to come to those means.

       Your first comment is going to be gang-upvoted simply because of the way it will be interpreted by the "totally real fellow conspiracy users of this sub" who gang-upvote anything that dismisses the very valid point the OP is making.

       Their statement about anonymous sources is correct, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The posts recent record of professionalism is horrendous garbage and has totally destroyed mine and many others trust in them. So why would I believe their anonymous sources when I don't trust them? I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seymour hersch as a counter example also uses anonymous sources and I tend to believe him based on his record of professionalism and the trust he has built. Does this mean him and his anonymous sources are always right? Of course not. But I do not believe he is producing news pieces with the direct goal of deceiving me.

       Honestly, I hope it keeps happening. For some reason people on reddit are flagrantly naive as to how many corporations/governments/manipulators are on here and the more blatant it gets the more the site will lose its appeal and die (which it deserves)
