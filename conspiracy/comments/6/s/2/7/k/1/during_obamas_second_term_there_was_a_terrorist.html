       Seriously there was such a large number of attacks during the Obama presidency that the only reasonable conclusion is that at least a few were carried out by the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook, Charleston Church shooting, Pulse. All of these involved federal involvement on some level and reek of a deliberate false flag attack to divide the public. Don't forget what's at stake here.

       neither sandy hook nor charleston was a terrorist attack. pulse was domestic terrorism, though because the guy was gay himself and a patron of that bar, it could be seen as a personal/revenge attack rather than terrorism

       At the bar with only 4500 square feet, less than 3000 of usable indoor space excluding bathrooms and patio.... And the most suspicious, only 12 parking spots, on an intersection, with no parking or car garages nearby... How did 300 ppl get there... How did they fit.. That way outside of fire code.. 
Are they all driving clown cars or are they being bussed in, ya know like a production....

       You know that in cities most people take public transportation or walk to places - especially they intend on drinking. I live in a city and can name many clubs that will have that number or more on a busy night and they have zero parking spaces.

       When ever I go drinking I don't take a car because I don't want to leave a vehicle at the bar all night and I don't want to drive it back and risk getting arrested. A lot of people probably took public transport or cabs because if your going to get drunk it is stupid to drive to the bar yourself because you will need to retrive it in the morning.

       A "bomb" that hurt no one.  Was so small that it was extinguished immediately.  A getaway pickup truck which just screams "look, it was a bunch of muslim hating rednecks!".

       If you want to doubt it, fine. You're acting like we're stupid for believing it when all you've got is "it seems fishy".

       I don't know why it's hard to believe a homemade bomb wouldnt perform very well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truck one is just meaningless. What kind of car should be used if it's a real attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe it's easier to chuck something into an office instead of walking into the center of the mosque with a bomb.

       We are using common sense. Your assertion that we're not is probably why you got so many downvotes.

       Worry not, I have great relations with women and I respect them if they deserve it. Just like I respect men, when they deserve it. But you keep at it with your retarded gatekeeping assumptions while I read today's top post (Stoicism and happy living without cares).

       Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance is a classic. I suggest looking into a summary of it. It explores the concept of quality and the contrast between romantic people and rational people.
Seneca is also a stoic philosopher much like Aurelius. Also worth reading his work. On the shortness of life I think is the bit that I read and I quite enjoyed it.

       Do you not have a hard time reconciling that respect for women with hanging out on a place that thinks they're incapable of love, that good women are unicorns and don't exist (AWALT), and has a link on their sidebar reading "women, the most responsible teenager in the house"?

       Well, the stoicism is something I got out of it. The importance of:

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lifting
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Meditating
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Making something of your life
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         knowing that people could always fuck you over (you're in this alone)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         knowing that women like dominance, confidence and someone who'll sweep her of her feet (I was the opposite of this, kept wondering why I couldn't get any)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         realizing that women aren't everything
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         putting yourself first in life
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and more. But these are the main points.

       The Syrian gas attack was a false flag. It's not clear that this was actually authorized by the US, or just their former lapdog, ISIS, but it definitely was false flag.

       Maybe it's because now that Trump's around there is no need to divide the public, Trump himself is serving that purpose. The problem with Obama was he was a little too good at bringing people together, thus the need for attacks.
