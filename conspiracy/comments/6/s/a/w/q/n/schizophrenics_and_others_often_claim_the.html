    <div class="md"><p>There is an article called &quot;is your cat making you crazy,&quot; i think in the Atlantic. They claim that scientific research has concluded that schizophrenia is caused by a parasite called toxoplasemia that takes up residence in the brain.

    <div class="md"><p>That is correct. It seems there are other invaders that can also make a nest in your brain, causing schizophrenia. It is speculated that maybe the reason there are different types of schizophrenia is because different invaders do different types of damage. But as far as i&#39;m aware, toxoplasemia is the only invader they have a definitive connection with schizophrenia, the rest are speculative at this point. But i may be years behind current research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never cited where someone would get toxoplasemosis. I simply said it is a known cause of schizophrenia. Read the article i cited. Toxoplasmosis is passed in sperm and 50% of fetuses are born with it if the father is infected. Hence the belief that it is a genetic disorder. The most common way to get it is undercooked meat. You can get it from cleaning up after a mouse that got into your house if you weren&#39;t wearing gloves. It sounds like you are trying to deny toxoplasemia infections exist. </p>

<p>I used to be in what I call &quot;the zone&quot; all the time some years ago.
It&#39;s the biggest thrill of my life, but then it&#39;s also terrifying to a scope few can understand. </p>

<p>Once you get in sync with these things your perception will change and everything will get very weird quickly. Then it gets worse but there&#39;s no turning back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you&#39;re coming from. When someone just gives you the runaround and doesn&#39;t do anything to help it makes you distrust them. But at the same time I get where they are coming from. I&#39;ve had exactly that sort of interaction where I just couldn&#39;t be bothered to back myself up because either I was just tired, or what I&#39;d seen that got me to my point I&#39;d seen a long time ago and it would take a long time to find it again, or even on occasion I&#39;d not actually have anything and later on I would realise that I was wrong before. But I guess what I&#39;m saying is try not to make blanket statements or label anyone absolutely (this goes for them, you, and even myself obviously. Everyone) because you only had an interaction with them at that point in time and in that context. It&#39;s not the full picture or an accurate representation of them. Also don&#39;t insult them like calling them a &quot;pathetic human&quot; because that&#39;s just horrible. Attack the argument or leave it, just don&#39;t attack the person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ieuan, I agree with your comment up to a certain point. Science can be slow, science can be boring, but eventually those outside influences would also be tested.   </p>

<p>After all the genuine science being done (not the &quot;we&#39;ve done one test on a mouse and will publish we&#39;ve cured cancer&quot; bullshit) introduces questions and problems to our gaps in knowledge that people couldn&#39;t comprehend before.</p>

<p>I know that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t then use science and say that disproves a theory like demons completely, for that I&#39;ll use common sense.   </p>

<p>I&#39;m an advocate for a more serious platform for mental health and a hell of a lot more help and knowledge to be mainstream, but as a personal stand point right now, demons are make believe like other deities and it is human to want to shift the blame onto something or someone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it! Just for clarification; I&#39;m not agreeing with the point op makes that supposes demons are responsible for mental health problems. I personally think that&#39;s a mix of things (generally: genetics, physical health, social conditioning/relative circumstance etc).<br/>
But what I won&#39;t do is rule out demons entirely. Neither would I rule out aliens, spirits, ghosts or any other extradimensional entity. And that&#39;s simply because the mainstream models of science we use today do not allow for the faculties to be able to reliably or accurately either prove or disprove them. And that&#39;s because generally these things are unreliable in the first place and therefore just can&#39;t be studied when you have no idea when or where a demon will show itself in whatever form it does, or when a ufo will show up, or a ghost or anything. The only reliable way to do that is via someone experienced in said phenomena. But then you have to mention the number of people who fake this stuff for money - that just muddies the waters to make research that was difficult in the first place now near impossible. And some experiences that are so significant, so personal and so subjective to some people that completely solidify belief in said phenomena - be it possession, seeing a ufo (I&#39;m in this category), or being haunted - become impossible to disprove when you bring science into it because it&#39;s either already happened and can&#39;t be replicated or it was such a personal thing that it&#39;s just impossible to even understand unless you were the experiencer.
It&#39;s a complex issue. So many variables and so many things that are unfalsifiable that most of the time these issues either rely on belief or direct experience to have anyone understand. I don&#39;t rule anything out, but I also don&#39;t speak my opinions as if they&#39;re absolute law. I try as often as I can to say when I&#39;m stating a belief based on my own perspectives and experiences as opposed to any kind of objective truth. And I believe in a reasonable amount of &quot;crazy&quot; things based on my experiences... But from my perspective it isn&#39;t crazy at all. It just makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mental illness is a lack of integrity of the system of the mind. A computer network is like a mind in some ways. It connects nodes together to exchange data as an organization. Our brains do a similar thing with our bodies, with a lot of processing in between of course.</p>

<p>A network with poor integrity is easier to hack. Hackers infiltrate, corrupt, and insert deceptive signals into the system, in order to utilize it to serve themselves.</p>

<p>Trolls are schadenfreude loving beings. They get a high out of getting others into negative emotions. They exist in other species and maybe even entire species.</p>

<p>Perhaps demons are just ET trolls that get a rise out of putting people into negative emotions. Perhaps mentally ill people can be opportunities for these beings to more easily cause negative energy releases, their soul food.</p>

<p>Bonus, they can even do it in the open, because we will dismiss all assertions that demons are messing with the subject as insane conjecture. </p>

<p>People suffering from schizophrenia may hear “voices” – auditory hallucinations – differently depending on their cultural context, according to new Stanford research.</p>

<p>In the United States, the voices are harsher, and in Africa and India, more benign, said Tanya Luhrmann, a Stanford professor of anthropology and first author of the article in the British Journal of Psychiatry.

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t that entirely depend upon their intentions that would affect you?</p>

<p>We have a tendency of projecting our expectations of our own selves being in the situations of others, but it is deceptive.</p>

<p>Some beings are more adherent to the golden rule than you or I are. That is to treat others the way you would want to be treated. They generally want beings to evolve themselves, so they become unique and independent minded. If they interfere too much, we absorb their perspectives and behaviors and don&#39;t develop uniquely. </p>

<p>However, due to unfortunate circumstances outside of the control of a given species, they will help in the least interfering ways they can. They&#39;re helping us this way with an infestation problem we&#39;re having. They can&#39;t stress enough that they are not here to save us. We are set up to be like needy, lazy petulant children by corruptors. It sure does put a wrench in the works for the benevolent beings. </p>

<p>On the opposite side of free will choice, there a beings who choose to steal the freedom of others using their own freedom. They not only enslave others, they often enslave their own species, in a repressive hierarchy. They abuse knowledge and technology to do it too. Our infestation is of this type of being, of course. </p>

<p>We&#39;re more in the middle, in between being valuable support for others and being useless eaters, parasites on others. They are not equally valid ways of life, but one can choose either way one wills to do. Parasites need hosts while hosts are best without parasites. The parasites can&#39;t live on their own, because they don&#39;t want to support their own beings, their own minds, by producing their own joys. They want the pirate&#39;s life. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to fear the benevolent beings. They also won&#39;t help you in ways that erode your own struggle to arrive at personal responsibility, because they want beings to be in control of themselves, in self-determination. They hang out in the background and help when others can&#39;t help themselves, they are not genies or servants, but wise, loving brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>You are right to be concerned about the other kind of being though. They are parasites on others. They are entropy incarnate. They produce almost no value and destroy so much value, just for gratification or personal advantages. They are often called demons, but they are really just spoiled ancient manchildren that never want to be responsible to others. They are much more technological than supernatural. Although, there is an obvious spiritual connection to this fundamental choice of how to treat others. It can be seen with one&#39;s own mind&#39;s eye, without any need for packages of Belief Systems (BS) to fill in the gaps. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In fiber optic illusion
The flickering eyes
By flourescent lights
Supplicate before machines,
Self-reflecting</p>

<p>The legend of modernity:
The phosphenes explode
God&#39;s eternal strobe
Through the holy filament,
Graven image&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Using any noise source, specific frequencies from that source can be amplified perceptually. So, encoding a voice pattern into a noise source is simply a matter of timing of the neuronal pathways that amplify the perception of the projected voice frequencies. In my research into FBI cases and interviews with government test subjects, it is obvious that any noise source can be used and in some cases not even necessary depending on the individual’s brain amplification. I have read testimony that describes how refrigerators or even Rice Krispies would talk to test subjects. In my demonstration, I had a rain maker/white noise generator running. It had a single speaker.
The message was complex, patterned, and repetitive. I heard a sequence of four words which rotated through 10 other sets after each phrase was uttered in a poetic style.
The phrases were, “Talk to your governor”. “I’ll bring you coffee”. “I am the secretary.” “Now, raise a caucus”. “Dukakis went to Harvard”. “Join their cosmology department”. This game got boring to me since I was not a spy and turned off by the cloak and dagger bullshit. I would walk away. At about 10 feet away from the noise source, the message became “Get back here!” It was all computer generated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both relative silence and natural background sounds IRL can turn into words if you&#39;re on enough drugs, sort of like seeing faces in clouds. Schizophrenia is basically tripping 24/7.</p>

<p>Sometimes I&#39;ll be watching an old program or film and I can hear something else going on, like another tape being played or background voices. None of that stuff was noticeable with old TV/movie speakers so they didn&#39;t bother cleaning it up or preventing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m schizophrenic but hearing the tv in the background really bothers me sometimes. I don&#39;t think its the subliminal type voices that we&#39;re hearing; it&#39;s more along the lines of the way the audio is processed and which frequencies are the most prominent. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re a conspiracy nut, you should know that there are helpful and hurtful frequencies that affect our bodies and minds. I think that in the case of most popular, modern tv shoes; the audio is processed in a way (and the shows directed in such a way) that makes negative emotion arise. Like many other things, tv is a conditioning tool. Conditioning us to always be in that doom and gloom/ anger/ denial state of mind. </p>

<p>Get rid of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mental illness is a lack of integrity of the system of the mind. A computer network is like a mind in some ways. It connects nodes together to exchange data as an organization. Our brains do a similar thing with our bodies, with a lot of processing in between of course.</p>

<p>A network with poor integrity is easier to hack. Hackers infiltrate, corrupt, and insert deceptive signals into the system, in order to utilize it to serve themselves.</p>

<p>Trolls are schadenfreude loving beings. They get a high out of getting others into negative emotions. They exist in other species and maybe even entire species.</p>

<p>Perhaps demons are just ET trolls that get a rise out of putting people into negative emotions. Perhaps mentally ill people can be opportunities for these beings to more easily cause negative energy releases, their soul food.</p>

<p>Bonus, they can even do it in the open, because we will dismiss all assertions that demons are messing with the subject as insane conjecture. </p>
