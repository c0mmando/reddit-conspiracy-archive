       Nothing weird about that right? Or that the bulk of replies to all the real conspiracies are AGAINST them being real? What a sad state r/conspiracy has come to. It will always hold a place in my heart for waking me up years ago...but I don't see how anybody could go from sleep to woke in its current state.

       a certain political agenda that attacks certain people is consistently voted to the top, but only votes for the post itself, the top comments usually contradict the point of the post.

       If I had to guess, I'd say it was an extra-national force. Not directly associated with a political party, with an imperative to stir conflict. To get very speculative, I'd say it was directed and funded by the Kremlin via the GRU for the express goal of inciting internal American conflict. Time will tell.

       I think the way you got downvoted proved your point btw, and I get exactly what you are saying. This is not a free place to discuss hidden things we want to question. Most posts are just downvoted. Its all about an opinion and not about contributions to the conversation.  That's not how voting is supposed too work.  Not only did you contribute to the conversation,  you even started one.  And still butt hurt narrow minded people downvoted you because their opinion is different. The opposite of fostering conversion and discussion.  Fucking echo chamber in here since last year.  Its sad, but I don't bother with it much anymore.  Its close to dead.  That's my opinion aholes. You don't need to agree with it,  but it did contribute to the conversation.

       It's funny because you guys have been sold a meme that takes ownership of the word "investigation" in your minds.  Fascinating, and I can see how it works.  It's the first story you think of when you hear the word, and if the very real and bigger investigation is brought up, it reminds you of the other that's dominantly associated with the word.  Mind owned on that topic as long as the story is fed to a community with evolving details.

       you like to let the shills post and change your opinion?  when upvotes are being sold how is this any different from CNN? you need to discuss to help filter out the fakes and bullshit. if no-one posts, discusses and argues then it literally is just a news outlet spoon feeding you an opinion.

       This, and I think the vast majority of shit posted here is just that. It wouldn't be very productive of me to just constantly post how insane such-and-such is, so I don't post. But I also want to stay informed from a diverse set of sources to avoid echo chambering myself and every so often a reasonable topic comes along here, so I'm subscribed to keep some of the bigger topics showing up on my front page.

       I'm in a similar boat.  Once in a great while I'll see something interesting that makes me put some serious thought into a topic.  That's why I'm here.  However, I have to shift through months of absolute nonsense to find these rare pieces.  Nothing against the people who are into conspiracy theories on every front, but that's not me.

       Been subbed for several years. Rarely comment, vote, or participate in any way. Mostly because I've grown up, educated myself more, and find very few new/interesting things here - and because this place has gone downhill in a big way. It's overrun by idiots and the Trump love has pushed me even further away. Downvotes may now commence.

       Please leave, it's users like you that are a detriment to this sub. I've been here for 8 years. The only thing alarming I see is comments like yours being upvoted with more votes than a typical
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       post, and the addition of several questionable mods. Other than that, the sky is not falling,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I can do the same thing. I could have this very comment upvoted for practically nothing. I know this sub well enough to know it's

       users would do nothing but downvote you.

       Several other mods passed up on banning that post, as saying it violates rule 10 is a incredible stretch of the English language.

       As you already know, I didn't allude to being a senior member of this community for the purpose of saying who should leave, but to assure our members that all is well. Conspiracy is no different today than it was when I got here in 2009. Trump supporters are the minority- they just make more noise than everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who attempt to convince the community that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is failing
       <strong>
        have always been here
       </strong>
       . Such individuals should be seen as nothing more than red herring, as we have plenty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've debated you in the past. You're opinions are usually in-line with anti-conspiracy skepticism. You're one of those weird members who like to claim you're here for "entertainment". I certainly don't go into communities I'm not welcomed in attempting to change/influence group consensus.

       Me too, I love conspiracies n stuff. Mostly ones that have to do with ancient history. Stuff like the pyramids being much older then we think. Anyway, I would probably post here but I see alot of people treated pretty badly if they disagree. Just because I don't agree with some things, doesn't make me a agent of the government or something. lol

       Reddit played a huge role in that election which is why there are so many shills here.

       Of course shills are losing so badly they may as well be on our team because they can't even outsmart teenagers trolling.

       But Trump won the election. That means all criticisms of Trump or his fanbase on reddit are invalid. The millions of subscribers on the_donald exist. Their petitions that fill to get more than a few thousand votes are alternative facts. The truth is optional. Thinking is undesired.

       I can't even follow the logic, probably because there is none. Reddit playing a large part in trump winning is laughable, clearly an attempt at attaching ones self to a larger movement in an attempt to feel significant.

       Nah I think it's just a reach to say that Reddit is a major battleground in the arena of American politics in the grand scheme of things. Also, Donald winning doesn't validate any of the other claims you're making on its own.

       They got caught cooking the subscriber numbers in The_Donald, too. They wanted to make it look like Trump was a fringe viewpoint, to create silos: The_Donald for Trump supporters, and the rest of reddit for Trump-bashing.

       What policy decisions or legislation has Donald Trump implemented thus far? All of my knowledge is about his executive orders, which operate beyond the scope of the normal branches of government.

       Executive orders are a concrete thing you can criticize. But go out into the rest of reddit and see how rare it is for criticisms of him to be based on things he's done, or facts.

There is actually a fairly small group of users that make up the majority of comments and posts here.

       This is true! Sad but true. I love this sub, it's actually the main sub I look at on Reddit. But I don't make a lot of my own posts, an I only comment occasionally when I feel I can add to the discussion or have a funny comment. I don't like to argue so if I think a comment will start a fight I just don't post it.

       While I can appreciate you don't like to argue, I do think it's good to speak up.  Many think this sub has been taken over - depending on who you ask it's either gone to the far right or far left.  When I'm reading through a thread, I like to see who comments because it helps give me perspective.  You don't have to argue, sometimes just commenting alone is enough.

       That said, I totally respect whatever reasons YOU may be here, that is just my singular perspective.

       A conversation with multiple contributors will likely have a much wider, and diverse range of comments, than a conversation with relatively few people speaking up.

       I must admit, I often delete drafts because I am not 100% behind the post. It's hard to overcome this self-censorship, even knowing the value of contributions.

       Even if you aren't 100% behind your statement, it's a good place to hash out your thoughts.  If someone pushes back, you can just "meh, I don't really care all that much" out of it.  Or, you debate it out and realize 1.) the flaw in your thinking; or 2.) that in fact you really
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       100%.

       I don't post much (never really) but if I did, I'd want all kinds of feedback.  Especially this sub which always runs a risk of being an echo chamber.

       I agree with this, argument or not, if you have something factual to say or something that pertains to the conversation then post it. Even if you don't respond if the topic is interesting enough it can spawn a whole host of conversation out of it. People are gonna argue/disagree with almost anything you say, as long as you're intentions are good and you aren't "shit posting" then comment away. I'll put any dumb idea I have into the comments may to see where others stand on it, if people don't like it I try to do more research and see if they have legitimate reasons for it and if it's just personal attacks then I try not to let my ego get the best of me lol

       I'd post in this sub if the content was any good, but 90% of what is posted here is absolute shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the top 5 stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Steve Bannon Wants Facebook and Google Regulated Like Utilities" - Quality content. That's why it has 400 comments and 1600 upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       "CIA psychologists that designed torture program to face trial" - How is this a conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Dianne Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi lived in the same exclusive GATED neighborhood, full of multimillion dollar homes, this guy just bought the street, love it" - No idea who these people are. Not really a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Wall Street Fines Down 66% Under Trump's Goldman Sachs-Filled Administration: "You do have to wonder when working-class Trump supporters will start to notice such things." " - Acceptable article, but really poor for a conspiracy subreddit. It just states some facts without telling us why we should care about this, or how does this affect us or anything of substance at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd fame): ‘On the Altar of Zionism, They (The Congress of the United States of America) Want to Tear Up the Constitution (of The United States of America)’ through the Israel Anti-Boycott Act law, punishing Americans with million dollar fines and 20 year jail terms." - Why are we listening to what a washed musician has to say about Israel? I have to give props to the fact that the article is way better than the title makes it seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for discussion to be stimulated we would need stricter moderation, but stricter moderation is against the principles of this sub for good reason.

       The problem with this subreddit is not so much the content, but the sheer lack of critical thought from its users. It's like people here would rather read absolute crap than read something that actually challenges their preconceptions on a give topic.

       Exactly, and it manifests in how comments that go against the narrative get downvoted. The OP here talks about "real conspiracies that people try to debunk" but doesn't realize that this is exactly the kind of discussion we need.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a "listen and believe" subreddit. It's a discussion. When someone criticizes your ideas, it should make you proud, and make you think. If you come up against an argument you can't refute, be an adult and analyze your own argument. Maybe you got something wrong, or maybe you just missed a key element to the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we see things like pizzagate gaining traction, and an echo chamber forming because all the detractors are essentially bullied into not participating in the discussion. Then when it becomes mainstream, the entire community is vilified by people who don't even want to engage, but just want to use us as a scapegoat to try and increase censorship.

       I've read a lot about more and more fuckery going on in this sub as well as other conspiracy related subs as of late-since the election basically. Anyone see the post last week by a former regular user who said this sub was infiltrated and how they were starting another sub?...who then went on to make another sub because evidently that one faces a similar fate.

       Shouldn't there be another flare up right now then? The Trump/Russia conspiracy theory couldn't get more mainstream, although they seem to be backing off it a little bit now since they don't want to be seen as the new "birthers" when it crumbles.

       No, I don't think I did. Where is the flare up? The whole point of this post is that there is very little activity at the moment, despite having a very mainstream conspiracy theory to discuss, like there was 2012 Mayans / FEMA camps back then.

       I just don't see that. Anything anti-Trump gets voted up. When there is news on the Russia conspiracy theory, it is popular on this sub. There just isn't much news about it right now. It's fizzling out, not flaring up.

       On T_D one of the mods even made a thread about them rotating but cant remember the reasoning behind it tho.  It might have had something to do with them just taking a break or something.

       That and some probably don't want to upvote things because they fear they will be targeted etc.  The people's fear of their own government is palpable.  It's very sad, but can you really blame them?

       I have hope that this will get better, and that is not just blind hope.  Keep taking and be gracious in those conversations.  Be willing to listen more and wait so that that your words will not fall on deaf ears.  Help others, too, in your daily life so that your words will not be maligned.  Not only is that the road to progress, but you will live a more fulfilling life that way.

       I see people like you complaining that "Trumptards" have taken over this sub. It's just not the case. Look at the comments in any post... anything vaguely pro-Trump is voted down, and anything anti-Trump is voted up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is a good example of this. Where is the army of "Trumptards" sending your comment in to the negative?

       It has nothing to do with the substance of the comments either. Someone could roll their face across their keyboard and then type "Trump bad" at the end... it will get more upvotes.

       You must be looking at a different sub then. People post nonstop about Russian hacking being BS, how Seth Rich is a leaker, and that Trump is taking out the "Deep State." So much so that people started calling this place a T_D 2.0 circle jerk.

       I'm down to -6 on that comment now. The one I was replying to is at +41. Your comment will be voted up. I'm looking at the same sub. If this were "T_D 2.0", don't you think the numbers would be reversed? Let's be realistic here. Where is this army of "Trumptards" to keep my comment out of the negatives and stop the other comment from being +41? Just looking at the numbers here, and it doesn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never go to T_D sub, probably for the same reason others dislike it: their mission seems to be to create a "safe space", and I don't like that. I want to hear from people with different opinions. That's why I almost never vote up/down any comments or posts. I don't want to hide anyone's opinions. A lot of people do want to hide them though, and they're here on this sub too.

       Seth Rich being a leaker is a great conspiracy theory, same with the "Deep State". It has all of the ingredients you need. Whether it's true or not... we may never know, but it's a great story nonetheless. Completely worthy of being discussed in a conspiracy section.

       Because they don't go around negging every anti-Trump comment or upvoting every pro-Trump one. People have also caught onto the antics and are pretty damn tired of it so the opposing voice is getting louder now. Try making a post(not comment) critical of Trump/Putin/Russia, something obviously legit, and watch it get negged into oblivion while a bunch of users deny the obvious reality of your post.

       While I personally think the whole Seth Rich thing is complete bullshit
       <em>
        I agree people should be able to discuss it here and entertain the conspiracy
       </em>
       . What I don't agree with is the lack of balance of topics which is done intentionally. This sub consistently ignores and downplays whats potentially the biggest conspiracy in American history while the same handful of topics get repeatedly astroturfed ad naseum even though a large portion of subscribers think the topics are propaganda. Its ridiculous

       Where are all of the "negged" anti-Trump posts, and where is the opposite? The numbers, both in posts and comments, just don't agree with this assertion that the sub has been overrun by "Trumptards".

       Just ignore my reply to you with all of the links and numbers then, after you basically asked me for it. Those pesky numbers always get in the way of a good story. It's so inconvenient to those trying to create this illusion of a "Trumptard" army invading a once-peaceful sub...

       You can also just look at the front page of conspiracy right now... or anytime and know you are full of shit and the person you were replying too is right. You TD morons shitted this sub up so hard its not even the same and everyone can see it with their own eyes but you try to convince people their own eyes are wrong.. hehehe.

       You don't see them because they rarely make it out of 'new' meanwhile the front page is routinely covered in &gt;50% SR, PG, HRC and the DNC posts. Gaslight someone else I'm not an idiot.

       Again, the numbers disagree with you. The top posts are routinely anti-Trump. They don't simply "make it out of new"... they burst out and shoot to the top, with numbers that almost no other type of post will get you on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comments within them are full of highly rated anti-Trump talk. Anything vaguely pro-Trump goes negative. I'm not interested in your trendy buzzwords that you just learned from "The Resistance" either... "gaslight"... LOL.

       there are fewer of the former and the vote totals reflect that. the latter are just not currently activated, which overwhelm the silent/lurking majority on certain occasions.

       But seriously... this place is just Twitter now. People here may like to think they're more "woke" and "in the know", but it's just Twitter. If you want to get likes/retweets/follows just talk shit about Trump all day. This sub isn't much different from what I've seen.

       Shot themselves in the foot with that logic. If the sub was taken over, their comment would not be at 50+ points. It suggests the opposite: their side has "taken over" if anything.

       Not really. There is a lot of thought put into it, but at the end of the day that entire writeup is orchestrated to appeal to a very segmented group of thinkers. And don't forget it's all pretty much an opinion piece on what he thinks of reddit features and updates.

       Like it or hate it, the death of reddit for him is the life of reddit for millions of others.

       Hey, sceptical lurker here. While I think that Pizzagate itself is bollocks there are cover-ups of paedophilia by elites and high ranking politicians. It annoys me that this shitshow de-legitimises a serious issue.

      <p>
       As someone from the UK the shit some of our House of Lords (especially) and House of Commons MP's have been up too is disgusting. The most galling thing about it is that it's mostly just a well know secret at this point.

       exactly our current PM is one of the people who's purposely lost a dossier including information on paedophilia within the establishment and it's absolutely clear that the Jimmy Savel was suspiciously-connected to certain members of the royals, including those who were also implicated with Epstein underage sex slave case such as Prince Andrew, then there's the Jersey Children's home [again linked to the royals] and the north wales care home cover-up and, and, and, and....
      </p>
      <p>
       yet very little of this ever gets real attention even here because everyone is too busy talking about absurd fantasy conspiracies involving secret-codes on pizza shop signs and insane shitposts on anonymous message boards from people claiming to be 'insiders' without giving the slightest bit of credence to their story.

       Pizzagate if it's anything sinister is a purposeful distraction from actual conspiracies.

       And because the information came from one party that means that it only involves that party, or is specifically out to get that party?

       If Bernie Sanders personally saved me from a fiery car crash, all while delivering my wife's baby I would still condemn him if he was doing pedophile shit. As would I for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Kanye West, or Stephen Hawking.

       Yes, some people on the right latched on to it as a means to attack Hillary and co. But to discount the entire thing because a few bad eggs are focusing on one aspect of it is just illogical (and that's not to say you can't discount pizzagate, but I believe that reason for doing so is a weak one).

       I respect your viewpoint, but this is ridiculously absurd. PIZZAGATE IS TODAYS VERSION OF ARKANCIDE. They exist for ONE REASON and that is to make people think the Clintons murder dissonents. It is an incredibly potent form of misinformation. I'm not going to say that somewhere somehow things uncovered through pizzagate or similar inquiries couldn't possibly be true, because of course they could be. But to say that Pizzagate wasn't originally conceived as an attack on Hillary/Bill/Podesta/Obama/the DNC is incredibly false and complete revisionist history.

       We get it. People hate Trump. No excuse for horse blinders. It was the dnc's emails that got hacked. I can't speak for everyone but I think the circumstances surrounding the situation have left the impression on many people that the motives behind pizzagate are political. I do think I speak for the majority of rational users here that 1. Both parties and all politicians are complete bullshit and 2. We want truth and justice. It's hypocritical to turn a blind eye on an important subject in the interest of protecting your "own" party.

       Forget the specific party debate, there is no such thing as a party. Did you know that a total of 737 people control 80% of our world? Political parties are a cute way to divide us even further.

       just to clarify though, the article says "737 firms" (read: corporate entities), not 737 people. 737 firms could encompass hundreds of thousands of people or more. The article does not specify the terms of inclusion for a firm. Taking Barclays PLC as an example, if they include general employees and stock holders in a firm, Barclays alone could potentially represent a million or more people (

       While pedophilia in general is a very bad thing, the thoughtless murder of millions of brown people, children included, around the globe in the name of your dirty ass tax dollars, directly or indirectly, seems to be a pretty big deal too that affects FAR more people. Seems like that could get a little attention from time to time.

       The regime decided it was time for Reddit to become one of the top sites on the internet (pushed through Google searches), so they had to whitewash it. The place has completely changed in the last year, unlike anything in its history (even back to the massive growth when it replaced digg).

       This sub is very old.. One of the oldest. Plenty of subscribers are non-existent users who now use a different account or don't visit anymore. It's definitely not a true representation of how many subscribers who actively visit the sub actually exist.

       Like 9 of those accounts over the last 8 years are mine. I had a couplen shadowbanned, mods banned one, and the others I just like to rotate to avoid giving too much info. I don't like commenting because I'm here mostly for the really "out there" stuff:Antarctica, UFOs, ancients civs, etc. I don't believe most of any of it, but I think the ideas behind them are fascinating and it usually gives me a decent read

       Hardly ever post anymore. This an alt of an old account that posted here all the time back in 2012. Now this shit hole is alt-right garbage with a controlled message. Nothing more than an echo chamber of people that are trying to force a narrative down your throat. It's an extension of /pol/ and therefore nothing more than a stormfront psyop. Pathetic mods that push an agenda and attempt to silence anyone that strays too far off the message, even more pathetic users that can't see the truth. That's why this sub seems dead, because it is.

       Most of the user accounts on Reddit are long dead and gone. Many duplicate users and bot accounts as well. My guess is that only a small percent of the 500,000 are actually active live users.

       Longterm lurker here. I like reading some of the posts but I never comment here because I'm not informed enough to weigh in on any of the topics. r/conspiracy also has a contrarian nature in its active posters, so an under-informed post is likely to inspire some caustic replies. Too lazy/uninterested to put in the research hours and too wary to post without the info to back it up. Just my two cents.

       I see the strange; a blind horse could see the strange, it doesn't concern me. I pay no mind to the facts statistics reveal. The game is fixed, the numbers never make sense mathematically. What can you do it's a private sight. I'm surprised the sub isn't a coordinated performance are like the r politics theater. Sometime they flood in, but most see right through it.

       It's annoying to no end.Not because of the subject but because of the people in the comments.For most of them a podcast with a dude who says he saw Hillary eat a pizza and blinking is evidence and prove.Don't bother to ask for something to back this stuff up because they will tell you it is there,in broad daylight and you just have to google it.Or you are denied to see their "evidence" because "you will not believe it anyway".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not how this shit works.When you claim something, the burden of proof is on you.Or do you waltz into a courtroom,scream about so and so being a Child molester and when the Judge would like some evidence you go:" uhhm no,show me he is not."?

       The part that really baffles me is that you are immediately a sheep if you use verifable facts that come from mainstream-ish source but if you talk about what a dude in a trailer in Bumfuck, Idaho said you're the beacon of truth.

       Oddly, it was an opposite effect for me, but I agree with you 100%
      </p>
      <p>
       Used to come here every now and then for other conspiracy theories. During the election, the Hillary hate came out in full swing and the discussion was about nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't care for Hillary, but I started participating more because so much of the stuff was so ridiculous to me I had to hop in and comment.

       Watched the sub get entirely overrun by the_donald posters during that time. Completely ruined this place.

       Theres still some good stuff here and there, but there is very obviously an agenda they all seem to have so now for the real I browse

       .

       Amazing that everyone who doesn't care about or believe in pizzagate gets called a "shill", but browsing
       <a href="/r/controversial">
        /r/controversial

       clearly shows that the shilling is done by pro donald kids.

       I want to correct the ridiculous stuff too but if you do it you are fighting an uphill battle without armor or a weapon.
And that is perfectly fine.People stick to their guns when a conspiracy confirms their pre existing beliefs.They do it,I do it,even you do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem arises when your judgement gets so clouded by left vs right,dems vs reps etc, that you think you are somehow enlightened and have the inside track.

       There are a lot of data points that say this was a botched robbery turned murder. Then there are a lot of data points that say Rich never had any dealings with Wikileaks. Then there's strong evidence that the Russian GRU hacked the DNC and wanted to work with the Trump campaign to sink HRC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put all that together, and it's clear there's nothing "conspiratorial" about the Seth Rich murder. You manage to take poorly-constructed and sourced pieces on information which do not form a compelling case for anything and conclude that SR was the source of DNC hack? Terrible reasoning skills you have.
      </p>

       If you're drawing conclusions based on paper-thin suggestions, you'll probably believe anything.

       Do you dismiss everything out of a letter agency
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       it's from a letter agency? That's your information filter? Not a very good one. A cult asks you to do the same thing: disregard all information from a source on the basis of the source. You need a better distinguishing method or you're falling for a load of bs constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liars can also tell the truth. The trick is to know how to tell the difference--not ignore a source forever. That's true ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me: what motivation do these agencies have to lie and say "it was Russia"? Are they in the pocket of HRC? Is that what your keen investigative skills have yielded?

       Iam really interested to see if Assange ever really confirms Rich as the leaker. What I see so far is he lead people to believe that Rich is the leaker, but he wont outright confirm it because he cant.

       It's an unsolved botched robbery turned murder. Doesn't have a goddamned thing to do with the DNC hacks. Unless you're of the mind that a private citizen who can't win a race against the most unlikable candidate in history, has the power to control the FBI, CIA and NSA.

       You really lump people who do not believe the official government conspiracy theory on 911 in with the more controversial conspiracies?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess, for myself anyway and not to speak for anyone else, there is just way way too much evidence available that shows the official "19 boxcutter wielding Al Queda hijackers" conspiracy theory is a complete fabrication. One has to work hard to ignore all the evidence that debunks the official lie and maintain the willful ignorance required to still believe the government's official version of events on 911.

       Metal doesn't have to become liquid before it loses integrity, so the silly arguments about melting points are dumb. The towers didn't fall at free-fall speeds, and you can actually see debris falling faster than the towers in all the footage. And no, building are never demolished from the top, ever. And WTC7 collapsed because it burned for a day after the world's tallest building fell on it, and most of the fire fighters died in WTC1 and 2 (besides, what would be the point? The US gov
       <em>

       The US gov took advantage of the situation, no doubt, but there is no evidence it was orchestrated by the US gov. None.

If you have chosen to ignore all the questions about 9/11 at this point in the game you have chosen the path of least resistance when it comes to any critical thinking, and fighting it out with you, in 2017, is not going to provide any enlightenment for anyone.

       Let's just say we both are entrenched in our opinions and are not really interested in listening to anything that contradicts our carefully crafted realities. I will just hand you this 'win' on reddit and hope you have a great weekend languishing in your much desired internet victory.

       No shit, this sub was slowly infiltrated by Russian bots and The_Dumbass brigadiers. It's ironic that a place entirely devoted towards conspiracies refused to acknowledge they were one of the victims of the largest psy-operations of the 21st century.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sold bumper stickers that said "Don't Blame Me, I Voted For Bernie" during the last year. I took photos of me holding them up or on top of an envelope, joined Facebook groups with 10's to 100's of thousands of members, pretended I just got the stickers in the mail and then surupticiously posted links to my sites and web stores (Amazon, Etsy, FB page) after I used my girlfriends Facebook account to ask where I got them from.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a very basic overview of a 2 person social manipulation campaign. I made close to 6 figures since last July, only after closing down operations around Feb. now imagine the having the resources of a government army filled with computer science engineers of over a decade experienced, limitless money and a history of espionage that rivales the CIA. The Russians didn't hack our election machines, they hacked the social collective of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, call me crazy before going back to the idea the Jews rule the world through nefarious cabals that meet at Bohemian Grove to manipulate third world dictatorships into throwing away the gold standard.

       You've been taken over. Only the bots and Trump supporters vote here. Considering how interesting and informative conspiracy was for so long, it's very sad. I don't know if this is how the CIA destroyed conspiracy or just how the trump supporters/Russian bots did. But look to your mods for the cause.

       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       , for instance, has 17 million subscribers, 13K there now, and the posts on their front page usually range from ~500 up to ~10K, with a couple in the 20K-40K range per day.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has ~500K subs, 1.2K here now, and our front page posts usually range from ~50 up to ~500, with a couple posts in the 1K-2K range per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       is about 40x as big subscriber-wise, these numbers if anything show
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       to have slightly better activity-to-subscriber ratios.

       It's all about
       <em>
        levels
       </em>
       , man; it's not just a binary. I'd probably agree with you, though. If we're looking at someone who's a prototypical Democrat or Republican, our front page probably won't do too much to change that. The truly corrupt practices of each party and the power factions that lie behind them get lost in the sensationalized claims from each side.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get a Democrat to wake up to their party's corruption, you're probably better off sending them to
       <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">
        /r/SandersForPresident
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/Political_Revolution">
        /r/Political_Revolution
       </a>
       . For a Republican, maybe go
       <a href="/r/Libertarian">
        /r/Libertarian
       </a>
       (I haven't been there for years and so can't speak for the quality.) Each side can easily see the corruption in the other party, but that other side will rarely be able to articulate the problem on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they can see the corruption on
       <em>
        both sides
       </em>
       , then they might be more open to some of the deeper topics here.

       I disagree. This place still entertains the wildest of conspiracies. I have no problem calling out bullshit with no evidence, or simply dumb conspiracies. Half of the "new" posts look like they're written by 14 year olds. Only good content should survive even here.

       When you put a theory out there, you best be prepared for it to be challenged.  Without testing, a theory isn't a theory.  It's just opinion.

       Conspiracy boards are fringe sites, and opinion becomes more and more heterodox as you move to the fringes. The UFO guy doesn't necessarily agree with the chemtrails guy who doesn't necessarily agree with the fluoride guy, that kind of thing.

       I am a passive viewer of this sub. I upvote here and there but don't have time to do research and contribute to the posting. I am also not much of a talker so I avoid commenting. But what really kinda drives me away from commenting is the bad mentality that has been in this sub since the elections in America last year. This sub changed a lot, there was a lot of infighting and stupid arguments. that took away the small will I had to participate in the discussions. I highly believe we are shackled and the only way to break free is unity and I still have hope we can be united and part of something greater.

       Most of the posts here are just rampant Trump defense or Clinton hate. Kind of tiring. The Trump campaign didn't have anything to do with Russia, eh? They are being framed. But....Clinton killed Seth Rich while have sex with kids(right?)! Why would I upvote these posts?

       It would probably be better if conspiracy walked away from Clinton and Trump... Focused on other things. Let those mature a little bit.

       According to channeled sources, Jesus himself was a conspiracy theorist.  Why wouldn't he have been?
      </p>
      <p>
       Quashing conspiracy belief is nothing new. I mean, I just got into a "discussion" with one of those "people", and they deleted all their comments.  They ARE, however, still active on Reddit.  Engaging in seemingly normal conversations otherwise.  I honestly don't know if it's a monetized account or a collective unconscious thing.  People who either KNOW how bad things really are and are purposely misleading people, or people that have a mindset that doesn't allow them to countenance things outside of their own "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I've seen both in play, which is why things are weird.  I know certain things "trigger" my thoughts and writing, so maybe it's just the same for others, but there are probably a LOT of people that don't "want" to believe in something outside of their bubble, and are almost just defending that bubble thought-wise.

       This comment made my day btw.  Showed it to my brother because we were talking about a related topic.  Funnily enough, don't know if you play video games, but the day before we got into an argument about Rocket League playing styles (we frequently play basketball mode against each other), and the "dispute" was so heated my brother wouldn't even look at a pretty rainbow directly behind where he was sitting.  We play super serial...although it's mainly just for the thrilll of scoring ridiculous goals...I should really make a montage someday.

       Well, I like conspiracy theories but I think I actually don't really believe in any of them... Sure, there are some strange things going on here and there and maybe a few ones are closer to the truth than official versions...

       But you just can't have a moderate opinion on this sub... people don't get it...

       Perhaps Reddit should add a feature that if a Reddit account has not been on Reddit for more than 4 hours within the last 6 months, the subscriber count does not go towards the total, although they are still subscribed.

       That sub counter on the side of this subreddit is actually inaccurate. It adds the first two digits to maintain a sub count proportional to the total number of reddit accounts in existence, creating the illusion that there are nearly half a million subs. In reality there are just over 6000, which fluctuates heavily as people sub and unsub from the subreddit.

       Having an open mind and believing conspiracies are not the same thing. I have an open mind, but if you want me to believe something you better have some good evidence or make a very convincing argument.

       An open mind set is fine and dandy but you need to be sceptic.You can discuss as much as you want but 80% of the stuff posted is debunkable in 3 steps.So why should anyone have an open mind when evidence often consits of YouTube Videos with spooky music by channels that have nothing but confirmed hoaxes under their belt?

       Not really, the thing about conspiracy followers/theorists is that we are naturally curious, yet cautious. So, while we like to lurk and see what is going on, look at the different angles, we're fairly loathe to actually get involved, else we become a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're best working behind the scenes, like an assassin. Think about it - who is the great assassin in the world? No one knows! Likewise, if we do not let on all that we know, than we feel that we can be more effective at deciphering the barrage of media bias in search of the truth...

       If 50k people are interested in conspiracies it means there's probably 100k who don't. I really couldn't get guess ratios but when I see clear evidence of say 9/11 and then a guy like Chomsky still believes the official narrative, I start to wonder if woke will ever be a reality for the majority. I'm scared because I've talked to two people close to me about stuff that is very 'woke' such as 9/11 and bankers destroying the economy etc. And their response has been one of shock and dress and the feeling of powerlessness to change the staying quo. Finding this new info they have said has made their life darker. There really should be a simple way of organising dissenters about these topics. They're no longer conspiracies when facts are involved.

       Because we havnt reached the snowball effect yet. The most important thing "woke" people can do right now is keep talking about it. Reduce stigmatization around the subjects, expand peoples minds. Once 10-15% of the population becomes aware, it will take on a life of its own and changes will begin to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now there is no need to focus on how to conduct specific change outside your own personal decisions. And even that is tough. Try to find a food product in some areas or even water, not produced by one of these evil shit companies. Nestle has about 20 different water brands they hide behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep talking is all you have to do.

       I'm eager for that snowball effect. The sooner the better then. I do try to make good personal choices. Haven't cut coca cola products out but I've definitely paid attention to what food I'm consuming now. I talk about this stuff as much as I can, to those willing to listen. Majority of my small friends circle would be considered woke. Which is cool. I can't tell how many of the local population here know these things too and simply putting the shutters up because of stigma or embarrassment. Shame but they'll be glad when the snowball comes I guess.

       Yeah well I never see anything upvote worthy. Like for the past 6 months at least, I've been scrolling through this sub looking for conspiracies to occupy my brain and every single day I see the same bs over and over and over and over and over and over. I don't even see any conspiracies on this sub anymore so I don't know why I keep coming back, hoping to find something interesting only to waste time.

       I think most people are only informed of conspiracy related stuff on a superficial level and thus don't know enough to engage in discussion beyond "yeah fuck that shit" and so don't comment on posts.

       The problem is that most of them are pretty dumb and distractions.

       if its a dumb one i rarely downvote, unless its a clear disinfo attempt.

      <p>
       if its a good one i will usually give an upvote and comment.

       a lot of people i think have just stopped bothering as the up/down totals are being manipulated to shit via bots and they are meaningless anyway.

       I think a lot of people are like me. We stumbled upon few conspiracies that brought us into that or this rabbit hole. We got intrigued, read more, found out how the world really operates, subbed to this subreddit, but I don't know enough to comment. I am only aware that our world is skewered. I lurk and read what the rest of you says.

       That's the part people need in order to be woke these days.  There is nowhere on the internet which has any degree of traffic which is safe from the machination of shills.  When one rises up, they will descend.  It's best to learn to deal with them rather than complaining, because they are a part of life on any internet forum these days, and that is not going to change.  Besides, complaining is what they want because your complaints will help dissuade others from getting involved.  Basically, you are doing the shills work for them whether you  realize it or not.  They want us all to quit and go home.

       I imagine a large number of them, excluding bots/shills, are likely people who are interested in the content, but either not knowledged enough to contribute to the conversation or unwilling, perhaps out of fear of looking uninformed.

       Its the primary reason why I generally don't comment here; I simply don't know enough about the subjects in order to contribute meaningful information. I'd rather observe and learn than speculate, muddying any discussion with unnecessary content.

       Sometimes I think people take a guilty pleasure in laughing at stupid things. Incredibly stupid people, idiots fighting things, hold my beer moments, etc etc. We can argue about the reality of such things, but that's my observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub used to have some well thought out ideas. I'm recalling detailed posts into how 9/11 was probably an inside job by bush and cheney. It was backed up with engineers and scientists who talked about tensile strength of steel, how hot jet fuel can burn and demolition patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then this sub got taken over by far right whackadoos who want to talk about kiddie porn rings in pizza places that whoops! Don't have fucking basements! Or Seth Rich conspiracy theories based on the misinformation put out by Assange who has a huge boner for fucking over the US in whatever way he can. The evidence posted on these theories is so paper thin it takes tremendous suspension of reason, logic and understanding of reality to believe in. And in the meantime these same people refuse to acknowledge the mounting evidence of a real conspiracy between putin's govt and trump's campaign and now presidency.

       So it's fun to watch morons drown in puddles, but you kind of don't want to upvote it or say much because it's embarrassing to admit you like watching mouth breathers try to teleport through walls when there's an open door next to them.

       And yet this one has 2k plus upvotes. So, how does that support your theory. Oh, and conspiracies don't exist for us all to agree with each other. I prefer evidence over superstition and what's typical on here are posts about someone's totally baseless 'theory" that is based solely on how they feel. I'm not gonna upvote some 14 yr olds guesses at what he thinks happened on a subject he knows nothing about. What would be nice for this sub would be to see some actual discussion instead of the political bullshit we've been seeing lately.

       Yep votes are artificially applied to whatever post or comment seems to be on the agenda of the day.. things not likes are just hidden or downvote or both so nobody can see them easily.

       Not really that strange. A lot of posts sound like they come from overly paranoid basement dwellers.  It kind of comes with the territory since the topic is so wide and conspiracy theorists can be a little distrusting.

       I noticed back in May on v/pizzagate that even though there were thousands of vistors showing in the sidebar most of the time that the posts barely had votes anymore. So I went around finding posts that had no voats and clicked on them and voted. Then when I would refresh the page my vote was gone but the icon still showed I voted. I had other active people check and it was happening to them too. Mods didn't care for SOME reason and eventually banned me from the sub for spam. So out of curiosity I checked if it was happening on Reddit and guess what...it is. I have even seen where my up vote has made vote % go from 100 down to 81%. Cool huh?

       I only reply or comment if I feel that I am informed enough on the topic to do so.
      </p>

       I like to read and watch what others post to get informed. If there is nothing for me to add afterwards, I just move on to the next post (I usually have nothing to add).

       No, I don't find it odd at all. Most people consume news, they don't produce it. And I would guess that's the primary use of conspiracy subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure you have some bots and shills here, but overall, there's just not much to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, the rigor one would have to go through, the hours of researching and connecting information in a presentable form, just isn't plausible for most people. It's also hard to establish anything new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a good thing that people refrain from posting new things, as it's mostly just old things.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many ways, conspiracy has become a news aggregate of people connecting dots or just sharing opinions and speculations.

       I subbed back when this sub was not politicized and there were daily and informative posts about JFK, MKULTRA, and 9/11. This sub degenerated into politicized bullshit, a constant ticker of ill-informed current events posts, it became impossible to decipher which posts are sincere opinions from trolls spreading disinformation. This sub became a tool for both left and right to bait their enemies and form their own narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr no one upvotes anything because this sub is mostly trash, but usually about the time I plan to unsub a really choice post comes by.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I honestly just sub to see what people who have no basis in reality think. I used to sub because this place used to be a valuable asset to my reddit experience.

       Because there can't be any substantive discussion on this forum between the shills and the ban-happy mods. Worse than GLP, which is terrible. But I'm sure that's the goal, gather us then stifle us.

       It's probably because this sub isn't what everyone expects.  At least not anymore. Look, obviously,  I have nothing against conspiracy theorizing given that I'm subbed here, but I wasn't expecting a bunch of heavy political stuff.  I subbed here to read about things like 9/11 and sandy hook.  You know?

       Have subbed here on this account and my old one for years. I never used to comment (and still don't except for this) because new posters used to be met with such suspicion that I didn't want to bother. Still one of my favorite subs on here though!

       This sub used to be great. I used to be able to verify with a group of other likeminded people that things were askew in the media when events happened. I even learned a lot of things I didn't know. Now, every single post is about Clinton or Trump or the pizzagate censoring. I definitely miss the way this sub used to be and I don't find it strange at all that many other people feel the same way I do. Why participate in the madness? That's what the main stream media is for.

       Not really. As others have pointed out, subscription numbers are an inflated metric by which to measure a subreddit's vitality and there are a lot of trashfire posts on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, "conspiracy theorists" do not subscribe to some monolithic ethos. Why should someone interested in 9/11 or Iran Contra upvote pizzagate or alien posts? What does HAARP have to do with Bohemian Grove? We each bring our own interests into this sub, and it's a poor mind which agrees with everything posted here.

       Downvoting bots are destroying the morale of people. F.x. What's the point of putting a comment when you get downvoted once every hour and not a single reply was written, whereas you've put actual effort and knowledge into the thing you wrote. Feels especially great when the post is a week old already and you know for sure noone is reading some -20karma posts and downvotes it even more.
      </p>

       That's how i feel about it. I'm still woke and alert, but i've lost hope a long time ago for a proper discussion. The age of misinformation is upon us.

       I just posted a video of sinead O'Conner talking about her suicidal depression and a part of the thread turned to a dis ussiin about her attack if he pope and how a secret society of luciferians infiltrated the church and government and mainstream media and the post was removed. They claimed I violated personal info. It's a public video and no one said anything personal about anyone other than publically know things about sinead. I think the high profile topic if sinead O'Conner gave too much traffic to my post which talked about the fact that a global elite runs the world through a secret society of luciferians called the illuminati.

       I stopped commenting, and even following this sub or a while bc my comments were downvoted to oblivion. you want a sub that caters to free thought, but all members must believe pizza gate is actually a thing, and Russia had nothing to do with the trump presidency. riiiiiight. the hivemind is worse here than in many other subs.

       But Trump won the election. That means all criticisms of Trump or his fanbase on reddit are invalid. The millions of subscribers on the_donald exist. Their petitions that fill to get more than a few thousand votes are alternative facts. The truth is optional. Thinking is undesired.

       I see people like you complaining that "Trumptards" have taken over this sub. It's just not the case. Look at the comments in any post... anything vaguely pro-Trump is voted down, and anything anti-Trump is voted up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is a good example of this. Where is the army of "Trumptards" sending your comment in to the negative?
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with the substance of the comments either. Someone could roll their face across their keyboard and then type "Trump bad" at the end... it will get more upvotes.

       Used to come here every now and then for other conspiracy theories. During the election, the Hillary hate came out in full swing and the discussion was about nothing else.

       I didn't care for Hillary, but I started participating more because so much of the stuff was so ridiculous to me I had to hop in and comment.

       Watched the sub get entirely overrun by the_donald posters during that time. Completely ruined this place.

       Theres still some good stuff here and there, but there is very obviously an agenda they all seem to have so now for the real I browse

       .

       Amazing that everyone who doesn't care about or believe in pizzagate gets called a "shill", but browsing
       <a href="/r/controversial">
        /r/controversial

       clearly shows that the shilling is done by pro donald kids.

       Having an open mind and believing conspiracies are not the same thing. I have an open mind, but if you want me to believe something you better have some good evidence or make a very convincing argument.

       An open mind set is fine and dandy but you need to be sceptic.You can discuss as much as you want but 80% of the stuff posted is debunkable in 3 steps.So why should anyone have an open mind when evidence often consits of YouTube Videos with spooky music by channels that have nothing but confirmed hoaxes under their belt?
