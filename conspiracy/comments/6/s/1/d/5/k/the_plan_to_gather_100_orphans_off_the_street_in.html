<p>The Plan:</p>

<p>Rescue Orphans from Port au Prince, Haiti</p>

<p>22nd Friday/Saturday, Jan    -  NLCR team fly to the DR (Dominican Republic)</p>

<p>Sun Jan 23 rd. - Drive bus from Santo Domingo into Port au Prince, Haiti and <strong>gather 100 orphans from the streets and collapsed orphanages, then return to the DR</strong></p>

<p>Mon Jan 24 : Bus arrives in Cabarete, DR at New Life Children Refuge</p>

<p>Haiti Team: Laura Silsby, Charisa Coulter, Carla Thompson, Nicole &amp; Corrinna Lankford, Paul Thompsons Team from East Side Baptist Church, Twin Falls</p>

<p>.....children, from infants to 12 years old.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t leave much time to check if any of these 100 &#39;orphans&#39; had any family, does it?</p>

<p><strong>The child snatchers: Special report from Haiti on the U.S. missionaries accused of &#39;stealing orphans&#39;</strong></p>

<p><em>They handed out flyers saying they wanted to &#39;help children who have lost their mother and father in the earthquake or have no one to love and care for them&#39;.</em></p>

<p><em>The flyers said, inaccurately, that the group had the Haitian government&#39;s permission to take 100 children abroad to the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti.</em> </p>

<p><em>Authorities believe none of the children were in fact orphans</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1249280/Haiti-earthquake-Missionaries-led-Laura-Silsby-accused-stealing-orphans.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1249280/Haiti-earthquake-Missionaries-led-Laura-Silsby-accused-stealing-orphans.html</a> </p>

<p>And if you work U.N. or w/e NGO and you steal children from other countries and you don&#39;t got a lot of cash for a &quot;Pay for Play&quot; with some alone time with Hillary Clinton then you can just offer up your adopted kids for Bill to &quot;babysit&quot; for a while which is just another form of &quot;Pay for Play&quot;...</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget to take a family photo...</p>

<p><strong>Update;</strong> - for some reason the &quot;To&quot; and the &quot;From&quot; and the Date of the emails/pdf&#39;s were covered up by the State Dept.</p>

<p>But here would be a possible follow up email asking for funding and describing the cost to transport the children;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donation Requests: Funds or Supplies as outlined below Rescue Mission in Haiti </p>

<p>• RI Flights for the NLCR/CVBC team: $400/each from Las Vegas to Santo Domingo, $220 from Boise to Las Vegas </p>

<p>• Transportation of the Children: $1800 to charter a bus in the DR to bring 100 children to safety in the DR</p>

<p>And the attorney who represented Laura Silsby? A man who was himself convicted as a child trafficker:</p>

<p><strong>Legal adviser to U.S. Haiti missionaries arrested</strong> - Wikileaks US CABLE</p>

<p><em>A Dominican Republic man who acted as legal adviser to a group of U.S. missionaries held for several weeks in Haiti on child kidnapping charges has been arrested in Santo Domingo, local police said on Friday.</em></p>

<p><em>Mr. Puello has been acting as a spokesman and legal adviser in the Dominican Republic for some of the detainees.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/32/323249_-os-haiti-us-legal-adviser-to-u-s-haiti-missionaries.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/32/323249_-os-haiti-us-legal-adviser-to-u-s-haiti-missionaries.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Adviser to Detained Americans in Haiti Is Investigated</strong></p>

<p><em>The head of the Salvadoran border police, Commissioner Jorge Callejas, said in a telephone interview that he was investigating accusations that a man with a Dominican passport that identified him as Jorge Anibal Torres Puello led a human trafficking ring that recruited Dominican women and under-age Nicaraguan girls by offering them jobs and then putting them to work as prostitutes in El Salvador.</em></p>

<p><em>Mr. Puello said in the interview that he had been representing the Americans free of charge because he was a religious man who commiserated with their situation. “I’m president of the Sephardic Jewish community in the Dominican Republic,” he said. “I help people in this kind of situation. We’re not going to charge these people a dime.”</em></p>

<p><em>The report said the police had found documents connected to the Sephardic Jewish community in a house in San Salvador where the traffickers had held women.</em> </p>

<p>Leaving aside the question of the legitimacy of the mission of the  New Life Children&#39;s Refuge, the Clintons didn&#39;t have anything to do with it.</p>

<p>This document is part of the attachment to <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765">this email</a>, &quot;10 AmCits [American Citizens] arrested with 33 children, headed to DR. Now under arrest in Port au Prince&quot;.</p>

<p>As it says in the email, &#39;The group is called the New Life Children Refuge America Organization (NLCR). Bill Bistransky found the attached &quot;Plan of Action&quot;(P0A) on their web site when he googled that name.&#39;</p>

<p>The document (nlcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf) was archived by the WayBack machine: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100215074718/www.esbctwinfalls.com/clientimages/24453/pdffiles/haiti/nlcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf">http://web.archive.org/web/20100215074718/www.esbctwinfalls.com/clientimages/24453/pdffiles/haiti/nlcrhaitianorphanrescuemission.pdf</a></p>

<p>It has three pages, but  was inadvertently split into two documents in the State Department FOIA dump:
C05766664 (WikiLeak&#39;s <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3776">3776</a>) 
and C05766639 (WikiLeak&#39;s <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3741">3741</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and trafficked to an orphanage across the border in the Dominican Republic (DR) which didn&#39;t even exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s what the document says: &quot;NLCR is in the process of buying land and building an orphanage, school and church in Magante on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Given the urgent needs from this earthquake, God has laid upon our hearts the need to go now vs. waiting until the permanent facility is built. He has provided an interim solution in nearby Cabarete, where we will be leasing a 45 room hotel and converting it into an orphanage until the building of the NLCR is complete. This interim location will enable us to provide a loving environment for up to 150 children, from infants to 12 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>False. She does not work for &quot;Amber Alerts&quot; (not a company), and &quot;head&quot; is not a job title.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a diplomantic deal over the 10 American missionaries jailed in Haiti on child abduction charges may lead to the release this week <strong>of all except</strong> the group&#39;s leader, Laura Silsby</p>

<p>So yes, Bill Clinton, in his role as &quot;special envoy&quot; for the UN, did intervene on behalf of the group. And yet, Silsby was the only one who went to trail and was jailed? </p>

<p>The King document does not indicate that Clinton intervened on Silsby&#39;s behalf in particular, nor that he managed to have her sentence reduced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And sadly seems super commonplace. It&#39;s like some weird code. Nearly all of the instagram, facebook, twitter etc. photos of people linked to these types of conspiracies have weird ass comments like that, and when you follow them they&#39;re usually other influential seeming people with weird random kids no one knows (always called nieces or nephews, always) and they&#39;re never these peoples&#39; own and looked drugged out, with drooping glassy eyes, tired smiles and leaning on the adult while the adult looks all smug and satisfied (often clearly intoxicated as well).</p>

<p>I noped the fuck out of this topic 6 months ago when I randomly followed a few commenters to their profiles (these types of social media posts were direct-linked on other conspiracy forums) and found ALL of them had tons of those &quot;nieces&quot; and &quot;nephews&quot;. Even that <em>certain</em> restaurant owned in DC called the unidentified kids like the tied/taped up girl on his IG page his &quot;nieces&quot; and &quot;nephews&quot; in interviews, to debunk the conspiracy. Which just makes it even more creepy now that it&#39;s pretty common knowledge these weirdos call these kids that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can easily find the original photos on FB. Those are troll comments about Bill Clinton from people they don&#39;t know. That really crossed the line.</p>

<p>If you find the original photo (the first one with Bill), you&#39;ll find out that he wasn&#39;t even in the 2nd photo with the masks. Notice the guy&#39;s body size and the ring on the right hand. It&#39;s not Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>The account belongs to a same sex married couple (males) who adopted the four children and even gushed about the beginning of a new life (spouse, kids). While the masks comes across as creepy initially, I guess it&#39;s a viral internet meme (horse mask) that some people are into (internet trends/fads).</p>

<p>The Laura Silsby one is a strange case. I would guess it&#39;s a get rich quick scheme to sell kids to couples who want children. I&#39;m not sure how adoption works but I&#39;m assuming it should not be easy (agencies would give preference to male and female couple who already have kids over an inexperienced couple).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody is that stupid that they think they can take children to another country without proper paperwork so it seems right that she was charged with attempted trafficking. I can&#39;t believe she was doing it as a Christian mission, money must have been the driving motive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Silsby entered Haiti with too much ambition,</p>

<p>She cast 100 children for the opening audition.</p>

<p>No child over 12 was Silsby&#39;s marching order,</p>

<p>Always keen to the effects of post traumatic disorders.</p>

<p>Her clients lived afar with lots of cash to dispense,</p>

<p>They were gitty for the acts which would surely commence. </p>

<p>Yet, while Jay-Z had 99 problems, Silsby had more,</p>

<p>And when she crossed through the border, there was no open door.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, Hillary Cinton jumped aboard,</p>

<p>She donned her political mask and brought out her choking cord. </p>

<p>With Hillary&#39;s help, Silsby was let go,</p>

<p>On the plane ride home, Hillary feasted on Silsby&#39;s left toe.</p>

<p>The lesson of the story is very clear,</p>

<p>No criminal should ever fear,</p>

<p>Any crime committed, any day of the year,</p>

<p>As long as Hillary Clinton is near.</p>

<p>What did they intend to &quot;do&quot; to those poor kids?!...</p>

<p>And why 100?</p>
