        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why is it that when the US allegedly assassinated Osama Bin Laden, they felt they needed to bury his body at sea? Ironically, covering up any evidence of his death whatsoever. No autopsy could take place or other kind of event that would prove it was him who had been killed. </p>

<p>The americans claimed that it was &quot;Islamic tradition&quot; to bury him at sea. </p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden was an extremist Sunni Muslim, and apparently being buried at sea is a Sunni tradition. What gets me is that Saddam Hussein was also a Sunni Muslim, but why wasn&#39;t he buried at sea? Saddam was buried in the ground as far as i know.</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t add up. I&#39;m sure many of you have asked this before, and blatantly come to the conclusion that the US never actually assassinated him in 2011, due to allegations of him dying years before in a CIA hospital... with the idea that the US government pretended he was still alive to justify more genocide on the middle-east. </p>

<p>But i still ask, why is it that Osama Bin Laden had a sea burial, yet Saddam Hussein did not? They were both tyrants/extremists, but why did one get special treatment over the other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saddam Hussein was put on trial and executed by the Iraqi government. It was meant to be a legitimate public process and would add credibility to the new government, spiriting away his body wouldn’t be a good move. Hussein wasn’t as much of an ideological hero or martyr. He was an authoritarian who kept his loyalists in power, with him gone there was little support beyond some of the Sunni minority. His tomb saw very limited pilgrimage before its destruction.</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden was killed during an illegal raid in Pakistan and his body dumped in the sea. He was ended there. There were no pains to legitimise anything, no publicity over the body and a funeral and no part of him for anyone to make a pilgrimage to see (despite Wahhabism I think this would happen). By the way Saudi Arabia is said to have refused to take his body so he couldn’t be returned there anyway - would he be buried in America instead? Not in my <del>backyard</del> bomb crater!</p>

<p>Different people and different situations.</p>

<p>This is r/conspiracy where let&#39;s face it maybe 10% of people who doubt the official account might change their mind had 100 doctors from different countries performed DNA tests live on camera.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy the official story.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there are not elements of truth to the official story, but it&#39;s not in line with how they typically deal with high level terrorists or political opponents.</p>

<p>Ideally, they&#39;d have given him a trial like they have with many previous terror suspects. But the official story is that he died in a gunfight........ OK, fine, then why not release some evidence that it actually happened? And then the argument to that is the Muslim world would be too upset........ But given how many incredibly inflammatory things happen every day towards Muslims, is that really a valid excuse?</p>

<p>This whole thing was shady as fuck before he was even allegedly killed. There were a ton of reports that he was killed in Tora Bora during the massive air strikes, and he did serve a purpose as the figurehead that was needed to continue the war on terror........ As long as that boogeyman was out there, it justified a lot of shit to a lot of people.</p>

<p>I look at it this way- If they were willing to go to war in Iraq based on false pretences and make up bullshit stories like they did for Pat Tillman, I have no doubt that they&#39;d make something up here if they figured it was beneficial. That&#39;s just how shit works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. In terms of him allegedly being already dead years before; there&#39;s many people who stated just that in the early 2000&#39;s prior to 9/11, for instance: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/19/afghanistan.oliverburkeman</a></p>

<p>My feeling is that if Osama had been considered dead, there would have been less of a reason to invade the middle-east under Blair/Bush. We already know those wars were based on lies involving WMD&#39;s, but it seems that keeping Osama alive &quot;on the record&quot; would certainly give another reason to continue another war <em>cough</em> invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no expert but I think it&#39;s a rule about being buried within so many days. Not so much about at sea. The body was on the ship and they probably didn&#39;t have any good options other than at sea. Assuming that they actually had a body. I think they did. The intention was to secretly whisk him away. But when one helicopter was damaged they couldn&#39;t deny it any more so made up the story. The whole thing is a mix of truth and lies. The Pakistanis  knew he was there the whole time. But for political reasons they couldn&#39;t shelter anymore. So they gave him up to us. They couldn&#39;t just hand them over because that would be admitting that they had him  so the whole operation was a staged farce. And we had to get rid of the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i remember people stating this around the time he was allegedly assassinated. To me, it&#39;s as if they claimed to dump a corpse in the sea (with an excuse for it) so that nobody could definitely say &quot;that is Osama Bin Laden&#39;s corpse&quot;. Because if he really had died in that 2011 raid, i&#39;m pretty sure his corpse would be paraded on Western television, as was Muahmar Gaddafi, when he was brutally murdered by american forces.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is the case. I think the case was they didn&#39;t want to turn over the body only to have his final burial place turn into a shrine for martyrs-to-be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure OBL would have gotten some VERY expensive and good lawyers who would have had the financial resources to start digging into and destroying the official version of how those towers came down, whether the whole thing wasn&#39;t entrapment by the CIA and all in all opening up a can of worms that for most of the world outside this sub is firmly closed.</p>
