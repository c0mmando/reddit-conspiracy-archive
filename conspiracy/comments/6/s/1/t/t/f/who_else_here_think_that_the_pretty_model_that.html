First of all, if you have this kind of money to buy off a slave then you don&#39;t need to buy a slave because you are rich in the first place!!! Second, or perhaps first, who would be crazy enough to trust anything going on the dark web, (especially a sex slave auction) ?!? Also, why not abduct the girl yourself because it&#39;s just as illegal as buying her and it cost nothing?
And then, the gang just release the girl because she is a mother and this is against their morality??? BWAHAHAHA. And then the perp is quickly caught, off course and admits to everything??? This is such a lame plot! This was all concocted by TPTB in order to demonize the dark web. Watch out for legislation coming soon to ban the deep web. </p>

I feel like people like us are the only ones not participating in it, and in 5 or 10 years we won&#39;t even be able to talk about current events with regular people at all. I&#39;m a little scared of that, not gonna lie. You think people call us crazy <em>now</em>? The conversion of reality is nearly complete.</p>

He was like &quot;ya sure dude&quot;. Well I saw him today, and he told me it went down more or less just like I said.

    <div class="md"><p>I did note that this activity was almost a word for word reenactment of Liam Neeson&#39;s hit action thriller Taken, when a pretty young (this time American) girl is abducted by a seemingly charming man who ends up being involved in a syndicate. She is sold at a sex auction, and even ends up being sold to what looks like wealthy Middle Eastern men.</p>

<p>Only real difference was no bitcoins.</p>

<p>Just found it interesting. I think this event is true though. However, I do think the media will highlight anything negative in regards to cash, privacy, digital currency, etc in order to hurt the reputation of anybody wishing to conduct activities in private.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Luckily for us, it&#39;s not that easy. Obivously they can pass the legislation, but that doesn&#39;t mean they can necessarily enforce it that easily. And it&#39;s not like they can just take away everyone&#39;s bitcoin (without the threat of imprisonment anyway), so the market will just go back underground. But short of cutting the world&#39;s internet connection, the economy can continue to run as it is. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll have to release their own coin, and then use propoganda techniques to make it seem like the best option, while simultaneously getting enough people to think that &quot;bitcoin is dead&quot; to try and devalue it.</p>

<p>Regardless, this won&#39;t be a very easy step in TPTB&#39;s plan.</p>

Although not the dark web it is still a possibility to buy a sex slave over the internet with a &quot;guarantee&quot; that you&#39;re getting the slave. Also Saudis like to take away passports and hide the servants work visas and then keep them as a type of slave( <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/11/news/la-ol-saudi-princess-human-trafficking-irvine-20130711">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/11/news/la-ol-saudi-princess-human-trafficking-irvine-20130711</a> )
2)This is what invite only websites are for and Silk Road had many legitimate sellers that sold drugs and guns until the deep web got popular and scammers started to show up left and right and the raid on Silk Road didn&#39;t help.
3)You get something delivered to you and is a guarantee versus you having to go out and hunting and possibly catching attention you don&#39;t want causing all sorts of problems but this is just based on the individual and if they have the funds to waste
4)Based on morality? Not much I hear about that now a days especially from these &quot;scary&quot; deep web sellers but you never know I&#39;ve been surprised with many things when it comes to humans the the mind
5)Sounds super sketchy like you say but you never know people with morality in this kind of business tend to get sloppy and would get caught after letting someone go maybe?</p>

<p>But would you mind linking to what you&#39;re talking about so I can be on the same page? Sounds like a plot to get at Bitcoin and all anonymous make software perhaps like TOR.</p>

<p>I could see that. Even if you&#39;re wrong about that story being bullshit. I&#39;m actually kind of surprised they haven&#39;t pro-actively worked to shut it down yet.
