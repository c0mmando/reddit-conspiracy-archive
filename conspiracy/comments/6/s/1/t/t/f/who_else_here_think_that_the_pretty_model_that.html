       This whole story reeks of massive BS. First of all, if you have this kind of money to buy off a slave then you don't need to buy a slave because you are rich in the first place!!! Second, or perhaps first, who would be crazy enough to trust anything going on the dark web, (especially a sex slave auction) ?!? Also, why not abduct the girl yourself because it's just as illegal as buying her and it cost nothing?
And then, the gang just release the girl because she is a mother and this is against their morality??? BWAHAHAHA. And then the perp is quickly caught, off course and admits to everything??? This is such a lame plot! This was all concocted by TPTB in order to demonize the dark web. Watch out for legislation coming soon to ban the deep web.

       They did this to justify more draconian internet laws. I'm totally with you on this. Our media is becoming this surreal false reality. I feel like people like us are the only ones not participating in it, and in 5 or 10 years we won't even be able to talk about current events with regular people at all. I'm a little scared of that, not gonna lie. You think people call us crazy

       How do you know most of who we talk to online now aren't regular people? Gotta talk to people in real life. I'm continuously surprised by what I hear from various walks of life. The hygienist at the dentist the other day heard of and spoke about all those creepy kids YouTube videos. That's why I always spark the conversation in the real world, cause Internet folk, well, you never know who you're talking to.

       Yup. My cashier at Target one time looked at my toothpaste and said, "oh good, it's the fluoride free kind. Nobody should be using the regular stuff."

       With distrust in the govt at an all-time low it's actually easier than ever to go into some of the more sinister things they're doing.

       In an earlier thread I suggested the possibility that this was contrived by her agent in order to generate massive publicity for the model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agents have come up with pretty outlandish ways of generating publicity in the past. (Maybe not this outrageous)
      </p>
      <p>
       I also suspect law enforcement will take a look at that possibility.

       Maybe he's been institutionalized and wanted to go back in? Maybe someone he cared about got a big fat paycheck somehow.  Maybe he's been MK Ultraed by the Illuminati that run the modeling racket. Maybe the model is MK Ultraed...

       by controversial proves there are normal people looking around like wtf. That gives me some hope. And I have a good friend that is a total normie, and I tell him about this stuff and he humors me. 2 weeks ago I told him about some of the things we were discussing here about the Awan bros. He was like "ya sure dude". Well I saw him today, and he told me it went down more or less just like I said. He isn't planning a trip to Antarctica to look for space aliens yet...But he is turned on now. And that gives me hope as well.

       While yes I agree that passing laws against who can do what online is about as effective as sweeping a desert. Human trafficking is actually a real thing. Though exceedingly rare in the US. They tend to happen more in Asia, the Middle east, and former soviet controlled area's. And presumably south america.

       I actually think it was true. Believe it or not, various syndicates
       <em>
        do have codes and conduct
       </em>
       that they abide by. It would not surprise me if this was an Eastern European syndicate who let her go because she was a young mother. There was also some strings attached to her release from the article I was reading, one of which was a payment of 50k she'd have to pay. But, as with everything, who knows, and take it all with a grain of salt.

       But I don't buy the dark web auction angle of the story. How do you get delivery of a human being??? Too many middle persons involved, too many risks. I don't doubt that there are gangs out there doing this sort of things but it's for their own benefit not as a business over the web!

       I did note that this activity was almost a word for word reenactment of Liam Neeson's hit action thriller Taken, when a pretty young (this time American) girl is abducted by a seemingly charming man who ends up being involved in a syndicate. She is sold at a sex auction, and even ends up being sold to what looks like wealthy Middle Eastern men.

       Just found it interesting. I think this event is true though. However, I do think the media will highlight anything negative in regards to cash, privacy, digital currency, etc in order to hurt the reputation of anybody wishing to conduct activities in private.

       Isn't the deep web where a lot of people actually do engage in stuff like human trafficking and child porn?  It's an interesting thing because people want those sites taken down/exposed/people arrested, but at the same time there's talk of people wanting their privacy and security away from the prying eyes of governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where would the happy medium be for people in regards to authorities and the deep web?

       Luckily for us, it's not that easy. Obivously they can pass the legislation, but that doesn't mean they can necessarily enforce it that easily. And it's not like they can just take away everyone's bitcoin (without the threat of imprisonment anyway), so the market will just go back underground. But short of cutting the world's internet connection, the economy can continue to run as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll have to release their own coin, and then use propoganda techniques to make it seem like the best option, while simultaneously getting enough people to think that "bitcoin is dead" to try and devalue it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, this won't be a very easy step in TPTB's plan.

       (take article how you would like I'm not sure on mirror)
Although not the dark web it is still a possibility to buy a sex slave over the internet with a "guarantee" that you're getting the slave. Also Saudis like to take away passports and hide the servants work visas and then keep them as a type of slave(
       <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/11/news/la-ol-saudi-princess-human-trafficking-irvine-20130711">

       </a>
       )
2)This is what invite only websites are for and Silk Road had many legitimate sellers that sold drugs and guns until the deep web got popular and scammers started to show up left and right and the raid on Silk Road didn't help.
3)You get something delivered to you and is a guarantee versus you having to go out and hunting and possibly catching attention you don't want causing all sorts of problems but this is just based on the individual and if they have the funds to waste
4)Based on morality? Not much I hear about that now a days especially from these "scary" deep web sellers but you never know I've been surprised with many things when it comes to humans the the mind
5)Sounds super sketchy like you say but you never know people with morality in this kind of business tend to get sloppy and would get caught after letting someone go maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       But would you mind linking to what you're talking about so I can be on the same page? Sounds like a plot to get at Bitcoin and all anonymous make software perhaps like TOR.

       You don't think it's suspicious that the victim would be returned? I think that's the thing that's making people suspicious here, not the fact that it involves someone other than John Podesta.

       I find it far more suspicious that this isnt a more common occurence. By sheer factor of human error and statistics/chance if it even only 3000 people are trafficked a year and Im pretty sure the numbers are way higher then even less than 1% of that would be around 20-30 people escaping.

       I don't know about all of your reasoning but I agree that it smells.  The biggest part for me is the "morality" of releasing someone they drugged, kidnapped, and were just about to sell.

       I don't honestly think she was pretty enough. Human trafficking is highly illegal and so obviously it follows that these criminal peoples would only risk their collective humbugs on the raddist of raddishes. I'm talkin' finno-ugrics, proto-illyrians, romano-haitians, etc... Something you'd really be proud to show around the harem.

       My 53 year old father, who types with two fingers and browses FB on my mothers account, recently asked me what the Dark Web was. He also makes jokes about RedTube (it seems he hasn't discovered PornHub).

       I could see that. Even if you're wrong about that story being bullshit. I'm actually kind of surprised they haven't pro-actively worked to shut it down yet. Probably has something to do with the fact that child porn is freely available and they don't want to cut themselves off from their supply.

       They haven't banned it yet bc they created it and want/need legitimate criminal users to create "noise" to obfuscate what would otherwise be obvious intelligence agency communications. I don't think you know much about the darknet.

       The "Black Death Group" is a scam. The kidnapper didn't know this and thought he'd imitate it, perhaps even try to deal with them.

       Could be a publicity stunt but it doesn't feel like one. Going overseas, actually involving the police, and researching a 'dark web' scam to attribute it to.

       TPTB love the darknet. They created it and encouraged others to use it. This was necessary to obfuscate what would otherwise clearly be spook activity. They need child molesters, drug dealers, etc on the darknet to create noise to make it impossible to decipher their activities.

       An unknown "model" surfaces telling a story that cannot be verified and there is no police confirmation, no suggestion of the police conducting any ongoing investigation into the so called "kidnapping", or the "ransom demands", and especially her miraculous "release", cause me to think the whole thing was staged from start to finish.

       Cheap whores are a dime a dozen and you dont have to kidnap them. The Albanians who run the white slave trade in Europe don't work on the dark web, they never have. They have access to as many women as they need, and they can operate from the standpoint of women living in relative poverty will seek them out and volunteer for any work they can get..
