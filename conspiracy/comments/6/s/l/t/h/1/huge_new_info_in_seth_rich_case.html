       Last night saw a whole lot of breaking developments in the Seth Rich case courtesy of Matt Couch who is one of the only people actually investigating the murder besides Cassandra Fairbanks and Big Leauge Politics. Anyways, last night on Periscope Matt dropped huge news about what him and his team have discovered about the night of the murder. Here's the link
       <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXGyOMyQjdxM">
        https://www.pscp.tv/w/1DXGyOMyQjdxM
       </a>
       <br/>
       At the beginning he talks about how Shawn Lucas and Seth Rich were in communication on the dark web before both of their deaths. That was first revealed a few days ago. The newer developments begin at about the 25 min mark of the video. Here's what is new:
       <br/>
       -the mysterious 2 hour gap where Seth was supposedly walking home from the bar on the phone now makes more sense as it looks like Seth was at a private party in his honor at a house
       <br/>
       -there were 12 people there and they were all part of the DNC
       <br/>
       -7 or 8 people left Seth at the party where they supposedly knew something bad was going to happen to him
       <br/>
       -these DNC workers had allegedly ratted Seth out
       <br/>
       -one of his friends tried to unsuccessfully help Seth the rest turned on him
       <br/>
       -the house was owned by Imran Awan of DWS fame
       <br/>
       -he talked to his ex girlfriend Kelsey Mulka not for 43 minutes but more like 45 seconds saying to her "how could you have done this to me?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Matt is very credible since he has been working hard on this case for months, this info could really blow the case out of the water. He has an inside source and it looks like he's implying that Aaron Rich may be one of those who turned on his own brother. I highly recommend watching the 2nd half of this video as soon as you can if you are at all interested in this case.

       Can he provide any sort of documents or material proof?

       I find that videos tend to have a lot of "because I said so" evidence.

       Well all I know is that Matt Couch has been looking into the Seth Rich murder for months, he tweets all the time about it. He has a team of 7 people looking into it including a professional private investigator. Him and his team went to Washington last month and to Omaha and they are going back to Washington soon. I agree with almost nothing that Matt thinks politically (he's a Trumper) but he seems very diligent about this investigation. 
He has no intention of burning his source so will be hard to get concrete info. I think the hope is that if this is all true then the people at the party will start getting very nervous and someone might finally talk.

       untrustworthy to me.

       Do you understand that witness testimony includes testimony investigators, coroners? Hearsay is used during testimony to exclude testimony and a judge rules on that during an objection. What is your point I am sorry. That witnesses are hearsay? I myself think that the Seth rich case points to a huge cover up and the Seth murders is damaging to the 2 party system in Washington DC. But who knows D.C. police are known to be corrupt just ask any local.

       I've taken testimony from many witnesses. I'm pointing out that "here's what some guy told me" without evidence or indicia of credibility is poor evidence outside of a courtroom, and incidentally also inadmissible in court.

       Asking what else he could offer is irrelevant to the assessment of what he is currently offering. It's not good evidence, whether or not he could offer better evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, a reporter with a track record of solid reporting may be able to offer credible accounts from unverifiable sources. Crouch doesn't have that kind of history. His reporting of unverified accounts from unverifiable sources aren't good evidence of anything. He needs to offer facts that (a) can be verified by third parties, such as us, and (b) are clearly relevant to and supportive of the story he's telling.

       No I am not. Witnesses can be anyone that helps prove the case for the prosecutor. I am not going to argue with you on this. This is a boring topic to me. Politics is nothing but bread and circuses.

       It means they didn't reveal their source at the time.  In fact they never revealed him, he revealed himself, and they just confirmed it.  And they reported stories based almost entirely on what he told them because they believed him to be reliable.  Mark Couch also believes his source is reliable so he is reporting stories based on that source.

       You leave out one important detail. The deep threat scandal was useful to the political coup that was going on. The Seth rich murder is not useful to the political class in DC. Republicans and democrats protect the two party system and will even murder to maintain that balance of power.
As to evidence? What kind of evidence are you looking for? It sounds like you simply have a personal interest in downplaying Seth riches murder. What evidence exactly would satisfy your quest for knowledge?

       I was hoping you could provide some specific examples of what you consider evidence. Unfortunately evidence such as Seth richs computer or his Reddit account were scrubbed. The police who have the ability to collect evidence have been silent and unable to move the investigation forward despite the huge political importance of his death. A journalist is not empowered to enact a search warrant or collect the kind of evidence that law enforcement can. The level of proof is different for journalists then a prosecutor. I hope I explainedwhy the demand for a smoking gum should really be to the corrupt and inept police department that is sitting on evidence that could either exonerate or implicate wrong doing.

       But I've been keeping an eye out for his developments on twitter and some things seem legit but other things seem like a desperate attempt at drumming up donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few days ago he was ALL about how Seth's roommate was mentioned MULTIPLE times in Podesta's emails. He went HARD on this connection but not ONCE did he disclose that these multiple mentions were literally copies of the same mass mailer email. Seth's roommate was credited for writing an article and that article was mentioned in the mass mailer email.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matt was acting like it was definitive proof that Podesta and Seth's roommate were definitively connected. I watched Matt post multiple variations of this claim on twitter, and it seemed as people responded to him asking him for a link to the source, he would post another tweet an hour later making the same claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       It rubbed me the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the other poster here said, if there is any documents or material proof to back up the claims laid out in the OP, lets see them.

       I agree it's good to remain skeptical, Matt Couch has had some misfires.  He also talks a lot about Seth cancelling his trip to the White House but I've seen it mentioned the event for that day was rained out which was the actual reason.  The Podesta link thing was weak too.  The sad part is we're forced to rely on these individuals on Twitter we can't really vet to do all the digging because nobody else will touch the case.

       Just a weird fact that is likely meaningless, but the PP report mentioned that Seth was lactose intolerant. I thought it was a strange thing to include in a profile, so I went through Seth's social media wiki
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       and sure enough, he said on Reddit that, post-surgery, he had become lactose intolerant and could no longer partake in the "drunk cheese pizza" that his roommate kept tempting him with.

       Are you talking about what you've heard about her  from this video or from elsewhere?   Because in Matt's version one of  the last thing Seth does is call her and say "Why did you do this to me?"  Sounds like she at least knew, and possibly helped in some way.  Maybe she led him into the trap, or something.

       Yes I mean to say this is stuff I heard about her before. That's why this post is so shocking to me. That's scandalous as hell. And far different than the "official" story.

       It's all based on his one source who  claims knew Seth, and I think even says he was  at the party.  The way he talks he makes it sound like he has real evidence and can get people arrested.  It could just be bullshit trying to get someone to come forward too.  Who knows.

       So if you think a guy has been murdered by powers that be, and you're investigating said murder, why would you record a teaser video saying you're going to blow the lid off of it? Aren't you giving said powers an opportunity to murder you? It would be be far more effective to stay quiet until you release said evidence. It's illogical. It's attention whoring. It's bullshit.

      <p>
       Or else this investigator is a complete moron.

       I was hoping you could provide some specific examples of what you consider evidence. Unfortunately evidence such as Seth richs computer or his Reddit account were scrubbed. The police who have the ability to collect evidence have been silent and unable to move the investigation forward despite the huge political importance of his death. A journalist is not empowered to enact a search warrant or collect the kind of evidence that law enforcement can. The level of proof is different for journalists then a prosecutor. I hope I explainedwhy the demand for a smoking gum should really be to the corrupt and inept police department that is sitting on evidence that could either exonerate or implicate wrong doing.
