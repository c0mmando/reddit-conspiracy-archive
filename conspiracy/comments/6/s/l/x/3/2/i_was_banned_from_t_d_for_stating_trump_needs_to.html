       The McMaster/Soros connection has come out in recent days.  There is so much evidence showing how Mcmaster is completely compromised.  Now they are going after members of T_D.  The entire sub has been scrubbed of McMaster posts.  I got a message saying that "Trump fully stand behind Mcmaster and no trolling would be tolerated".  WTF is going on.  This sounds like Soros is sending out his minions and paying people off.  Very creepy.  Be aware.

       Trump himself has expressed confidence in McMaster, so if you say he needs to be fired you are going against our supreme leader. Also, letting McMaster go would mean a 3rd NSA in like 6 months, which goes against Trumps image of "hiring the best people" and "no chaos in the WH"

       So we are 100% trusting of israeli intelligence and not at all trusting American intelligence? If this was true, don't you think Trump would have fired him? Unless you are claiming you have intelligence info that Trump doesn't?

       I think Trump wants to fire him, and that it will happen.  But I know that many deep state officials in our government are working with Mcmaster.  Those people will have their knives out once Mcmaster is gone.

       If anyone thinks the leaks will stop by firing McMaster or any other high level adviser, I hate to tell you that is not the case. Leaks are coming from all over. Maybe we should be asking ourselves why the info is being leaked and not who is leaking it. Maybe if there was not so much shady shit going on behind closed doors, there would be no pressure for loyal Americans to get the info to the press.

       Mcmaster is not the sole source of leaks, he is a piece of the puzzle.  Also, WTF are you talking about?  Leaking entire conversations with foreign leaders so they can criticize his temperment?  Give me a fucking break.  Why didnt someone leak why we shipped $400 million in un marked cash to the Iranian regime in the middle of the night??

       We can't do anything but speculate who and why the transcripts were released. I understand the harm of leaking that stuff but I am more concerned about what the transcripts revealed. I assume that has something to do with why it was leaked. Somebody felt as though it was damaging and wanted to score some political points.

       And Alex's response was to the effect of "Yeah, I play a character on some of the SKITS I do on my show.  But that's only less than 1% of what I do on the show.  The other 99%+ of the time I'm articulating my genuinely held beliefs."

       wow.  just wow.  so, these fucking slimeball senators, who are bought and paid for have your full support, and trump is a dirtbag?  Trump is just doing exactly what he said he was going to do.  Dean Heller votes "NO" against obamacare repeal, yesterday every insurance company pulled out of Obamacare exchange in his state=his state is fucked.  Mccain said Russia hacking podesta's emails was "an act of war", and attacked trump for not attacking them, then North Korea has a nuclear warhead that could destroy Hawaii in 10 minutes and he criticizes Trump for his rhetoric.  You literally cannot make this shit up.

       Wow.  The evidence proving McMaster is a globalist/Soros operative is pretty conclusive and damning.

       I understand that the mods at The Donald typically don't allow criticism of Trump's positions or decisions.  But you would think that they would make an exception here, considering how bad McMaster is.

       Im surprised that you would fight Trump when all hes trying to do is get the federal government the fuck out of our business. how could anyone be opposed to this??  He cut 11k federal jobs on monday.  He has saved $150 billion dollars from the federal deficit so far.  If he gets dumb ass congress to follow his lead on tax reform, our economy could be the greatest its EVER been.  Follow him

       Mcmaster is not the sole source of leaks, he is a piece of the puzzle.  Also, WTF are you talking about?  Leaking entire conversations with foreign leaders so they can criticize his temperment?  Give me a fucking break.  Why didnt someone leak why we shipped $400 million in un marked cash to the Iranian regime in the middle of the night??
