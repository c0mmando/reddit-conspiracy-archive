Silly conspiracy theorist. The king wasnt out to get him! What was he thinking!?</p>

<p>Letter to him  from George Synder to George Washinton 1778</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our present Time, pregnant with the most shocking Evils and Calamities, threatens Ruin to our Liberty and Goverment. Secret, the most secret Plans are in Agitation: Plans, calculated to ensnare the Unwary, to attract the Gay and irreligious, and to entice even the Well-disposed to combine in the general Machine for overturning all Government and all Religion.
It was some Time since that a Book fell into my Hands entituled “Proofs of a Conspiracy &amp;c. by John Robison,”1 which gives a full Account of a Society of Freemasons, that distinguishes itself by the Name “of Illuminati,” whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all Religion, even natural; and who endeavour to eradicate every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distinguish Man from Beast by his Shape only. A Thought suggested itself to me, that some of the Lodges in the United States might have caught the Infection, and might cooperate with the Illuminati or the Jacobine Club in France. Fauchet is mentioned by Robison as a zealous Member: and who can doubt of Genet and Adet? Have not these their Confidants in this Country? They use the same Expressions and are generally Men of no Religion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>to which George Washington esponds in a seriesof letters ending with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GW’s response from Mount Vernon on 24 Oct. brought the exchange to a close: “Revd Sir I have your favor of the 17th instant before me; and my only motive to trouble you with the receipt of this letter, is to explain, and correct a mistake which I perceive the hurry in which I am obliged, often, to write letters, have led you into.
“It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Iluminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more fully satisfied of this fact than I am.
“The idea I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or the pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, and that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects—and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.
“My occupations are such, that but little leisure is allowed me to read News Papers, or Books of any kind; the reading of letters, and preparing answers, absorb much of my time. With respect—I remain Revd Sir Your Most Obedt Hble Ser. Go: Washington” (letterpress copy, DLC:GW; LB DLC:GW).
2. The Illuminati was the name of a secret society founded in 1776 in Bavaria by Adam Weishaupt. It had an organization similar to the Freemasons and evinced republican and deistic principles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha!</p>

<p>I had no idea!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in The Illuminatus! Trilogy, written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, as the founder of the Illuminati and as an impostor who killed George Washington and took his place as the first president of the United States. Washington&#39;s portrait on the U.S. one-dollar bill is said to actually be Weishaupt&#39;s.</p>

<p>Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel Cerebus the Aardvark by Dave Sim, as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the Cerebus and Church &amp; State I volumes. His motives are republican confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.</p>

<p>He and Franklin heavily infiltrated Freemasonry to make it appear that the American Revolution would be a &quot;controlled&quot; revolution to let the people blow off steam. This is why the British didn&#39;t fight very hard, or kill off all the leaders quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how far it goes back with hard evidence but it&#39;s public knowledge that something akin to America was being conceptualized before its founding with individuals like Sir Francis Bacon and a &quot;New Atlantis&quot;. </p>

<p>However, this idea that Washington or Franklin were working as double agents for Britain is provably wrong. The Culper Spy Ring is an example off the top of my head that shows Washington and Franklin were, in fact, working against the British. If you want to suggest otherwise, then you&#39;ve got to bring some hard evidence to the table instead of just making claims. </p>

<p>As for the idea that he was murdered by Freemasons, that&#39;s even more absurd. Washington is the most venerated of all Masonic figures, he&#39;s featured in almost if not every lodge including the House of the Temple in Washington, DC, and bloodletting was actually how they tried to treat people back then. If what you said was true, he wouldn&#39;t still be vernerated by Masons, including the &quot;high level&quot; ones, today. Unless that&#39;s all a conspiracy, too. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/HowTheNationWasWonAmericasUntoldStory1630-1754">This</a> will bridge most of the details between that time and the Revolution. The Revolution was not a sudden occurrence, it was planned out far in advance.</p>

<p>I said the exact opposite of this.</p>

<p>You either have some hard evidence to back what you say like an intelligent person, or don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure you read my post, because you&#39;ve made several errors on issues that I was clear on, and I provided some evidence. There is plenty of documentation that all of his doctors were masons:</p>

<p>As for the whole Illuminati thing.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mention the Illuminati. We can talk about it, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Illuminati really did try to seek out world order and spread &quot;Illuminism&quot; but that wasn&#39;t compatible with Freemasonry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you dig really deep, the Illuminati was actually an infiltration of Freemasonry, designed to create support for the American Revolution. Be careful with most of the exposes, because they&#39;re mostly written by Freemasons and Jesuits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Illuminati really was stamped out, like historians say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and Freemasons in groups like the <a href="http://watch.pairsite.com/belmont.html">John Birch Society</a> are the ones saying it survived, and is behind all of the evils being committed by the Freemasons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BUT, after WWI/WWII, a &quot;world order&quot; did come about, sorta. What people call &quot;the new world order&quot; is really just known alliances, called the international order and it&#39;s even called that in the National Intelligence Council reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll want to look into the <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/book_reviews/2007/3408quigley_jeff.html">Round Table</a> and the other groups created around the turn of the previous century. They were the ones that infiltrated America and re-took the colonies for the Crown.

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that Washington&#39;s doctors, who bloodlet him to death on purpose, were also masons? Do you know what that means under masonic law?</p>

<p>A mason can&#39;t murder a brother mason unless he is a traitor. None of Washington&#39;s murderers were killed by the freemasons, so there&#39;s only one conclusion: Washington was murdered as a traitor to freemasonry.</p>

<p>The fact is, Washington basically pretended to be a freemason, so the British would go along with the Revolution. But it wasn&#39;t a masonic revolution, it was a real revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware that Washington&#39;s doctors, who bloodlet him to death on purpose, were also masons? Do you know what that means under masonic law?</p>

<p>A mason can&#39;t murder a brother mason unless he is a traitor. None of Washington&#39;s murderers were killed by the freemasons, so there&#39;s only one conclusion: Washington was murdered as a traitor to freemasonry.</p>

<p>The fact is, Washington basically pretended to be a freemason, so the British would go along with the Revolution. But it wasn&#39;t a masonic revolution, it was a real revolution.</p>
