Part of me thinks they might be a legit threat but the other half of me that has recently became aware of the 9/11 false flag is seeing patterns similar to before those events took place. Things like the pentagon missing trillions of dollars,  conducting preparedness drills (nuclear drills a few months back in NYC and DC), testing our ICBMs from CA recently, and the media seeming to be ramping us up for war. I&#39;m thinking it might be a little bit of both at this point. My other question is what would our government gain by going to war with NK? </p>

<p>Seriously? War is a business. It funnels tax payer money into the pockets of defense contractors. War has been and always will be about profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to somewhat believe the official narrative on this one, except for a few things.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Kim is actually hell bent on destroying the world, I think he&#39;s just an idiot kid who inherited power and doesn&#39;t know how to properly run a country. The leads to him feeling inadequate and having to lash out by executing any dissenters. </p>

<p>North Korea has pretty useless land for farming, and they&#39;ve historically depended on food aid from other countries. His father used this same sort of &quot;give us aid or we&#39;ll do something terrible&quot; dog and pony show.</p>

<p>Un threatening the worst coincides with their worst drought in decades, and I kinda feel like that&#39;s connected.</p>

<p>But, if you went to South Korea right now, most people wouldn&#39;t even give North Korea a s find thought. They act crazy every year, achieve some kind of deal, then back off, and then rinse - repeat.</p>

<p>Kim Jong Un and their leadership is not as crazy as people or the media wants you to think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And somehow all of our past administrations have managed to not feed the troll (Kim Jong.) There&#39;s no easy way to subdue NK without it affecting China, Russia, SK, and Japan. And ultimately turning it into a global conflict and potential economic collapse. Sanctions and diplomacy have always been the solution to the NK problem.</p>

<p>The Laymen America isn&#39;t going to get behind a war with NK even if they do bomb the sea by Guam. Hopefully even with the cheerleading Fox and Friends and the like are doing with Trump&#39;s words I hope enough people can see past the bullshit enough to realize what a bad idea all of this is. Guam is basically slave labor for US manufacturers. We should be empowering them to break the shackles. </p>

<p>We have the capability to neutralize any threat NK may claim they have without causing any casualties. Sanctions are pretty much already starving them out. What&#39;s the next step? Bomb a bunch of people that have no choice in the matter? The whole thing is fucked and more political theater as far as I can see it. If any military aggression is to be executed by the US Russia and China will need to be on-board 100% or we are fucked, period. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Artillery is not nukes. And it doesn&#39;t take them long to shoot aimlessly at Seoul. Seoul is a mega city and practically a city-state. It&#39;s only a few miles from the border. Millions of lives would be decimated within a minute or two.</p>

<p>Not only that, they have chemical weapons that can be blasted over cities and areas of the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DPRK have always rattled the sabre, but in the past they haven&#39;t really had such threatening capabilities and they usually wanted something.</p>

<p>This year they have dramatically increased their missile tests, they have long range ballistic missiles and are under a year away from possessing an effective ICBM. It’s believed these missiles are nuclear capable and they have, or are close to having a suitable warhead. This is in the face of increased sanctions and increased criticism and opposition - they&#39;re not getting anything from this so far.</p>

<p>Their progress has really surprised analysts. There was lots of Bush-era “axis of evil” fear mongering which failed to materialise, but recently things have really accelerated. They’re all ready a threat to US territory and allies with conventional weapons and could do all manner of harm today if they wished. But the strike-anywhere ICBM frightens people a lot more.</p>

<p>It is really hard to say what the DPRK will do. I&#39;ve followed them since the nineties and their attitude hasn&#39;t much changed over that time, but their capabilities and confidence have. There’s still no end to the regime in sight.</p>

<p>I also don’t know about what plans are in place to deal with the DPRK, either now or when they have more capabilities.</p>

<p>You don’t have to worry for your own personal safety yet if that’s what you mean, but that’s for now. If you’re concerned about any military action I dunno.</p>
