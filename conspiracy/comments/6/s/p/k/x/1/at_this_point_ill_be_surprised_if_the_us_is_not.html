       I'm gonna move that timeline a lot closer. If NK launches missles at Guam next week like promised, then it's on like donkey kong. Even if they explode in the water its close enough to be considered a direct attack and we will strike back. God help us all.

       I will say, in all the past NK threats we've seen over the years, there's never been such a realistic "timeline" attached (other than them just saying XYZ attack is 'imminent'). To say they're gonna try to strike Guam (specific location) in mid-August (specific time period) is just.....yikes.

       I guess we'll all be waiting with baited breath like we do for the 4chan LARPs. of course i'm hoping this will also be a hoax

       Don't buy into the fear mongering and Trump feeding the troll. A war with NK means a global conflict and as much shit as Trump talks that sort of conflict would put us in a conflict that would cause his business interests to suffer. Thankfully he's got people around him that hopefully have half a brain and realize what a very bad idea war would be. Hell, even his buddy VP has gotta give him a call and let him know not to feed the troll.

       I don't disagree with that either, but the crass jerk certainly seems to be heavily compromised by the deep state at this point, so he's definitely making a push toward sending us all to hell in a hand basket.

       Sure, but when Obama sent us to hell in a handbasket, he was cheered for it due to him hiding the reality of what was going on. Trump straight up says "we should steal their oil." He straight up says "Obama created ISIS." When you're bold and direct and honest in that way, it makes it harder for the MIC to do what it wants to do.

       There's now been rumblings of a false flag being blamed on NK, so people are trying to figure out a) what's going to happen, but seemingly less important b) what they're going to use to overshadow their involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) the part that's got me worried isn't that nk will strike first. It's that once they see that the "first strike" is blamed on them, they will take
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       as the first strike. And retaliate immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       America slaps itself in the face, cries "NKorea!" Then organizes a retaliation. Nk will know at this point, they are doomed. They will have no reason to think otherwise. So they push the button.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not expecting Red Dawn and armed paratroopers, or even nukes in major cities. But they do have nukes and satellites. The ability to combine the two could kill 90% of America (EMP). I have also noticed that the news has inexplicably stopped mentioning EMPs as of a couple weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to B) in less than 2 weeks, we've got the mother of all distractions coming.
       <em>
        Literally
       </em>
       overshadowing the entire country.

       Really not the bold of a prediction, which is what makes it scary. Being in tune with reality, while maintaining knowledge of historical precedents and trends, paints the future image of war with North Korea or Iran statistically probable. But account for NK, Iran, Russia, Syria, and ISIS (along with some other less well known players) and you have the statistical probability of World War 3 occurring within the next year. That's the bold prediction. Crazy times.

       The hysteria is meant to drum up national security spending and arms sales in the region.  Unlike Iraq, Libya, and Syria, these countries are deathtraps with large armies dug into rough inhospitable terrain and large uncooperative populations that would be impossible to manage without inflating our army with a draft.  I don't think the elite are willing to push their luck with popular opinion that far.

       No.  These tensions are being manufactured to bring the polities in the region into a hardline stance that we can then sell arms to.  We would never go to war with North Korea because that would destroy Seoul and thereby end their allegiance to the U.S.  The deep state wants this party to go on forever so that's right out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same for Iran.  The U.S. and Israel want Iran to exist as a threat to divide the Arab world, which the U.S. can also sell arms to.
