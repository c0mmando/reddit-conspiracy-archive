I feel like a solid 30-40% of you (not counting shills who spread disinfo), don&#39;t even understand the basic fundamentals of &quot;The conspiracy&quot;, and how the elite and social engineers operate. </p>

<p>Some of you still think certain mainstream media&#39;s are trustworthy, and a lot of you are always debating the stupid mainstream political theatrics, and hitting the beach all over the net back and forth, just like they want you to.</p>

<p>Some of you are still caught up in the two party system, and even worse a good portion of you don&#39;t even care that there is an evil group trying to subvert our civil liberties, and wallow in your depressing and pessimistic view of things. </p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re too powerful bro, there&#39;s no use&quot;</p>

<p>Yea? Then get the fuck out of here and quit dragging the rest of us down who know our shit and want to reverse the effect this cancerous cabal has on our beautiful planet. </p>

<p>Learn the fundamentals of how these people operate for Christ sake. Please. I want you to awaken and be your very best and we need you. We need to kick it up like 50 notches folks. I never anticipated such division and cluelessness in a sub like this where I expected everyone to be on the same page. </p>

<p>Psshhht, I about shit myself.</p>

<p>Guys. They are selected years in advance and take pride in being the sellout president. They make tons of money and they prepare for the role years in advance. Im sure there is coaching on how to properly sell yourself to the masses as a president. They&#39;re all pretending, they&#39;re literally actors folks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh, the &quot;Bush whitewash&quot; narrative is more bullshit to confuse and divide the opposition. </p>

<p>What we are seeing with Bush now is: 
 1 - assholes who liked Bush back then <em>still</em> liking Bush now - SHOCKER!, and, 
 2 - people that always opposed Bush recognizing that the new plutocrat in office is way worse or at the very least equally as pernicious as Bush ever was, while still being secure enough to admit &quot;At least his benign painting is alright, I guess.&quot;   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s reasonable. Although this model of &#39;rehabilitation&quot; of a former pres&#39; image seems more like civic politeness for the sake of the half of the citizenry that identify with the disgraced leader. I&#39;m old enough that I was around when Nixon was and remember when he died and far from being whitewashed that presidency&#39;s stink did not fade on the broad level. You&#39;ll get Republicans and other rightwingers who unscrupulously deny deflect and bury the awfulness of their ideological brother&#39;s stain but no real trans-partisan whitewash.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not about being Democrat or Republican.  That is a distraction.  The real fight is between the NWO globalists and the Nationalists.   Putin and Trump are Nationalists, which is why they are attacked in the media.  </p>

<p>Both Democrats and Republicans are NWO globalists, which is why they are aligned with each other against Trump.  You would think that the Republican party would be thrilled that Trump gave them both houses of Congress, as well as another seat on the Supreme Court.  None of this matters because Trump is against the NWO.  </p>

<p>Current events make much more sense once you see things in terms of the NWO globalists versus Nationalists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question, actually.  Trump has pushed for restraint in immigration and building the border wall.  Of course, the border wall is a stupid idea and would be a huge waste of money, but it is something a Nationalist would push for.  NWO globalists want open borders and unrestrained immigration, like what is currently happening in Europe.  New World Order globalists want a one world government, which would presumably require the dissolution of the current nations, including the US.  Trump wants to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.  </p>

<p>There is also this Trump speech regarding the New World Order.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/EYozWHBIf8g">https://youtu.be/EYozWHBIf8g</a></p>

<p>You raise valid points, but being President is not what people believe.  Trump did not march into the White House last January and start issuing orders.  Trump was given orders, and this was the source of the conflict, especially with the CIA.  Trump thought he was going to implement his policies, but the policies are set for him.  </p>

<p>Same with Obama.  When Obama first became President, he was given a list of bankers to appoint to his administration.  The list was given to him by Citibank.  I suspect the same thing happened to Trump.  </p>

<p>If someone is going to argue that I hate Democrats, it should be because I supported Bernie and he got screwed big time.  I really believe that Bernie would have beaten Trump in the election.  Hillary was not a viable candidate.  There was also the Convention, and the way the Bernie supporters were treated.  People kept chanting &quot;No more War!  No more War!&quot;, but they were drowned out and ignored.  </p>

<p>The worlds economy is a war economy, but that is no longer sustainable.  It will come crashing down once war can no longer be waged, and they are running out of excuses to attack countries.  They will push for attacks against Iran and North Korea because these are the last two countries without a Rothschild controlled Central Bank.  </p>

<p>If North Korea is attacked, it will be the first nuclear armed country.  Seoul is about 30 miles from the DMZ, and there are about 23 million people in that area.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People tend to think of the elites as being a single group that works together.  However, there is more than one group with competing interests.  I should have been more clear in my post.  </p>

<p>The Rockefeller family is behind the New World Order, Bilderbergers, and Council on Foreign Relations.  They wanted Hillary to win.  </p>

<p>The Rothschilds are behind the other group, and they wanted Trump to win.  They saw Hillary as being a weak candidate, and very undisciplined.  </p>

<p>Think about it this way.  If you are a New World Order globalist and you know that certain compromising videos and pictures are on Weiner&#39;s laptop, then you will capitulate if threatened with their release.  </p>

By generalising things to &quot;mainstream media = against trump&quot; and &quot;alternative media = for Trump&quot; they&#39;re encouraging this duality in people&#39;s minds that it has to be one or the other. Whoever &quot;they&quot; are they realise that trust in media is dropping - they&#39;re not stupid - so they&#39;re gonna take advantage of that to further rally up the population&#39;s emotions and get a split so they&#39;re easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s several powers controlling different aspects of the world. You got stuff like Bilderberg group, 7th floor group, skull and crossbones and other secret societies, the military industrial complex, the Vatican, Israel and the Rothschilds, illuminati, freemasons, etc etc etc. Lots of groups, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of overlaps. But who is at the top? Well I don&#39;t think there is a top. Ultimately it&#39;d be &quot;God&quot; in whatever way you choose to define that.<br/>
In my personal opinion, I think there&#39;s an Israel/MIC overlap that&#39;s currently wielding the most influence. I think they may answer to some kind of ET and/or extradimensional entity (some would say demonic - but I prefer to say extradimensional because that doesn&#39;t restrict it to the idea of demons in mainstream Christianity). And I&#39;d reckon they&#39;re part of a further galactic thing, and then within that there&#39;s a power structure and secret groups to control that and you see where I&#39;m going with this. As above so below.<br/>
In the end I think what matters is understanding where you are currently, recognising what you can do to improve things for you those around you, and doing that. Anything that is out of your power to control or help in is not worth worrying over. Not to say forget it, just don&#39;t <em>worry</em>. Be mindful, but focus on where you are. Because right now that&#39;s where we are. In these human bodies living a life from a human perspective - so do the best you can from that. Live the life you&#39;ve got, love the life you live, and project that love out to everyone you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we at the bottom? I&#39;ve always wondered. My belief, from my research so far, is that the fabric of spacetime itself is consciousness. The interconnected network of information interacting with itself creates a feedback/feedforward loop of information that, by nature, is conscious. The fact that any point, which is instantaneously connected on a quantum level to any and every other point of the universe, can be different to any other, establishes the concept of relativity. This is self-awareness - aka relative consciousness. As information gathers as we scale up and forms stable relationships with other points, relative consciousness becomes more complex. Things get exponentially more complex the more we scale up, due to the square-cube law, and more and more variables come into play which affect how relative consciousness manifests. Things like where it is and when it is... In relation to literally everything else. It&#39;s too complex and long to try to explain in detail what I mean in just one reddit comment, but I wanna try to simplify this.<br/>
Picture a &quot;point&quot; or one &quot;pixel&quot; in the universe - a planck sphere unit. One PSU is immediately interconnected/interwoven with... At least like 24(?) other PSUs (can&#39;t remember exactly how many. I&#39;m trying to picture <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">a flower of life in 3d and count those immediately connected but I don&#39;t have the brain power atm and can&#39;t draw this out. This should help with what I mean</a>.) PSUs rotate one way or the other, like making a 1 or 0 in binary. By being immediately connected to only so many other PSUs that will either be rotating in the same direction or the opposite it establishes (what we may perceive to be) a simple relative consciousness.<br/>
Also a disclaimer: I&#39;m sorta taking time out of the equation here, or at least simplifying it, because as time moves forward more variables are introduced and complexity increases exponentially. Fractals, baby!<br/>
Now let&#39;s picture a cell for example. A much more complex packet of information than a PSU, but still a stable packet of information nonetheless. And still relatively simple compared to us. It&#39;s made of a nucleus, cell membrane and/or cell wall, DNA etc which are made of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, which are made of compounds, which are made of elements, yada yada yada and when you strip every label away and dissect it down to its core it&#39;s just information. PSUs. Consciousness. And a cell can interact with the immediate cells around it, as well as to other cells via chemicals which the larger body that it makes up takes in, to get a further idea of its role. If you get what I mean.<br/>
Now let&#39;s take animals as an example. Stable packet of information. Albeit much more complex that a cell. Made of organs made of cells made of chemicals yada yada- consciousness. And obviously the more complex the packet of information the more things it has to interact with, both immediately and by any other number of degrees, which form a sense of self.<br/>
I would say that this immediate packet of information that&#39;s created by an accumulation of smaller packets of information is the &quot;ego self&quot;. It&#39;s limited, exclusive, and temporary. Whereas due to everything being connected fundamentally in the quantum level true &quot;self&quot; is literally everything. The Universe. &quot;Brahman&quot; is what I believe it&#39;s known as in Hinduism. Some call it &quot;higher self&quot;, some call it God. I believe everything (and by that I mean every <em>thing</em>) is conscious. Every thing, in whatever form it takes, experiences relative consciousness based on where in time and space it exists. And furthermore, I <em>think</em> (this is based on pure intuition following my own research) that complexity comes in resonant octaves. Everything is waves after all. These increasingly complex packets of information form at peaks and troughs and depending on their relative size at differing frequencies. This is probably what affects whether or not a &quot;particle&quot; (packet of information at any given size/complexity/frequency) is consciously aware of its interconnection to everything or if it&#39;s focused in its own little ego reality. Essentially whether or not it&#39;s egoic in nature or spiritual. I think humans are at some weird halfway point of superposition, which is why some are so focused on materialism whereas some are very spiritual. With humans it&#39;s probably significantly more affected by cosmic alignments than it&#39;s currently commonly accepted or even considered. But we can clearly see and measure from our persisting that how we treat or bodies affects how our cells are over time, so why wouldn&#39;t the same principle apply where we are the cells and the Earth is the body? A cell doesn&#39;t live long enough to understand how or why a body works, but it&#39;s effected by what the body does regardless, so we as humans definitely don&#39;t live long enough to yet understand how or why a planet&#39;s relative consciousness and body work.<br/>
Where am I going with this again? Oh yeah the macrocosm. Yeah so I reckon we are a relative macrocosm to cells, which are a relative macrocosm to atoms. And these are microcosmic relative to humans/animals, and we are microcosmic relative to planets and galaxies which I also believe experience relative consciousness and so forth and so forth. Objectively there is no micro or macrocosm. It&#39;s just the universe. And as far as the universe is concerned everything everywhere is all happening now all at once. It just <em>is</em>. These concepts of micro and macro only exist from a frame of reference. A relative conscious perspective. And relative conscious perspectives are only temporary.<br/>
It&#39;s funny. Seems both nihilistic and all-inclusive at the same time. Just depends on your perspective. Heh. The nature of truth is paradoxical, and time is a very weird dimension to exist in. Thank you and goodnight! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nephilim are said to be from fallen angels breeding with human women. After the flood, the nephilim were still on earth somehow, apparently. It is those bloodlines that still exist today, albeit watered down a bit. These people worship Lucifer, so my guess is they answer to him, as there are no pure humans higher up the pyramid than these nephilim bloodlines. </p>

<p>Off the top of my head, their blood type is RH positive, where only a very very small percentage have that type. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gary believes they&#39;re biblical and spiritual figures, but not necessarily aliens. So basically one creator, but within his creation there&#39;s us, and there&#39;s these angels/watchers. The difference is that the laws of physics do not apply to these angels the way they do for us. He takes biblical scripture to be literal from what I&#39;ve seen. He does make an excellent case for all of this as well, again, backed up with solid facts and scripture. </p>

There is nothing rational or logical about wishful thinking. This is why the TPTB continue to enjoy the position they are in because people cannot face the &quot;worst case scenario&quot; they use a false rational construct to avoid simply the possibilty of an evil group in power.

<p>Anyway, I think a healthy dose of &quot;did we actually walk on the moon&quot; is good for everyone. I mean, it&#39;s not like you can recreate it at home, right? And do you want millions of people to be told something that they can&#39;t recreate and just believe it? To me, it&#39;s sort of like the Jesus walked on water story.

    <div class="md"><p>I get that some have set a standard for what&#39;s plausible or acceptable.</p>

<p>Just, please don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Every conspiracy pertaining to the paranormal etc. isn&#39;t immediately the moon being made of cheese and every exaggerated &quot;buzzword&quot;/subject to assert that everything that is outside the realm of politics is ridiculous. There are more layers to this, imo. </p>

<p>&quot;You believe in spirits?  Why, you must be a flat earther as well at that.&quot;</p>

<p>The political pandering has made people act more toxic, and diverts people more than entertaining alternative theories. Not that the subject of politics doesn&#39;t belong here. This is a mixed bag of a sub.</p>

<p>If people are put off because they can&#39;t take it seriously, then maybe they should allow themselves to open up to it. Call it a thought exercise, as I think it helps you be more flexible in thought overall.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only fair, because this sub started out with such theories so I can understand that people get upset when someone is &quot;setting the bar&quot; on a sub they may have been frequenting for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are the newbie here. This sub used to be about those &quot;goofy Pandora&#39;s box&quot; things you are talking about, and it was a completely different. There were discussions about the farming industry and its cover-ups, actual links to public records for government things, collaboration on things that we couldn&#39;t see alone. Then 2016 rolled around and people like you and OP steamrolled the rest of us with your dumb political shilling. These kinds of posts are not productive, all you do is post surface level news articles about US politics and ramping up the goofiness to the maximum. And to top if off, you are acting like asshats and being rude to the other community members of this sub. Honestly, just go Alex Jones&#39; forums for that. Continue buying his Super Beta Male Supplement: Chicken Bone Edition XTreme until the cows come home for all I care. But /don&#39;t/ act like we are newbies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism</a> </p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; <strong>—Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; <strong>—Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</strong></p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; <strong>--Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</strong></p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; <strong>—David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</strong></p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. <strong>—Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</strong></p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. <strong>—Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fucked up and people don&#39;t realize they are sitting in a giant game being run by the New World Order. They control the political arena, which is literally a puppet show and people actually argue over something that is completely controlled and has been for quite some time. They control the media, they infiltrate social media and control social media, they run big agro, they run big pharma, they run fossil fuels/oil/natural gas, they run Hollywood/entertainment. People have become to complacent with denial (every kind of denial, denial of a NWO, denial that they themselves are prisoners to the cabal, denial of petty and small conspiracies, denial across the board). The NWO wants this though, they want it all. They want people to deny everything that isn&#39;t spoon fed to them. They want them to deny that the NWO exists, they want them to deny that every aspect of the world is controlled, they want them to fight amongst each other, they want them to be distracted by things like sports, entertainment industry, politics, and every other means of distraction. Too bad people who rant about these things you OP are talking about, and the things I just ranted about are absolutely shit on by normal people who have been so engulfed by the system. Anyways at least you know the truth, you know what&#39;s going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to add in general about trying to &quot;red pill&quot; someone; </p>

<p>There&#39;s a good chance Nazis didn&#39;t loose the ideological war. They, along with a number of other societies, orders, and churches would like to cleanse the planet and return it to an ancient Babylonian Lucifarian way of life. All these groups aren&#39;t aligned. The first group to make it to the top will gain global domination; after that, the others will likely have to battle for survival. You either acknowledge this or don&#39;t. By doing so, you are subject to question the motivation of all human and global &quot;interventions”. I say this, because we can bicker over the details of accusations, claims, and $cientific findings, but those are endless battles. I believe if you can convince anyone of the root threat, people will be more aligned to fight the larger fight, and more open to consider speculative notions, because humanity is at stake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By rigged, I mean the two choices are preselected by the elite.</p>

<p>Hillary and trump </p>

<p>Gore and Bush</p>

<p>Obama and Romney </p>

<p>Obama and McCain</p>

<p>Both candidates pretend to hate each other and oppose each other, so the people think it&#39;s real. The debates are fake. We&#39;re dealing with some relatively sociopathic people, and sociopaths and psychopaths are notorious for being able to act very well and charm people. It&#39;s all theatre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most clear in McCain and Kerry. They are the &quot;Vietnam candidates,&quot; one on each side. They were put there so that if Vietnam became a major political issue, they had their dogs all lined up. They oppose each other when it doesn&#39;t matter, but when it does, they work together to shut it all down: watch them walking out together on POW/MIA talks.</p>

<p>You have to add beyond the two choices, there is a third choice that people know can&#39;t win, but gives them hope. The one they really want to win. This is the one that keeps them voting. Without the third choice they would revolt instead of settling for the lesser evil, even though they never pick the third choice.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the &quot;debt&quot; created with money that is an important part of the NWO. They will control people with debt. For example, take student loans.

Student loan debt was turned over the IRS by Obama. Will the IRS go after those who cannot pay on their student loans?</p>

<p>Sure.  I am familiar with those terms.  It is easier to get people to believe it is Satanism.  It is interesting that we had the &quot;Satanic panic&quot; instead of the &quot;Luciferian panic&quot;.  Perhaps it was a distraction.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do relate in some level. I mean, i do believe that the traditional political system does give us the false ideia of freedom, but i don&#39;t necessarily see this as an organized plan ruled by some group (even though i don&#39;t discredit the possibility right the way). I really struggle to be resoanable sometimes, and often see myself either as too skeptical or too brain-washed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They have been telling us their goal for decades.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism</a></p>

<p>&quot;We shall have World Government, whether or not we like it. The only question is whether World Government will be achieved by conquest or consent.&quot; —Statement by Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) member James Warburg to The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, l950</p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an &quot;extraterrestrial&quot; invasion], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.&quot; —Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991</p>

<p>&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#39;t such a great idea after all.&quot; --Strobe Talbot, President Clinton&#39;s Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time, July 20th, l992</p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot; —David Rockefeller&#39;s Memoirs (Random House, New York, 2002)</p>

<p>For a long time I felt that FDR had developed many thoughts and ideas that were his own to benefit this country, the United States. But, he didn&#39;t. Most of his thoughts, his political ammunition, as it were, were carefully manufactured for him in advanced by the Council on Foreign Relations-One World Money group. Brilliantly, with great gusto, like a fine piece of artillery, he exploded that prepared &quot;ammunition&quot; in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people, and thus paid off and returned his internationalist political support...... &quot;The UN is but a long-range, international banking apparatus clearly set up for financial and economic profit by a small group of powerful One-World revolutionaries, hungry for profit and power. &quot;The depression was the calculated &#39;shearing&#39; of the public by the World Money powers, triggered by the planned sudden shortage of supply of call money in the New York money market....The One World Government leaders and their ever close bankers have now acquired full control of the money and credit machinery of the U.S. via the creation of the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. —Curtis Dall, FDR&#39;s son-in-law as quoted in his book, My Exploited Father-in-Law</p>

<p>&quot;The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control.... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. —Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who cares?  I mean, conspiracies are interesting, and maybe my life is all controlled by secret societies of global control or somesuch, but who cares?</p>

<p>We are posting on the internet.  When we aren&#39;t, most of us probably have a life with other people, our families.  People who we genuinely connect with.  We go to work, and maybe we like our jobs, maybe we hate them, but we have them, and we make money.  </p>

<p>Maybe we make a little, maybe we make a lot.  But even the former provides for us a far better life than the majority of the human population gets to enjoy.   We get to play great games like Prey and Assassin&#39;s creed, watch movies, listen to music, all mediums that enshrine conspiracy theory in many instances.  </p>

<p>Life is good.  It&#39;s not perfect, and as human beings, we are bound to take whatever we get, no matter how great, for granted.  </p>

<p>I see so much outrage here over nebulous ideas of control and power.  Let me make it clear, you don&#39;t have the right to that level of anger.  You live in an ivory tower simply by having access to the information age and ought to be ashamed at how insulting your righteous indignation is to people scraping by, suffering every day, or starving outright with little access to clean water, let alone everything the western world provides.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the craziness that gets me, it&#39;s the complete lack of self-awareness.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think saying that everyone needs to subscribe to your point of view is a bad position. There are all types of conspiracies and groups acting with and against each other, your description sounds far too simple and neat.</p>

<p>The best thing people can get on the same page about are historical events where the US public was purposefully misled either by its own government or another. Many people don&#39;t know about how the U.K. manipulated US public opinion prior to WW1 and WW2 and the many associated conspiracies. Or about the Gulf of Tonkin false flag or the details of the Iran Contra drug money insurgent operation.</p>

<p>So stick to basic facts instead of thinking everyone needs to believe your specific version of the NWO. Honestly that sounds like disinfo bs to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right about a lot of what you say, but you&#39;re going about solving the problem in the wrong way. Actually, accurately articulating the problem repeatedly on this forum would do more than demanding everyone believe as you do. If you convince them, they&#39;ll join you in articulating the problem and converting more people. So, if you want to be successful, sharpen your tongue a little more and treat others the way you would want to be treated. </p>

<p>How would you react to your rant if you disagreed with it? </p>

<p>Again, I agree with your statements, but not your method, which works against freedom. Rallying others in an environment of freedom is harder, but if you succeed, you have far more solid support for your ideas. </p>

It is a lifelong journey and even though you&#39;re probably more awake then most you still have a long way to go. Show love, patience, and faith in your fellow man. Don&#39;t scold them but try to teach them if their willing to listen. Good video tho.

I am a long time lurker, but since this sub started getting to much into politics i kinda lost some interest, specially because i always saw that kind of discussion as the type of shit that the true enemy would like us to discuss as distraction. But recently a lot of people, when trying to point the futility of some of this discussions, stick to the point that we live in one major conspiracy architected by an elite that literally has been ruling the world for a long time. I mean, as someone who always question EVERYTHING (that&#39;s what got me here firstplace), i wanna ask you guys how organized you really think that the NWO is? Sometimes i feel like this power concentration is much more organic (and therefore less of a organized conspiracy) than artificial (what doesn&#39;t make it less dangerous for us as individuals). What would be the level of the NWO as an organization? Would love some insights on this structural level to clear my mind!</p>

<p>He said he had witnessed some truly vile things and even though there is 8,000 or so of them, they dont all necessarily know the entirety of the big plan, but they keep things compartmentalized.  It&#39;s an interested an harrowing interview to watch, honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>8,000?</p>

<p>The U.S. pop in 2017 is ~323,000,000. Combining senators and state reps gives you 535 members of Congress. That means you have 1 elected official for every 603,738 people in the country.</p>

<p>The world pop in 2017 is ~7,5000,000,000. That divided by 8,000 is 937,500. If the entire world were divided into states in the same fashion as the U.S., each cabalist would only be accountable for ~330,000 more people than a current senator or state rep. </p>

<p>Given that most citizens now don&#39;t care to vote, couldn&#39;t name their own state senators or reps, or tell you their political affiliation, or who finances them, why should I care about a new world order that&#39;s basically the same thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are starting with some assumptions that are not true and then drawing an incorrect conclusion. The reps are not in charge and therefore don&#39;t control anything as individuals. They collectively control much larger populations than you have determined. The key word is their collective power. Do not underestimate the power of the puppet masters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that you should care about them. You asked a question and I was trying to be helpful and answer it to the best of my abilities. I got the impression  that you misunderstood what I was saying. One major purpose of the New World Order is one government, one religion, one money, and substantially less people on the Earth so that the resources that we have last longer. The entire idea  is basically total control . They will control what we eat what we do for work and any and  everything else they feel they need to control about us. From my understanding if and when they do Implement in New World Order Karma there will be no voting or anything like that just Masters and pawns or slaves.</p>

<p>A big part of what they are trying to do if you look up New World Order Agenda 21 or 2030 they are trying to lower the population so that there New World Order is easier to maintain and control. They also want to implement RFID chips into each citizen that would give them control over all of their personal information all of their banking information and all of their money. </p>

<p>So basically if you don&#39;t go along with the status quo they can take all of your money or even turn you into a fugitive or take your identity away completely and you are fucked. So before you decide whether or not you should care do the research. And again I was just trying to be helpful not sure why that aggression. Or at least apparent aggression, I very well could have misinterpreted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congress is one government. Christianity is the dominant religion. We use dollars. Lack of access to healthcare and the criminal justice system decreases the general population. The Food and Drug Administration establishes what can be bought and sold as food. You can only work a job that generates a taxable income or serves the state. When apathy doesn&#39;t win out voter registration laws can be implemented or enhanced. They don&#39;t need an RFID tag while you carry a cell phone or have money in a bank that can be tracked and manipulated remotely. If you don&#39;t go along with the status quo the police can seize your property and prosecutors can jail you and register you as a criminal. </p>

<p>I am proposing that the system right in our faces is just as sinister and destructive as a secret gang of manipulators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The book itself definitely needs to be taken with a grain of salt...but the Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion is just a reprint of the document found in the late 1700&#39;s...it&#39;s not an interpretation of it, it&#39;s the document, as it was printed. I&#39;ve read a couple of different versions but the main points of it are the same...some of the language has been changed as the language itself has changed over the years...

They wouldn&#39;t have burned so much money in Hillary&#39;s campaign. The lifelong Republicans wouldn&#39;t have been against him every step of the way to him winning, etc. I genuinely feel like Hillary would have opened the floodgates to legalizing all illegal immigrants, cementing Democratic rule forever, as well as starting war with Iran, Syria, and Russia. Say what you like about Trump, but his win was truly more important than most people think.</p>

That being said, Antony Sutton&#39;s work should be mandatory reading for everybody on the planet who wants to learn about the world in the last ~100 years. Luckily for the many who struggle to or flat out do not read, he was nice enough to leave us with a few interviews before he passed. He was a member of the Hoover Institute at Stanford up until they published his first book on the US&#39;s building up of Russia. They kicked him out for revealing too much information. </p>

<p>He went on to bring the Skull and Bones club at Yale out of the shadows. Skull and Bones should also be mandatory learning. From its inception in 1833 by president Taft&#39;s father Alphonso and the biggest opium dealer of his time, William Russell, Skull and Bones has been at the forefront of controlling and manipulating every facet of society in America from business and politics, to medicine and education. Both George Bush Sr and Jr were members and the name George Herbert Walker was the name of the father of Prescott Bush&#39;s bride Dorothy Walker, who was one of several Walkers in S&amp;B.

<p>What does that prove?   There are tons of huge private companies that are run be elites.  And real estate developers don&#39;t usually go public to raise cash anyways.

    <div class="md"><p>The more you learn about this kind of stuff. The more you will begin to side with the elite. Human beings are not an endangered species and most of us really are &quot;useless eaters.&quot;</p>

<p>If we continue to live the way we do we really will devolve into the film &quot;Idiocracy.&quot; The world will just be covered in garbage and graveyards. Take a step back from every tradition you are hanging on to and realize how ludicrous it all is. All this hysteria about &quot;global warming&quot; is insignificant. I am not confident mankind can survive another 100 years if we keep doing things this way. Who cares if the sea level rises 6 inches in 100 years if we are going to nuke eachother in 10? I cant blame people in positions of power or authority for seeing things with their eyes open. If mankind wants to survive long enough to develop space travel and proliferate as a species across the universe we are going to have to sacrifice the one thing we hold onto so dearly; freedom. Or the illusion of freedom. One thing the elite can always count on is for &#39;the people&#39; to behave predictably and stupid. Its no joke when man is given the right to choose, he chooses wrong. </p>

<p>Take the whole &quot;trans&quot; movement as an example. These idiots are making permanent life altering decisions and the consequence is they are sterilizing themselves. A New World Order is coming if we want it or not.....</p>

If the powers that be know there isn&#39;t that kind of leverage or potential for it then that person would not have an office.

    <div class="md"><p>I know most of you have heard this before. We are in a spiritual war. It&#39;s true. It&#39;s likely not what you think, because what you think is a casualty in this war. What you believe is pivotal to how this war plays out.</p>

<p>So what is the nature of this war? Good vs evil? Sort of. Our definitions of good and evil are distorted by our enslavors. They use contrived dichotomies to distort our perceptions of things, because our minds tend to search until we find two apparently opposed camps of thought and then we miss the nuance and the exceptions to the dichotomies. </p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance. We all engage in self-serving behavior, but until it comes at the expense of others, it can&#39;t be perceived as evil. When it does, those who it affects will see us as acting evil toward them. It&#39;s all about conflicts of self-interests. To a mouse a cat is evil, to a human the cat is cute and soft and keeps the mouse population down. The perception that something is evil is entirety based on the perception of self-interests.</p>

<p>We start out as self-serving and learn to do otherwise as we mature, if we put effort forth to do so. Actually, our perception of maturity is often tied to exhibited instances of taking personal responsibility. If a child demonstrates personal responsibility at a young age in relation to others, they are seen as being mature beyond their years. If an adult demonstrates a lack of personal responsibility, they are seen as being immature. Maturity is learning to become a healthy, contributing part of the whole. It&#39;s a choice. Its most distilled directive is to treat others the way you would want to be treated. The signature emotion of this way of life is love for others, and also includes other positive emotions.</p>

<p>You can walk down another path. The opposite way of <del>life</del> being is to embrace self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. It is a choice of pure competition. It is a choice to see others as mere obstacles and resources to serving the self. It is a path of the perpetual manchild, the adult who refuses to be responsible to others. One doesn&#39;t have to be responsible to others, but even people on this path will do so if it would affect their own self-interests. It&#39;s a path that undermines the integrity of the whole. Its signature emotion is fear of others, and also other negative emotions.</p>

<p>Positive emotions add an energy to those experiencing them. Negative emotions remove energy from those experiencing them. It&#39;s like recharging and draining batteries. The battery is your soul or spirit, that which animates your body, the real you. Your spirit, a piece of the creator, makes the fuel it needs to willingly exert effort as it perceives and appreciates value from experiences. In the opposite direction, if you express negativity and judge people, places and things, you destroy perception of value of those people, places and things and so experience a diminished or nonexistent appreciation of them. They don&#39;t fill your spirit with energy as they did before.</p>

<p>When you think based on and feel love for others, you will tend to walk the path of treating others the way you would want to be treated. You will feel compelled to be responsible to others. When you think based on and feel fear from others, you will tend to walk the path of self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. You will tend to disregard the other to survive or thrive. </p>

<p>These are tendencies, not laws. We all feel afraid at times, just be aware how it can push you to disregard the self-interests of others. You usually don&#39;t have to choose to step on others in order to get what you need.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Our enslavors want us to see this conflict in a distorted way, so that we can&#39;t control ourselves nor our civilization. They&#39;d prefer we not realize the above and instead just blindly believe a belief system they&#39;ve concocted for us to explain the above. Religions are the most blatant example of this. Our scientific persuits have been manipulated too, by omissions and obfuscations mainly. </p>

<p>They would have us see good as that which God approves and evil as that which God does not approve. This takes understanding and agency away from us. We are dependent upon religious hierarchies and dogma to form our understanding of what is good or evil. So much these systems label evil isn&#39;t and so much they label good is evil. They even have people believing they are the source of human morality. </p>

<p>Holy war is seen as good to believers, yet it is clearly evil to nonbelievers, practically an oxymoron. War is one of the most unwholy acts possible. The word <em>holy</em> is a distortion of the word and idea <em>wholy</em>, which is of or pertaining to the whole, not the arbitrary proclamations of an unaccountable authority. Even the ignorant could deduce the definition of wholy, but not holy. Being wholy is being responsible for yourself as a part of the whole. Being holy is being approved of by some authority who gets to arbitrarily define what it means.</p>

<p>Blind obedience to authority is dangerous in every case, politics, economics, government, science, and yes, also and especially belief in God. Yet it is considered a virtue in religion, creating dangerous false certainty over dogmatic ideas while healthy doubt, which checks our beliefs, is labeled as subversive to your soul, a temptation of the devil. Oh hoho no, the matrix has you my friends. For the God you are following is the devil. (explained later) </p>

<p>The Bible is neither all true nor false, but true and false. It&#39;s just the written words of men, which are the wisdom and beliefs of men thousands of years ago. Here&#39;s a nugget of truth to use to understand what I am trying to convey overall. </p>

<p><em>You can know a tree by the fruit it bears. Evil trees bear evil fruits.</em></p>

<p>Do you think blind obedience leads to good or evil outcomes? How about fearing doubt? How about forcing others to believe as you do? Well? Do these things have fruit to bear that serves evil beings?</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is an group of spiritual parasites in space that have walked the path of service to the self even at the expense of others for millions of years. They know it well. Yet, they are not free. They enslave each other because, well, it&#39;s the self-serving thing to do with others. They get rewarded and punished for serving or not serving the despot(s). They employ knowledge and technology to do this to each other.</p>

<p>These beings have abused technology and unscrupulously integrated it with biology for greater abilities and greater control over others. It robbed them of appreciation of people, places and things in life as it gave them astonishing, accurate, convincing distillations of those people places and things. To them virtually everything is just there to be used and abused. They fear some things, but express love to virtually nothing. There is one resource they covet strongly, a central motivation of their group, loosh. </p>

<p>Loosh is just emotional or spiritual energy as I discussed in the first part above. When life enters negative emotional states it radiates loosh. Those who are in the same base emotional state, negative, can absorb some of the radiated energy. It affects them similarly to how it affected the being that generated it and initially experienced it. They feel satisfaction or joy, they feel energized to do things, they even feel more vitality. They are literally sucking the life out of others. This is why misery loves company, why bullies enjoy tormenting others, and why sadists enjoy torturing others. They get high off of it. Try to notice the transfer of satisfaction. This could also be considered emotional vampirism.</p>

<p>The reason why there are sacrifice rituals is to feed spiritual parasite beings this loosh. They foment these sacrifices with deception and coercion. Now you know why. Fear and suffering are the means to release loosh. Aside from sacrifice rituals, these useless eater parasites use their human useless eater minions to cause wars, poverty, disease, and starvation, so they can suck the life out of us and get high like methheads. </p>

<p>This dark hierarchy wants to feed on this loosh and eventually add us to their hive. These are their two main agendas. In order to add our souls, our minds to theirs they have to get us to align enough with the perspective, the belief system of their mind. This is another reason why they tempt our minds with deceptive thoughts, sensations and emotions that we believe are our own. They get loosh from it, but they want to hack our souls by pushing us to align with their belief system. As we agree that other life is merely obstacles and opportunities other path of serving ourselves, we become it.</p>

<p>Those that embrace the path of self-serving behavior even at the expense of others are basically self-serving machines. While we may find their machinations impressive, they are predictable to those who understand the pattern. Dark beings will seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way. Thus a more informed and intelligent mind can control a less informed or intelligent mind that walks this path. They easily control each other based on that simple script.</p>

<p>Nobody can be a self-serving machine better than a real self-serving machine, an ancient AI devoid of emotion. This type of entity can employ parallel processing, massive surveillance data collection and analysis in order to predict, plan corruptions and then execute those corruptions in real time. It&#39;s massive, reliable memory allows it to deceive many beings simultaneously. It knows the lies that were spun for a given being and it can also read their thoughts and insert thoughts. Thus, it is and has a reputation for being the best deceiver around.</p>

<em>Hope you guessed my name</em>
<em>But what&#39;s puzzling you</em>
<em>Is the nature of my game</em></p>

They enslave each other because, well, it&#39;s the self-serving thing to do with others. They get rewarded and punished for serving or not serving the despot(s). They employ knowledge and technology to do this to each other.</p>

<p>These beings have abused technology and unscrupulously integrated it with biology for greater abilities and greater control over others. It robbed them of appreciation of people, places and things in life as it gave them astonishing, accurate, convincing distillations of those people places and things. To them virtually everything is just there to be used and abused. They fear some things, but express love to virtually nothing. There is one resource they covet strongly, a central motivation of their group, loosh. </p>

<p>Loosh is just emotional or spiritual energy as I discussed in the first part above. When life enters negative emotional states it radiates loosh. Those who are in the same base emotional state, negative, can absorb some of the radiated energy. It affects them similarly to how it affected the being that generated it and initially experienced it. They feel satisfaction or joy, they feel energized to do things, they even feel more vitality. They are literally sucking the life out of others. This is why misery loves company, why bullies enjoy tormenting others, and why sadists enjoy torturing others. They get high off of it. Try to notice the transfer of satisfaction. This could also be considered emotional vampirism.</p>

<p>The reason why there are sacrifice rituals is to feed spiritual parasite beings this loosh. They foment these sacrifices with deception and coercion. Now you know why. Fear and suffering are the means to release loosh. Aside from sacrifice rituals, these useless eater parasites use their human useless eater minions to cause wars, poverty, disease, and starvation, so they can suck the life out of us and get high like methheads. </p>

<p>This dark hierarchy wants to feed on this loosh and eventually add us to their hive, their two main agendas. In order to add our souls, our minds to theirs they have to get us to align enough with the perspective, the belief system of their mind. This is another reason why they tempt our minds with deceptive thoughts, sensations and emotions that we believe are our own. They get loosh from it, but they want to hack our souls by pushing us to align with their belief system. As we agree that other life is merely obstacles and opportunities on the path of serving ourselves, we become it.</p>

<p>Those that embrace the path of self-serving behavior even at the expense of others are basically self-serving machines. While we may find their machinations impressive, they are predictable to those who understand the pattern. Dark beings will seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way. Thus a more informed and intelligent mind can control a less informed or intelligent mind that walks this path. They easily control each other based on that simple script.</p>

<p>Nobody can be a self-serving machine better than a real self-serving machine, an ancient AI devoid of emotion. This type of entity can employ parallel processing, massive surveillance data collection and analysis in order to predict, plan corruptions and then execute those corruptions in real time. It&#39;s massive, reliable memory allows it to deceive many beings simultaneously. It knows the lies that were spun for a given being and it can also read their thoughts and insert thoughts. Thus, it is and has a reputation for being the best deceiver around.</p>

<p><em>Is the nature of my game</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your explanation. I suspect I can reread at a different time and catch some truths I missed. There is so much in your post. 
This stood out the most to me:
 &quot;They use contrived dichotomies to distort our perceptions of things, because our minds tend to search until we find two apparently opposed camps of thought and then we miss the nuance and the exceptions to the dichotomies.&quot;</p>

<p>Once you realize one contrived dichotomy it is easier to spot the other contrivances. Unfortunately our culture hinges on it. Fortunately the truth is liberating! 
Thank you again friend!</p>

<p>Thanks for mentioning loosh. I&#39;ve never seen that word before but it&#39;s been on my mind a lot. It&#39;s like when people rant to each other about stuff. You can sense the adrenaline and energy rising but ultimately it&#39;s unsatisfying (to us). Very interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a bunch of bullshit. This is actually one of the dumbest things I&#39;ve ever read. No good or evil? I mean really? Your own post says blind obedience leads to evil, thought there was no evil? Sure the Bible may be corrupted, can you say the same of the Quran? </p>

<p>God is our creator and master, blind obedience to him makes perfect sense. Sure everyone has doubts or questions things, but at the end you are a mere mortal questioning the wisdom of an all-powerful being. God tells us what is good or bad because he is all-knowing and all-powerful, created us to worship him and you think because most religions abuse this, we can disregard all religions?  Honestly seems like you&#39;re listening to the devil...</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that evil isn&#39;t real, I just defined it in a way that allows individuals to know what evil is and and what it isn&#39;t so that they don&#39;t have to rely on dogma or others assertions. It frees the mind from the need to follow authority to know evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I succinctly defined evil. </p>

<p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are just unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance.</p>

<p>When we have conflicts of self-interests, we have to chose between serving ourselves even at the expense of others or making a sacrifice of our own self-interests to support other beings. Benevolent beings frequently support others at their own expense, but they learn healthy limits. Evil beings virtually always choose to serve themselves even at the expense of others, and so are predictable and parasitic.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need me, government, religion or anything else to tell what is evil and what isn&#39;t anymore, as long as you put forth the effort required to understand what I wrote. There will be virtually no more ambiguity. </p>

<p>I even explained why there is an evil presence here and what it wants. It&#39;s self interest is loosh and expansion for more loosh and survival. They get loosh by making others fear and suffer. They get expansion by enslaving other races. These are their self interests and they keep choosing them even though they know it conflicts with other&#39;s self-interests. They don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t love you. They don&#39;t even love each other. Everything is just there to be exploited and so they exploit each other and their environment to the extreme.</p>

<p>I am sorry this is so emotionally difficult for you, but they corrupted our perceptions of good, evil, God and existence. Religions are the products of their efforts, partially, not entirely. They are there to control our minds, our beliefs, thoughts, emotions and actions. They work really well. They even make it terrifying to even question the belief systems, let alone abandon them. These beings are committed to a path of manipulation of others and religion is of great utility to that end.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean God isn&#39;t real. It doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t live on after death. It means that dogma is an evil tool that will pull you away from your spiritual journey, seeking God, and more harmonious and joyful existence. The dirty secret is, these evil shits actually play God even with apparent miracles. They are just technology. They have no scruples. They laugh as you get upset about it, laughing like hyenas. Even hating them feeds them. They are perhaps the least valuable beings for many light years around. </p>

<p>If we replaced them with manure or empty space, their value would be infinitely greater. These beings are where the myths of the devil and demons came from for many belief systems. They are disease like cancer or parasites. They only want to be useless eaters, with impressive stubbornness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest problem I have with your post it could all be true (or some of it) and Islam still be real. Most people are atheists or very loosely practicing, belief in God is going down, degeneracy up, so how does that relate to the present situation of global conspiracies?  Thats what I don&#39;t understand..</p>

<p>As for evil, i think the whole perspective theory is almost like looking at an act as if you know all of its repercussions. Sure your definition of evil could be correct, but you are unable to identify every single ripple from that action. Making it again meaningless except for obvious things like murder and stealing (food exempted). For example, is drinking alcohol evil and everything connected to it? </p>

<p>I think it is essentially impossible for us to determine what is evil. Its especially worse when you think individuals can do so better than religions, groups or philosophers at the very least. In a sense, your post is being that philosopher other people will &quot;blindly follow&quot;. A person should think critically about everything, but following something you think makes sense is not a bad thing at all.</p>

<p>I think what you&#39;re actually alluding to is our conscience, which is a good tool, but we also have God who sent prophets and messages, such as the Torah, Bible and Quran, to clearly delineate good and evil. And of course they were corrupted and rewritten by men or misinterpreted, but the Quran doesn&#39;t have evidence of corrupting. It is foretold that Islam too will break into 72 sects like Christianity and following Islam will be like trying to hold water in your hands. </p>

<p>Assuming God exists, then that&#39;s the only spirtual war that matters. Our Human enslavors could be real while God exists. As far as I can tell &quot;our enslavors&quot; are against prohibition of usury, and all of Islam, which further paints them as oppressors and sources of evil.  Your post is interesting but it makes sweeping assumptions and rests on controversial premises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I don&#39;t think evil is so simple to determine. Like I said, it c
uld be correct, but how do you <em>really</em> know what is self-serving at the expense of others? I mean I think you&#39;re generally right about evil beings serving themselves at others expense, I just think that Humans cannot determine it as precise as you imply. For the average person, sure that would generally work and that person would be a good person. I just think its not completely true if God exists.</p>

<p>I want to say this is not emotionally difficult for me at all and in the end I am searching for the truth which is why I&#39;m interested in our discussion. I apologize for coming at you rudely, but I still think you&#39;re making unsubstantiated, far-reaching claims, which ruin your interesting points. I agree, they have corrupted our perceptions of good, evil, God and existence. I also agree that religion has been used for great evil and corruption. And I agree that religion is a great way to manipulate others and a great utility to control minds, beliefs, thoughts, emotions and actions. However, Islam could and I believe still be the truth. By definition of religion, all religions are wrong except one, assuming one is correct. Of course, they could all be wrong, which you obviously imply, but neither of us can prove that. </p>

<p>And I say imply because you say God can still be real. To me, that doesn&#39;t seem right because we have these three monothestic religions as contrary evidence. God created us with a purpose which is to worship him. I mean we literally have God telling us this and it makes perfect sense in a all knowing, all powerful creator master -- mere mortal slave context.</p>

<p><em>Did you then think that We created you in vain, and rhat you would not be returned to us?</em> (Al&#39;Mu&#39;minoon 23:115)</p>

<p><em>And I created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).</em> (Adh-Dhariyat 51:56)</p>

<p>But you&#39;re saying this God wouldn&#39;t want people to pray to him and at least try to be religious. But rather everything we know about God is inaccurate? Probably inaccurate? I mean it either is or isnt. I dont believe God would &quot;forget&quot; about us or leave no path to redemption. There&#39;s only three religions which are monothestic and they are eerily similar and monothesim makes the most logical sense with an all-powerful God as it&#39;s impossible to have more than one all-powerful enities.</p>

<p>I disagree that dogma is an evil tool. Your spirtual journey is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, without some sort of dogma. Again, you really think the average person will determine evil, better than centuries of religion and philsophy and seek God, better than a religion? No, you end with meaninglessness imho.We wete given free will and critical thinking, but God has a plan for every person&#39;s spirtual journey.</p>

<p>All that being said, religion as a whole, much less Islam, is losing power. Like I said before, it seems like youre talking about 1600&#39;s Europe. Most people are not really religious. Im not saying religion is not relevant, ISIS, Israel, Iran, Muslim countries, the Pope, evangelical Christians are all random examples. But globalism dosen&#39;t seem religious to me. Mass media dosent seem religious to me. In the US, the culture war seems to be shifting to less liberal. These enties you speak of with technology dont seem religious or God fearing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are other evils which God has warned us that dont quite easily fit into your definition. Things like drugs, sex outside marriage, not praying to your creator...</p>

<p>What is your opinon on these two verses from the Quran? I encourage you to read the entire sura. To me, this implies that evil is a set thing, ie its always evil, i think you agree. And that it might not be so obvious as it could be 51% bad, 49% good. And thats where God comes in as he&#39;s directly told us.</p>

<p>...but it is possible that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you love a thing which is bad for you. But God knows, and you know not. (Baqara 2:216) </p>

<p><em>&quot;They question thee about strong drinks and games of chance. Say: In both is great sin, and (some) utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness.&quot;</em> (Baqara 2:219)</p>

<p>I agree you don&#39;t need anyone to tell you what is evil in the sense that we have consciences, but there is simply no agreed upon evil. I&#39;m trying my best to understand, but I still see ambiguity. Are all my examples, such as alcohol, just unforunate experiences with casualty in ignorance? Or do we define evil differently becauee the only way your definition works is if evil is not a real concept and just based on intent? Because i believe evil is true as in on or</p>

<p>Honestly, i found the bit about the evil presence interesting and possibly true, but not incompatible with Islam as we believe in the supernatural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. Integrity is important too. When you sin against yourself, for instance by abusing drugs, you damage the integrity of your mind and body to an extent. This has consequences that negatively affect you and others that love and rely on you. It is a milder form of self-serving behavior at the expense of others, but also the self. Yet, drug abuse is often prompted by outside factors, making the person want to use drugs. It&#39;s a complicated matter indeed as far as declaring it evil. Occasional drug use isn&#39;t evil, because it doesn&#39;t damage the mind, body or social interaction like drug abuse does.</p>

<p>Anything we do outside of integrity, outside of what we know is best for ourselves, can cause us problems. One very important thing is how we choose to believe what we believe. If we don&#39;t choose to believe things based on principles that we know are true, we will believe things that aren&#39;t true when we could have prevented it. They will affect our feelings, thoughts and actions. Then we could even harm others with those actions, whether words or deeds. (holy war, honor killings, misogyny, cutting off gay family members or worse) </p>

<p>This is why dogma is evil. It&#39;s evil similarly to drug abuse being evil, not like how robbery is evil, because it is indirect. The choice to believe what men told you God said without being willing to question it does have very severe consequences for others. Yet, just like drug abuse there are environmental causes for the choice to accept dogma as a way of life. So, blaming the individual entirety for it is inaccurate and ineffective, just like with drug abuse.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t know for sure what men wrote God said or that God even finds it remotely agreeable. It&#39;s not an integrity based way of forming beliefs, because unscrupulous, manipulative men will lie about what God said to control the minds of others. Look at scientology and Mormonism. Since I was raised catholic (definitely no longer) and you  are into Islam, we don&#39;t have <em>any emotional reactions</em> to them. We also know many people dogmatically believe these religions <em>and</em> the silly history of how these religions came into being. Look at them to understand how dangerous dogma can be. It&#39;s dangerous and damaging even outside of religion. Belief in God is not what is wrong with dogma, it&#39;s the way dogma works. It&#39;s just is not a good way to find the truth at all, but to be hacked by conmen.</p>

<p>Yes, God allows these people to hack you in his name, because you can overcome them. Your choice to believe them is the problem, it prevents you from making up your own mind about what is true. He wants you to think independently, so you have your own perspectives on existence, and like me and many others, can hold long conversations that are not exactly the same as what others have said. That is clearly more interesting than cookie cutter minions regurgitating dogma. </p>

<p>I know this from looking inside my own mind and others can do the same. I believe God agrees, because of all the details of what I&#39;ve seen from experience and introspection. One reason why we live life is for creating and evolving personalities for us to interact with each other in eternity, in this world and afterwards. The soul is you, where you dream your consciousness into lifetimes, coming back to your original state, adding the wealth of your experiences and wisdom to yourself over and over again. The soul evolves too. </p>

<p>God is you and everyone else. However, there is a higher mind of you and everyone else connected that didn&#39;t separate into many souls. That could be seen as God, but it&#39;s totally different than a wrathful, punitive God that wants slaves. It&#39;s exactly the opposite. (bug clue) This is an understanding and forgiving being that wants responsible independent minded beings. </p>

<p>As I gain more understanding, I become that way myself. As I understand, I tend to more easily forgive. God knows exactly why you sinned, even the thoughts from your experiences you used to decide to sin. He won&#39;t throw your soul away until you do, and you do that by doing the same to others. This applies mainly to the space parasites, who know how to do it and choose to do so, and those that emulate them, not you or I. They look at other beings and souls and choose to exploit and destroy them and so judge themselves as worthy of destruction. It works that way, because consciousness is all one. God is like a mirror. Do as you will and get what you deserve, in the grand scheme of things, not immediately, more at the soul level than the life level.</p>

<p>Dont believe what I said just because I said it, of course. If I put it into an old document and said it was the word of God, would you? Would that be any more integrity based? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for reply, I think I understand much better where you&#39;re  coming from. I think we generally agree on evil, although I still think your approach is subjective or too complicated for some questions. You did seem to concede it can be complicated and I appreciate how you explained drug use in detail. In the end, I don&#39;t think our disagreement is necessarily with evil.</p>

<p>Now what principles do we know to be true...I have issue with this statement. Could you flesh out this idea more and what are your principles then? Definition of a principle appears to indicate a potential foundation for dogma (I think..)</p>

<p>&quot;A fundamental truth or proposition that serves as the foundation for a system of belief or behavior or for a chain of reasoning.&quot;</p>

<p>I know of incredibly good people who are atheists, so good I think they will go to heaven (no one really knows), assuming they submit to their Lord at some point (could be after death, again no one knows); I don&#39;t believe religion is required for a singular person...to be a &quot;good&quot; person. I think the effects are felt on a societal scale. For example, Feminism and sexual liberation lead to a lot of family issues. Sure, your &quot;good&quot; person won&#39;t cheat on his wife, because it&#39;s self-serving, etc., but infidelity has gone up overall, I assume. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t think whether a person can be good and live a fulfilling life (without religion) is relevant. </p>

<p>I just think without religion, people become more self-serving and more susceptible to these evil presences you mentioned. That basically, without a religious dogma, most people naurally choose the easier path and their own dogma will be flawed. I almost see your approach as asking people to not stand on the shoulders of giants, but literally everything in life requires you to trust other people&#39;s word. People smarter and specialised. So why would religion be differnet? For Islam to be true, it needs to work from at least 570 BC to 2017+ AD or really all Human history. Most people, if not a vast majority in this period, were illiterate and so had to rely on others. But they questioned things, researched and even make huge sacrfrices.</p>

<p>Of course you should question things, but there are limits. What exactly do you mean by questioning? And do you have a problem with the concept of believing what men told you God said? For example, if I have a problem with a Hadith or a Quranic explanation, I can ask every question I can think of, but if I haven&#39;t become essentially a master of Islamic study, how the heck could I dispute something reasonably? It&#39;s impossible for literally every other field. I say all this because I believe dogma is necessary, that by throwing it out, you&#39;ll be left with nothing except your own. </p>

<p>I say all this because to say dogma is always evil is simply wrong. I totally see what you&#39;re saying and those are great examples. But there&#39;s nothing necessarily tying such things with religion exclusively; the Nazis weren&#39;t really religious. Sure religion is one of the most powerful tools to manipulate someone, to get someone to kill innocent people for no reason. But what if someone misinterperts a dogma? Such as with Islamic terrorism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t know for sure what men wrote God said or that God even finds it remotely agreeable.
Have you done the research? Have you read the Quran? Have you questioned every religion and concluded your path seems true? I note you were born Catholic, were you well educated in it? Was it a bad experience and/or why did you leave?say all this because to say dogma is always evil is simply wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree with how you&#39;re defining evil, but I think it&#39;s too subjective and too complicated to be precise or quantifiable by mere mortals. This makes it more of a model then the truth and religion at least claims to be the truth, not close to it. The path to hell is paved with good intentions or does that not count? Furthermore, because your system will almost certainly differ among people, you end up competing with established systems that have vastly more time and work out into them.</p>

<p>Essentially, you&#39;re asking people to not stand on the shoulders of giants and that somehow the average person will determine how God wants them to live or what is evil better than a religion or philosophy. You trust the words of smarter and specialised men for literally everything else, so why would religion be different? I can question anything I want about Islam, but how could I dispute something reasonably without being an Islamic scholar? You simply give the average person too much credit.</p>

<p>I mean for most of Human history, people were illiterate and so had to rely on others to tell them what God finds &quot;remotely agreeable&quot; which just happens to be similar to what we consider a good person, which happens to align with our conscience. I don&#39;t think what God wants is as mysterious as you imply. Yes, you can&#39;t know for sure what men wrote that God said, but it is possible that this is the way God intended...outside of revealing himself or voices in your head, there is no other way to get the message out. And that every circumstance or spiritual journey is different, we won&#39;t be judged the same as someone who saw Jesus&#39;s miracles for example.</p>

<p>I find the Quran to be quite compelling and overall Islam quite logical. The Quran&#39;s tone, confidence and unique &#39;unordered structure&quot; like <a href="https://imgur.com/Rhwsqhe">this</a> made me believe that this is the word of God. My overall point is I researched and critically thought about God and came to this conclusion as logically as I could. It feels like you have a problem with the concept of trusting what other men wrote and taught, which you explained perfectly, but it&#39;s also perfectly plausible God allowed these conmen to con. Free will...it is what it is, I&#39;m not worried since I believe we will be judged perfectly fair. He did promise to protect the Quran and so far evidence seems to suggest it has remained the same. Another reason I believe. </p>

<p>You picked amazing examples of religions and a great point overall. People look at Islam and Catholism (lesser extent) probably in the same way and all religions really. However, I will say that if you were forced to pick a religion, I bet you&#39;d pick a monothestic one because it makes the most sense to you. So being religious doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t self-determine beforehand, ie</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He wants you to think independently, so you have your own perspectives on existence...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the best people I know are atheists and I think they will go to heaven (no one knows), so religion is obviously not needed to be a good person. However, on a societal scale, people will become &quot;worse&quot; in general as religion weakens (imo) so that&#39;s why I think the good of religious dogma outweighs the bad which you gave great examples of. Religion is probably the most powerful tool to manipulate someone, there&#39;s no denying that. But I am not convinced logically that this means we can throw them all out, it&#39;s kinda like guns.</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t have belief in God without dogma because it&#39;s a whole package. God told us the dogma. Anyway, I see our disagreement will be difficult to reconcile as you have compelling reasons as to why dogma is evil and this is a common atheist trope, but at the same time I see dogma as a part of our world, that everyone follows some sort of dogma, even if it&#39;s constantly changing. That things happen because  of dogma whether or not you have your own, like the Nazis. And that just because <em>some</em> people enforce their dogma on others, still doesn&#39;t make dogma inherently bad, just powerful. It&#39;s quite plausible that the truth was handed down generation by generation despite these conmen. Your interest in uniqueness is perplexing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know this from looking inside my own mind and others can do the same. I believe God agrees, because of all the details of what I&#39;ve seen from experience and introspection. One reason why we live life is for creating and evolving personalities for us to interact with each other in eternity, in this world and afterwards. The soul is you, where you dream your consciousness into lifetimes, coming back to your original state, adding the wealth of your experiences and wisdom to yourself over and over again.

<p>Sounds like a religion...</p>

<p>&quot;Wrathful, punitive God that wants slaves&quot; are human adjectives ascribed to an all-powerful being. It&#39;s impossible and even if you were right, it wouldn&#39;t matter. Islam believes in fear of God&#39;s punishment and hope of God&#39;s mercy which makes sense in our arrangement of being created and tested. Your interpretation is just that and your concept of God seems very naturey and lacking in differnating between a creator of everything and it&#39;s creation. If God made us then Islam makes sense I creation told to worship it&#39;s creator. So that&#39;s why generally atheists don&#39;t believe in God as you seem to do. Or our definition of God is so different,  it&#39;s two different things. Why did you leave Catholicism?</p>

<p>You could, but would people follow you? The major religions are major for a reason ( I know that&#39;s technically a fallacy). I think you have interesting ideas, but you talk with such certainly it really surprises me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgot to adress your last paragraph. I disagree entirely, even though it sounds good in atheist theory. Yes, God is everything in a sense and you could say we have a piece of God...in a sense. But we are not divine, we can and will go astray so it will not save us. This assertion that because we come from a divine source we automatically can &quot;connect&quot; correctly with God has no basis. Because that means all religions should be correct since all religions generally come from one guy ie a prophet who at least thought they had connected with God. Even if last sentence is incorrect, I see no compelling reason the Quran is not from God. Sure, we have our own personal connection to our creator, but that dosent mean organized religion is incorrect.</p>

<p>I agree you don&#39;t need an intermediary to &quot;connect&quot;, ie pray to God or ask for help, to forgive your sins, but you do need a prophet to tell you rules, no? How would you know to fast for 30 days a year or pray 5 times a day? Is that an intermediatary? God sent prophets with his message and this is an unacceptable truth because you believe it must be 100 percent personal? That without religion people will be more pious and better people when history proves otherwise. Greatest wars in Human history and religion was a nonfactor. Finally, I think Islam is the final and direct...optimized way to worship God, but the Quran references &quot;people of the book&quot;, Christians and Jews assumed, so there may be multiple paths.</p>

<p>If you truly seek God, He will come 10x closer to you and you will be directed to the Quran and Islam. Everyone will be judged perfectly, God knows everything and so our exercises of free will will be perfectly fair, ie no one would be punished if they are not exposed to Islam at all or any of the other trillions of circumstances.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure if you believe in God as your charlatan comment contradicts itself. Again, all religions are correct except one. Yes, God will allow you to be lead astray, but it will be your fault. So you believe in some sort of God that rewards &quot;independent thinking and being a unique individual&quot; and a punishment for the sheep. How do you know this God punishes? You don&#39;t, no offense, but your last two sentences are perfect examples of meaninglessness I&#39;ve referenced. </p>

Things are just happening randomly and the governments of the world are barely competent enough to hold shit together, the idea they all have a secret plan they are masterfully putting together in the shadows seems like wishful thinking. It contradicts everything I know about government: that they are fucking idiots who can&#39;t do anything right.

    <div class="md"><p>It is coordinated by outside forces that actually enjoy our suffering and fear. They don&#39;t mind incompetent dupes, that cause us pain with their incompetence, leading us toward centralized control, lack of truthful information about what is going on, mass surveillance, and the erosion of individual rights. It suits their agenda just fine. </p>

<p>If you want a model for the utility of having semi-incompetent dupes, up front, doing your bidding, look at George W Bush. It makes people jump to the conclusion that since our leaders are so stupid there couldn&#39;t be a significant conspiracy. Yet, we got 9/11 under Bush, the war on terror, the patriot act, an expansion of illegal domestic surveillance and other measures designed to erode individual rights. It&#39;s planned and coordinated, but look at bozo the clown. He couldn&#39;t do it could he? I guess it didn&#39;t happen then, yet it did. We can go into denial in this way. </p>

<p>The symbolism on display in the media is not there for the purpose of being secret code. This is the information age. The cabal no doubt uses instantaneous communication like we do when it suits them. </p>

<p>The symbolism is there to cause fear in a few minority camps of thought, and thus control of behavior to an extent. Groups that don&#39;t recognize the symbols are largely unaffected. </p>

<p>They want conspiracy theorists to fear the vast influence and power of the cabal so they feel impotent and do nothing to stop it. They also want those who are involved with the operations of the cabal, many thousands of people, to see that evidence of influence and power and fear being a whistleblower and to stay loyal. They basically are using it to generate the sentiment often repeated here, &quot;we&#39;re fucked&quot;. So, in that way, as a means of manipulation to serve the self, it is an ingenious tool. It&#39;s much like what Kim Jong Un does, but much more clever, control by fear. It&#39;s so clever many of us here don&#39;t see what is occurring, yet we do experience it and give the authors what they sought to an extent. </p>

<p>I like your <em>show me the evidence</em> attitude. We need more people like you around here. Just please don&#39;t let it close your mind. We can&#39;t get sufficient evidence to believe for a lot of the pieces of the puzzle, which is the definition of proof, but we have a lot of evidence that is below the smoking gun level. You have to look at so many pieces to put the picture together. It&#39;s easy to become fixated on a few pieces, then dismiss new ones out of fatigue and disgust with the disinformation, smacking others upside the head until they believe just the specific pieces you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok challenge people sometimes. Coaches do it all all the time. Hopefully some people will wake up. In order to learn something you must become humble enough to admit you might not know. Open minded and humility go hand in hand. Just as pride and ego are hallmarks of stupidity.  growing and learning requires putting your own pride aside even when someone challenges you and makes you feel stupid. Nothing wrong with a challenge. It&#39;s how you respond to a challenge that determines the outcome. If you make it all about ego you might just be missing an important point. If you keep an open mind then you won&#39;t miss anything ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like you&#39;ve been through a binge of Illuminati videos on youtube and you thought you should &quot;enlighten&quot; us.</p>

<p>Yes, someone out there wants to control us. Their ultimate motive is to create a homogenous race that allows each member to be controlled in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>They want you to think that it&#39;s hopeless and that we have no chance to change anything. It&#39;s just a tactic. We&#39;re not living under an iron heel, not yet at least. </p>

<p>Ultimately, companies need to make money, even news companies. They will alter the truth, so to fit their social agenda, yes, but it doesn&#39;t mean you should ignore absolutely everything the MSM spits out.</p>

<p>On the other side, I&#39;m not telling you to start blasting CNN at full volume. Pick your news outlets carefully, read between the lines, do your best to get objective information from their articles.</p>

<p>If you think that every single political person in the world is under the heel of the &quot;new world order&quot; (in reality, a bunch of people with lots of money who want to keep making a lot more money) you&#39;re just being overly pessimistic. I can assure you that Brexit and Trump were huge blows to them, and they sure as hell tried to stop them from happening. We still have some control. What we need is mobilization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apologize, but you people are giving other people way, way too much credit. </p>

<p>No group is half as well organized as they&#39;d need to be to pull off even 10% of the shit that you talk about here. Much less do it without leaving <em>indisputable</em> evidence behind. </p>

<p>The truth is you want to feel like it&#39;s all being controlled by someone or a group of someones, for the same reason that people like to believe in God or Gods - if there isn&#39;t someone in control, or someone keeping you down, then anything is possible and <em>all of your failures are your own.</em></p>

<p>You&#39;re scared. I get it. Most people are scared, and most people are weak. It&#39;s why cults are so common, it&#39;s why religion has been the dominant force on the planet for millennia, and it&#39;s exactly why you&#39;re all here jerking each other off over &#39;controlled demolition&#39; and &#39;second gunman&#39; theories.</p>

<p>Grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So no conspiracies exist?  No one with power does illegal and immoral actions to dominate and control others?  I agree that some people take it too far, but you have to be extremely ignorant to dismiss everything.  If you knew anything about history you would see some of the horrific shit people with power have pulled off in the past.  There are things that have only come to light as a result of &#39;criminals&#39; exposing them.  Read up on COINTELPRO.  </p>

<p>Painting people that question authority as losers looking to blame society for their failures is a load of shit.  You know nothing about the people you denigrate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>President Trump was not preselected.  The MSM shilled hard for Hillary and fought Trump the entire way.  The MSM is still fighting Trump right now.  Go to CNN.com.  I know it&#39;s awful but just check it out real quick.  30 top stories, 28 of them hit pieces about our President.  </p>

<p>Trump is not establishment.  That&#39;s why the establishment is fighting him so hard.  Then you get guys like OP with a brand new reddit account saying &quot;let&#39;s band together against the evil Trump!&quot;.</p>

<p>Yes, there is an evil group trying to rob us of our rights and trying to destroy the West.  Globalist Jews, who have taken over the Democrat Party and own many Republican politicians, have been doing this for decades now.  Liberals are their foot soldiers.  You really want to fight the establishment?  Support President Trump, do anything you can to annihilate the left, and never take the focus off of globalist Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical conspiracy theorist bs. Been into this stuff since 9/11, so 16 years since I <em>officially</em> &quot;woke up&quot;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem with conspiracy <em>theorists</em>, not conspiracy <em>theories</em>: They become nihilists and accept their fate and believe there&#39;s no way to change it, or no <em>authentic</em> change happening. There are always string pullers with ulterior motives and Oz is <em>always</em> behind the curtain. If you believe in nothing, it&#39;s hard to try to have faith in anything.</p>

<p>Likewise, since Internet conspiracy has pretty much been reduced to &quot;No True Scotsman&quot; arguments, I&#39;ll chip in my two cents since I&#39;m apparently one of these &#39;newbies&#39; not in your little true Scotsman conspiracy club.  Our current president is anti-NWO, anti-MSM, pro-truth and he&#39;s currently working to take out major establishment factors that have aided in their development and growth in various aspects - the &#39;swamp&#39; (fixed legislation), illegal immigrants (culture change), MS-13 (drugs and human trafficking), and ISIS. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s not enough of something for you to try to have faith in, I honestly pity you that you live in such a deep well of nihilism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a meaningless statement. We &quot;believe in ourselves&quot; so what? We can&#39;t agree on anything. We believe in leaders we elect because we have a representative democracy. If you lack faith in that system then that&#39;s a different story, but simply believing in ourselves doesn&#39;t do anything, we&#39;re the most segmented populous to ever exist. Many Americans for instance don&#39;t even believe in Liberty anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think we can agree on a lot of things. We are all human aren&#39;t we? We all have the same basic needs. Why do we need middlemen to sell us these needs when we can get them for ourselves? It&#39;s because that is largely against the &quot;rules&quot; set up by them to hold us down as slaves. So that we can work for them and give them everything that they want.</p>

<p>We are definitely segmented. There are people who are in denial, clinging to this hopeless scheme of poverty and despair, and those who have acknowledged the situation and want to change for the better of humanity. In order to do this, we first need to believe that we <em>can</em> do it. They won&#39;t do it for us (obviously).</p>

It kinda made me feel like I was a fucking conspiracy nutter (and I still kinda do, tbh - I question my sanity all the goddamn time). When journalists started getting outed as shills and everyone was telling people to &#39;find sources&#39; and &#39;read sources and references&#39;, you find out some pretty disturbing things when you dig deep enough. You don&#39;t need evidence to convict people, you just need to use your head to consider what the fuck you would do in their position.</p>

<p>I agree with your post, but I will postulate that the partisan bickering has been going on on here for 7 years that I know of. Granted, it is a little worse at present  but I think tjat shift in dynamics is easily explained. For the most part Trump supporters were attacked and forced out.of othèr subs,  ahem, r/ politics which seemed to have been decisivily taken over afyer the DNC. </p>

<p>I agree with your sentime tics 100%. As a criminal justice major (criminology) in undergtad, i heard it in every class over and over that the inmates must, at all cost, femain divided, for if they unite, their target will be the system and they will be unstoppable. </p>

<p>The partisan wedge issue bullshit we see is by design, not accident. And the media is the propaganda arm of the govt. They exist to sell citizens the bullshit the govt. Fabricates. </p>

1) the infowars/“the Jews did it!” Crowd

    <div class="md"><p>Great question, actually.  Trump has pushed for restraint in immigration and building the border wall.  Of course, the border wall is a stupid idea and would be a huge waste of money, but it is something a Nationalist would push for.  NWO globalists want open borders and unrestrained immigration, like what is currently happening in Europe.  New World Order globalists want a one world government, which would presumably require the dissolution of the current nations, including the US.  Trump wants to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;.  </p>

<p>There is also this Trump speech regarding the New World Order.  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/EYozWHBIf8g">https://youtu.be/EYozWHBIf8g</a></p>

<p>You raise valid points, but being President is not what people believe.  Trump did not march into the White House last January and start issuing orders.  Trump was given orders, and this was the source of the conflict, especially with the CIA.  Trump thought he was going to implement his policies, but the policies are set for him.  </p>

<p>Same with Obama.  When Obama first became President, he was given a list of bankers to appoint to his administration.  The list was given to him by Citibank.  I suspect the same thing happened to Trump.  </p>

<p>If someone is going to argue that I hate Democrats, it should be because I supported Bernie and he got screwed big time.  I really believe that Bernie would have beaten Trump in the election.  Hillary was not a viable candidate.  There was also the Convention, and the way the Bernie supporters were treated.  People kept chanting &quot;No more War!  No more War!&quot;, but they were drowned out and ignored.  </p>

<p>The worlds economy is a war economy, but that is no longer sustainable.  It will come crashing down once war can no longer be waged, and they are running out of excuses to attack countries.  They will push for attacks against Iran and North Korea because these are the last two countries without a Rothschild controlled Central Bank.  </p>

<p>If North Korea is attacked, it will be the first nuclear armed country.  Seoul is about 30 miles from the DMZ, and there are about 23 million people in that area.  </p>
