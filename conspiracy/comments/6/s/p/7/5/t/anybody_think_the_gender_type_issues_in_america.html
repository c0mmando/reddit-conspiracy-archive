    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m beginning to believe that the whole plan with trans popularity is to cause a divide. They are pushing trans in our faces in hopes that we get disgusted and fight back. It&#39;s working. </p>

<p>I get the idea. That they&#39;re pushing trans to break up the family unit. But what&#39;s happening is that it&#39;s breaking us apart from fellow human beings. Those that swap genders are still apart of us and tptb are fully aware of this, and they are using those that are gender confused as a tool. Same thing with immigrants. Same thing with all women, men, children...no matter your background. I see it on the daily...people fighting back against someone who has transitioned...they are pinning their anger on an innocent person when they should be using their resources more wisely. </p>

<p>They are dividing us into subgroups that turn on each other and we are letting it happen. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t comprehend the nature of elites using talking points that are only relevant because we live in the sexual dark ages that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>The only conspiracy here is political correctness not sexuality. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve already sank any hope bias ship you&#39;ve had. You mentioning feminism in your OP is also a red flag as there isn&#39;t nothing inherently wrong with feminism either what you&#39;re doing is cherry picking so you can have these talking points....</p>

<p>Debate how harmful it is to push political correctness via social and sexual means,  but to assume either of your talking points and inherently &quot;bad&quot; is a poor stance. </p>

<p>I think we understand each other there. Feminism needed to happen but its not like the man owned the wife before feminism. The wife owned him, the wife didnt have to make decisions as the man made them for her. That&#39;d be a really nice life to be honest. Not making decisions? Anyone would do a whole lot to not have to make decisions. Thats the hardest part of life </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost don&#39;t know where to start with this, but here goes:</p>

<p>Firstly, you clearly have no idea about depression and mood disorders function. Both can be successfully treated with therapy and medication. Emotional states depend on neurochemistry, some of which we can control and influence by reenforcing mental states through behaviour (neurons that for together, wire together), but quite often, for reasons we don&#39;t understand, the chemistry is off, and no amount of &quot;determination and will power&quot; is going to do anything. </p>

<p>Secondly, are you really not sophisticated enough to understand the difference between gender and sexuality? Many trans individuals are females, who identify as males, who are attracted to other males, for instance. Gender is about how an individual identifies themselves in a spectrum between a male and a female. Sexual attraction is a wholly different animal. You can&#39;t suddenly decide to be turned on by dicks if that&#39;s not your thing... did anyone teach you to have your first erection? (Just assuming you&#39;re male... if not, then swap in vaginal moistening...).</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t believe that in 2017 there are people who believe that individuals can choose at will which type of genitals they have an autonomic sexual response to. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like an acquired taste or something that you can just power through till you&#39;re all about the dick (or vag, as the case may be).</p>

<p>AND, if you actually had any experience with folks who are homosexual or trans, you would know it&#39;s not something they chose to be trendy. </p>

<p>Hopping on that big pharma nutsack aren&#39;t you? You know with depression they say its from a low seratonin in and dopamine count? That its the happy chemicals? Who&#39;s to say they are not just recording what&#39;s happening <strong>during</strong> depression and not that because of a low count, thats the <strong>cause.</strong> its a chicken before the egg scenario but way easier.</p>

<p>You know doctors prescribe antidepressants to children undergoing a parents divorce? Like its not normal to feel sad about that because your chemistry is off? No. </p>

<p>What they&#39;re doing is training your brain to <strong>NOT</strong> make enough in its own by introducing a substitute. You become dependant on it, that&#39;s why they dont advise you to come off it but to ween. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>both can be successfully treated with therapy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve already killed your own argument with this. 
If it wasn&#39;t a psychosomatic issue then therapy wouldn&#39;t do shit now would it? They always address a <strong>cause</strong> on why you&#39;re depressed or having mood issues. You&#39;ve literally killed your argument right there. But therapy is used as another feel good coddling technique to rape insurance even more. if you need to talk to someone, why not a priest? They would love to help you, and you dont even pay. </p>

<p>As per the gender bit, I get what you&#39;re trying to say, but you fail to see a correlation between childhood experiences, trauma and outlook that those people had. Its the same thing with the medication. If you&#39;re a male with male testosterone and surrounded in a coddling environment, that testosterone does not get used. Your body stops producing it and using it and slowly or rapidly, you become feminine. Eventually the environments and your thought processes change how you view your environment and how you react to it, so its just like you said </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to try... I really am. Let&#39;s talk about psych meds first, shall we? </p>

<p>Any psychoactive substance (from Prozac to cannabis) that you put into your body can ONLY act on the chemistry that&#39;s already there. SSRIs (for example) only affect the reuptake of serotonin that is already circulating in the brain. You&#39;re not taking a dose of neurotransmitters... the body manufactures these substances itself. The cell can synthesize the chemicals from ingredients already in the brain; often they are also a byproduct of other activity within the cell... REGARDLESS... the only thing a psychoactive substance can do is to cause a cell to release more or less of a substance by affecting a receptor site. I&#39;m trying to give you a kindergarten version of neurochemistry here... it&#39;s clear you have no basic knowledge about these systems or how they are impacted by drugs. Just because they may be over prescribed in certain circumstances does not mean they&#39;re not effective.</p>

<p>Behaviour based therapies are also effective, sometimes on their own, sometimes in combination with medication. But depression is only one of several mood disorders; the more serious ones require medication to effectively manage. Behaviour affects chemistry; chemistry affects behaviour... you can alter either (to some extent) by altering the other. It&#39;s not a paradox, as you suggest. Why not save yourself a lot of future embarrassment: pick up a used first year intro to psych text book and read it.</p>

<p>Now: I just need to be clear. You&#39;re actually claiming that a male that is &quot;coddled&quot; too much (whatever that is supposed to mean) will gradually stop producing testosterone and become &quot;feminine&quot;? That&#39;s what you&#39;re claiming? So if you&#39;re not hard enough in your boy, he&#39;s going to crave the dick? I sincerely hope you don&#39;t have children.</p>

<p>Where is there <strong>any</strong> evidence of this?  Because I tend to believe the actual accounts of thousands of people who say the exact opposite - that they did everything in their power to NOT be gay or trans, to the point of being suicidal and in extreme mental anguish - even to this day.  In fact, there was just an AskReddit question yesterday about being trans with hundreds of people responding about how painful the realization was.  So I find it extremely hard to believe people are gay or trans because it&#39;s &quot;cool&quot;.</p>

<p>My opinion?  Who cares?  Why should I care if some brother and sister want to get married, who am I to stop them?  Royalty did it for thousands of years.  The mormons do it.  The Appalachians do it.  Ultimately what do I care?</p>

<p>That said, it isn&#39;t the same.  No more than people suddenly wanting to, and being okay with, marrying their pets is ever going to be acceptable.  (And even if it one day is, why should I care if some dude wants to marry his donkey.  More power to him.  LOVE WINS.)</p>

<p>Which is why pedophilia (and bestiality for that matter) will never be legal in civilized nations.  And have NO business being brought up in the same conversation as homosexuality or transgenderism - which harms nobody except those who enjoy clutching pearls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in the 80&#39;s.  There wasn&#39;t a horror movie produced between 1950-1995 that I haven&#39;t seen.  Further, by the time I was 13 I had devoured an entire library of true crime books.  So in my most formative years I was consumed by violence - both real and depicted.  Yet, I am one of the friendliest and most pacifistic people I know.</p>

<p>Before you accuse me of one fallacy or another, let me add... I live in a pretty liberal community.  My children have many friends with gay families and I have a close relative who is transgender.  We&#39;ve been to PRIDE, we&#39;ve watched RuPaul - you could say they are surrounded by LGBT things.  Because our family doesn&#39;t make a big deal out of it and it&#39;s just a way of life - there&#39;s no shock, shame or elevating of <em>any</em> of it, it doesn&#39;t even register on their radar. As my daughter once said, &quot;Some people love people just like them, some people don&#39;t.  Some girls dress up like boys, some don&#39;t.  Some men feel like women, some don&#39;t.  As long as I&#39;m free to be me, why would I care if you want to be you?&quot;</p>

<p>I think <em>worrying about the children</em> is an excuse for grown adults to voice their fears and prejudices - which I&#39;d say is <strong>a lot</strong> more harmful to children than anything in the LGBT community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really didn&#39;t respond to what I said, does exposing kids things such as Rupauls <strong>always</strong> work out just fine? Because when an 8 year old boy does drag and performs at shows, and writhes around the ground in sexual poses, I can&#39;t really say that isn&#39;t sexualizing kids. <em>but that&#39;s just what they want to do</em> no, stop it. You have an obligation as a parent to stop it. It&#39;s thing to let them dress up at home, but another to encourage inherently sexual behavior well before puberty. </p>

<p>And I grew up in an area probably more liberal than you, with LGBT family as well. I harbor no prejudices against adults. And as an ally of them, all of the sudden I&#39;m a nazi for pointing out the blatant sexualizing of children? Also it&#39;s sad that you would equate horror movie watching to this topic, almost disrespectful. At 16? Sure maybe as a family watch Rupauls, funny show. At 6? 8? Give me a break, you&#39;re hurting the left and emboldening actual bigots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you immediately bring it to adults, and him specifically? I think the better question is how this affects children, and young adults, especially young adults with depression. </p>

<p>Obviously trans and gay communities are a good thing for those communities, and those looking to come out and join those communities. The problem he is having a hard time explaining is the effect it has on young and impressionable kids. If you ask me the Internet is a bad thing for children, in a host of other ways let alone influencing sexuality well before it is meant to be influenced. That said it may not be the goal to influence sexuality, but many times it kind of comes off that way in my opinion. Bill Nye comes to mind. </p>

<p>Democrats, mainly liberals, are destroying the family.  Transgenderism, homosexuality, abortions...  look at the rate of black on black crime.  Somewhere around 72% of black kids grow up without a father.  That almost brings a tear to my eye.  When that happens to the white majority, America will be in the worse shape you can imagine.   </p>

Do you think economically poor white people have an easier time than any other economically poor group? Do you wish to see the end of racism? Because if you do, are you of the opinion that blaming an entire group for something will help achieve that? Even if you did have the opinion that white people were all inherently bad, then wouldn&#39;t this be the ideal time to show that you are above the same racism you believe another group is guilty of? Feel free to carry on down the path of hating a group, but I&#39;m white from the UK, you might not believe me, but I&#39;ve never sat around when it&#39;s just white people in the room and suddenly everyone starts talking about how they want to keep x or y race down. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like in your area or what the ultra rich think, but I&#39;m from a poor area in London where I was the minority in my area. Most people just want their family to be ok and spend time with people they love doing something they enjoy. Not saying there aren&#39;t horrible people who do want to plot your downfall, out there, but I&#39;ve been fortunate enough to not have to spend anytime with them, I hope you don&#39;t have to either.

Irish have been under apartheid for hundreds of years by Anglos and were sold into slavery around Europe and even America. Slav and slave have a long history of being used together and Jews and Arabs were the ones who sold the slaves to North Americans so don&#39;t act like white people were the only ones using slaves at the time.</p>

This is exactly the type of information and topic I was looking for on the argument and you&#39;ve really got a good argument and look on the situation so thank you for that. I think you&#39;ve got a really good head on your shoulders and you really do write quite well. Have you tried cross posting this to /changemyview to see what kind of reaction it gets? I think it would be a very interesting discussion. I also have to add the elimination of gender roles and societys promotion of sex culture and promiscuity produces later births and more without parents. Later births have an increase to birth defects thus draining more and more on social welfare and the cycle repeats </p>

It seems definite that if it is a conspiracy it has some sort of sinister motivation.</p>

<p>My wife also thinks that more likely than conspiracy is some sort of side effect of chemical exposure. Lots of unregulated chemicals are in our water and food that have possible endocrine disruption effects, as well as birth control. Birth controls true side effects are not fully understood by science. She&#39;s a chemistry teacher and I&#39;m a water treatment professional, so neither of us are &quot;chemical conspiritards&quot; by any means. We just believe that hormonal disruption is more severe than a lot of people want the population to understand</p>

<p>Trans people are sometimes literally murdered just for being trans. That kind of hate crime doesn&#39;t happen much these days, but they absolutely are victimized. </p>

<p>This fucking topic itself is loaded with people saying hateful things about these types of people. That&#39;s victimization. Trans people don&#39;t need to seek out victimization, it&#39;s given to them freely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I get that, but you&#39;re not addressing humanity or living in general. I brought up a mere philosophical point in the mortality of man. That making <strong>any</strong> decision is the hardest thing you could ever do. I&#39;m not contesting anybody <strong>shouldn&#39;t</strong> make their own decisions, so stop getting ass hurt because someone makes a point you&#39;re not comprehending. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying if a person were to end up homeless, penniless, and disabled from their decisions, as well as face the whole world that it is on making them, that the hardest thing to do is making the <strong>right</strong> decision that you&#39;ll never really know is right or not. But who am I kidding, you&#39;re probably a hedonist right? Something along the lines of &quot;do whatever makes me happy?&quot; That doesn&#39;t work with raising someone or even loving someone for that matter. I can say if thats you&#39;re motto, you&#39;re a very selfish person and a product of this consumeristic society as if it doesn&#39;t already show in how you speak </p>

<p>Sure, you can do whatever you want to do without hurting or endangering anything, thats just common fucking sense.

<p>Ad hominem (again) </p>

<p>Without addressing the point I made of how your actions effect others regardless if youre not hurting anyone or violent. So I think you lost yourself there and have no real answer so you&#39;re projecting you&#39;re lack of an answer by means of an ad hominem.

<p>Uhhhh... what?  </p>

<p>And I&#39;ve addressed your point.  But I&#39;ll address it one more time:  If others are so easily influenced by people&#39;s actions, I say that&#39;s on them.  And their parents who raised them.  My papa used to say, &quot;KarmicEnigma, if everyone else jumps off a bridge, are you going to follow them?&quot;  And I&#39;d say, &quot;Maybe, if it looks fun!&quot;  </p>

<p>The point is - people have choices.  If their choices are influenced by others, should we stop <em>others</em> from doing what they are doing even though it hurts nobody - including those who are choosing to do the same based on influence?  </p>

<p><strong>That</strong> sounds like some libtard snowflake bullshit to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. There are cases that have been onset through both acute physical and emotional traumatic events. This is well documented. People with MPD do not claim to be born as a different gender, even though some of those personalities may take on different genders. They are temporary and usually related to an emotional trauma. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder">90% report childhood abuse</a></p>

<p>It is important to distinct that multiple personality disorder is separate from transgenderism or gender dysphoria. The vast majority of transgenders have not had significant traumatic events before identifying themselves. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKZjag5OZOo">Mel Blanc, a famous voice actor, was awoken from his coma due cuing from a character he created.</a></p>

<p>As for the cases of transgenders there have been studies out lined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism">Causes of transexuality Wikipedia page.</a> They have found physical differences between cisgender (people who accept what they physically are) and transgender. </p>

<p>There is a very good nature vs nurture study section that details the difference between gender expression and gender identity as well as historical norms and societal expectations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you really think the mainstream media is trying to push the idea of  trans hate though?</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m massively indifferent to the idea of trans people, if they want to have surgery or dress in a certain way then it makes no difference at all to my life.</p>

<p>The only thing I would say is that the idea that a child should have the authority/ability to change their sex at such a young age is frightening. For me this is case of being consistent, if a child can vote at X age or have power of attorney at X age then I&#39;m fine with them being able to decide to undergo surgery, but no parent would give a 5 year old power of attorney, so why are they allowing them to undergo surgery that could have a devastating impact.</p>

<p>The mainstream is clearly quite supportive of trans people at the minute which I don&#39;t have a problem with. I am confused by the so-called &quot;non-binary&quot; trans people though. What makes them decide they feel like a man or woman on any given day? I&#39;ve asked a few people but never received an answer that wasn&#39;t hostile (I totally accept I could&#39;ve just asked the wrong way or wrong people though). The mainstream has been pushing the non-binary idea a lot and it seems to be at the expense of other trans people who just want to be called the other pronoun. The non-binary arguments about calling people Zim/Zher etc seems unreasonable to many older people like myself as it&#39;s not a natural evolution of language. This idea seems to being pushed. I also think the race-baiting/gender-baiting being pushed at the moment makes people believe they have identified some new &quot;enemy&quot; whereas in reality it leaves people fighting among themselves and not looking at the LIBOR rigging scandal where it was recorded that the banks are intentionally causing the economy to work in a way that isn&#39;t beneficial to the market as a whole.</p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with that.  The <em>entire</em> crux of my argument is personal freedom and personal responsibility.  People should be allowed to (mostly) do what they want with their lives as long as it hurts nobody.  Marrying a donkey is obviously extreme - but I simply don&#39;t care enough to walk around carrying a sign saying &quot;NOBODY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO MARRY DONKEYS&quot; and, if I had to take a stance, my opinion is &quot;who cares?&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you are responsible for yourself.  If you are so easily influenced by my actions, that&#39;s not <em>my</em> problem - it&#39;s yours.  I&#39;m raising my kids to be independent thinkers and make their own choices.  If other parents aren&#39;t doing the same, that&#39;s a shame.  But again, why should we restrict a person&#39;s personal freedom all <em>in the name of the children</em>.  That&#39;s dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I answered your statements in the original argument. That 10 year olds are not necessarily subject to abuse by engaging in sexual acts. They have a choice, and if they choose their choices then thats personal freedom and liberty no? You dont just get to cherry pick what freedom and liberty are to some people. That 10 year old can be perfectly willing to begin a relationship with an older man, why do you think its abuse? Just as you said </p>

<p>No there is not. The point of a &quot;child&quot; is different everywhere around the world. In America you can&#39;t drink until 21. In Germany? Its 14. </p>

<p>Century&#39;s ago the age of consent was a lot lower in some areas where even a 12 year old could marry. Are you saying they technically shouldn&#39;t because of the laws in america? You mentioned laws governing this. Not to long ago it was illegal for gays to get married, that was a law? If the age of consent for a child changes, does that mean you&#39;ll be against it as well? Or are you just relating legality to morality? Because if you are, you&#39;re going to have a bad time </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in all honesty, I can see the position @HeyWhoDoYouThinkYouR is putting forward. It&#39;s basically that the same arguments that were used to (IMO, rightly) mean that being gay/trans was an acceptable choice will be used to legitimise having sex with children. There are already articles framing pedophila as an attraction that they can&#39;t control. There are also some groups who are basically saying &quot;well being gay was a stigma until recently so why can&#39;t pedophilla also be accepted eventually?&quot;</p>

<p>As you rightly point out, children do not have consent, but then the argument is at what age someone stops being a child and is able to give consent. It is a topic that can be spun by people who want to promote having sex with children.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t&#39; obvious differences between adults and children and the idea of consent now, it&#39;s that these ideas can be eroded over time by using the same arguments that were used for gay acceptance. Are you of the opinion that a child should be able to say that they feel like they are the wrong gender and have surgery to change their sex? Again, if you believe this is acceptable then this will be another argument put forward by despicable groups such as NAMBLA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only know a couple of feminist writers. I saw Germaine Greer speak at a conference and thought she was pretty interesting. It seems that many people in the &quot;contemporary&quot; feminist movement (I&#39;m not well-read enough on this topic to know what the actual term for this group might be) really dislike her because of her views that a biological woman obviously has different experience of being a woman than a male to female trans person. I&#39;m willing to learn a bit if you can provide references about the previous comment you made to the commenter about their being &quot;limited perspective on feminism in north america&quot;.</p>

<p>The trend seems to be that feminists are now supposed to treat being born biologically as a woman as nothing more than a state of mind that can seemingly be changed at any moment. (again, I am not claiming to be an expert, merely stating what feminist arguments seem to be promoted most heavily in the media as I see it)</p>

<p>I&#39;m most confused by the idea of &quot;non-binary&quot; people for whom, gender is essentially saying &quot;I feel like being a man/woman today&quot;. But that feeling of being a man or woman seems to be based on very little. Do they feel like they are more of a man on one day because they are aggressive/competitive or more of a woman because they feel caring/sensitive that day? Aren&#39;t those stereotypes exactly what feminism was trying to fight? I&#39;m happy to believe that in that situation that there are individuals and some women are competitive and some men sensitive etc, but why do contemporary feminists support the idea that male to female trans person knows what it&#39;s like to be a woman? Besides stereotypical ideas of what it is to be a woman, how can this person identify as a woman?</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m also confused by the reluctance by contemporary feminists to criticise Islam. Again, isn&#39;t the obvious subservience to men something that previous feminists would have fought against?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure my question makes much sense, it&#39;s just that from the narratives presented by the media about feminism it seems to logical inconsistent these days. Of course, I know very little about the topic so please feel free to correct me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corporate media profits from spectacle, which means we can&#39;t trust them to provide a balanced portrait of feminism.<br/>
It&#39;s impossible to generalize all feminists thinking a certain thing. These are just people with interests and needs.<br/>
I think at it&#39;s core, feminism is about self empowerment, self realization, and unity against exploitation of all kinds.<br/>
Also, any so called feminist who thinks Islam is not sexist has his head up his ass. That said...<br/>
Feminism is about being aware of the different types of power and privilege we hold in society. In context, it may be inappropriate for a white woman to simply tell a brown muslim woman to stop wearing those sexist clothes. But that&#39;s a totally euro-centric way of judging a woman who grew up wearing these things and having certain expectations. Western society has a problem respecting and understanding other cultures, stemming from our colonial past.<br/>
Sexism and racism are constantly acting to keep certain groups dominant over other groups. Some may think well the weak deserve it. Survival of the fittest. They might think woman should stay in the kitchen, and non-white people deserve to be poorer than whites. I think that&#39;s fucking sexist and racist, and that&#39;s what feminism is about. Calling people out on their cruelty when they deny others their humanity.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always different strands to any movement, but the feminism that seems to be promoted by mainstream media just seems inconsistent. I don&#39;t know enough about the different factions within feminism to say how reflective the arguments that are pushed in the mainstream media are a reflection of feminism.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This I do not agree with. Why is it inappropriate for anybody to say they don&#39;t believe something is a good or bad idea? Why is it inappropriate for a white atheist to say it? Who decides who gets to decide who gets to speak their mind? Why do they have to say that the woman needs to &quot;stop wearing those sexist clothes&quot;? If a white atheist speaks to a muslim woman but says &quot;I don&#39;t agree with you having to wear these clothes because of X reason&quot; then what is the problem with that? The muslim woman should be free to tell the white atheist that she doesn&#39;t like an idea of theirs or refute their argument. Also, if the person says &quot;stop wearing those sexist clothes&quot; then they don&#39;t&#39; really have much of an argument as they&#39;re trying to enforce the same behaviour they are criticising. The idea that because an individual belongs to a group they can&#39;t criticise something is basically like when the pigs say &quot;some animals are more equal than others&quot; in Animal Farm. The idea that belonging to a particular social group means an individual can&#39;t voice their opinion is pretty discriminatory isn&#39;t it? An argument should stand on the strength of the content not the because of the person who says it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes &quot;western society&quot; does have problems with other cultures - as do cultures having problems with other cultures for as far back as recorded human history. Across the world and throughout time all cultures are guilty of treating other cultures poorly. It&#39;s not as if the Ottoman empire didn&#39;t do anything terrible, or the Persian empire was peaceful to everybody it met. There&#39;s just this tendency at the moment of equating one culture (usually white western culture) as being the pinnacle of all evil. There are shitty people and amazing people in every culture.</p>

<p>Sexism and racism are constantly acting to keep certain groups dominant over other groups.</p>

<p>Agreed, it happens all over the world, white farmers were murdered in Zimbabwe for being white, a young black kid, Stephen Lawrence was murdered in the UK for being black, one third of foreigners living in Japan experience racism (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/japan-racism-survey-reveals-one-in-three-foreigners-experience-discrimination">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/japan-racism-survey-reveals-one-in-three-foreigners-experience-discrimination</a>)</p>

<p>I would argue the best way to combat racism is to encourage people to not see themselves as part of a group, but an individual who just happens to share some genetic traits. I&#39;ve seen some awful comments from some black people and white liberals recently calling black people with a more traditionally conservative opinion &quot;coons&quot;, &quot;sell outs&quot; &quot;uncle Toms&quot; etc. Why should all black people have to share the exact same view like a hivemind? To me, this form of racism is more dominant than the old-style eugenics argument you highlight in your comment. There are definitely still those who believe in that social Darwinism nonsense, but to me it&#39;s equally racist to believe that all people who share a skin tone should have the same opinion.</p>

<p>Obviously racism and sexism still exist so if you could introduce legislation or law to combat this then what would you implement that isn&#39;t already in place now?</p>

<p>My wife suggested that if paternity leave was made mandatory then this would mean that employers no longer view women of child bearing age as a potential drain on resources that they have to pay her wages while on maternity leave and would also mean that women would be more likely to climb the corporate ladder as a man would have to shoulder the same responsibilities as the woman. I can kind of see her argument. I&#39;m interested in other views on what legislation would improve sexism and racism that aren&#39;t in place now.</p>

That&#39;s true about the west vs other cultures. But as a member of the West, witnessing criminal violence of our economic elite, I object. I thought we were enlightened or something?<br/>
As far as regulations go, I would suggest our &#39;free trade&#39; legislation should be replaced with trade agreements that respect human rights. No imports made with child labour, for example. No imports from places where worker safety, environmental protections, or minimum wages are ignored.<br/>
Why do we in the west allow corporations to important products made in wage slavery conditions? Made by poor women and children who live in what is essentially a prison? I would suggest we allow it because we&#39;re a racist, sexist culture.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many people that could justify children making products for what amounts to pennies per hour. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s necessarily because of racism or sexism, I think it&#39;s probably just because it&#39;s better for their profit. I think there&#39;s lots of examples where companies are willing to let people of all ethnicities and backgrounds suffer if it means they don&#39;t lose money. I did a very quick search and found a number of cases where companies sold products they knew would cause health problems for western citizens too (example: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36191495">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36191495</a>)</p>

<p>I think these companies are willing to put anybody at risk. The most notable example I can think of is Bayer who knowingly sold injectable medicine with the AIDS virus to people in South American, Asia and Europe. They had tried to sell it to the US first, so it&#39;s not like they cared if European, Asian or South American people died from their &quot;medicine&quot;. They just didn&#39;t want to incur the cost of having to recall it.</p>

<p><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2006/08/05/bayer-sells-aids-infected-drug-banned-in-us-in-europe-asia.aspx">http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2006/08/05/bayer-sells-aids-infected-drug-banned-in-us-in-europe-asia.aspx</a></p>

<p>I agree though, I don&#39;t see why these imports clearly made from child labor are allowed to be imported. I don&#39;t see why at the minimum, anything made with child labor shouldn&#39;t have a warning in the same position as the designer logo of the t-shirt/jacket etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily western economic elites who are morally objectionable either. Have you read about the World Cup being held in Qatar? They enticed workers from around Asia and basically confiscated their passports so they couldn&#39;t leave. There&#39;s no reason to hold the World Cup their either. It means having to move the tournament from the summer to the winter (first time ever this has been done), also the other countries bidding for the tournament have the existing infrastructure in place. Clearly there were bribes and kickbacks for all involved. Despite FIFAs instance that homosexual fans are welcomed, it means that a gay couple wanting to watch their team in Qatar will have to not show any affection to their partner publicly in case they are arrested. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just not sure that the examples you listed are because of racism and sexism and more opportunistic greed. I think if a company can exploit someone whether they are white, black, gay, straight, man or woman they will.</p>

<p>As to why people continue to buy from these companies, maybe that is in part because of racism or sexism, but equally, it could be because people aren&#39;t aware (not everybody has the time to check who made something and what conditions it was made in, they&#39;re living their own lives and trying to get through the day themselves). </p>

<p>People talk about freemarket economics and in general, I&#39;d rather the market decide on what should be made. I would like to see the products made with child labor to have a prominent warning label on it though. I doubt that if there was such a warning label on it whether there would be the same level of sales. Those companies would have to reconsider their practices once it became economically unfeasible for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry,  I didn&#39;t mean to imply that obviously wouldn&#39;t be the preferable outcome, but the labelling would let the &quot;market decide&quot;. Personally, I believe that if the public relations nightmare of companies having to admit how they make their products is shown to consumers, then not only will consumers not buy that product, but they will also stop buying from that brand. I doubt many people will be willing to wear clothing that has &quot;made with child labor in X foreign country&quot; emblazoned next to a designer logo. Hardcore nationalists would be appalled that their labor was forcing down wages and reducing jobs in their own country, while globalists would see how damaging it is to their reputation worldwide. </p>

<p>My point is there is no way of knowing who is genuine and who is milking the system for their own gains and that since we are not allowed to criticize because it is their inherent right to be pro choice or what have you it opens us to an era of ignorance. </p>

<p>A hedonist?  No.  But I believe very strongly in personal liberty.  As long as I am not hurting or endangering anyone, I should be able to do whatever I want to do.  Marry who I want to marry.  And make my own decisions.  Pretty simple, really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. There are cases that have been onset through both acute physical and emotional traumatic events. This is well documented. People with MPD do not claim to be born as a different gender, even though some of those personalities may take on different genders. They are temporary and usually related to an emotional trauma. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/dissociative-identity-disorder-multiple-personality-disorder">90% report childhood abuse</a></p>

<p>It is important to distinct that multiple personality disorder is separate from transgenderism or gender dysphoria. The vast majority of transgenders have not had significant traumatic events before identifying themselves. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKZjag5OZOo">Mel Blanc, a famous voice actor, was awoken from his coma due cuing from a character he created.</a></p>

<p>As for the cases of transgenders there have been studies out lined in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism">Causes of transexuality Wikipedia page.</a> They have found physical differences between cisgender (people who accept what they physically are) and transgender. </p>

<p>There is a very good nature vs nurture study section that details the difference between gender expression and gender identity as well as historical norms and societal expectations. </p>
