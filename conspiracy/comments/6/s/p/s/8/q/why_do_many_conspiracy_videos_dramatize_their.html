       This is actually the top reason I don't watch conspiracy videos anymore. They all (sorry) use "super ominous" music and scary sound and visual effects I find it hard to focus and not have my brain drift into a "dumb consumer" mode. In a way, I feel about them like I feel about most TV shows; like they're trying to bypass my objective viewpoint and emotionally manipulate me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally most of them also tend to present rather weak arguments, so I kinda suspect many of them to be ... how do you say ... well, not actual conspiracy videos, but stuff meant to catch curious minds and detract them into harmless nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish somebody did documentaries and inquisitive shows that aren't overly dramatized. Yeah I know Hollywood does it too. And I wish they'd stop. But only a fool would hope for that. Hollywood makes it's money from skillfully shutting off the mind and sometimes that can be enjoyable (although barely), but that's not what I expect from a show that is supposed to be at least a little inspiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good show I like, for example, is David Attenborough's "Life". Why? Well: The soundtrack tends to be minimal and it is edited in a way so that you have enough time to follow and grasp all the concepts that are explained and think critically about them. It is structured well. It also doesn't overdo special effects and doesn't cut too often so your eyes/ears don't get overburdened with stimuli (which would also detract from any critical and conscious approach). Pacing. It is edited by someone unafraid of letting a picture sit there for a while and letting you take it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if you talk with a real person in real life, do you just hammer them with arguments and ideas and give them no time to respond and think? Nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Whenever I see a conspiracy video that starts with scary music and zoomed in slow motion videos with Brightness -50 and Contrast +50 and a lot of shock-y sound effects, I just feel that something is a little off. And when I say "a little", I mean "all my red flags go up".

       What is the best video you have seen on YouTube? Or, what is the short list? Maybe if we put our minds together we can come up with something decent, and then work out what it is that makes these videos wortwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, the best long video is Eric Hunt's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80GgRWuXcO8">
        Spielberg's Hoax: Last Days of the Big Lie
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The best short videos is
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55xTk8FEoJQ">
        this one about crisis actors
       </a>
       .

       This is the single best video on YouTube though it was banned from YouTube and this is just a re-upload. The original video had over 1 million views and changed the course of world history. They had planned to nuke the London 2012 Olympics but too many people knew about it so they had to call off the operation. Operation Blackjack Code 9.

       Honestly, I really don't have a problem is they're dramatized as long as the content is engaging. If that's the sort of tactic it takes to get more people on board to waking up and questioning their reality, so be it.

       Most seem like intentionally-produced disinformation or information so vague and inconclusive that all it really does is waste people's time. There's even a consistent style for these videos... they almost look like they're all made by the same person or organization.

       It reflects their mentality: everything is so very dark, so very scary, yet the information they possess is of earth-shattering in importance. Watch out for these guys as they are the ones who may really be unhinged opposed to the rational conspiracy theorists (No true Scottsman, I know) who can actually help spread their information in a more digestible manner.  Which type is more helpful for the overall cause of Truth?

       Because a lot of people are only interested in conspiracy theories for entertainment purposes and content creators know this and want to capitalize as much as possible on it.  It's the reason why Alex Jones screams and shouts and acts a fool.  That's not to discount the conspiracies (although that might be a producer's intent as well) just the intent of the producers of these videos.

      <p>
       Because most people won't watch the videos otherwise and we are trying to spread information to the largest possible audience. If that is not your cup of tea then only watch the videos that appeal you.

       The 2 best conspiracy documentaries I've ever seen (rich mans trick and 9/11 new pearl harbour) had none of this garbage and they had me hooked and I could have watched the whole 6 hour series in one sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Corbett who also makes excellent documentaries without any of this shit, I've even watched a couple of his where it's literally just him yapping on over a PowerPoint presentation and been hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the info is good then the dramatics isn't needed, in fact if I put a doc on and hear the dramatic drums and trumpets start then I just turn it off, it's obviously there to make up for lack of depth or any real content.

       Before I answer, here is a no-frills information dump on one cohesive topic that will blow your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the most boring video in the world, containing the most magnificent information known to man.  Bring a calculator and be prepared to pause for math if you are as skeptical as you claim.  Short version: every ancient monument on earth knows exactly where it is/each other are on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to answer your question.  As you'll find, this video is arduously boring, despite it getting all of your neurons firing at light speed.  You may easily become more involved in your own thoughts than the video itself (especially if you pause to math stuff out and reflect).
      </p>
      <p>
       So why ominous?  Because you are lied to.  Sunshine and lollypops doesnt fit the motif.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, some of the more religious (non-doomsday) productions tend to cover popular songs a la "Conspiracy Al Yankovich" and are more upbeat in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to get through that video, it is mind-blowing.

       This is done to trigger your emotions. Fear especially. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because once you get a certain level of emotion going, people just stop thinking rationally. That makes it a lot easier to keep people watching the video and it makes it harder for them to realize/recognize any weaknesses in the material.

       It's good that you have the 'all my red flags go up' reaction, it's typically the right one to have.

       For propaganda to be effective it has to be entertaining and appeal to emotions.

       The things you mention, when combined, are clear signs of a blatant effort to over-dramatize and typically, someone who useful information to share - doesn't need all that bs to get their point across.

       No idea why CTers think longform rambling videos are the format du jour for information dissemination. Unless, in fact, that they care more about subscribers and broadcasting than information.

       They have a profit motive to do this. They get paid per click and for whether you watch a minimum amount of the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all conspiracy theory videos on YouTube are made by people who don't believe in the nonsense they're peddling, but know that if they upload lots of poorly produced videos claiming Hillary is an interdimensional satanist and Obama is a gay Kenyan from outer space, they'll get clicks and views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clicks and views = $$$ on places like YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the alt-right media were up in arms about YouTube demonetising fake news videos. They were crying "CENSORSHIP!!" because YT allowed the videos to stay up but stripped them of ads (and thus ad revenue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the money. They're trying to manipulate you into believing their bullshit, because they have a profit motive to deceive you. Same for Alex Jones and the rest of the alt-right media.

       So I agree with you that a lot of them do have background music or noise.  However its more to make the videos easier to take in, cover up minor issues, and also forces you to feel a certain way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch a horror movie without music/background noise and its not as scary, or it doesn't get you thinking the killer is near by.  Or watch an action movie and notice the music changes just as the fight changes.  Its done to make you feel certain emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it can be used to cover up background noise the producer doesn't want in the video.  Maybe someone is shuffling their feet during an interview or someone dropped something on set during a response.  What do you do?  You throw some music on and cover up the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just adding a little background noise/music makes the videos a little more enjoyable/easier to deal with.  Interviews dont have background noise for a few reasons, and they can be bland just hearing people talk.  Even the history channel used music and background noise back in the day( mid 90 s) when it had its awesome documentaries and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the weak arguments I am not going to argue with that.  Some will pick one "bullet proof" topic and just keep talking about it and ignore other points, facts, or flaws in their logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documentaries are tough to make them good.  If you don't have the budget, or good interviewer/narrator, or a topic that is intriguing it can be tough.

       Once something becomes mainstream it becomes corporate, the drive here is to profit more so than actually inform. It's not by accident that a lot of these videos have clickbatey titles with ominous music to suck you in. There is indeed a conspiracy industry that a lot of the times profiting off fear, Alex Jones trying to sell you water purifiers and solar blankets is one example of this.

       What is the best video you have seen on YouTube? Or, what is the short list? Maybe if we put our minds together we can come up with something decent, and then work out what it is that makes these videos wortwhile.

       The 2 best conspiracy documentaries I've ever seen (rich mans trick and 9/11 new pearl harbour) had none of this garbage and they had me hooked and I could have watched the whole 6 hour series in one sitting.

       James Corbett who also makes excellent documentaries without any of this shit, I've even watched a couple of his where it's literally just him yapping on over a PowerPoint presentation and been hooked.

       If the info is good then the dramatics isn't needed, in fact if I put a doc on and hear the dramatic drums and trumpets start then I just turn it off, it's obviously there to make up for lack of depth or any real content.
