        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Whenever I drive I use YouTube Red (9.99/mo for commercial free YouTube and I have to pay the extra so I can listen to the music and turn off phone screen). </p>

<p>I connect it to my car with Bluetooth. I normally search songs and listen. After a while, YT builds my own customized station and just loops the same songs over and over. </p>

<p>I got bored of listening to it and turned off the app on my phone. I decided to switch it up to FM radio and was scanning channels. I stopped on some Spanish song that I found catchy. Now I NEVER listen to Spanish music mostly because I am not Spanish and I don&#39;t know the names of any of the songs. </p>

<p>I let the Spanish song play and then listened to a few more radio (FM) stations in my car. </p>

<p>After a while I switched back to YouTube and guess what - Spanish songs mysteriously started popping up in my play list. The only way this could have happened is if my phone mic was left on and listening to my radio and recording.</p>

<p>Again - not sure if this is malicious - but definitely weird. </p>

<p>Anyway, turns out it was the new Justin Beiber single.. and its bloody everywhere!!!</p>

<p>Any chance thats what happened to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This very well may not be a coincidence. More and more advertisers are inserting ultrasonic tones in their advertisements which can be picked up by smartphone apps to track your radio and TV habits. Some stores even employ them to tie your online identity with your real identity if you purchase something. This is no baseless, paranoid theory; just google &quot;smartphone advertisement ultrasonic beacon&quot; and you will find lots of information about this practice.</p>

This is well trodden territory. </p>

<p>I wonder if people aren&#39;t being influenced to write posts like these to apply chilling effect on having conversation about controversial issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happened to me just a few hours ago (Google Ads) and I took a screenshot of the ad and was filled with dread. I thought of a really weird specific thing and got a huge popup ad on GameFaqs through Google Search. Okay, the word was basically &quot;fortunetelling&quot;, and 5 seconds later I get a totally out of nowhere ad with huge text &quot;FORTUNETELLING&quot; (in finnish, my native language). I basically thought &quot;I wonder if fortunetellers are just really good guessers&quot; (one of those funny random &quot;showerthoughts&quot; in bed) as I opened the Google Search result link to GameFaqs forums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am currently a struggling alcoholic, but very much on the wagon. I had a pretty deep conversation with my family about my alcoholism one day, and later that day, i opened my phone to find my internet browser open and sitting idly on an advertisement for a local rehab center.</p>

<p>I pressed the back button, and the tab closed. Could not later find it in my browser history. So lets recap, they microphoned my private conversation with my family, opened my browser, opened a new tab in private mode, and navigated to a sponsored ad for a rehab center after id already detoxed by myself, all because i used the words &quot;alcoholic&quot; and &quot;addict&quot; multiple times in one conversation. </p>

<p>This is the level of sophistication being employed in the surveilance of the human population.</p>

<p>Do you have a credible source for this claim? I mean, it sounds plausible enough, but I&#39;m just wondering if it&#39;s now openly discussed / explained somewhere.</p>

<p>I was talking with a friend about, not searching online, plantar fasciitis. Then I get a YouTube commercial about a foot brace to fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The song Despacito is number 1 everywhere in the world. It just tripled the previous record on youTube, and even non Spanish artists like Justin Beaver are singing it, so it&#39;s not too weird to hear it in a lot of places.</p>

<p>The only way this could have happened is if my phone mic was left on and listening to my radio and recording.</p>

<p>Yep same thing happened to me. </p>

<p>I had a phone conversation about some obscure topic that I&#39;ve never searched for on Google or YT....ever.  </p>

<p>THE VERY NEXT TIME I log into YT, I&#39;m presented with a suggestion that is the EXACT topic I was discussing on the phone.</p>

<p>The only way this could happen is if they were listening.  I make sure to double click and close every, single app when I&#39;m done with it.  So there&#39;s no possible way it was running in the back ground.</p>
