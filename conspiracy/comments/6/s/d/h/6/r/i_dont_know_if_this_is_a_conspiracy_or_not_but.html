       Whenever I drive I use YouTube Red (9.99/mo for commercial free YouTube and I have to pay the extra so I can listen to the music and turn off phone screen).
      </p>
      <p>
       I connect it to my car with Bluetooth. I normally search songs and listen. After a while, YT builds my own customized station and just loops the same songs over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got bored of listening to it and turned off the app on my phone. I decided to switch it up to FM radio and was scanning channels. I stopped on some Spanish song that I found catchy. Now I NEVER listen to Spanish music mostly because I am not Spanish and I don't know the names of any of the songs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I let the Spanish song play and then listened to a few more radio (FM) stations in my car.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a while I switched back to YouTube and guess what - Spanish songs mysteriously started popping up in my play list. The only way this could have happened is if my phone mic was left on and listening to my radio and recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - not sure if this is malicious - but definitely weird.

       I kept hearing a Spanish song on commercial radio for the last few weeks. It was really bugging me as it was on tv shows, radio etc.. problem is i live in Ireland, not exactly a hub of latin music!
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, turns out it was the new Justin Beiber single.. and its bloody everywhere!!!

       This very well may not be a coincidence. More and more advertisers are inserting ultrasonic tones in their advertisements which can be picked up by smartphone apps to track your radio and TV habits. Some stores even employ them to tie your online identity with your real identity if you purchase something. This is no baseless, paranoid theory; just google "smartphone advertisement ultrasonic beacon" and you will find lots of information about this practice.

       I'd recommend checking in your Settings for YouTube, to see if it's got access to your microphone. If you can 'speak to search', then the answer is already yes.

       yes, definitely turn off the 'OK google' option.  Though OP said he had an iPhone, so unsure if that option is available on non-android phones.  I was surprised to see how many people have that constantly listening 'OK google' active.

       we gave them permission to do this by using the service and signing their privacy policy. Im researching this at the minute, ill link some of the findings below. its unbelievable what permission you actually give companies. Yet no one actually checks before signing!

       I keep seeing posts like these. Almost the exact same post. We have been discussing this for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       . Not in the theoretical sense, like ever since they split the FB messenger into its own app and we reviewed the permissions in
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       ... This is well trodden territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if people aren't being influenced to write posts like these to apply chilling effect on having conversation about controversial issues.

       Some phones do not let you delete these apps. I use a s7edge cause of the app package disabler which lets you turn off the rapeware on your phone. Then there are shitstains like the entertainment network "we do not speak of" that force their app on your phone during an update an makes itself so you cannot uninstall it.

       There are risks to it, but I never really pay more than 100 bucks for a phone either. So, by the time a phone is in my price range there are usually very stable root processes available.

       I believe this is done by location and not Mic. I say that because I have moved to a different state and it keeps playing ads from the previous state. I somehow think emails are involved...IDK.

       YouTube app DID have permission for my mic. Disabled it. And no, it isn't some Justin song. I literally have never had another Spanish song pop up. It happened only after I first heard it on the radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       What concerns me is that the app was obviously accessing my mic and it wasn't even running.

       If you use firefox in desktop mode you can listen to youtube with the screen off. The ads are kind of annoying but not enough to drop $120 a year.

       It happened to me just a few hours ago (Google Ads) and I took a screenshot of the ad and was filled with dread. I thought of a really weird specific thing and got a huge popup ad on GameFaqs through Google Search. Okay, the word was basically "fortunetelling", and 5 seconds later I get a totally out of nowhere ad with huge text "FORTUNETELLING" (in finnish, my native language). I basically thought "I wonder if fortunetellers are just really good guessers" (one of those funny random "showerthoughts" in bed) as I opened the Google Search result link to GameFaqs forums.

       I am currently a struggling alcoholic, but very much on the wagon. I had a pretty deep conversation with my family about my alcoholism one day, and later that day, i opened my phone to find my internet browser open and sitting idly on an advertisement for a local rehab center.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pressed the back button, and the tab closed. Could not later find it in my browser history. So lets recap, they microphoned my private conversation with my family, opened my browser, opened a new tab in private mode, and navigated to a sponsored ad for a rehab center after id already detoxed by myself, all because i used the words "alcoholic" and "addict" multiple times in one conversation.

       The song Despacito is number 1 everywhere in the world. It just tripled the previous record on youTube, and even non Spanish artists like Justin Beaver are singing it, so it's not too weird to hear it in a lot of places.
