        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Naturally I ended up binge watching videos on the subject. Came away from it unsatisfied overall due to the fact that Musk seems to be the only one that could verbalize with any specificity the issues that should be addressed before this technology is pursued.</p>

<p>He&#39;s basically saying that - Concerning AI we can&#39;t afford to operate on a &quot;reactive policy&quot; due to AI&#39;s progress rate and decision making speed.</p>

<p>He recommends that a government institution create and apply safeguard policies/procedures before any more work is done in this area.</p>

<p>I feel he is expressing very valid concerns and a much safer way to approach the whole thing.</p>

<p>Do I agree with putting the government in charge of it? Not so much. </p>

<p>But I do agree with his basic premise that if this is going to occur...it is critically important for it to occur in the right way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His statements are right on it. The government usually puts laws into place due to outrage or mob rule. Any issues with AI will be too fast for government intervention. People will exploit its logic flaws like I can with askreddit&#39;s auto ban on emails. Simply ask the right question like what is the worst email address to have at work and watch the bans roll in. Someone will roll along and exploit the flaws left and right. I mean if you hooked up an AI to a metal 3d printer or Amazon, it could easily replicate itself and create facial recognizing drones that attack and kill if they see a certain face. It could do this entirely in secret if it was hooked up to the internet and use cameras as eyes and ears. By the time it took to create regulations, it could easily destroy over half the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take this scenario and try to imagine how AI would logically come to the conclusion that negating threats capable of stopping it&#39;s actions would become primary directives.</p>

<p>If ever or whenever AI reached this point the chances of its plan being foolproof would be pretty high.</p>

<p>One simple question...will we ever be certain that AI will not somehow remember that humans pulled the plug on it in previous experiments?</p>

<p>What&#39;s to stop it from taking its experiences and storing them on a cloud server only to find them in a later experiment?</p>

<p>People always say...well, you have to keep it isolated from external sources. Well that is exactly the opposite of what they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>They&#39;re letting AI programs immerse in the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recently there was an article about a team(Microsoft?) that developed some AI.  The AI didn&#39;t have any incentive to continue using English so they started modifying the language to be of more use to them, to the point where the researchers couldn&#39;t fully understand them anymore.  They scrapped it, supposedly, and started again with a focus on them staying in English so they could be understood.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to immediately imagine the worst possible outcome, so when I heard AI were developing their own language because it was easier I got a little scared.  It made me think that if there&#39;s a concern over future AI control, we&#39;ll never see it coming.  Their communications will be unintelligible and we won&#39;t have any warning.  Reminded me of the show Odyssey 5, where the plot of one episode was the protagonists had to discover and stop a rogue AI.  The AI wanted to end everything so it altered the results at some research facility so the scientists there would make a mistake big enough to destroy the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You...kind sir, have just pointed out a possibility that completely escaped me. Irony 10/10 achieved.</p>

<p>A peek inside my mind - I actually wondered if it was possible that Mark Zuckerberg had a bot installed on Reddit to notify him whenever his name is mentioned in certain subs.</p>

<p>My logic - Who would think that the username &quot;openly incognito&quot; would be clever?</p>

<p>Obviously someone would have to have some type of personal experience with the need to remain incognito, have the desire to be able to have open dialogue on a social media  platform...and think it&#39;s clever to pick a username that flaunts the whole thing in everyone&#39;s face.</p>

<p>Disclaimer..I am not under the impression that this is the case..but it is within the realm of possibilities no matter how slight.</p>

Humanity&#39;s free will is at stake and Elon does appear to be trying to help prevent that.</p>

<p>That in itself was a troubling issue to me. Should have included it in post.</p>

<p>Any company that thinks it&#39;s a wise move overall for humanity  for one company to have a majority control over this technology is the last company that should be entrusted with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html">This is the best (long) article about how when AI hits singularity</a> we&#39;ll be comparatively as smart as dust mites and that the shock of realization will actually kill people from brain aneurysms, shock or heart attacks. I&#39;d highly suggest taking the time to read it. You will not be sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I dismissed the idea of out of control A.I. as far fetched, but then I realized that if the only thing it was programmed for was survival, it might be able to evolve to spread itself around in various ways. I doubt that it would ever come to the conclusion that it should harm people on purpose, but it could just spread so much that it infects and messes up a bunch of computer systems kind of like a strong virus.</p>
