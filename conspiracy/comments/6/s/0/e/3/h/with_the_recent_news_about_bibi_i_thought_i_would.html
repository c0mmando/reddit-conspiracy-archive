<p><em>&quot;The main thing is to hit them (Arabs) hard. Not just one blow, but so many blows... that they think everything is crumbling.&quot;</em><br/>
<strong>Read: Kill their babies and bomb their schools and infrastructure so that they&#39;re reliant on neighbors and foreign support to even sustain daily life, followed by a brutal propaganda campaign throughout the Western world, where news groups are led by the same film companies in Hollywood.</strong> </p>

<p><em>&quot;But hold on Bibi, what will you do when the world says &#39;How come you&#39;re conquering again?&#39;<br/>

<strong>Read: We will spread propaganda that shows us as the hero to the average idiot, when in reality we are the murderers and anyone who&#39;s educated enough will know it.</strong> </p>

<p><em>&quot;Especially America, I know what America is. America can easily be controlled. Moved to the right direction.... They won&#39;t get in our way.... I was not afraid to clash with Clinton. I wasn&#39;t afraid to clash with the UN.&quot;</em><br/>
<strong>Read: Our propaganda works well already and nobody can stop us. If the US and UN can&#39;t stop us, nobody can.</strong>  </p>

<p>I seriously suggest everyone to read the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion if you haven&#39;t already. Anyone who denies what the Zionist oligarchy is doing around the world is just plain stupid, in denial, or is straight up lying to uphold the agenda.</p>

<p>When the book of Revelations was written, Christianity had no ties to Judaism. Judaism and Christianity were mortal enemies; killing each other. So, why would the resurrected Jesus even mention the Jews and their synagogue?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s a misunderstanding/misapplication/manipulation of the correct translation e,g</p>

<p>By the time of Jesus the word Edom or Edomite had been translated by Greek and Latin into Ioudaios and Iudaeus meaning a Judean or person living in Judea. The original King James version of the Bible, 1611, translated Idumaean-Judean into Iewes. It wasn&#39;t until the revised editions of the King James Bible, that the word Jew appeared.The word Jew does not mean Israel or Israelite! We must conclude therefore that the first &quot;Jews&quot; were Canaanite-Edomite-Hittite. It is certain, according to the Bible, that Jews are not Israel.</p>

<p>So you can see what happened, &#39;Iewes&#39; had a similar pronunciation  to &#39;Jew&#39;, and overtime they got muddled up. The Jews today are in fact Edomites.</p>

<p>Jews (as in the modern use of the word) throughout history have married into other nationalities/cultures to gain influence or $$$$$. So for the majority of people it becomes near impossible to tell which one is a Jew. </p>

<p>Jesus is effectively telling people that &#39;he knows of those who say are white/asian/black but are not, but are of the meeting place (synagogue) of satan&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Oden Yinon wrote an article in the 80s describing plans for Israeli territorial expansion to <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6918a74f83f9a57859ab872b0a386fba-c">this</a> extent.<br/>
Most of what the article spoke about happened or happened in a different context, but what really stopped the plan in it&#39;s tracks was Israel losing the War to Hezbollah in 2006, which is why they created ISIS in order to weaken Syria, Hezbollah, and Iran, and meanwhile creating a vacuum that distracts all of their enemies.<br/>
Ever wonder why ISIS and al Qaeda never attack Israel? It&#39;s because they&#39;re supported by them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the goal eventually just like any conquering nation. Problem is limitations. They can&#39;t get too many enemies. It&#39;s funny that Israel is the only socially acceptable invading nation in the past 50 or so years. When Saddam tried to invade, he went from having the whole world&#39;s support to being hated by everybody. Nowadays the only other countries that are &quot;allowed&quot; to invade are Saudi Arabia, Israel, and African warlords. hmmmm :thinking:   </p>
