       You know most conspiracies are widely considered fake, right? Just because the majority thinks something doesn't necessarily make it true, hence we have this forum. Not saying I believe the protocols to be true or false, but I have read them, and there are some interesting parallels to what we actually have today.

       I only use the kjv 1611 because it's the original and most accurate bible translated from Hebrew to Greek to English. But either way, the prophesy is still clear as day, those imposters over in Israel, those Ashkenazi converts, claim they're from the tribe of Judah!

       I use the 1611 historical (First printing) and not the crap modern KJV, and I also use earlier versions then that. I also get old dictionaries which confirm the real original meaning of the word 'Jew' and it was a contraction for Judah.

       Why would the "resurrected Jesus" condemn Jews as being a part of the Synagogue of Satan when he had already condemned all Jews (while he was on Earth) that refused to believe in him? --Matthew 23:37--
      </p>
      <p>
       When the book of Revelations was written, Christianity had no ties to Judaism. Judaism and Christianity were mortal enemies; killing each other. So, why would the resurrected Jesus even mention the Jews and their synagogue?

       Because it's a misunderstanding/misapplication/manipulation of the correct translation e,g
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time of Jesus the word Edom or Edomite had been translated by Greek and Latin into Ioudaios and Iudaeus meaning a Judean or person living in Judea. The original King James version of the Bible, 1611, translated Idumaean-Judean into Iewes. It wasn't until the revised editions of the King James Bible, that the word Jew appeared.The word Jew does not mean Israel or Israelite! We must conclude therefore that the first "Jews" were Canaanite-Edomite-Hittite. It is certain, according to the Bible, that Jews are not Israel.

       So you can see what happened, 'Iewes' had a similar pronunciation  to 'Jew', and overtime they got muddled up. The Jews today are in fact Edomites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews (as in the modern use of the word) throughout history have married into other nationalities/cultures to gain influence or $$$$$. So for the majority of people it becomes near impossible to tell which one is a Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus is effectively telling people that 'he knows of those who say are white/asian/black but are not, but are of the meeting place (synagogue) of satan'

       Correct. The messages to the seven churches were meant for actual churches of the day (60 - 90 AD). This passage was a message for the church at Smyrna.

       Because the book of revelation is mostly about future prophesies that's why.
The Bible is a book about the past, present and  future of the 12 tribes of the Hebrew Israelites. 
The Bible is a living book.

       You're right.
       <br/>
       For those who don't know what you're talking about, Oden Yinon wrote an article in the 80s describing plans for Israeli territorial expansion to
       <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6918a74f83f9a57859ab872b0a386fba-c">
        this
       </a>
       extent.
       <br/>
       Most of what the article spoke about happened or happened in a different context, but what really stopped the plan in it's tracks was Israel losing the War to Hezbollah in 2006, which is why they created ISIS in order to weaken Syria, Hezbollah, and Iran, and meanwhile creating a vacuum that distracts all of their enemies.
       <br/>
       Ever wonder why ISIS and al Qaeda never attack Israel? It's because they're supported by them.

       unless of course nowadays its simply a desert and the map ive linked covers more oil land etc.

       That's the goal eventually just like any conquering nation. Problem is limitations. They can't get too many enemies. It's funny that Israel is the only socially acceptable invading nation in the past 50 or so years. When Saddam tried to invade, he went from having the whole world's support to being hated by everybody. Nowadays the only other countries that are "allowed" to invade are Saudi Arabia, Israel, and African warlords. hmmmm :thinking:

       You know most conspiracies are widely considered fake, right? Just because the majority thinks something doesn't necessarily make it true, hence we have this forum. Not saying I believe the protocols to be true or false, but I have read them, and there are some interesting parallels to what we actually have today.
