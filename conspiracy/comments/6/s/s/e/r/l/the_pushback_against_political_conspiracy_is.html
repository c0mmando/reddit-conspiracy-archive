       Most conspiracies involve the U.S government. JFK for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others are what? Vaccinations? You know those things millions of people get and only a few may have problems but no disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens may not be possible without "inter-dimensional gates". Which I personally believe to be bullshit. Space is too big and chances are we have not ever been visited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are financial conspiracies which end up being political as well, Soros.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are people who claim everything is rigged. If that's true then Donald is the chosen president by the powers that be and 63 million people did not vote for him. Seems like a cop out bullshit. Just proclaim it all rigged I am the ultimate conspiracy theorist I don't need to think beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious why they want to shut up political conspiracy, to make sure their side is not talked about anymore. r/politics is about posting articles with the headline exact. Here you can actually put what makes it a conspiracy in the title.

       Aliens idk basically the only reason i believe we may have been visited is because the former minister of defense for Canada went on record saying they are here and he wasnt a nobody.  He united the army and navy etc in Canada. Hes pretty well known here.

       <em>

       hunted down and suicided, or thrown in prison, for whistleblowing on the biggest strategic and philosophical secret in the history of humanity?

        On November 4, 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the Milky Way. 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars.

       Doing so could be seen as shill accusations and potentially result in a ban. Naming names is not important, there will be more. The "unwavering faith" angle is concerning beyond what comes off as obvious shilling, it's where the cult feeling comes from. If it was users wildly embracing everything done by Obama, Clinton, Sanders, against all logic and typical conspiracy concerns, I would say that same thing.

       , I don't think it should be a removable offense since saying someone refuses to criticize Trump should not be viewed as the same as calling them a shill or troll, and overall should be viewed as an observation and not an attack since there is nothing inherently negative about the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since the rules clearly say first violation will result in a warning and I've never had an offense, I shouldn't be banned even if it is considered rule breaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The names you would never see say a bad word about Trump are peyote and MAGAbolt. Those are just the two off the top of my head.

       Yeah I get all that, it shouldn't be a big deal. Yet I see frequent baiting attempts, users trying to get others to come out and call them shills, so personally id rather stay out of the accusation game.

       I understand completely, which is why I named names so you didn't have to take the risk. However, for the reasons I outlined, there
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be any risk at all since unquestionably supporting Trump doesn't necessarily equate to shilling or trolling. But again, I understood why you rather not.

       I think it's that you expect everyone to hate him like you do, because most other places online love that shit so you may have got used to it? I'm just saying, anytime I see someone say anything non-negative about Trump's presidency, they always have to say "not a Trump fan, but" blah blah, or else everyone jumps on them for being a Trump fan, as if that in and of itself were an insult. When we first were introduced as a nation to our candidates for presidency, wanna know what I thought about Trump? I hated him, so bad. I watched Jon Oliver at night and I giggled at the Drumpfs. It was when my hatred of him was made mandatory, and all of the media lost their minds attacking him, and Hillary's tendrils were all over all of it, that I started posting on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       instead of reddit as a whole. It's so forced, and it's being forced by our worst, truest enemy, the one so hidden that many can't even name one of its heads, and so, to me, if they tell me to do something like
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       lives depend on it, I'm gonna do the opposite. That doesn't mean I'm gonna love Trump, far from it, but it does mean that I'm gonna question anyone who looks at me like
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       stupid for not carrying a societally-mandated hate.

       What, your hatred? I dunno, call it whatever you'd like, it's cool with me. But nah, you're just looking for those super Trump supporters to be there. There's a bunch of shilly stuff on the new feed as well, but for some reason we do ok with sorting them out by the time they reach the main page, and judging by comments, the problem I see the most is the really ass holish "what conspiracy??!?!" people who only allow you to talk negatively about certain topics. I welcome any real people, even if they really really love HRC and Podesta as people. So long as they're real, I'm down.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the fakeness that I hate, the forced narratives. Like there were these two threads back two days ago, and one was about Trump shills, the other about Podesta/Brock shills. The top comment in the Trump shill one was talking shit about Trump. The top comment in the Podesta one was "yeah go research the 1st amendment like a good little boy, then come back and share with the class", super douchey like. It's shit like that. I don't know how you don't see it, but so long as it exists, there's gonna be people fighting hard against it, but stop calling us Trump supporters plz. We're anti censorship/pro free information is all.

       So many people that see so much hate in the world but won't even see it in themselves.. It's really weird, to me.

       Shills started the whole "What's the conspiracy?!?!" thing back during pedogate. I will forever hate it because of that.

       I don't think anyone is infallible.

       I don't think that you should begrudge any person for their opinion, like in anything. Shocking, I know. It's really contrary to a lot of people's feelings on how the world should be. I think we lock our problems in stone when we say that certain opinions are wrong. It just hides things, it doesn't resolve them.

       Wow dude.. You're right, they want to stop us from looking into political conspiracy, buuut. Like, ok:
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccinations have some crazy science to back up the claim that they're dangerous af, perhaps intentionally so
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens don't need inter-dimensional gates, or FTL craft, or whatever, what's neat about them is the evidence of their having been here, not our ability to imagine how, though that is fun as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rigged game can still be won by someone that the house does not want to win; I'm sure you can think of examples from your favorite movies or stories. It's certainly not a cop-out to be discerning.

       Yeah I get all that, it shouldn't be a big deal. Yet I see frequent baiting attempts, users trying to get others to come out and call them shills, so personally id rather stay out of the accusation game.

       I understand completely, which is why I named names so you didn't have to take the risk. However, for the reasons I outlined, there
       <em>
