       My niece got a job and she doesn't need a bank account. the card will  let her take money out of the ATM

       Yes, there was a case about this in PA where the judge ruled that these cards were not a valid form of payment as they are neither cash nor check. So they went beyond just not being legal because of the fees to not being legal at all, at least in PA.

       If they're not legal in PA. How can they still be issued somewhere else...or is it that they need to be sued again citing this case?

       A state court in PA would only have precedent in PA. And really, it would have to be a ruling by the PA Supreme Court to be binding across the whole state.

       Nitpick: it would only
       <em>
        be

       precedent in PA. And its precedential status doesn't really matter, it's that the PA court would only have jurisdiction in PA.

       Like I said, that's just nitpicking. You're right on as to the substance, as you know.

       The same people who cribbed that fiat currency is backed by nothing are now buying currencies that reside on a computer network in the form of 1s and 0s.

       While bitcoin may be better than fiat currency because it cannot be
       <em>
        directly

       manipulated by govts, it's still disconcerting. Maybe that's why I like real estate: I can visit a pile of bricks and cement, and even get money from people who want to live there.

       That to me is as silly as saying one never really owns a company, just a small ownership of it (stocks), or, one never really holds currency (just an IOU from the Treasury), one never owns a car because they can't stop paying auto insurance on it, and on it goes.

       Usually these things charge the poor people to use the cards, which means they violate minimum wage laws, because their net pay is less than their nominal pay of minimum wage.

       A lot of places charge people to cash a check. A check is also not paper money.

       I'm wondering if the niece chose the card instead of check or direct deposit. I've been given the option in the past but never took it.

       The way it generally works is if you keep a balance of less than $1000 on the card, it will charge you a monthly fee, usually like 4.95 or something like that. At least this is how the greendot-based ones operate.

        Answer: No. Your employer can’t require you to receive your wages on a payroll card. Your employer has to offer you at least one alternative.

       Most likely the niece was offered the choice of check or card and chose the card because she didn't have a bank account. Her choice. Not exactly a conspiracy on McDonald's part.

       I worked at Olive Garden for a few days in 2011 (there were numerous reasons why I didn't last longer, I'd been a server for years and OG, not sure if its the whole company or just that one in particular, was weirdly cultish and creepy) and this was how employees were paid. I imagine tips were still cash, but the actual paycheck was on a debit card.

       I know some larger restaurant companies are doing this. I was told while working for one it is to save costs on mail paper checks an since everything is digital now all w-2's an tax information is available on a workplace portal. You can opt out of the employee card itself and just have them direct deposit to your own bank account.

       Used to manage a mcdonalds when this started. It's because a lot of their workers didn't have bank accounts themselves. To use the card mcdonalds gave them, they had to pay fees. Basically, any time they wanted to use their money, they had to pay whoever was handling the transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       After explaining the concept of "company money" to some of the people under me, I literally walked them to the bank across the street after their shift to get them a bank account.

       Great point. You choose between two evils basically. And either way the banks get their shekels from you somehow. Can he employees request cash?

       They already pay taxes and other shit taken out of the check, then to cash it is another tax from the bank. This shit is ridiculous.

       Read the list of fees and understand the fees can change at any time. Those cards are basically a scam, but it's scary to think they could be the new norm.
      </p>

       In Canada, most of the do-it-yourself checkouts at the grocery store only accept card (no cash). Now there is a tap card for even faster buying. Cash is being warred against, and the speed of the war is increasing.

       It's cheaper to process card payments vs cash deposits in banks. It's now cheaper for businesses to go all in on cards.

       Here is a good article on the subject,
       <a href="http://money.visualcapitalist.com/global-war-on-cash/">

       I could probably find a way better article, that focuses on how the war on cash will ensure the survival of the central bank, which are as much the enemy of common people as Cancer, but I will wait and see if and how much you try-hard to defend them.

       Re my OP. I'm referring to the swift manor they are making/pushing businesses to adjust to cashless systems. It's a simple and effective plan. I estimate that cash will be hard to find in 5 years. The game changer will be mobile to mobile NFC payments, once that takes off and the general public use it, we can wave goodbye to money!

       Yeah, it's common now. I hate having money in the bank. I feel uneasy knowing it can be devalued at the press of a button!
      </p>
      <p>
       I spend everything, and money I do save I put into properties. It's not secure, but at least it's a real item. Sure, the housing market can drop, but it still has a
       <em>
        value
       </em>
       of being shelter. So it will always be worth something. £200,000 in my account today will not be able to buy the same goods in 2 years time... that's wrong on a lot of levels. Where as a house will always be a house...

Atleast this was the case for me. I'm going to assume it's the same for her seeing as my friend worked at McDonald's and had direct deposit to Chase.

       When I worked at Gamestop it was the same. But normally it's an option for people that don't have bank accounts. You can apply for direct deposit. Or paper checks if you want to wait a week for it to come in the mail.

       that doesn't mean it's ok, these things charge you for transactions over a certain number a month, as well as other fees that eat into low paying workers wages quickly. Some states have already had legislation aimed at stopping this practice, not sure if any passed though. This is a cost saving device used by large corporations to offload the payroll fees they would normally pay to their own workers......

       Something similar happened at my school with student loan disbursements about 5 years ago. They signed everyone up for debit cards with a bank and charged us fees to withdraw and fees for not maintaining a high enough account balance. They claimed we would "get our disbursements faster" so it is worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say, the bank was skimming fees off the top of student loan disbursements and everyone was pissed.

       Starbucks does this too.  She can most likely set up direct deposit into her own checking, but as soon as she was hired she was probably told  if she didnt give them her  dda and routing number by a certain date pY is issued on the card.  Have her set up autopay right away.

       They do this because a lot of low income people don't have bank accounts. I have managed to evade this bullshit because my mother got me a bank account when I was like 8 or 16 or something. If you don't have a bank account, you're losing like 10% to whatever institution cashes it for you. And then a lot of banks will fine you if you don't keep a minimum balance in your account, which is typically hard to do if you work fast food or retail.

       The way around it is to sign up for direct deposit. Many companies these days give you your check on a debit card if you aren't willing to sign up for direct deposit. A way for them not to issue any paper checks.

       You can choose direct deposit to your own account to avoid all the fees and such associated with use of their cards. They don't "force" you to use the pay card. Pretty much everywhere from Walmart to Whole Foods does it this way.

       Sure, if they value my non-repeat customer status.
I went there for a muffin and coffee on my way out of town and probably won't be back to a McDonald's for another 10 years.
