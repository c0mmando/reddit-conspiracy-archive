        I've been meaning to pen this post (or one like it) for some time now. A number of contributing factors means that time is more or less now.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So here it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        High Level Insider
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       About a Year  ago, I came across the [High Level Insider question threads](https:/reddit.com
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnio2/high_level_insider_an_explanation_of_the_anon_and/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/5rnio2/high_level_insider_an_explanation_of_the_anon_and/
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <em>
        Further detail on HLI are provided across the post if you've not heard of the anon before and don't wish to read the sessions right now
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after that, with the help of some likeminded users, we discovered the anon had a number of Alts on Reddit- one was a legacy account, the other still active. What I'm about to impart is the sum total of my experience with the anon to date. If you check back through my post history you'll see my earlier (and rather more crude) efforts to raise awareness on this. I'm doing so now as the anons most recent incarnation seems to have disappeared , so I feel less prickish about subjecting them to the inevitable deluge of enquiries that will ensue after this post. But I can't overstate how valuable the insights gained from studying the anon have been for me. The narrative they present and solutions they offer are both novel and inspiring. It's the Internet so of course it's impossible to know if they're speaking with 100% veracity, but without taking the time to adequately look into this, writing it off as a committed LARP, seems more naive than taking it as gospel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only ask that you read with an open mind and take the time to perform the due diligence that should be a requisite for any prudent investigator.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        tl:dr
       </strong>
       - Things aren't as fucked as they appear, it seems as if we might have a shot.*

      <hr/>
      <p>
       u/freedomintensifies -
       <strong>
        The Legacy Account
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll start with the legacy account that we discovered after the question sessions on /pol. If I recall correctly it was a combination of certain phrases, the subjects discussed, and the (trademark) clarity when discussing the complex &amp; novel, that led us to conclude the anon was one and the same. I followed up with a jocular, but respectful message asking if they'd confirm our suspicions - didn't think they'd respond. But they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find further reading on a diverse array of topics across their comment history, but the comment I feel most elucidates the connection would be their breakdown on September 11 and then introducing the Space Elevator:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       u/closedsociety404 - We then came across an account bearing the hallmarks we'd come to recognise - novel narratives driven by singular facts, varied and deep competencies, eschews the concealment of knowledge etc
Here's an example, (but again you'll find a wealth of further reading across their comment history):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         At the very top of the occult pyramid, yes. However, many people who are involved legitimately do think they are worshipping some entity. For example, there are a lot of myths about aliens creating human life. Often these involve tales that these people came from the Sirius star system or some such. Scientologists have similar stories like planet Xenu. Mormons too.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where did this stuff come from? Well, suppose you know how to navigate by the stars. If you are devoting mental energy to this, other people will pick up on it. How to conceal your true mental intentions then? Wrap it in very emotionally riveting tales. You look up to Sirius to navigate but you conceal what you are thinking / doing with some fantastical tale about this is where your creator originated or whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
         Enough of this and in some sense it becomes "real." People who are exposed to the linguistic keys that lead them to the emotions tied up with Sirius can be overcome with the emotions that swirled around it in the past. It can feel like some other worldly entity moving through you and some people get wrapped up in this with legitimate belief.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sirius rises in July in Egypt / Israel / Iraq and overlaps with the sun. So the heat of the summer seems to be associated with Sirius - there is less light and heat when Sirius is away from the sun. Can naively seem like a life giver (growing the crops) literally and figuratively (origination myths).
        </p>
        <p>
         But then you find out that there were active trade routes from America to the Middle East thousands of years ago, that the stars were important for navigation. So you know why the true purpose of Sirius needed to be guarded. And you know better than to think Sirius has anything to do with it getting warm during the summer now - just a cosmic coincidence.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as people being in the know, all of that varies tremendously. You can get a small sense of that just from this point. The more you know, the fewer of their myths you can believe. But, if you are fed a lot of semi-truths it is very easy to feel enlightened yet be more lost than when you started.

       After studying the entirety of their comments, cross referencing with the (then active) sessions on /pol, as well as with each other ,we concluded that the OPs of the excerpts  were indeed alts of theHigh Level Insider anon. In my time as a lurker I've  seen FBIAnon, HiddenHand etc all ply their trade, with varying degrees of success, but ultimately the verdict was: Larp. The racists and infancy prevent me from engaging too much, but I ride it out as /pol occasionally throws up some  gems. High Level Insider was different from the off. When have you ever seen the maesltrom of shitpost hell be tamed by a guy speaking about

Answers within seconds of the question being posed, with sessions frequently lasting for hours. I checked details like disparity in time between answer &amp; question, cross referencing  from google, to address the possibility the anon might be fraudulent - but nothing. (I invite you to do the same, perhaps with a different methodology to detect foul play.)

       is the only book HLI recommends to any who enquire on further reading outside of the sessions. Coherence in consciousness (
       <em>
        The Holy Spirit
       </em>
       )  is a genuine phenomena and one exploited by the elite against the masses.

         Consciousness" is a skill wherein people create a mental world analogous to the physical world in order to attempt hypothetical solutions to novel problems. This skill was developed over thousands of years, following the collapse of an earlier system for responding creatively to unique stimuli. This system, dubbed "the Bicameral Mind" involved the right hemisphere of the brain generating solutions and communicating them to the acting left hemisphere using language as the encoding system. As a result, Bicameral individuals "heard" these solutions spoken to them as if from an outside force.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Hypnosis, schizophrenia, possession, are all vestiges of the Bicameral Mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power structures that exist in society today are the result of secret societies that formed as the conscious emerged. Initially meant to preserve awareness, the societies became corrupted by the idea that knowledge should be hidden to rule over the masses. The various factions in Mystery Babylon stem from this central premise:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Dark priests - these people believe that beauty emerges from contrast. Evil is necessary for good kind of thing. They are not necessarily pro-evil, but pro-contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
         Kings - generally less intelligent than dark priests. Much of their code of behavior derives from a belief in the past that you need a slave class to sustain an enlightened class.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meritocracy - they believe in something similar to democratic rule, but only with votes for the initiated, because the masses are hopeless.
        </p>
       </blockquote>

        Christianity
       </strong>
       Three follow an esoteric form of Christianity, HLI repeatedly stresses the need for symbolic, not literal, interpretation as the means to truth.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Christianity itself was our primary attack on the empire. We work primarily through ideas that are compelling enough to spread on their own merit, what you might call meme magic
The elements of the trinity are distinct and each independently meaningful. The holy spirit refers to our collective consciousness. God is real and Jesus was an inspired prophet. Christianity is correct to emphasize the virginal birth and sacrifice. What the virgin birth means is that he rose to consciousness outside of the mystery schools, which laid bare the fraud of them concealing knowledge. His entire life was lived as a sacrifice spreading the truth to ensure that connection to higher consciousness / the godhead would never be the exclusive possession of the corrupted schools.
        </p>

         You have one in the space elevator alone. You have seen the rise of the middle class in one nation threaten the global order to such an extreme degree that the CIA went on a killing spree across America, rounding up others into institutions, restricting job access, and so on. They are on the brink of failure from only modest economic success. It isn't so hard to see that unleashing decades of unused technological progress would not only end them but leave you with a radically better world.
And, all of this is verifiable. Crack open some textbooks, learn the physical principles, and see for yourself.

       If this is a LARP, its superior to any I'm familiar with by some orders of magnitude. There are subs and 'Fan/LARP' (VOTL,High_Level_Insider) accounts that have sprung up since the anons appearance, all of whom are actively researching and engaging with the source material.

       Earlier this year, I penned a post on
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/let_me_explain_exactly_how_trump_is_a_rothschild/">
        Trump
       </a>
       , and another on
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/60ufas/cmv_tulsi_gabbard_is_a_member_of_cfr_council_on/?st=J6556H01&amp;sh=b3b82271">
        Tulsi Gabbard
       </a>
       both composed using breadcrumbs given to me by the anon. Both equally necessary to help break the spell bogus politicians have over this community.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61hfyi/comment/dffawob?st=J63REDXT&amp;sh=a0180b18">
        I noticed the anon was active on the thread during the week it was stickied.
       </a>
       Again, I can't attest to the 100% veracity of the anon, more so that I've found deception easier to identify when viewed with the aid of their insights. If this equates to truth, then so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They seem to have disappeared for now, both on Reddit and /pol, but the comment histories and archived threads are there still available to view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll finish with sharing one of the last messages I received from the anon. I'd just read
       <em>
        Fingerprints of the Gods
       </em>
       and wanted the hear their thoughts on the technological capacity of ancient people. The matter of fact manner they discuss truly reality-expanding concepts, never ceases to amaze me. Hopefully it's piqued your interest to the extent you're curious enough to look into this for yourself.

         To me the most interesting thing about the ancients is that they had the time to stop and think carefully.
Really there isn't much remarkable about what we find other than the carefulness of it all. We could talk about how the pyramids were constructed, no magic need be invoked. It isn't the overwhelming task that it appears.
The truly neat thing about the pyramids is not their scale, it is their precision. That requires high mathematical competency which is very abstract thought. Mathematicians are some of the most careful, precise, considered thinkers on the planet. &gt;&gt;That these existed in droves necessary to do all the astrological work tells you about a society that was living luxurious lives by modern standards.
Even in a "first world" nation like America, half the population is in dire poverty. I think something like 2/3 are paycheck to paycheck, 80% can't handle an emergency bill of modest size - $5-10k.
You think about these things compared to ancient civilizations that had th time to sit around and work out thousands and thousands of years of astronomical calculations, design temples all around the world, build them, etc., and they seem rich beyond comprehension for most - at least in terms of free time. Who has the free time to build a boat and sail around the world today, never mind the years of designing a temple to build on the other side of the planet, etc.?
All that stuff about the pyramid being some magical power plant or some such is a distraction. Really what it tells you about is the magic of a society organized towards the interest of the people, the magic of living in harmony, and so on. 
The pyramid is remarkable only in the sense of the remarkable fall man has experienced in the intervening period, not so much a remarkable achievement in itself.

       You'll like the symbology of the cross methinks:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Yes. Jesus didn't die on the literal wooden cross. He was taken down alive, nursed to health by Mary, and left the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dying on the cross is a metaphor. He stood at the intersection of the elite and the masses, the crossroad and remained there.

       The crux of the response I eventually received was: these things take time. It's only with the advent of the modern age and the resultant power shift that came with advanced technology, were they able to overtly oppose the regime as opposed to i the covert meme-based warfare they traditionally employ. Across the sessions I get the impression that we're very much in the midst of a major transition. Events like the procession of the equinox have seemingly converged by chance with the transition of reserve currency status... 
the parasitic cycle of fiat, gold, fiat, gold is due to turn again, as the cabal moves from one host to another. In the absence of any targeted intervention, of Biblical proportions, the American people will be saddled with a debt that can never be paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems as good enough time as any for the revolutionaries to begin their stand.

       I get that.  I normally am not superstitious but 2024 is the year of the second US solar eclipse too, as it is 7 years from now.  lots of weird conflicting prophecies around how end times go, but the 7 years of tribulation caught my attention.

       Hamilton was a humanist who favored US soveriegnty over foreign dependence.
      </p>
      <p>
       His 'Federalist Papers' put him on the side of the Ionians, Athenians and Spartans in the Pelopanesian war. If I remember correctly, I believe he renounced Aristotle as the Platonic heir, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of what I have read of his politics (and what little of his economics can be found in the 'Federalist Papers'), Hamilton seems in line with the ambitions of Three, an American Republic free of the Old World influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Washington, it's confusing. He was a mason of high rank,
       <em>
        in order
       </em>
       to keep tabs on their movements and spread rumors of the Illuminati penetrating their ranks. As  HLI intimated, the compartmentalization of Mason knowledge allowed for confusion--  fostered by agents of Humanity such as Franklin and Washington-- to run rampant.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Hamilton was
       <strong>
        FOR
       </strong>
       the new republic. Washington (and Franklin) were in bed with the enemy to pull the world over their eyes.

       I have never read anything of his referencing the Rothchild's, but I do believe he was
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       a central bank, a Nation bank. Also, I was wrong in the comment above. He never mentioned Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamilton wrote series of reports for George Washington's administration and for congress starting in 1790. He was the predecessor of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay">
        Henry Clay
       </a>
       , whose economics inspired Lincoln.

        IOU's the government handed out durring the war
       </a>
       . He demanded the government establish good credit with it's citizens by paying-- with interest-- the face value of the IOU's. Some corruption ensued, but take the good with the bad, I guess. He used

       was to be a part-private, part-state run bank. If I understand this correctly, the federal government would pay back the IOU in full, or you could put it in the National Bank at $0.75 on the dollar and watch it grow. Playa's Choice, if you will...

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_on_Manufactures">

       is the one which inspired the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_School_(economics">
        American System
       </a>
       ). Essentially, Hamilton wanted to tax the bejeezus out of foreign imports to boost domestic production. ** Warning:: Gross Over-simplification ahead!**
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        His argument:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       America has every resource we need plus 3 million souls who need. Let us harvest here, produce here and sell here. The rest of the world will come to us. The Dutch and Portuguese will pay to sell to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Their Argument:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the northern states produce! The southern states are farmers! We rely on foreign imports for the luxuries of civilized life!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamilton's viewpoint is stated plainly in the
       <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/18/pg18-images.html">
        Federalist Paper 11
       </a>
       where he writes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Suppose, for instance, we had a government in America, capable of excluding Great Britain (with whom we have at present no treaty of commerce) from all our ports; what would be the probable operation of this step upon her politics? Would it not enable us to negotiate, with the fairest prospect of success, for commercial privileges of the most valuable and extensive kind, in the dominions of that kingdom? When these questions have been asked, upon other occasions, they have received a plausible, but not a solid or satisfactory answer. It has been said that prohibitions on our part would produce no change in the system of Britain, because she could prosecute her trade with us through the medium of the Dutch, who would be her immediate customers and paymasters for those articles which were wanted for the supply of our markets. But would not her navigation be materially injured by the loss of the important advantage of being her own carrier in that trade? Would not the principal part of its profits be intercepted by the Dutch, as a compensation for their agency and risk? Would not the mere circumstance of freight occasion a considerable deduction? Would not so circuitous an intercourse facilitate the competitions of other nations, by enhancing the price of British commodities in our markets, and by transferring to other hands the management of this interesting branch of the British commerce?
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       <strong>
        TL:DR: Accepting our outrageous tariffs will be the cheapest course of action for a foreign manufacturer.

       Thank you for your well articulated viewpoint. I will have to research further and reconsider my opinion. Admittedly, my opinion is more based on second hand interpretation than source material. Most "conspiracy" authors are not fans of Hamilton due to him being a proponent of a central bank. That is one reason why he is celebrated by modern day elites, hell even Broadway.

       Spiritual truth. They see the Bible as being almost entirely an allegory, and I don't. At the very heart of the issue, I don't believe anyone will go to heaven without repenting and accepting the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for their sins, and they explicitly reject this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't to say I think they're bad people. They fight the Mystery Babylon system, which is literally God's work, and they are not opposed to literal interpretations of Christianity: "whoever is not against us is for us." (Mark 9:40).
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of their members, like
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull">
        Raymond Lull
       </a>
       , have taken Christianity pretty literally. Even Hamilton was pretty clearly a conventional Christian, and Washington probably was as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, I would argue that the mystery religions they follow originally came from Enoch in the Old Testament, who created the Sacred Sciences. The original message was corrupted by the time of the Nephilim, who ruled over the whole earth by these mystery cults. After the flood, Nimrod used mystery religions to again enslave humanity, so God confused their languages and scattered humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to both the good and evil mystery schools, Freemasonry came from Enoch before the flood. Where HLI gets mixed up is that he doesn't realize there are two traditions. To my knowledge, author Gary Wayne is the only one to snap to this: in Genesis there is a good Enoch (line of Seth) and an evil Enoch (line of Cain).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the story goes, God sent the flood to destroy humanity because he hated them. And the Tower of Babel is about hiding knowledge. What HLI doesn't know is that he's getting a corrupted reading of this story, which is prevalent in virtually every single religion besides the writings of Genesis, and probably the Book of Enoch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real story is that the evil mystery schools like the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73J4VSOFn-c">
        Brotherhood of the Snake
       </a>
       which were founded by literal human-demon hybrids, had enslaved humanity before the Flood. After the Flood, Nimrod did the same thing (literally a One World Government), so God confused their languages and scattered humanity so they could be free of control by the mystery schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was because the original story was corrupted that God called Abraham out of Babylon. And unlike the other religions, he wrote everything down, so it couldn't be corrupted by the Mystery Babylon system (only misinterpreted).
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets even crazier when you consider the possibility that God entrusted these nations to angels who had not fallen in the 1st situation (note Daniel's references to the demon "Prince of Persia" and Paul's saying in Ephesians that our battle is against territorial demonic forces), but fell after being given responsibility over nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it reaches its craziest when you recall that HLI referred to his group as "The Watchers." Same name given to the angels that fell in Genesis 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Book of Enoch also tells us that many of these fallen angels are repentant, and want to fix the mess they created. Recall also the Greek legends of the Titans (Giants, Nephilim) overthrowing the true God, but then being overthrown themselves by Zeus, who saw how evil they had become.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to some of the question sessions, Three has been fighting Mystery Babylon since about 800 BC. We've been fighting it since well before the Flood.

       Is there any particular reason you see the overt narrative culminating in Pauline and following church doctrines being divinely inspired as opposed to every other narrative transmission which becomes warped over time?
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to lean toward agreeing with Christ that right action is right doctrine rather than the inverse which tend to be the teachings of "the Church". Paul I think struggled with this due probably to his religious background and audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to teachings of Christ I find it very difficult to adopt the modern literalist narrative that requires a confession of faith to secure a place in the afterlife. His teaching is not a universalist one, but he very clearly in multiple instances makes it clear that his path is one of right action not right belief. What's beautiful about this is how it works whether the Kingdom of God is meant to be made manifest now or to be experienced in fullness after death.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, if you're loving God and your neighbor I embrace you as a brother and hope to bring the Kingdom in with you. Just curious as to how you got to the place you are and if it's something I hadn't considered.

       For one thing, Paul was brutally killed for these beliefs, like the rest of the disciples. Sheeple will die for made-up religions, but not the founders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, there is fulfilled prophecy. Look into the dozens of prophecies about Jesus that he fulfilled, or look into how Bible prophecy is being fulfilled right now, like how Israel was regathered from the 4 corners of the earth back to their land.

       The most important part is actually repentance; turning from a life of evil. Imagine if God let unrepentant evil psychopaths into Heaven; it wouldn't be Heaven at all. You simply can't have a positive afterlife without a prerequisite of repentance.

       Sure, this is why the book of James is in the Bible, to counteract libertinism ("sin it up, Jesus already paid the tab!"). Real repentance will lead to good deeds.

       Yes. The followers of Jesus Christ. The true followers of the Hebrew religion. Those that listened to Noah's preaching after the flood. Those that followed Enoch's preaching before the flood.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're interested, there's a really interesting book called "Eternity in their Hearts" that shows that many religions are essentially telling the same thing if you go back far enough. This belief was
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praeparatio_Evangelica">
        widespread
       </a>
       in the early church, but modern Christians teach that anything except Evangelical Christianity is terrible and must be denounced.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, many pagan religions believe in an ultimate creator God, which is exactly what the Bible teaches: lots of lesser spiritual powers (angels) and an ultimate one (God).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's likely that many of these old religions were founded by Enoch and Noah, and subsequently corrupted.

       Based on what? It sounds like you're presuming he's inaccurate because he reaches a different conclusion than you do. Bill Cooper quoted extensively from Evangelical sources in exposing the mysteries.

       Like who? If you have a source that you think does a better job presenting things, then by all means share it. But otherwise, it sounds like you haven't taken the time to evaluate whether Gary Wayne's argument is supported by the evidence or not.

       From everything I've seen by Gary Wayne, he doesn't believe in aliens, but rather spiritual beings. I've heard him say repeatedly that the alien line is not something he believes in, but it originated from one of the Gnostic secret societies. The same societies the push the mysticism narratives, like elves and fairies.

       He believes in his research and believes in his book, nothing wrong with that. He's not wrong in that the mystery schools are deceivers. As for Gary, I don't know. I'll see what I think after I finish his book. He seems like a genuine good person though.

       This is, at best, a probabilistic argument, and a terribly weak one (people who believe in biblical literalism are so prone to make mistakes that you should be suspicious of this person on the sole basis that they believe in literalism). If he were a flat earther, you might have an argument, but we're talking about finer points of theology, not something you can debunk in 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're saying biblical literalism, is, per se, grounds for being suspicious of someone's views, then I would say you need to read The Origin of Consciousness again. This is essentially shutting off one's consciousness to the claims of someone outside of your tribe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every argument that a person makes should be evaluated on its own merit, including whether literal interpretation of the Bible is correct. Have you actually investigated that personally, or are you assuming High Level Insider is correct about that matter without confirming it yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really care if you disagree with me, I just want you to make a strong argument for whatever position you take.

       In the last question session, an anon asked if TPTB tried to kill God, to which he replied something like "yes, but they were unsuccessful". My thoughts are that he didn't mean it literally, but that they have tried to steer people away from God and more towards scientism, big bang theory, etc.

       That sounds about right. Turn science into pure empiricism, reasoning from the observations, rather than operating from a sense of a deeper truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a very basic level, most societies didn't even consider the Creator to be rational, so why would you go looking for natural laws that you can understand? In other words, most societies are philosophically incapable of science.

       As far as ClosedSociety404, I have a less cynical view of the Council for National Policy. It's not great, but it's nothing like its counterpart, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other establishment policy groups.

       Compare also to the groups it largely replaced; Le Circle, John Birch Society, American Security Council, etc. All created by Freemasons and Knights of Malta, totally subverted from the beginning..

       I have had discussions with others about how we live apart from our neighbors.  It really weakens us.  If we relearn to share and work together, then money is not necessary.   The Babylonian money magick becomes useless.

       If it's a LARP, it's still profound and offers plenty of food for thought in its own right. And if it's legit...

       It has the ring of truth for me. I think people can't get past the fact that it's 4chan, the home of LARPers - but IMO, if Jesus were alive today he may well be dropping truth bombs on 4chan.

        The ability to speak freely is not something most people have encountered in person and it really shocks them to bump into it. I've repeatedly struck up conversations with strangers and had them tell me I am going to save the world within five minutes. That's an overblown analysis on their part, but it speaks to the intensity with which an encounter with freedom resonates with people.

       You're not wrong. Some sources I trust say the groundwork that is being laid from 2000-2020 has a HUGE effect on what happens in 2324. And that's why Major Ed Dames couldn't remote view beyond 2012. It was "off limits".

       I've read a lot of his stuff on 4chan back when it was happening and you can tell the account is extremely intelligent and well read. But at times throws out some really insane claims like the one i mentioned above. What do you make of this?

       I've compared pictures of both of them and can definitely see how it's possible. Same facial structure, same hands, etc. I wouldn't put it past the CIA to be able to change some parts of his face like the lips and nose. I'm sure all of it was filmed in a propaganda studio somewhere as well.

       Does HLI have an explanation for the appearances of Osama circa 2000-2001 as being frail, sickly and requiring a dialysis machine? Any thoughts on the theory that Osama died in 2001?

       Even before I came across HLI, I wasn't buying the official version © 
I'd read reports at the time (4/5yesrs ago) that he died of natural causes - after seeing The 'changing faces of bin laden', CNN meeting him in his cavehideout, the 3 tapes they found in his compound... I'm more inclined to believe he died then and his likeness was used to perpetuate the War on Terror©
      </p>
      <p>
       Bin laden was always a cia creature. As was Obama. The theory posed, far fetched thought it might be, is definitely worth considering. Run a search for "obama is Osama" on YouTube ... HLI isn't the only one beating that drum..

       Also the name Barack Obama is eerily similar to Osama Bin Laden. Since it was a character Obama played, he got dibs on 'killing' him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you watch some comparison videos, it almost seems obvious that they're the same person, post 2001. It's also obvious that they're not the same Bin Ladens pre and post 9/11. It's pretty wild how much fuckery is afoot with this.

       In your understanding, was Osama bin Laden ever a real person? Or was it a CIA role played by two different actors, one who passed away in December 2001 and one who became president in 2008?

       In my understanding, OBL was a real person from Saudi Arabia, who was a CIA asset during the Afghanistan vs Russia war. He was trained and funded by the CIA as a proxy army against Russia, like we've seen them do many times. He was a well known figure after that, so when he died in 2001, it was a perfect opportunity to use his likeness to blame on 9/11. Bill Cooper even called this almost a year before 9/11, and specifically mentioned OBL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, less work would have to be done to get a bogeyman known by people from the middle East and the west. Since Barack Obama was a CIA asset too, along with his family, and the fact that he was fluent in Arabic, dark skinned, intelligent, etc, he was a perfect candidate to play the role. So perfect, that barely anyone knows it, and people mock you if you even suggest it.

       Total misrepresentation of the argument. In addition, you fail to factor in the body of supporting leads visible in the comments. You're in this sub so a baseline of cynicism must be present in you .. which is good. Why don't you turn that to actual examination of the material you've been linked(from multiple sources) and conduct a more thorough research than "lol bs larp".

       Not really. if you can tell me what part i misrepresented i'd be happy to approach it. But you didn't and you can't because that was literally his argument. Sure, i can go down searching thousands of links through the sources he just provided. But when it starts off with " oh he looked like him...and went to school with berzinski... and worked at a place where cia worked before... not much of an argument.

       your first mistake is assuming i don't think they'd do it. I think they'd do it and more. but you have no argument or source and likely since you're pumping this HLI guy so hard, you're more likely to be a part of (or at least fallen victim to) more larping or bogus conspiracy shit like the flat earth campaign that is just to muddy the waters and make conspiracies seem that much more retarded. I mean if you are so damn sure about it, at least like HLI is who you seem to believe...then it shouldn't be hard to source something that isn't tangential proof full of holes.

       This is where you lose me I'm afraid. I'm no 'flattie' - although your false equivalence doesn't go unnoticed. For the reasons I listed, I don't think the idea Obama at one point played Osama as part of his CIA role, isn't so outlandish a theory. You're aware that the vast majority of the public would greet your notion that Obama was CIA, with the same incredulousness as you have for the theory he played Obama?

       Discounting an idea as madness without doing the diligence necessary to offer an informed opinion, is materially similar to accepting it as gospel.

       i don't think it's too outlandish either. I even am inclined to believe it more than i think you believe i am. I just don't blindly assert things because they sound good or because i want them to be true.

       "Discounting an idea as madness without doing the diligence necessary to offer an informed opinion, is materially indistinguishable to accepting it as gospel."

      <p>
       i agree. which is what many seem do be doing with the HLI guy. Which is why i pointed out the Osama thing because it's just taken as gospel the way he asserts it without any reasoning or proof. So since you support that guy you are essentially condoning that type action that you detest. That was my point really. i don't really want to argue about the facts. i ask for sources for my own research not to argue at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       And i get you're more analyzing what he says and you don't have to defend him on every issue. that's fair. I was interested in him and he lost me at that point. I asked him for clarification but was never given any.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Most people are less aware that Obama / Osama is related to the book of Revelation, that his name translates as Lightning from Heaven in Aramaic (when Jesus said I perceived satan as lightning from heaven what he spoke would be very, very close to "barack o bama"), etc. There are many many layers to the deception as is usually the case.

       Great post! If I I could upvote this a thousand times, I would. The HLI changed me for the better. After reading his AMA'S, as well as the Julian Jaynes book, I have a vastly different mindset. Whether he's a LARP or not is irrelevant to me at this point, but I think he's the real deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there was an account here going by his moniker that recommended another book to me, which was Manly P Hall's 'The Secret Teaching Of All Ages'. It has given me alot of insight into secret societies, what they do, how they're formed, societies within societies, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope he does another question session soon. He said they'd continue for years to come, but has been on a hiatus since early March.

       I think Manly P Hall was a front writer for their organization, sort of like Shakespeare (which Hall discussed very directly). They often refer people to "Secret Teachings" today.

       And whats interesting is that Hall became a 33 degree freemason of the Scottish rite, 47 years after he wrote that book. Alot of people assume he was a freemason before he wrote the book, myself included.

       Agreed. Also, people underestimate just how much secret societies and mystery schools have shaped history and pulled the strings. I mean the first 2 paragraphs in the book go on to bash non thinkers and people who don't have a burning desire to know the answers of the universe.

       I've mentioned it before, but has anyone looked into Rudolf Steiner? He seemed to be coming from a similar place as HLI, in that he felt that occult knowledge should be shared with the masses, and dedicated his life to doing just that.

       I don't think he was one of them, not a leader at least, but he was involved with a bunch of people that were. That's roughly the period where Golden Dawn ripped off everything the light occultists had done (Crowley calling his Satanism "The Illuminati," etc.)

       That's how psyops are generated. They coopt some truths (so that it sounds similar, or familiar to you) and mix in lots of lies, leaving you even more confused. Do not lose much time with this kind of stuff.

       Awesome post, going to read into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm too cynical to believe that anything can be done about the current state of the world; save for massive natural disasters, thermonuclear war, or worldwide civilian uprisings.  I feel that people promising hope and an answer in times like these, with seemingly inside information, are either mocking us from on high or are trying to lul us into a false sense of security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully after I go through all of the links I will have changed my mind.

       The thought has crossed my mind, in fact you'll see me express something very similar in the latter part of the post..
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if they're not?
      </p>
      <p>
       We're hardwired to believe in "what ifs?".  And for good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I go over the lake, what then?
What if we land a man on the moon, how would we go about doing that?
What if we built a space Elevator?
      </p>
      <p>
       "What ifs" represent  potential to create opportunity where a gulf formerly existed. Is that not our god given power to create? TPTB have done an admirable job in convincing us we lack the ability to create ourselves and must depend on them for sustenance. What Three and HLI represent is really just a return to the essence of what makes us human- the ability to shape our world in accordance with our desires. As opposed to shaping the world
       <em>
        in accordance with their desires
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no logical reason for TPTB to execute such a ploy in a time when they can whittle down presidential candidates to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. There seems little value of running a psyop on the livestocks to give them the illusion of free range living.

       Excellent post. I was also skeptical at first, but I'm thinking that this guy is legit. I'd love to see another question session; although he mentioned in one post that they were accelerating their plans so he may be busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what sold me on him was the fact that he presented solutions. "Run surveillance on elites. Acquire agency. Break the Overton window. Build a space elevator."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read the Jaynes book but I'm still trying to pin down what he means when he talks about consciousness. The closest definition he gave was to be able to perceive the interconnectedness of minds. Have you or anybody else made any progress on how to achieve it?  I've found some leads that I'd be happy to share but I'm curious to see if anybody else has learned anything.

       The Space Elevator is a means to launch payloads into  LEO (lower earth orbit) at a fraction of the cost than we can presently. At this altitude, space based solar arrays can be constructed to harness luminosity unencumbered by the barrier of atmosphere. The resultant energy acquired would be enough to increase the throughput of the world, increasing global GDP (wealth) and opening the way for future initiatives. My further education isn't  grounded science based, but a cursory glance at history will tell you how many of earths problems are remedied with the introduction of more energy. Cheaper, more abundant, clean energy is the transformative quality that will propel mankind into a new age.  I'm not aware of any symbology mentioned alongside the Space Elevator, that's not to say there isn't however.

       Not far-fetched to me. While I may disagree with some of the details, the high-level concepts in the original post match exactly what I've come to believe. Such as:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There are many competing factions, and even more alliances between various factions.
       </li>
       <li>
        In space, there are at least 4 factions and various alliances.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some want new tech to come out to help people, some don't.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some want more knowledge of spirituality and our real human history to come out, some don't.
       </li>
       <li>
        There is a high level elite class that does want to make sure humans are easily manipulated slaves.
       </li>
       <li>
        Almost all factions are part of the CIA, FBI, NSA and global elite to some extent, but the CIA is one of the worst, and the most against individual freedom.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some factions are trying to reduce over population to save humanity as a race. They mean well for the group, but this requires a lot of individual people to die though.
       </li>
       <li>
        There is help from ETs but the help is via sharing knowledge, and otherwise very minimal.
       </li>
      </ol>

       I'm going to disappoint you. No way that HLI would agree with your opinion as he repeatedly asserted that there are no extraterrestrials around the Earth. Time to grow up from alien fairy tales.

       Wait what? I'm not talking about what "High level insider" has mentioned in the  title said. I'm talking about all sources that I've seen. My comment was to see how much in my comment correlates with what High Level Insider said.

       You said matches exactly, which isn't true. I'm assuming it was just the wrong word choice though, but just wanted to make sure people reading didn't mistake it with HLI.

       You're right.  I tend to add additional details to my posts just for FYI, but sometimes I don't make that clear. I was trying to list what I had heard from other sources, much (but not all) that matched what HLI said.

       I can see this in your reply. Fair comment and my bad if I came across more abrasive than I'd have liked. Your methodology is sound, hopefully the material provided offers some new avenues to employ it on.
