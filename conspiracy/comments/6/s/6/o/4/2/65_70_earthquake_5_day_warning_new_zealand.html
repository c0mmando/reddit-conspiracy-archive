<p><em>Solarwinds will be choppy next 48hrs</em></p>

<p>There is currently an active alpha sunspot 2670 holding on the earth facing disk. Followed by two tiny coronal holes. </p>

<p>Id argue activity in New Zealand. With lesser Chance for an Indonesian swarm.</p>

<p>So <strong>6.5 warning newzealand.</strong> Next 5 days. </p>

<p><em>there is not that much solar output lately</em> so <em>Me Thinking:</em>* a 7.0 magnitude quake is the relevant &#39;high&#39; point this week. (in terms of EQ&#39;s and seismic episodes). 
<em>I don&#39;t expect anything larger then a 6.8 really...</em></p>

<p><em>Also expect mild to moderate aftershocks in relevant areas exhibiting their current seismic swarms.</em></p>

<p>Keep at it man, for the good of humanity. I don&#39;t know how, but I want to help. I&#39;m not a coder at all, so I can&#39;t help in that way, but I can write (I&#39;m content writer for an extra buck while I&#39;m studying).

<p>I upvoted it.  But he didn&#39;t answer it, he guessed.  He has all the data necessary to tell us his accuracy rate but doesn&#39;t.  He doesn&#39;t have a problem working with numbers so why he doesn&#39;t tell us is strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His theory makes no sense to me. A quote from a previous discussion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No I am saying that solarwinds are absorbed by the earths magnetic field lines, which deposits an electric discharge on the earths core. This absorved energy leads to heat buildup and causes volcanic chambers and magma to react violently.</p>

<p>I simply feel that the solar events stimulate the largest subsurface changes which lead to many slips. Some earthquakes are not caused by solar interferences. Yet many are...
I view solar activity as a &#39;pitch indicator&#39; giving us a unique perspective on addressing the estimated values of seismic thrust a known seismic region will experience...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, this makes zero sense right? When related to frictional forces being overcome as the primary source of earthquakes, how dafuq does the process mentioned in the previous quotes promote earthquakes? At deeper levels, surely this theory does not explain dehydration and embrittlement of subducting slabs ect.? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not necessarily. One doesnt have to rule out the other. </p>

<p>Convection <em>may</em> not be the only cause of shifting tecronic plates. There&#39;s no scientifically disproven reason why the sun&#39;s immense magnetic fields, or outbursts of said fields couldn&#39;t interact with the floating tectonic plates, perhaps by increasing electric charge or inducing piezo-electric tension into rocks. the release of this tension as a solar event passes could cause very small movements that could increase (but certainly not guarantee) the chance of an earthquake. </p>

<p>hell, even the moons gravity <em>must</em> have some pull on the plates and thus play an albeit small role in it all. </p>

<p>The geomagnetic relationship is certainly worth exploring and could also help explain erratic animal behaviour prior to large quakes, odd lights in the sky before and during large quakes. </p>

<p>As a (claimed) geologist, you know that there is much more complex mechanisms involved than your simplified explanation of plate tectonics given above. </p>

<p>We have a proven, working mechanism that explains earthquakes, if you propose an alternate model, then that requires extraordinary proof. </p>

<p>That does not mean however, that you can simple make the blanket statement that the theory <em>is</em> wrong simply because the accepted theory more-or-less, kind-of explains how things mostly-sometimes work.</p>

<p>What about &quot;The relative importance of each of these factors and their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.&quot; says to you &#39;it is a settled theory that plate tectonics can be explained entirely by a terrestrial conduction model.

    <div class="md"><p>This does not need to be an alternative theory - it can form part of the existing understanding.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve named two perfect examples of theories which, while explaining the <em>vast</em> majority of how a system works, do allow room for other influences to be at play. the inclusion of these influences would not rule the underlying theory incorrect, but instead make it more correct.</p>

<p>there is room in the theory of plate tectonics/earthquake origins for other forces to be at play.</p>

<p>why not just let this theory be explored rather than attacking it? No one is asking you to do any work. Instead you chime in and try and write it all off for no one&#39;s benefit. </p>

<p>ParsingSol and his solar/earthquake correlation theory could turn out to be dead wrong, but at least he&#39;s exploring possibilities and trying to better the world. You are not.</p>

<p>While, as you noted, there are internal forces that happen without the sun, you have to take into consideration external effects of the sun and the distortion of earth&#39;s  magnetic field.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel I gotta defend OP here. This dude puts in full time work to try and develop this theory of his, and there is compelling evidence that he is on to something. Conventional earthquake theory knows jack shit so I have no idea where you and the guys below have gotten on a high horse. My guess is you are a pair of $cience worshipers who read headlines not articles and don&#39;t realise the inconsistencies in most conventional geological and astronomical theories. How much do you and the geology bro know about the sun? Or the magnetic influences on our planet from it? I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say it&#39;s almost nothing. And do you know how I know that? Because we as a species don&#39;t know that yet. We have a bunch of satellites collecting data from the sun that are constantly at odds with what our conventional theories should be predicting. Our scientific knowledge of the sun is nowhere near complete and the ignorance behind your attitudes is astounding. This guy is doing real analysis in an area that is still poorly understood, on his own money and time, by recording data and finding correlations. You know, the way science is supposed to work. And he does it all in the face of snide people like yourself who have seemed to completely forgotten what the process of science actually is. Homo ignoramus indeed.  </p>

<p>I feel like this could be extended to most of the people who come to r/conspiracy specifically to trumpet the ideas from their elementary school textbooks.

    <div class="md"><p>If anything were likely to happen, I&#39;d suggest it most likely to occur between midnight the 10th (12PM NZST) and 6pm the 11th (6AM 12/08 NZST) - Based on what I understand of this theory and the NOAA WSA-ENLIL Solar Wind Prediction</p>

<p>Still have no idea how New Zealand is chosen as the area of interest though. Surely localised monitoring would be the only practicable method to determine location with any believable level of accuracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a probability game. Like sequencing. Ladt constant series vs pitch of solar intrusion. The reason I feel a comparative model would stand a better accuracy is due to memory. 
We have say 10 million recorded sequences and series. </p>

<p>Each large event should be considered a &#39;hit&#39;. The earthquakes that follow by sequence need to be ruled out in order and scale. 
Monitoring the scale of a geomagnetic scale would be intensity vs duration = event magnitude / sequence.</p>

<p>Past hits likely represent future events in terms of sequencing live solar data.</p>

<p>I.e. If you see an incoming solar wind stream at 750km/s. For x duration. That is likely to match with x sequence. 
Then compare that to current sequence. <em>(on earth).</em></p>

<p>Sequence vs probability. </p>

<p>So hugest quakes first. Use these as actuator&#39;s. Then follow past data. Do say 9.0 - 4.5&#39;s. And then use the triangulation of bz componet data, noaa solar wond predictive data and usgs records to monitor an active event.
Then run that with a mapping software and determine probable warning to assessed areas of concern. (Based on seismic events in recorded history).</p>

<p>The thing is I am likely to miss. But there was a 6.5 today in china. The intensity really is trackable. Thats the main argument. Yet probability and locations is going to take some level of technical achievement, that I myself don&#39;t factually harbor.
I suck at doing what I am proposing this does. But it does seem interesting to wonder. </p>
