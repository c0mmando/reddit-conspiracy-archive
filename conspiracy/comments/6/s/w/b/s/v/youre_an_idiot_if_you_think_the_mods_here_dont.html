       I can answer that, it happened a few months before the end of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to post here a good bit and then the election ramped up, Trump was the winner of the Republicans National Convention and Hillary the winner of the DNC and things went to complete hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an inarguable shift in not only what was heavily pushed in this sub but also what political bias it took. This sub has always delved into politics but never before had it been so inarguably pushing one side over another. It was subtle at first and less noticed but as time went on it only got worse and worse. If you supported one side or another you were a shill (no matter of side) if you didn't believe either side you were a shill in disguise. There was no winning. No matter where you stood you were inevitably going to be accused of supporting one side or another. You couldn't say a single thing about either candidate without being accused of supporting whichever side you weren't referring to at the time. If you called out Hillary you supported Trump. Called out Trump you supported Hillary. Those in the middle we're not allowed to stay in such, at least according to people's perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election split people so much that everyone felt on edge. Which led to finger pointing on all sides. Tie that in with the rise of bot accounts and clear agendas on display across all of Reddit and people were only split more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't help that Reddit as a whole has allowed covert advertisements. Which led to a group of people already keeping an eye on all things and taking a questionative stance towards things to be even more speculative of what they were seeing because what many considered relevant post were getting removed/brigaded/down voted etc. Because no matter the side if you saw a post they didn't support your side it was an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub, simply put, splintered because people who all agreed they were for conspiracies started playing political games. Believing their side was right and the other wrong. Not everyone, but enough. And many saw this for what it was the clear cut establishment attempting to pit two sides against one another. Sadly those that have attempted to call this out were ignored. And now it may be to late.

       Which side do you believe is being pushed?  Because it looks to me like both sides are shilling pretty regularly, and that the mods are generally pretty fair (and I've had a number of run ins with them).  I would say that the CA shills are more regular but less obnoxious, while SB tends to focus on brigading top threads.  Both sides are equally annoying, but how do you filter out shills without catching a whole bunch of genuine users in the process?
      </p>

       Personally, I think Trump is an awful president, and I'm really glad he beat Hillary.

       Honestly, at first I thought "just get rid of the shills, goddamnit", but after talking with some mods about it I realized that I didn't have any better ideas about how to identify them properly.  Personally, I think that some of them are glaringly obvious from browsing comment histories, and that human judgment is the best way, but that just opens up a whole new can of worms with accusations of bias.
      </p>

       My personal suggestion is to put every single post in contest mode for 24 hours.

       My view on banning shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're going to accidentally ban some innocent people.  Don't fret because they will appeal in modmail and it's usually pretty easy to tell if you made a mistake based on how they react to being banned.  There is another layer of mistakes that can be made there also.  Regardless, just ban them and if it seem you made a mistake it's really easy to unban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest mode is a bandaid IMHO.  It might help some wounds heal but if it's too deep then you're just creating an environment for infection to fester.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said CA shills were less obnoxious. I tend to agree but I'm curious if for similar reasons or not.  I think they are less obnoxious because they tend to blend in better here, they tend to also subscribe to other Conspiracy Theories that aren't Trump related.  I think SB is only really interested in ONE theory so they tend to shit on just about everything else that is frequently discussed here.
      </p>
      <p>
       To simplify things CA will consider (or act like it) most conspiracies except for one, obviously that one being that Trump is some flavor of bad.  Whereas SB will only consider one Conspiracy and they make fine Conspiracy theorists as long as the subject is Trump, anything else and the obnoxious vibe is dominant.

       I'm not sure that's a fair litmus test, because I don't know what your criteria are when you say 'based on how they react to being banned'.  I mean, in the past I've been known to lose my temper and be a real dick to mods when I thought I was being unfairly treated.  So, I stayed banned in those subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still not sure what the objection to contest mode is.  It's obviously not a cure all, but it's certainly better than what is currently happening, and it seems like it would discourage, if not prevent brigadeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On CA vs SB shills:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that a lot of the people who get identified at CA shills are actually just genuine Trump supporters.  They're definitely pushing a narrative and trying to shape the dialogue, but I can't help but feel that it's more organic.  They may be (are) stupid as shit, but they're pushing a narrative based on belief, rather than because somebody is paying them.  I'm sure there are some number of actual paid CA shills, but they blend into the general idiocy associated with
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       , and don't really stand out most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think ShareBlue feels different because they simply don't have that kind of organic support.  Not too many people actually like or trust the DNC.  When SB is brigading it's more of a 'here's our latest talking point, obey!' feel.  SB's approach to shilling seems to be more of the 'shock and awe' variety.  They push obvious bullshit (WaPo at the top of conspiracy?) articles to the top fast, hijack the top comment chain, and absolutely smash anybody who questions the narrative with downvotes (or sometimes multiple accounts just start attacking comments simultaneously).  They also tend to hijack the top comment on every political thread and shit all over conspiracies in general.  I just find that style of shillery much more annoying, although I'm not sure I would say it's objectively worse.

       I regularly ban people from Conspiracy for shitting on the Conspiracy subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of people here who speak out against my political ideology who aren't at any risk of being banned.  If people of certain political ideologies are incapable of speaking out without breaking the rules here, it's not my problem and I'm not going to avoid banning them because of your false perception of why they got banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny really, we have people come in here calling everyone retarded or trumptards or cucks or libtards and as soon as they get banned they all scream at us in modmail
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I WAS BANNED FOR MY POLITICAL VIEWS!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sorry bud but your blatant disregard for our rules is why you got banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been accused of being cucked, of being "trumptarded" (probably am) of being a Jew of being a Nazi of being a shareblue employee and even a Cambridge Analytica employee.  All because some hyperventilating user got banned because they refuse the follow the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably dont even understand what my political views are.  I'm not a republican, I do Support Trump but probably not for the reasons you would assume.  I would support single payer health care, but not while we have mass immigration and shitty boarder controls.  I don't support war but I'm also not a pacifist.  All these issues aren't as black and white as the 2 party fraud would like you to believe.  I'm not anti-abortion but I think there needs to be reasonable limits on it.

      <p>
       I'd like to see a list of all the comments you've deleted and banned. And I think this sub would be interested to see it too. Then we could have a fair open conversation about it - otherwise it's just your word.  For example, I've seen you delete innocuous comments that said "
       <a href="/u/Flytape">
        /u/Flytape
       </a>
       banned me". In the spirit of Moderator Transparency, I'm sure you'd agree that would help address many concerns.

       Also, please answer the following two questions to the best of your knowledge:

      <p>
       1) Do you or the other mods makes notes about specific users in a private wiki, IRC, or chat service?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Have you or the other mods privately discussed using this sub to set up honeypots for the purpose of collecting or tracking user IP addresses?

       We aren't required to give people warnings and council them endlessly before we ban them so I usually reserve warnings for people who have demonstrated that they CAN have a civil conversation/debate in the past but are maybe just having a bad day.

        “We conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it’s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,” a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Palmer Luckey—founder of Oculus—is funding a Trump group that circulates dirty memes about Hillary Clinton.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I’ve got plenty of money,” Luckey added. “Money is not my issue. I thought it sounded like a real jolly good time.”
       </p>
       <p>
        But in another post written under Luckey’s Reddit pseudonym, there are echoes of a similar tech billionaire, Peter Thiel [
        <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/donald-trump-has-made-peter-thiel-immensely-powerful">
         "Notorious tech billionaire Peter Thiel, a key Trump transition advisor"
        </a>
        <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/who-is-peter-thiel-rnc-2016-trump/492380/">
         "express doubts over whether it was a good idea to give women the right to vote"
        </a>
        ]
       </p>
       <p>
        Before becoming directly involved in the process, Luckey met the man who would serve as the liaison for the nascent political action group, and provide legitimacy to a Reddit audience for later donations without having to reveal Luckey’s identity: Breitbart tech editor and Trump booster Milo Yiannopoulos. The bleached-blonde political agitator is most notable for being permanently suspended from Twitter for harassment after a series of abusive messages to actress Leslie Jones.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luckey first met the alt-right provocateur in Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, before Yiannopoulos began working on a charity to send white men to college. The Daily Beast later reported that the scholarship fund had resulted in zero financial distribution of the donations that had been made directly to Yiannopoulos’s bank account.
       </p>
       <p>
        “I came into touch with them over Facebook,” Luckey said of the band of trolls behind the operation. “It went along the lines of ‘hey, I have a bunch of money. I would love to see more of this stuff.’”

       i dunno, police give out info on how to identify suspicious persons
      </p>
      <p>
       im just wondering if your Shill Identifying Methodology is something like: Liberal Viewpoint/disbelieve pizzagate/believe seth rich was not murdered by dnc assasins: Shareblue shill
      </p>
      <p>
       Love trump/loves pizzagate/knows seth was murdered by dnc assassins: CA Shill
      </p>
      <p>
       the way I identify what I think are shills (since it cannot be confirmed I have no idea how accurate I am) is people who do things like question facts in a manner that is meant to make it seem like the facts are wrong, but they arent interested in the answer, because they keep doing the same thing elsewhere in the thread and other threads
      </p>
      <p>
       Or they post a ton of articles all with one viewpoint/agenda, especially ones with questionable sources or with titles that are meant mislead in the title. This is effective for shills because a lot of people just scan the title, take what they want, and move on without reading the content or digging deeper
      </p>
      <p>
       or if i notice talking points with similar verbiage coming from different accounts, or a ton of repetition in posts
      </p>
      <p>
       examples like "putin is a saint" or re: wikileaks "100% track record" followed by stat of how many documents without a single fake. when multiple accounts do this in multiple contexts i get suspicious

       Both sides. But no longer in equal measure. And I agree Trump is a terrifyingly innefective president, but Hillary was not an option.

       The lesser of two equals is a shitty option, but just because you made it doesn't mean it make either side any less evil. And that's the point a lot of people want to forget or ignore and would rather play partisan political games.

       Exactly.  Trump is awful.  He's a self serving sociopath who only ran for president to stroke his own ego and improve his brand value (and get rid of a lot of those pesky regulations that hurt his profits).  Hillary is a career criminal of the worst sort, an absolute psychopath who is willing to commit any crime for profit, and murder casually when inconvenienced.

       I think it's funny how we had the same premises but reached a different conclusion. I would much rather accept a slimy career politician than a man child. Both are awful, but I could at least be sure Hillary knew what she was doing. With Trump, it feels like his decision is shaped far too much by those around him while also being erratic. All of us here want political change of some sort. I just feel we are better off with the status quo until someone comes around that aims to change it for the better. We shouldn't aim for change for the sake of change. We need change in the right direction and I didn't feel Trump brought that.

       Trump is bad.  Hillary is monstrous, and also a prepared deep state puppet.  At the very least Trump has caused the US deep state some headaches (although I believe they've whipped him into line now).

       I am all for disrupting the deep state, but headaches for the sake of headaches? That doesn't serve a purpose. It only works to undermine our efforts because it lumps us conspiracy theorists in with the right more often than not, which generally results in us being painted in a negative light.

       The deep state is the number one enemy of the people.  They have turned America from a great nation respected around the world into a cryptofascist police state that is utterly dependent on constant war to survive.  Trump is a bad president, but the deep state are monsters.

       The 2012 election cycle had several shill take over attempts but the real community of the sub was united in it's view. The shills were very obvious. Now it's hard to tell a shill from a regular partisan hack. The community seems to have forgotten of the one world government agenda we were all so strongly united against.

       They were told who to hate and to ignore all else. Soros and the other deep state groups give them a feeling of inclusion. Society would be better off if we were all ICP Juggalos. At least then we wouldn't care what other thought of us and fell into group think so easily.

       No. The CRT/shareblue are the most active and blatant on this sub period. People can cray T_D all they want but it is not reality. You can not show me at least 2 daily front page posts that are praising Donald Trump. Discussing a mysterious murder and satanic child sex rings are not T_D, but a very common thing on conspiracy subs even when no politics is involved.

       Should you be surprised when a conspiracy sub researches and discusses corrupt politicians? No.. The difference is when teams of people and MSN are making up false accusations against a politician in an attempt to sway public opinion solely because the one world government politician lost.

       no, but that isnt what im talking about. We get front page posts that are attacks on whoever trump is attacking whenever he is attacking them, even if they were ignored before. T_d is way more obvious about this, but it finds its way here. Fire mcmasters on twitter was a good one, and we had a couple of weird sock puppet types doing their routing in that thread

       I appreciate your point, but you destroyed yourself with hypocrisy in the last paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have taken your stance and you believe your side is right and the other side is wrong. You are practicing distorted skepticism. Obviously, what you say has been true for decades. But the truly skeptical position would allow for the possibility that the current administration is trying to force the establishment to change for the better. For that matter, any new administration
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be different from previous administrations. We don't have to consider this likely, but the skeptical position would allow for the possibility that change could happen from within. People who say otherwise are scared to see what would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to understand the true source of the division in this subreddit, it's important to give sufficient attention to the people that just won't let Trump supporters have their theories. They will respect our rules, and if they are wrong they will admit it in the end. Meanwhile, nobody can really prove that they are wrong. Maybe Trump knows more than he lets on and he has a plan to destroy the Deep State. Maybe you think that's ridiculous. Maybe it's okay to have people that think both things simultaneously in this subreddit. But it's not okay to continuously harass and bully people for their beliefs. It's not okay to show up in every thread with a topic you have a pet hatred for and bully and harass everyone. It's not okay to cry "The_Donald2.0" in every thread that dares to suggest that Trump is not a sexist idiot Cheeto.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can talk about Russian collusion. We can talk about Seth Rich. We can talk about time travel. We can talk about aliens. We can talk about Hillary Clinton covering up health problems. We can talk about Bigfoot. We can talk about anything. If you don't see a submission about topics that interest you, then get involved and change that. On the other hand, if you see topics that you only want to shit all over, kindly hide the post (downvote if you must) and move on with your day, or else deal with the fact that you look like a shill or an asshole.

       In principle it's not, but when it always appears in the context of the never ending quest to equate Donald Trump with the establishment, then yes it is taking a side. One can believe that Trump is in collusion with the establishment or one can believe that Trump is working against the establishment. But the skeptical position is to allow for either possibility or neither possibility until more information comes to light.

       See, you're placing your own beliefs here, and not mine. I never said anything outside of well known political standings (i.e. DNC &amp; RNC respectively) about either candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence I can, and will, continue to say regarding what I've previously stated I am not taking a side one way or another, simply stating facts. Ergo there's really no point debating this point, as I'm not going to say more then what I have regarding either candidate, if for no other reason than not adding to the divide in this sub, nor am I (and pardon the bluntness) not going to be bated into agreeing with someone else's personal views on any particular candidate one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nothing personal but I'll let my words speak for themselves not someone else's.

       I'm sorry, but sticking your head in the sand and believing you haven't chosen a side doesn't change reality. You say the reason we are caught up in political discussion is because the establishment wants us divided. That is a positive claim which carries the implication that neither side of the political argument is right and both are being manipulated. This is a belief, not a fact, and whether or not it is true can change over time. It is possible that there is a legitimate political debate happening now with serious implications for topics which conspiracy theorists have debated for decades, in which case it would be reasonable for us to discuss what is happening. But now that the Deep State conspiracy is finally coming out in the mainstream, we have you and others like you here to tell us we should hush up and stop playing politics.

       Okay, the only one pushing an agenda here is you. I simply was stating what happened to this sub. You are the one making this something it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, the establishment wanting to divide us is not a statement in question it is a fact. I'm not saying who that establishment is. I'm not, as you've insinuated saying "deep state" nor am I saying "Donald Trump's or Hillary Clinton". You can't see that as you've clearly drawn an idiological line here. That's fine. That's a fine stance to have, as long as you aren't allowing such to cloud your cognitive thinking and are allowing yourself to view all sides of a situation/statement/position equally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly though the above mentioned idiological stance is very rare if not outright impossible because embracing an idiological side, one way or another, is going to inadvertently lead to a bias, whether conciously or not, and in discussions as polarizing as some in this sub those bias are more than likely going to arise. And that my friend is why you won't see me taking a stance one way or another along this left/right divide in this here discussion. I'm not trying to push whatever stance I may have into my discussion here, as what I believe regarding such isn't important to a discussion of what happened to this sub and how it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's really all I have to say about all that.

       You're not being completely honest with yourself. You moved your goalpost a couple comments ago. Originally, you said that the reason the subreddit is in its current state is
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       the establishment wants to divide us. That implies that the establishment is successfully dividing us and that is the reason for the political bickering. That is not a fact, although you are now correct; it is a fact that the establishment
       <em>
        wants
       </em>
       to divide us, sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter. If you want to stop, that's fine, I've made my point, which is just to say that casting scorn upon others for taking a stance
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       taking a stance. If you really didn't want to take a stance on the left/right divide, then you wouldn't have any reason to bring it up in the first place.

       It is well known amongst aware people that the left-right paradigm is a construct designed specifically to foment what you guys are doing in this thread. There is no reason to believe Trump is above this, and to me it's pretty obvious that this was Trump's specific role from the get-go.

       Yeah, you don't need to lecture me about the left-right paradigm, I promise. I've been here for almost a decade discussing this very issue. You can go around casting your opinions and biases as obvious truths, but some people find it just as obvious that you are wrong. We are watching Trump destroy both parties as we knew them. He took over one entirely and is using it as a vehicle to expose deep criminal influence in the other. It's obvious why people are curious about what the guy is doing. No need to feign ignorance just because you disagree.

       It makes me sad that you spent ten years seeing the left-right paradigm for what it is only to put the wool back over your eyes. You don't think Trump made a deal with infowars and launched astroturfing campaigns on other conspiracy sites to garner the truther vote? As a group, people who are awake are having to be more discerning than ever because Trump really is playing 4D chess...with
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       . We lost a lot of aware people when conspiracy sites were flooded with pro-Trump rhetoric. People are much easier to manipulate that they suspected it seems.

       I think you stance
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be used to push a kind of false equivalency to bury misdeeds on one side or the other and encourage complacency. You have to recognize that it is entirely possible that one side really is worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a side. I have a lens that I view the world through. But I try to keep in mind that I could be wrong. And I don't shit on people for having an opinion. It's not really political for me. I've voted on both sides and sworn off both parties in disgust. But I thought Bernie was enough of an outsider and an honorable person so I supported him. That's when I feel I saw behind the curtain of deceit put up by the DNC. I was registered democrat but I felt there were things happening in Reddit and elsewhere that could not be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie supporters and trump supporters both brought enormous passion to supporting their candidate. Hillary supporters have always seemed to convey mostly hostility for people that support someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Trump has his own corruption. That would be a reasonable consideration. But I think it would be such a monumental difference in scale that it's hard to take it that seriously some times when I feel there are clear crimes being ignored on the other side. Plus Trump really is the conspiracy president. It would make sense to support a 9/11 questioning, vaccine skeptical politician.

       You're welcomed to have this stance this is fine. But as I've stated before I'm not pushing one side or another. Simply pointing out what happened. Support who you want. I'm not telling you not too. Just don't be surprised when others disagree with you, no matter what stance you take.

       Lol I'm sorry but it's blatantly obvious that Trump is not against the elite by now. I think it's safe to say that you can't become president unless you will enable tptb, which he is doing.

       That's your read on the situation, but it is still your personal bias. Maybe you are just an impatient little shit and this plan has multiple levels of obfuscation. Maybe it will happen next week. Maybe you are right. It doesn't matter. No matter how hard you laugh and shame others, it is still too early to say what is happening. Maybe both viewpoints should be able to coexist peacefully on this subreddit without one side ridiculing the other incessantly.

       It's easy to see they've been working hard at this for a while now here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a bit harder for them to find the justifications, but it seems they've now chosen their strawman: "politics".
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics and conspiracy are inextricably linked, if you remove poliyics this sub is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind the fact to begin with the justification for this kind of massive mod intervention is flimsy at best. All they've been able to offet is phony controversies as a pretext to institute more and more rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that doesn't even get to the shills and bots. It'll be time to jump from this burning ship very soon.

       I got downvoted to hell yesterday for pointing out that users in the T_D subreddit supporting Trump no matter what he does is not a conspiracy.
       <br/>
       So yea... it is the users aswell which are ruining the experience and it has really kicked into high gear recently. Very young accounts have flooded this subreddit just like the larger ones and it is not an organic influx as far as I can see.

       Non partisan here, even if Trump isn't exactly setting the world on fire (yet), it's still painfully obvious that the left are still fairly buttsore over the election. To deny this is silly, but there's no need.to be mean about it. I feel sorry for both sides of partisanship, i think both are failures.

       I actually think that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       occasionally hits on some real shit that the powers that be definitely don't want discussed because they have seen that this place can be an incubator for ideas that really take off and spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at where we have seen drastic media manipulation, both legacy and new media, it really is coming mostly from one side. Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit all have been massively manipulated and there is no reason to think this is any different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media manipulation by the DNC, and arguably the deep state as well, during the 2016 election made me a conspiracy theorist and went a long way toward turning me into a reluctant trump supporter. I used to dismiss pretty much all conspiracies out of hand and I used to go spend time downvoting every post on the_donald because I hated trump and hated the culture of that sub even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of the Republican Party in general and neocons can all go die but I really think what is happening on the left is monumental.

       If your sub hasn't been banned by Reddit. Then it's not as dangerous as you think it is. Try looking at the Donald. Which ended up getting shadowbanned by the admin's for being too effective

       I actually spend most of my time there now even though I got banned a long time ago for going against groupthink. You are right about being effective. They have a strong immune system against shills and trolls. The rest of Reddit gradually came under the pro Hillary propaganda so T_D is really the only place left that's relatively untouched by manipulation.

       Could this be because of my post trying to raise awareness for exposing the New World Order?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much nearly everyone agreed with that sentiment. It had 1.k upvotes and an immediate positive reaction from the community right upon posting. Was it aggressive? Potentially. But I felt I had to get a message across. I think what we're seeing is going to be a ban of all NWO or one world government related discussion, under the guise of it being "political discussion".
      </p>
      <p>
       I never called for anything or any topics to be banned in my OP. That would be unfair, I don't believe in banning any free discussion, however, I raised a good point that perhaps we should focus on the EVIDENCE BACKED conspiracies, and maybe stray away from the Pandora's box (Bigfoot, flat earth, conspiracies that have very little provable evidence to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Bigfoot or flat earth were real, there's WAY more evidence pointing to the existence of a group of Ruling elite who dominate the social and political realm. Why not allocate our resources and focus to where we can wake people up?

       I agree, it'd be disappointing to see politics get banned because everything is, to some extent, linked to politics. Discussions of 911 = Bush administration and his staff orchestrating things. Discussion of JFK assassination = CIA and motives of then-VP LBJ. Fed reserve = appointments of reserve chairman. And on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect the right of all political views to coexist on here, even ones that I think are utter nonsense and narrative-driven. If the topic is getting banned because of shills, then shills are the problem. Not the topic itself.

       Exactly. To me it seems like a reason to ban any discussion relating to exposing the corrupt governmental/social system, and the ruling class of elites we have on our fucking plate.

       There is at LEAST evidence to support a conspiracy to subvert our civil liberties while we waste away in the rigged economy.

       <a href="/u/magnora7">
        /u/magnora7

       did is a good idea.  He created his own sub and still contributes here.  I think every serious submitter here should do the same thing.  It's really hard to make something disappear when there are multiple copies.  Just a thought.  Keeping this network alive and connected is a good thing.  Until we have a distributed/transparent/secure alternative, this is our best place to be.

       I personally couldn't agree more. I think anyone who posts here should also crosspost to their own sub to filter it away from the swamp of nonsense content that is taking over more and more of this sub. In particular I think
       <a href="/u/polkadotgirl">
        /u/polkadotgirl
       </a>
       should do this.

       Although I guess on futher inspection, she did do exactly that 5 days ago! Right here:

      <p>
       Seriously, reddit is a gift because anyone can become their own media station. We should use it to its full power, and everyone who has ideas worth spreading should make their own sub, even if they just post once a month or whatever. It really doesn't matter, there's nothing to lose by starting a subreddit, and there's no harm in crossposting a good post around to a few different subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been kind of blown away by how much
       <a href="/r/magnora7">
        /r/magnora7
       </a>
       has grown, I never expected it to get beyond a few hundred people. But it's clear a lot of people on reddit who are branching out and looking for quality sources and quality subs. Those with quality things to say should do humanity a favor and put their ideas out there! To me this is how we grow as a species, by keeping important ideas alive and prominent in our minds.

       Depends on if you're trying to build a community-based subreddit (in which case a subject-based subreddit name might be better) or more a subreddit focused on the writing of one person is better. I've caught a lot of shit for "being narcissistic" by having a sub named after myself. I don't think there's anything wrong with names like
       <a href="/r/DeeperTruths">
        /r/DeeperTruths
       </a>
       or something like that, but I agree the "conspiracy" meme is overused. However a lot of people are trying to reclaim that word since it's become synonymous with nonsense, despite the fact it's a legal term that properly describes many situations around the world today.

       I just imagine people 100 years from now digging through the remains of this website. Having certain content in a separate subreddit means it won't get lost in the noise of larger subreddits. I think that's important for long-term preservation too.

       Somehow, something tells me that the current mod fiasco is being well received by the inorganic posters here. There seems to have been a great effort to turn conspiracy into a madhouse that nobody would trust for serious discussion. That alone is why I dont bother to post here.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I would say that the average lurker has lost all faith in this sub and its moderators. We stay away from any posts because we can see the hyperpartisanship and inauthentic discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I have more than a few ideas to help sort this mess out the truth is that change of a positive sort isnt likely to come around any time soon without some deep introspection by the mod team.

       Great post, there's no question the mods are bought and paid for by CA, the Koch Bros, etc. Shows you how far the right has fallen that they have to shill so heavily on subs like this; glad you're calling them out!

       Ah, I see, the stealth edit, very interesting! The Koch brothers have funded the GOP heavily before and after Trump, and you have to be pretty naive to think they wouldn't direct that funding to online efforts. Please, stay woke! 
Regarding Cambridge Analytica, yes, that's what I said CA; don't slip up or your handlers might crack down. Advising as a friend; cheers!

       Everyone has an agenda, even our janitors. Contest mode without proof of brigading is annoying, but they aren't as bad as they could be I suppose. I was just hoping for better from them though.

       Contest mode is a great way to counter shills/bots/etc from

       I don't see how, bots can just spam the thread with low quality posts, while a real user may write one or two well reasoned replies. Since it's in contest mode, the low effort bot controls the thread since upvotes don't matter.

       Contest mode also randomizes the order. It's not always the latest up top, or the bottom, or whatever. It forces people to read the whole thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       It becomes super easy to ignore low effort posts in contest mode. They stick out like a sore thumb because they're mixed in with high quality posts.

       I disagree most context threads I've seen are mostly low quality posts due to the situation I've described above. Normally low effort posts are hidden, now you have to wade through garbage (and the bots control the volume).

       The problem with normal mode is up votes drive discourse. More votes makes it go to the top. Negative votes makes it all hidden by default.

       True enough. I haven't used default reddit in so long I forgot they hide comments under a certain threshold by default.

       I've said it before in another thread and I'm going to say again.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6slxvz/fbi_conducted_predawn_raid_of_former_trump/">
        this thread about the FBI raiding Paul Manafort's house
       </a>
       there were 3 users who between the 3 of them had well over 100 comments. There's 800 comments there now but yesterday I counted them having over 100 when the thread was only at around 500 comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAGABolt, psyderr, and peyote_the_coyote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are 3 accounts making up 10-20% of an entire comment section?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either they knew it was going to be put into contest mode, or their goal was to post so much nonsense that it would sway the mod's  to make the decision to put the thread in contest mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAGABolt in particular is suspicious, due to him being banned and then unbanned immediately after. Which could be seen in the public modlogs.

       Magabolt is 100% a mod alt. And I even know which mod it is. Though obviously I can't say names because of rule 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just look through the mod log
       <a href="https://snew.github.io/r/conspiracy/about/log">
        here
       </a>
       and ctrl+F "Magabolt". 10 days ago he was added as a "contributor", by a certain mod, which is the only reason he can post despite having -100 karma. So now he bypasses Automod. He's been banned twice by other mods, only to have the same mod who added him as a contributor uban him. The same mod which constantly reapproves his posts after being deleted from breaking rules.

       Woah, that's like, blatant abuse of mod powers at the least. He's not even hiding it. You should make a post of your own about it, it's not rule 10 when you have actual proof. Though I understand if you're worried about getting banned.

       I  guess I don't what the big deal is and what all this hand-wringing about contest mode is all about. I thought sorting comments by 'new' was established as the way to go, if one wanted to insulate themselves from the influence of agenda-driven shilling and brigading, for regular users of this sub years ago.

       A real

       Despite all the sock puppets reddit is full of these days, I feel this sub is still somewhat close to way things used to be. There are shills, and trolls, and people that are obviously are not here to have a open free-thinking discussion about TPTB, but that has always been the case in some way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The woke ones are still here too. We know partisanship is BS, we have to keep this sub alive by calling their BS when it comes up.

       Partisanship is quite the issue here as are shills and trolls. This is kind of expected when a sub reaches the top tiers of reddit subs. Especially in light of the seriousness of some of the allegations carried here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as conspiracy stays highly ranked we can expect it to be used as a platform for trolls and schills. It would seem that a better solution would be another private sub for those who are interested in discussing things with politeness and an open mind. Meanwhile this place will remain the chaotic mess it is.

       The fact it is top tier is what makes it so important. I dunno what makes someone start thinking alternatively, but the more accessible ideas are the more likely they will gain followers.

       I dont know that there are enough regular people to drown out the rancor we are seeing. Even when normal people do post its often met with caustic rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       This place and the tenor here has devolved pretty badly. While there are numerous factors at play (With at least 4 influx groups who have shaped the forum into its current state.) the most bothersome seem to be the anti-conspiracy faction that floods nearly every topic to troll those seeking earnest discussion.

       Yes. I feel 9-11 as an inside job has been thoroughly debunked and claims that it is impossible for planes to bring down the towers relies on a misunderstanding of engineering and physics. However I do feel there is much more that is worth investigating in terms of Saudi support for the hijackers.
      </p>

       My concern is that if we allow people to post about debunked theories jet fuel and steel beams, we're on a slippery slope to having to allow flat earthers to post there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel this would detract from the discussion about much more plausible conspiracy theories, and there are plenty of much larger subreddits that encourage discussion about theories relating to 9-11 being an inside job.

       A lot of evidence has been indepently reviewed by thousands of independent engineers, and save for a handful of architects (who are not as qualified to judge structural integrity) the overwhelming consensus is that thermal expansion caused structural integrity to fail in wtc7, which caused floors to fall and expose those below them to dynamic loads outside of their designed capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe an entire industry and academic discipline is all in cahoots to cover this up. But considering the fact that engineers are generally pretty reactive to credible evidence, I find this unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, it took a single letter from a single student who presented credible, mathematical evidence that the
       <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/structural-integrity/">
        Citicorp center could collapse in high winds from a certain direction
       </a>
       to order and entire retrofit of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not have to agree with this, but until there is more credible evidence of some type of controlled demolition or coverup, I'm going to have to judge this to be just as debunked as faking the Sandyhook shooting or Apollo 11.

       Because I don't think conspiracies that have been heavily debunked are the most important theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact I think they're a distraction from highly plausible conspiracies involving some of the most powerful leaders on earth that can hardly be discussed in other conspiracy forums without devolving into insults involving terms like "muh russia" and dismissing credible journalism by labeling it as "deepstate funded MSM" instead of debating the content of the articles being presented.

       There is no way you could possibly prove that it wasn't an inside job. Even if certain theories are wrong. Even if it was literally the official narrative of the towers, the hijackers might of been contracted from the inside.  CIA had contact with bin laden since the 80's. The idea 'you get to decide' what is debunked and what isn't is bullshit. Not a conspiracy sub just you're own personal echo chamber.

       You might clarify which aspects you feel are debunked. For example, it is quite possible that Bush admin knew an attack was being prepped and simply failed to stop it. Or, maybe they just avoided working in terrorism and hoped for an attack. Or, maybe shadowy elements actually collaborated with bin Laden (who himself may have been a CIA asset). Maybe it really did come out of left field.

       Regardless, the subsequent conspiracy to lie us into Iraq is well-documented, and none of the scenarios I described require dank memes and steel beams.

       Absolutely agree with you 100% on that one. Particularly considering the government managed to convince a majority of Americans that Iraq had WMD's (which weren't in the country), and that Al Queda was in Iraq (which they weren't, at least until a few years after we showed up and created a massive power and labor vacuum through de-Baathification).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even on the 9-11 front I still believe there are questions that need to be answered on the role of the Saud's and their possible state sponsored, covert support for the attackers. But right now I find it extremely implausible that there was active or passive support from the US government in the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       If new information is made available that suggests otherwise, I'll be the first to issue a public apology to every user like you who tried to convince me otherwise and it will be moved immediately to our list of encouraged topics.

       I completely understand if our focus isn't your cup of tea. But I personally feel that a serious discussion about highly plausible conspiracies either gets lost to political bickering, or is crowded out by posts like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6syq3j/the_earth_is_growing_pangea_was_not_a_lopsided/">
        this one on the front page arguing in favor of Aether.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally feel that keeping an open mind to the disproved concept of Aether is like searching for mathematical truth be constantly considering the fact that 2+2 could equal five and never bringing yourself to the conclusion the it actually equals 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       If new evidence comes to light about a controlled demolition or nefarious government cover up (or aether for that matter) I'll be the first to issue a public apology and move it to our encouraged topics list, but in the mean time I feel that heavily debunked, and highly improbable theories are outside the scope of
       <a href="/r/ConspiracyHypothesis">
        /r/ConspiracyHypothesis
       </a>
       and a better fit for some of the many other conspiracy subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that same note, while Trump-Russia has been a major focus due to the fact that new information seems to come out so regularly, if credible evidence is presented that this really is a "nothing burger" it will be moved to our prohibited topics list. There are plenty of other topics from Crimea, to Syria, to Net Neutrality, and corporate/government astro turfing on Reddit that seem like highly plausible, non-debunked conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just don't understand why requiring users to be informed by credible evidence before posting counts as creating an echo chamber, and refrain from partisan political attacks/cheering counts as creating an echo chamber. To me it seems like the opposite, which was part of my goal.

       But if you think that creating a subreddit devoted to conspiracies, where literally the only criteria is to not ignore highly credible evidence without addressing and rebutting it doesn't bode well for finding truth, we're going to have to agree to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, if evidence surfaced that aether was real, or 2+2=5 I'd be happy to discuss it. But without any evidence to the contrary, I feel that providing a platform for people to argue that 2+2 !=4 is more likely to lead people away from truth than towards it.

       Sometimes discussions verge on the metaphysical/preternatural. Often there is NO evidence to these things, and yet they are frequently discussed in the conspiracy community. What about this? Sometimes these topics can be quite silly, like the flat earth nonsense. Still though these folks should be able to discuss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart of discussing and researching conspiracies deals with eye witness accounts. Other times info comes from myths, legends, folk stories, and urban legends. There is often no evidence attached to these things, but it would be absurd to deny discussion on these topics in the conspiracy community.

       I can definitely appreciate that. And especially given the rift that has formed in the user base of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       I can understand why that might be an especially sensitive concern.

       I think there should be a place where more esoteric conspiracy theories can be discussed, even though their not my cup of tea. I also think there should be places where people can engaged in partisan political speech, even though that's not my cup of tea either.

       Thanks, and upvoted you as well. Yeah I actually love the idea. Now I understand where you are coming from, and that there is no funny business. There should be places where conspiracies which are vetted and have serious evidence backing them are discussed. It is interesting because topics like Gladio, and some of the sub-projects of MKultra have been investigated very critically, complete with some decent (though most of it is circumstantial) evidence. Will definite check out the sub.

       You are also an idiot if you think mods here don't ban people for not worshiping Trump. They allow enough controlled opposition to make it look like all opinions are accepted, while multiple members are silenced so the controlled pro Trump narrative is not compromised.

       Ugh that was one of the most bullshit things they've done. Would have been fine if they told us how it would work from the beginning, but they let the community get super involved in nominating, debating policy, and showing support for candidates then just said "btw we voted secretly here are the mods".

       Many conspiracies that are very probable do not have a large amount of evidence, and people could screw with "interpretations" in order to silence people. What about the franklin scandal, iran contra, and teh dutroux affair? These are singularly political. Will these be banned discussion too? The dutroux affair has some convincing circumstantial evidence, but nothing to take to court.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we bring up some strange thigns about Harbin hot springs? No evidence there, but some very strange info that deserves to be shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that there is waaay too much room for abuse of power. The potential for covering up very serious stuff is huge. I do not like how this is sounding. I have seen it with whereisassange, and on other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, pizzagate has many many many problems, and there has been some subversion of the investigation by tptb to the point that it has been somewhat tainted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet pedogate investigators have opened some very important doors in the investigation. Sometimes it is extremely political in nature, and there is almost no real evidence. Hunches are relied on, and responsibility for not losing one's head. What about this kind of thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about every single other damn conspiracy? Aliens? Big Pharma? Government drug running and human trafficking? Government experimentation? Sometimes certain segments of these topics does not really have any evidence, and yet they are extremely valid in discussion. What will you do then, mods? How can you protect against the suppression of these kinds of discussion?

       Another issue. From my experience, this board has always run a bit to the right. I love the leftists that post here, and it is so vital, but what I am afraid of is that this is going to turn into another neoliberal/neoconservative echo chamber. Those on the far left, right, and far right will be stifled like everywhere else.  What the hell is happening? Not enough info from mods is coming out. I know you guys are volunteering your free time for this, but you guys chose this responsibility. I know there are plenty of Trump shills and other right wing shills, but anybody with any basic common sense knows that the most sophisticated and strongest shilling is from neoliberal sources and their allies. What is going to defend against the slide in that direction like every other damn sub on reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       And again I just have to say that every single serious conspiracy theory that has any legs is predominantly political!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there should be some sort of constitution or manifesto made to regulate and guide this sub, so that nobody, not even moderators can cross certain lines. I can see no other way.

       What about the Russian narrative? It is pretty clear that there are serious questions about the whole thing. Are folks going to be silenced on this subject? Are the MSM's corporate soundbites going to be favored and pushed? Is this truly the spirit of questioning authority, and peering deeply into things that many others dont? Are we just going to listen to what the neolibs/neocons spoon feed us and accept it at face value?

       Conspiracy culture has been driven by the right up until recently.  Conspiracy is explaining away  John Birch Society, American Security Council, Council for National Policy, all drove the New World Order craze of the late cold war and into the 1990's.  Just doing a precursory investigation of where those ideas originated right out of the general's left vs. right feuds of the late 40's to 50's. Several of their members were also responsible for varying degrees to the melding of occult methodology and the UFO phenomena into the talk radio spectrum and are now perpetuating it through the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is seemingly catching up since the election last year as consensus reality is breaking and we are in something amounting to post-truth bubbles. Mensch is just the beginning for the left.  At worst at the moment you have Manafort not registering as a foreign agent as he has advised elections all over Europe for 40 years and has deep ties back to several Eastern Bloc arms dealers.  Flynn is up for tax evasion and not registering as a foreign agent but there has been some realization especially on MSNBC this is a way to motivate their base.

       Even the the throwback topics at the top of this sub which is more in line with some of the original community here... Are coming right off of Joseph Farrell's personal promotion squad from one of the mods who is a member of his community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevermind the more salacious of the hilarious topics that have become political hot potatoes recently...  You are never going to unwind politics from conspiracy, a conspiracy by definition are individuals colluding for an illegal goal.  Politics as a broad definition are people colluding together for a legal goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The static to signal ratio has been getting amazingly high recently.

       I can answer that, it happened a few months before the end of the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to post here a good bit and then the election ramped up, Trump was the winner of the Republicans National Convention and Hillary the winner of the DNC and things went to complete hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an inarguable shift in not only what was heavily pushed in this sub but also what political bias it took. This sub has always delved into politics but never before had it been so inarguably pushing one side over another. It was subtle at first and less noticed but as time went on it only got worse and worse. If you supported one side or another you were a shill (no matter of side) if you didn't believe either side you were a shill in disguise. There was no winning. No matter where you stood you were inevitably going to be accused of supporting one side or another. You couldn't say a single thing about either candidate without being accused of supporting whichever side you weren't referring to at the time. If you called out Hillary you supported Trump. Called out Trump you supported Hillary. Those in the middle we're not allowed to stay in such, at least according to people's perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This election split people so much that everyone felt on edge. Which led to finger pointing on all sides. Tie that in with the rise of bot accounts and clear agendas on display across all of Reddit and people were only split more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't help that Reddit as a whole has allowed covert advertisements. Which led to a group of people already keeping an eye on all things and taking a questionative stance towards things to be even more speculative of what they were seeing because what many considered relevant post were getting removed/brigaded/down voted etc. Because no matter the side if you saw a post they didn't support your side it was an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub, simply put, splintered because people who all agreed they were for conspiracies started playing political games. Believing their side was right and the other wrong. Not everyone, but enough. And many saw this for what it was the clear cut establishment attempting to pit two sides against one another. Sadly those that have attempted to call this out were ignored. And now it may be to late.

       Could this be because of my post trying to raise awareness for exposing the New World Order?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty much nearly everyone agreed with that sentiment. It had 1.k upvotes and an immediate positive reaction from the community right upon posting. Was it aggressive? Potentially. But I felt I had to get a message across. I think what we're seeing is going to be a ban of all NWO or one world government related discussion, under the guise of it being "political discussion".
      </p>
      <p>
       I never called for anything or any topics to be banned in my OP. That would be unfair, I don't believe in banning any free discussion, however, I raised a good point that perhaps we should focus on the EVIDENCE BACKED conspiracies, and maybe stray away from the Pandora's box (Bigfoot, flat earth, conspiracies that have very little provable evidence to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Bigfoot or flat earth were real, there's WAY more evidence pointing to the existence of a group of Ruling elite who dominate the social and political realm. Why not allocate our resources and focus to where we can wake people up?

       I agree, it'd be disappointing to see politics get banned because everything is, to some extent, linked to politics. Discussions of 911 = Bush administration and his staff orchestrating things. Discussion of JFK assassination = CIA and motives of then-VP LBJ. Fed reserve = appointments of reserve chairman. And on it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect the right of all political views to coexist on here, even ones that I think are utter nonsense and narrative-driven. If the topic is getting banned because of shills, then shills are the problem. Not the topic itself.

       I actually spend most of my time there now even though I got banned a long time ago for going against groupthink. You are right about being effective. They have a strong immune system against shills and trolls. The rest of Reddit gradually came under the pro Hillary propaganda so T_D is really the only place left that's relatively untouched by manipulation.
