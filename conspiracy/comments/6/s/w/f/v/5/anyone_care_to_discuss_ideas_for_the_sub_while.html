    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think banning political conspiracies is the best idea. I&#39;m not sure how serious of a concept that is with the mods. It&#39;s obvious what happens with them though. Perhaps mods can create a tag for political conspiracies and make it like new members. Limited post ability, or base the post ability on the members post count. I&#39;d like to think there are other options then contest mode and banning the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know shills (from both sides) are an issue, but I dislike it because it <em>immediately</em> shuts down any meaningful discourse, it&#39;s a manipulation tactic in and of itself.  You and I couldn&#39;t be having this conversation if you (or I) had opened up the discussion with <em>you&#39;re just a shill</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s a cheap and easy out from a conversation that maybe makes one uncomfortable.  Facts are facts, use those.  Name-calling is simplistic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, it slows down things to the point that if you were to engage with each shill based on the logic of their arguments, it would drown out all organic discourse, so I think there needs to be some middle way. We can&#39;t just ignore it, but I&#39;m with you on the need to prevent others from outright accusing people of being shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banning political conspiracies would kill the subreddit I think.  Not that they&#39;re big topics right now, but that would mean no JFK, no New World Order, no 9/11, etc. </p>

<p>Basically anything that doesn&#39;t base itself on magic/sci-fi would be political.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t necessarily have a huge problem with contest mode (I think it does kill discussion), but if they&#39;re going to have rules like that, they need to be evenly used.  Instead it was getting used to squash anything critical of Trump.</p>

<p>I do think topic tags would be good, but don&#39;t think they&#39;d really help the people problem though.  Just a nice thing on any subreddit.</p>

<p>Coincidence? From the looks of it, the alt-right was barely a thing before that. Merely a fringe group with zero tangible influence on anything.  </p>

<p>I think your best move here is to humbly admit that you have been unwittingly parroting a talking point that was fabricated by Hillary Clinton and the DNC during the 2016 election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok dude. I&#39;m not privy to your personal interactions. You know you can just block him. I know we&#39;ve gone a round or two between us, and in my opinion, you can be kind of trollish. I know i can be too.</p>

<p>But I suggest, at least for the purpose of this discussion about the sub in general, stick to your opinions about his points rather than automatically engaging in personal attacks. It only serves to make you look bad.</p>

<p>How terrible that I should bring it up one (1, a single time) more when you reply to my comment in this post with some twisted bullshit.</p>

<p>Aren&#39;t you the spitting image of a a victim? Harassing users because you don&#39;t understand a thing about technology, ignoring the ones that corrected you, harassing them some more to the point of suspension, then coming back with another account with no remorse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think whatever is posted must include evidence and possibly a reason linking it to conspiracy. I think the countless Clinton/trump/obmama/pizza news articles that have nothing to do with a real conspiracy but simply have shocking headlines, mentions their names or is about the arrest of a pedophile in china. The low effort shot posts which I believe the shills and bots have been fueling here and all over Reddit need to stop. Honestly I&#39;m all for letting the shills / bots fight it out but if we are gonna do something this is the only rational choice... not banning political speech/conspiracy?! Wtf. CIA plan almost complete lol. They have shut down all the other subs so this ones only logical. Long time coming. </p>
