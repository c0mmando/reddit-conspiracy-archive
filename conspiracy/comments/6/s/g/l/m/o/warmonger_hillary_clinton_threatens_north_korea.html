       right cause hillary clinton had absolutely nothing to do with arming isis and never made any arms deals with saudi arabia. at least trump stopped letting the cia fund isis. ffs you hillary supporters man, so naive. trump is fulfilling promises while making decisions he probably wouldn't have before because he basically has no choice. no matter what he does the left will always whine and cry

       What a joke. You guys blatantly call pit Hillary for being nice to Saudi Arabia and calling for no fly zones but you don't give a fuck when Trump goes to ear and threatens another one. It's fucking hilarious.

       Well, he got busy with his plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days and putting together the extreme vetting plan took those 90 days.  You can't expect to keep all his promises!

       With so much resistance in his way to accomplish his promises, people will only cheer that they had voted for Trump over Hillary and the number will lean even favor for Trump in next reelection because the only thing we keep seeing is Dems are doing everything they can to keep him from accomplish his promises. Dems message nothing but hilarious, they dont care what Trump's policies will benefit the nation, they just resist regardless.   Yes de-regulation for banks is bad. But tax cuts and stimulus are good at this moment. They just dont care! They against everything Trump trying to accomplish with laughable excuses. and the only thing they are agree is when Trump is starting war with any nation which will hurt the country. BTW, GOP is just as bad and evil. Lately, what promoses did you expect Obama to keep? I love to hear it.

       LOLOLOL, do you know what are they doing now? who helped Obama the most in the past 8 years? GOP and dems are actually frends/allies, more than you can imagine. Who placed the most important vote in the senate against the obamacare repeal? (tho I think repeal is not good for the long term, but the familes can no longer take it anymore). I can go on and on but you get the point.

       Lack of competition and the options of the plans, in the long run, the premium will still raise. in short term, it will go down. There are more, like the mandates, taxes and penalties. Obamacare is so complex, there are so many suspicious fundings to different programs, doesnt seem like a normal health care bill. Repealing it is not a good plan to start with. Replacing it cost more money. The only option left is waiting for it to implode. Well, not a bad plan since without a bailout, obamacare will implode very soon (I bet MSM didnt explain why it is imploding and why a bailout is needed immediately), but wait for it to imploding means million familes will suffer. Its very tough decision here. Trump has been attacked by all sides. the situation is even more than expected, MSM is now no longer reporting news. so ppl dont know how good or bad trump is doing. they just keep blashing him on everything or anything. big, small..... Supporting trump is now necessary, because small business now counting on him, even the big corps. if he is voted out, the country will fall into depression quickly. the economy is pretty bad shape, its the hope that keep it together right now. Replacing Trump was doable at the first place if MSM and dems didnt use Russiagate or resisting him, if he didnt do well, he will replaced in 2020. now it seems impossible, because dems, lefties and msm are going crazy, ppl are scared. they got beaten up or have no freedom of speech in the college, workplaces... they dont allow ppl with different opinion . This is worrisome. Even Trump are terrible trump, he will be reelected. I really suspicious whether they are doing this on purple to just helping trump to reelected. This is so weird. They are not stupid, they can figure it out how people are feeling. They have polls, they ask people.

       Yes. Are you going to insult me because I'm an immigrant? or you are suggesting that ppl with English as second language cant vote. I do have friends that speak fluent in English tho. I read bills, policies, and news. We can talk about one thing you think I misunderstand in politics and I will explain it here.

       ps to my last reply, you probably dont know whats going on right now. GOPs and dems are in the same team, at least many GOPs are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are against trump to make any progress regarding the effects. They wont give him a chance. RUssagate will only push the country into war which we vote against it. Not all Trump's policies are good, but did MSM really do a good job examining it? his foreign policies are a mess, I dont care if hes been foreced or just trying to prove himself not collusion with Russia, its bad, even with NK. China is a the biggest enemy to the US, now and future. Russia just dont have the manufacturing to win a war with US. In the economy side, the policies NOT invented by Trump, they are actually from Ronald Reagan.....Trump doesnt have the help he needed to accomplish anything even GOPs controls both senate and house. Most ppl hates dems' policies, they voted for GOPs for a change. Look how many states are turning red now which decades of being a blue states. how many have voted out even during the obama's era. I kinda want dems to shine again, but they need a new leader and new slogan or GOPs will get way too cocky to accomplish anything. They are doing it now. Remember back in the last debt debate and other policies debate and fights? GOPs have what it takes to win, but they managed to lose or cave? do you know why? They did it on purpose, because the more they lose, the more people will vote for GOPs, because they are advertised to say like we need to dominate the house, senate and the president in order to achieve anything, but they drunk in the power and fail to do anything positive. Now ppl are suing them. But ppl will never go back to dems, but voting against their policies are the very reason they switch to GOPs. Trump, well, a president, I know alot of ppl who doesnt like him, but voted for him and will continue to do so. one of the reason is that MSM, the other is the dems. They are making a great example of reality divergence to the people. dem voters are even more inclines to side with Trump after listening to CNN 24/7 blashing trump. They just use the wrong strategy, ppl are so easy to find out something wrong with the MSM and dems' propaganda.  more ppl scared to say anything about supporting trump will only make them to vote and supporting him because they are scared of insanity going on. Ppl now hating trump is voting for him because the violent going on, they are scared of their safety. Well, I want dems to shine again, but US is going to be one party country. Dems admitted and knew they are not going to win the mid-term re-election or any kind of election. If you are pro dems, I'm pro-common sense, I wish dems can actually win something or anything in the near future.

       In my timeline before I was sent back in 2011, one of the major things that happened was what Un vs Clinton.  It was my mission to go back and prevent any of what happened there from ever happening which included bringing about a series of strange events that would ensure humanity's survival.  Only Clinton and her team of advisors will know how they would handle this situation and they will never admit it.  I may die but humanity will prosper and not go extinct like it was in my timeline.  In the end, that is what matters.
