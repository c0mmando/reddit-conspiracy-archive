<p>By &quot;TPTB&quot;, do you mean President of the United States Donald J. Trump?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening — beyond a normal statement — and as I said, <strong>they will be met with fire, fury and, frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen before</strong>,&quot; Trump said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at an event this afternoon.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hilarious how people in this sub bend over backwards to blame the MSM for WW3 when it&#39;s Mango Mussolini leading the charge for war - even going so far as to threaten &quot;fire and fury of the likes the world has never seen&quot; against North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you haven&#39;t noticed, the USA has been warring since its beginning.  There have only been a handful of years since 1776 we <em>haven&#39;t</em> been at war. We depose democratically elected leaders, we install dictators and we meddle with other countries as a standard practice.  All of this happened before Trump, and it will continue after he&#39;s gone.  You really have to be a moron to think he invented this.  Trump is merely a puppet, doing what the puppet master tells him to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not certain that the missile was that far off. They&#39;d had a series of recent setbacks with their missile tests that many people that are conspiracy minded felt was a likely result of American tampering, most like from a computer virus similar to Stuxnet.</p>

<p>Far as the miniaturization, I&#39;m not certain. There were rumours that Iran was helping out North Korea with missile technology in return for help with Iran&#39;s nuclear bomb program....... I&#39;ve read rumours of Pakistan being involved too. One thing seems certain though, at that is North Korea has made great strides in their missile program. </p>

<p>It has been documented that Obama told Trump during their meeting in the White House that North Korea was the most dangerous issue in the world today. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course,the knowledge to create nuclear devices is in the public domain.......do you know that any missile fired from north Korea would be taken down before it got anywhere near a target or that firing a nuke would be a death sentence on par with Assad using chemical weapons?......The media is drumming up a scary version of events to get the public on board with whatever act is next in the El-ite playbook.</p>

<p>Nuclear weapons can be used as a deterrent by the US,France,UK,India,Pakistan,China,Russia but north Korea can&#39;t because?.......the media are a one trick pony that use the same tactics on the herd whether the threat is real or fictitious.</p>

<p>If NK has nukes then why are the cunt-trees run by the banking families targeting NK with sanctions up the ass &amp; poking the horses ass with a stick?.....those are all rhetorical question marks preceding this sentence!</p>

It is a pretty well known fact that the USA has a very advanced missile defence system in place in the pacific and that the tech level that NK currently possesses would mean that missile interception and destruction is the most likely scenerio following an aggressive NK missile launch. </p>

<p>All these media scare mongering about them being able to strike Guam as if the USA isn&#39;t capable of shooting it down before it even leaves NK airspace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I take all the stories I hear about NK with a grain of salt.  NK has been described as a total intelligence gather failure by people in the IC, and our shadow government works to undermine any country which it cannot control, a lot of times through use of propaganda.  Remember the &quot;nurse&quot; who testified before congress before the gulf war that tugged on everybody&#39;s heart strings?  These first hand &quot;accounts&quot; are what they use to manufacture consent for these wars and they&#39;ve been doing it for the last 60+ years. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s YOU that&#39;s brainwashed and fearful of an enemy that doesn&#39;t exist, you ever think about that?</p>

<p>These stories of tyranny aren&#39;t something that was just cooked up over night by the MSM or by the war mongers or the banks to coax the country into war. North Korea has little in the way of profit making resources for the machine. The machine stands to gain little to nothing in stopping Un.

<p>Those people are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to verify lies created by the South and are often proven inaccurate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>US government policy has been that any non-market economy needs to be snuffed out before it spreads, even if human rights and dignity need to be ignored. This was sometimes called domino theory. It explains how the US was able to kill 1 million people in DPRK and bomb it until &quot;there were no more targets left to bomb&quot;, levelling the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a conspiracy sub it&#39;s funny that people rarely take the time to share information, rather than personal rumours and fears.</p>

<p>I find it fascinating that North Korea&#39;s leader went to school in Sweden. Could he be just another player working the field? Do you really think nobody noticed he was in Sweden? People got to him. This is all staged to push glbalist agendas, and how about the recent ban on nuclear weapons?</p>

<p>&quot;4. Kim Jong Un attended Liebefeld-Steinhölzli Schule, a Swiss state school, as a teenager for two years. He attended the school under the pseudonym Pak Un. It is assumed he returned to Pyongyang, when he abruptly left the school when he was about 17.</p>

<ol>
<li>While at school in Switzerland, he received failing grades in natural sciences and received good grades in music and technical studies&quot;</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice. I think North Korea is our Chinese buffer. They are in on so much. They make lots of medicine that ends up in Europe and America. They have a good supply of resources and the ability to create technology. There is no way to really corroborate what the media in the West says. During split Germany, many defectors and such were just actors telling scripted stories and if assume the NK defectors are the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some would say they founded the country itself!</p>

<p>&quot;THM: Thank you for talking with us Alan. Since this is a long distance call, let me cut to the chase. You are the co-author of a book, which puts forth a new theory regarding where the Knights Templar went after their suppression. You claim that place was Switzerland. Did the Templars found Switzerland?</p>

<p>Butler: Well of course if you really want to know the ins and outs of this conundrum you will have to read The Warriors and the Bankers, written by Stephen Dafoe and myself. The book is available from Templar Books of Canada or you could get it through Amazon.com. Like most subjects (when you really get down to looking at them closely) there is no short answer. What we can say is that, on a balance of probabilities it seems most likely that they did.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Today the UN has far more leverage on the world than it did before Kofi Annan&#39;s reforms several years ago. Now, NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) were given more power to decide social policy, than individual nations themelves. This gave rise to the power of the company, over the minds of men, and the trend will only continue.</p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t have a world police force, but we do now have mercenaries for hire, in every conflict around the world.</p>

<p>Maybe the UN is just a tool of the West, to bide time until another war. Maybe there is far more to it than meets the eye, but the overall aim of the UN is being pushed by it&#39;s members, and they would prefer if you thought they were dumb, but never underestimate people.</p>

If you show the world that your response to being nuked is to use conventional weapons then you are tacitly implying that using nukes in a limited fashion is now fair game (in that there&#39;s a good chance you can nuke the US and only get a conventional war in response rather than mutually <em>assured</em> destruction).</p>

Not sure why everyone is freaking out. Ain&#39;t gunna happen. They have not attacked us and they don&#39;t have the capability to. We have the whole peninsula on lock down and the capability to neutralize any attacks NK may try. This is the same shit talking NK has always done and previous presidents, even Bush, managed to not feed the troll. </p>

<p>Condi Rice discusses Iraqi President Saddam Hussein&#39;s nuclear capabilities with Wolf Blitzer on Jan, 10th, 2003 and she infamously said: &quot;there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don&#39;t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.&quot;</p>
