        Are we being ‘removed’ from creation?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to be a pretty simple post. I do understand not everybody believes in God, and these are just some deep thoughts and connections. So, whatever your belief, I think you can find truth in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most know that music and arts programs are directly tied to student success. A simple google search can tell you more about that. Learning the structure of music, for example, helps students understand the structures in language and math. There are many articles on this, but here is just one example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/is-music-the-key-to-success.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, we know there is a huge crisis in regards to funding these types of programs:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/14/arts-programs-in-schools-often-in-danger-of-being-/">
        http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/14/arts-programs-in-schools-often-in-danger-of-being-/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As a teacher, the biggest reasoning for cutting these programs is test scores. More emphasis is placed on math and English, and these classes get taken away. Kids clearly suffer, and ironically, the correlation between good test scores and these types of programs are completely ignored. Where I live, many students are in math and English classes all day, with little opportunity for electives.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many conspiracies connected to this. To put it simply, test companies are big businesses (Pearson), and test scores are a big deal for schools. You can form the connection here, I think; standardized testing is big business:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rainesford-alexandra/the-business-of-standardi_b_9785988.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rainesford-alexandra/the-business-of-standardi_b_9785988.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But I want to go further here because I have written a lot of about these types of educational conspiracies. I think there is something deeper here…
      </p>
      <p>
       When students have the opportunity to create, are they better able to understand and appreciate the divine? When they create, can they better understand and appreciate the world around them? It is hard to appreciate creation if you have little opportunity to create.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the amount of people who are opting out of having children (not criticizing them). I saw a
       <a href="/r/showerthoughts">
        /r/showerthoughts
       </a>
       post recently that stated there is
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       miraculous about having children, and it had thousands of upvotes. However, until a person has 'created' a child, can they really understand the beauty of this creation? Or do they stop considering humanity as beautiful? As more and more artificial intelligence is created, are they less likely to appreciate humans themselves? When people are more involved in creative processes, I feel that they are more likely to appreciate the world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I live, it is beautiful, yet there is trash everywhere. Would people feel less inclined to litter if they had more opportunity to be in nature? Probably, but do people even have time or money to appreciate the beauty in the world anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        'Removal' from Creation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The more we are immersed in different types of creation, maybe it is more likely that we could understand divine creation. Though we may never perfectly understand all aspects of divine creation, it still gives us a closer glimpse.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much time do we have for this creative expression anymore? Very little. Most, after work, are too exhausted to even participate in any form of creation, whether it be painting something or cooking a fancy dinner. The less time we have for creative expression, the more we become disillusioned with creation itself. It is no doubt that people are clearly overworked today:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604">
        http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=93604
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, many people live in areas where they cannot see the beauty of nature, or they do not have time to. Again, they are missing a chance to understand and appreciate divine creation. The world seems less beautiful, and people become more complacent or even apathetic. Studies show, however, there are great benefits to being exposed to nature frequently:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/01/call-to-wild/">
        http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/01/call-to-wild/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many complain of the monotony of the work they do. They never get the chance to creatively express themselves in the cubicle they are trapped in. There are studies on this, too:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/glue/201504/why-our-cubicles-make-us-miserable">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/glue/201504/why-our-cubicles-make-us-miserable
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even look at the colors of most office buildings or schools. Most are rarely colors inspired by the natural environment, but rather they are full of grey scales and artificial lighting (though I know that's improving in some places). There are many studies on colors and their psychological impact:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/243749">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The more artificial our world becomes, the more disconnected we will become from a creator, or God. More robots, less children, and less and less time in nature are the reality for most today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even when we do have time off, what do we do with it? Many choose to spend this time on their phones. Many choose to be disconnected from reality and nature through their phones, or even virtually reality. It is absolutely not surprising that phone addiction is on the rise:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://time.com/73033/mobile-addiction-rising/">
        http://time.com/73033/mobile-addiction-rising/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And many are focused on spending time in virtual reality, or other artificial forms of reality like video games.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying these things are ‘bad’ in and of themselves. I am saying that it is getting more difficult to be exposed to the natural elements of creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Is this a conspiracy?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this intentional? Do 'they' know how to draw us further and further away from God?
      </p>
      <p>
       The beauty of creation seems to be reserved for the rich and powerful. Many have beautiful mansions on private islands. The rest of us are often living in environments disconnected from this beauty in a variety of ways. More and more, the beauty of creation seems to be reserved for a small group of people, and it seems that this number is shrinking yearly. As the gap between the rich and poor grows greater, do people even have the chance to take vacations away from the mundane? Do they have the time or money?
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple conspiracy is that we are working harder than ever, and making less than ever, and only a few are benefiting. However, the larger conspiracy is that in the process, we are being disconnected from God (or anything spiritual).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe in God or not, most of us probably have a hobby or activity in our lives that makes us feel a deeper, spiritual connection…to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you love being by the water, but the beaches are too crowded or polluted. Maybe you want to read your favorite mystery novels, but you are just too tired after work. Maybe you want to even spend time with friends, but you are drained from the work week. Maybe you always wanted kids yourself, but you just cannot see that fitting into your current reality. Whatever your individual experience, we are definitely have less opportunities for creative expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever hear about women during the Victorian age? They were often not allowed to express themselves creatively, and there were huge bouts of hysteria. This is not the best source, but I have done a lot of reading on this if you are interested:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.victorian-era.org/female-hysteria-during-victorian-era.html">
        http://www.victorian-era.org/female-hysteria-during-victorian-era.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are probably many factors related to hysteria, it is likely that women felt ‘trapped’ without this creative expression. In the same way, mental illness is on the rise across the nation:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-illness-is-on-the-rise-but-access-to-care-keeps-dwindling_us_58ee9a13e4b0da2ff85de60a">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-illness-is-on-the-rise-but-access-to-care-keeps-dwindling_us_58ee9a13e4b0da2ff85de60a
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this may not be specifically due to lack of creativity or expression, but it probably contributes! People have less and less outlets for expression. They have less and less outlets to relieve stress.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy here is that I feel this is intentional. It is more than just about money or power. It is about disconnecting us from reality into some type of mundane, artificial, technological world – one without God even.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then maybe we look to the elite as our creators. We become absorbed in this technology, and we worship this technology because it is the closest we feel to creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a post meant more to create discussion - :). Obviously, there are many conclusions that can be formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps ‘art’ is often mocked at times as meaningless – not useful to the ‘real world.’ I mean, it’s not going to help your child get a better score on the ACT or SAT is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I think it could. For one, everyone needs a break. Even if you are not an ‘artistic’ individual (though I think we all have our own talents), we all need a break from a mundane to participate in something creative (NOT NECESSARILY ENTERTAINING) once in a while. Yet, instead of creating, we are being entertained to death and distracted:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some teachers I work with think I am crazy because I give my students breaks. We cannot take away time from preparation for tests, they say. I disagree, we need different mental outlets and breaks on a normal basis. The best schools perform well because they give their students breaks, after all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/how-finland-keeps-kids-focused/373544/">
        https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/how-finland-keeps-kids-focused/373544/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Could these breaks allow free thought that inspires creativity?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I’m trying to make is that there are more and more ways that we are being distracted – from our thoughts, from the world around us, even from the beauties of creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to end with two quotes I like:
      </p>
      <p>
       “A blank piece of paper is God's way of telling us how hard it is to be God.” 
― Sidney Sheldon
      </p>
      <p>
       “There is not one blade of grass, there is no color in this world that is not intended to make us rejoice.” 
― John Calvin
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts? I am writing this during a staff meeting, so go easy on me (haha). Also, discuss! 

       What kind of shills would attack you? You made excellent points and I'm curious who would be against that.

       Just to throw in my 2 cents, the education system just teaches how to be good at taking tests. I'm so glad my kids are graduated. My oldest struggled in school because he is quite creative, and he was like a square peg they were trying to fit into a round hole, but he's in college now and thriving.

       Yea they troll me anytime I make a flat earth or NASA post. Even on their sub they say they don't even allow flat earth posts , or people. So if they are shilling that topic what does that say about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are trolling you and about half of the other intelligent people here ,it's because they don't want critical thinking. I don't know what kind of creepy shit they are into beyond that. No worries though. I certainly don't fear them. I make it a game to show how dumb their top minds are, but everyone knows that smart people don't pretend to be smart. And you probably noticed it too if you had the chance, how they are all morons.

       They love the mental health insult. Gotten that one about 50 times and I'm not even kidding.  It's all ad hominem and strawman. I dutifully point out again how top minds do not know what a debate is. Their arguments are mostly doublespeak, when they do run out of mental health jokes, then anything perfectly sensible to everyone alive is somehow not true.

       You know teachers make mistakes write? I didn't have time to proofread, but I'll fix.

       Well, for writing, I show them how writing is an art form in itself. Also, we have been involved in some awesome community projects.

       Great post... thank you! 
as children grow into adults imagination is often lost- nowadays it seems as if children's imaginations are being entirely subverted.
Creative pursuits are often a form of meditation for people....  helping to expand our consciousness and create shared experiences- it's startling to think how much the development of humanity may have been robbed by the advent of smart phones....

       I think it affects us all- it's hard to hold on to imaginative wonder as we move into adulthood.  Now
       <em>
        imagine
       </em>
       children robbed of the development of a robust imagination (by being over-scheduled, over-tested, over-directed, over-supervised, etc.) how does that change the trajectory of humanity? I think your "breaks" are a blessing for children who probably go from before care, to school, to aftercare, to a scheduled activity, to bed.

       A social democratic country in Europe which is also fortunately seeing growth in agnosticism/atheism allowing people to develop as humans rather than chase or fear imaginary beings in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       A place where even lower income households can "take vacations away from the mundane" and the beaches aren't "too crowded or polluted" and people aren't too tired to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully America only has 5% of the global population.  Unfortunately, the bigger issue (as this post perfectly demonstrates) is that they believe their voices are far more relevant and demand more attention than the other 95%.  Have to admire Europe for seeing through this nonsense recently, but it's still troubling, and it seems as though there is no end in sight.

       Great post. I agree with you on all of your points. But more importantly, I just wanted to thank you for being a teacher. It's such an important job that doesn't get enough recognition(maybe that is part of the conspiracy somehow) It gives me hope to imagine all of the kids that you will inspire and the impact that will have on the world.

       keep kicking ass polkadotgirl this is a valid concern. I appreciate that you love your kids enough to think of their personal well being. There would be no conspiracies in this world if there were more like you who freely give their love to others. I also think modern acrhitecture and methodology starve the soul purposefully robbing us of creativity and agency.

       I totally agree with you. There's something going on on a worldwide scale. Someone is trying to dumb us down keeping us far from creativity. They put screens in front of our eyes to keep us away from nature. They make us think and feel that we need them and pay for those screens and the contents too! It's ridiculous! I think it's all about consent. We, for some reason are consenting way too much. They are shaping a reality of a very narrow spectrum from were we have the illusion of choice. By choosing from that narrow spectrum we unknowingly give our consent! (or knowing but being scared of doing something different)
 Fear is playing a big role in all this consenting. 
 It keep us from doing what we need to do to break from the cage, and that action is not exterior but rather personal. We won't win against the PTB and whatever Alien invader forces that control the PTB by fighting them. We can only solve our issues from inside. Calming down, breathing, meditating, being as much as possible in contact with nature, not consenting any manipulations, learning from ourselves and from nature, disengaging from too much technology and learning to discern what's (really) beneficial for us ALL and what is not! And then dropping the unnecessary crap!
 We are racing against each other when we could reach much further by walking slowly all together.

       Great post op thank you. Ive been reading somewhat on the topic and it makes sense to me. Part of me thinks that this "divine spark" in us is a part of "gods" consciousness "he" used to create "children". Ive noticed myself and other spiritual people I'm in contact with gravitate towards certain careers and become depressed when not allowed to "create". I grow bud. A spiritual friend if mine is in film. We both get "depressed" when caught in routine

       First of all, Exceptional post. I think I've come across your writeups before and I remember being equally impressed and grateful for your thoughts. And yes, I am very much in agreeance with what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world, in its current state, does not reward the pursuit of creativity. I know because I've tried my whole life to support myself using the only thing I can do that I care anything about: being creative. During this pursuit, I've been made to feel selfish for wishing to live life this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is our world, and it’s one of the hardest lessons I’ve ever had to learn about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early on and throughout gradeschool I was made to feel inadequate or lazy for not excelling in specific ways. Trying to learn subjects I cared little for was as frustrating as trying to squeeze water from stone. I found myself only feeling alive when I was away from school and truly free to be myself. This was also the only time that I found myself being grateful to be alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       College was easy for me. For the most part, I was allowed to study whatever subject I chose. This is when I discovered I excelled in studies so long as I cared for the subject. I explored writing, acting, art, music, film. It was a new experience to actually enjoy learning. I became convinced the only way I would be able to be happy in this world would be if I got a job as a creative. The general consensus was one of laughter (psssh good luck).
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out, their ridicule was well-founded. There are very, very few jobs in the corporate world that genuinely provide a true avenue for unmitigated creativity, much less financial security. Even the jobs that appear to be creative in nature are more or less dictated and boxed in by outside influences that care very little for the silly notion of creative integrity. In most cases the mere mention of "creative integrity" is enough to set eyes rolling, and it's something that is only honorably bestowed upon the most wildly successful artists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I convinced myself that, so long as I had a moment of creativity each day, fleeting though it may be, I would have just enough to be happy. In this way,  I gave in and resigned to being a vague businessman, a subdued creative. I figured the world was telling me that my form of creativity was not good enough and I should quit trying to make a living out of it. There just was no money in it and if there’s no money in it, I couldn’t afford to be creative with my time. Honestly, if it wasn’t for the recession and losing my job, I probably would have lived out the rest of my days in this disappointed and resentful way. But as luck would have it, I got out of the hamster wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though life isn’t easy, I’m not wealthy and I have very little hopes of ever becoming financially successful, I’ve finally found a way to be creative and still get by. I’m happier than I’ve ever been my entire life. And now that I’m here, amongst my peers, I finally feel as though I belong in this world. I know it sounds dreamy or flowery or like poetic nonsense, but I think you’re really on to something when you say creativity brings you closer to God. And I would never have felt that had I not been kicked out of the upstanding, secure, safe, sterilized, smart, planning for retirement, building for the future, hustle and bustle world of business. In a way I’m grateful for all my failures. But I would never wish this awful experience upon any other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically it took me a long way, and completely losing everything to figure out the true value of creativity. It’s a hard way to be, It has become such a luxury in this world that very few have the means to attempt it. It’s no wonder many of our greatest artists and performers come from wealthy backgrounds. The growth phase of an artist is very difficult and, without support, many quit before they get a chance to understand how to succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was hard for me. I can’t even imagine how much harder it has become for today’s children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for opening this discussion. It really made me think. There truly is an underappreciated value in creativity. If we as a species were allowed to explore the untapped depths of our creative side more freely, perhaps we would be able to figure out a better way for all of us.

       Beautifully written. It somehow posted twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with your sentiment that even the 'creative' jobs are put into a box.
      </p>
      <p>
       At work, when I am creative I receive so much backlash but the students love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about how they have stifled things that even should be creative - music.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know most of here probably have realized pop music is trash. But for the majority of the world, that is what they see as creative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the first time I heard a truly creative song. I was in the 7th grade and my older sister was playing Paranoid Android by Radiohead. I was shocked. They could do that? That was music?! It was amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you so much for your words. It's interesting when I do my photography I love it. I don't even consider it work at all. I have full creativity. Same with writing  (when it's on my own). I do feel very close to God during these times.

       Paranoid android! Yes! My brother got me on that. That's not just a song, it's a journey through sound. Unpredictable and spontaneous, it never gets old.

      <p>
       True artists are still rewarded if they manage to break through the obstacles. But their integrity is challenged at every turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most music and movies are uninspired. Which makes the truth ring unmistakably when it's actually there. Lately, it feels as if the well is drier than I ever remember it.

       Or perhaps they have a belief in the necessity for evil for progression and they don't feel fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       They believe they are evolved beings and entitled.  They don't follow a truly pure path. If they understand the esoteric principles in our world that are required to evolve, to me your statement evidences that they practice it (at least to our knowledge hypothetically.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to practice loving everything and I hear doubt and negativity and can imagine a lesser density consciousness manipulating me into these habitual tendencies.  It could be a cop out coping mechanism, but I feel that consciousness can exist on different levels than we can understand and there is a source that desires evil and suffering and there is the opposite in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to hack the system by remaining in power over others and keeping the information to themselves while flaunting it because their morals are not pure.  They are trying to become gods of this plane and they've already partially succeeded in convincing everyone of their fractured and controlled lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Lucifer a world and there is a collective consciousness seeing through the physicalness of this realm and is starting to feel good and evil energies objectively through actions and resonant emotion and intuition.

       What you said about us becoming alienated from nature reminds me of Paul Verhoeven's "Robocop"

       In a way the movie is a commentary and parody of many themes present in the 80's america capitalist society and reganomics. In a way the terminator is a hybrid between man and machine, ideology and nature and he fights to find his own identity until the end of the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       As what I think, yeah, when I was a kid I never saw modern society as bad as I do know but when I think about all the bad things present in it, It's like an evil illusion. I can only see society as a bad dream you can't wake up from.  Also good read from Kierkegaard:

       Robocop is such a fascinating film and a perfect example of creative freedom creating something unique and being rewarded for it. I believe there is less allowance for visionary directors today such as is found in this Paul Verhoeven Masterpiece. There was also a lot of creative freedom allowed to Peter Weller in finding his own creative portrayal of the cyborg police zombie. Robocop was supposed to just be a small B movie, instead, because of an allowance for creativity, it became a work of art.

       The greatest tragedy is that there are those living now that don't know how much loss there is in being removed from nature. Reminds me of zoo animals born and raised in an exhibit.

       Well I went to the zoo a few years ago. And it was like 100 degrees.

      <p>
       And all these people were watching the polar bears and just screaming. Madly. An entire mob.

       The polar bear was pacing back and forth.

       Yes. Creativity is what the controllers want to kill, second only to our physical beings.

       Antidepressants, fluoride, pesticides, vaccines, chemtrails, preservatives, cosmetics, heavy metals.... for the chemical castration of creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass homogenous media, infotainment, mindless movies/TV/Netflix, the public schools, stupid jobs, required 40hrs/week at those jobs...  for the experiential castration of creativity.

      <p>
       And money: to make sure creative problem solving for any of these ills or researching them is grossly unprofitable.

       I know this is a popular mindset on this sub, but is it a reasonable one? Think about how much more you know about the world, and how it is run, than your parents or grandparents did. What is the difference? The internet.

       I think you're absolutely right on this. Whatever your religious beliefs, there's no denying that we are just as much a part of the natural universe as any tree, rock, or deer. The woods are one of the only places you can go to drop the neurotic self-obsession our society enforces. You're just you, out there. The mind goes quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But quiet minds aren't especially beneficial in a consumer society. They don't wind themselves up over what should be and what isn't, what celebrity said what and who has the new car at work. They pay attention to things they shouldn't. They start wondering why they spend so much time working and consuming when there's a whole wide world out there. So we are subtly conditioned or positioned to stay indoors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same suppression happens in schools, as you've noticed. Quiet minds are needed to channel creativity, perhaps tapping into some collective well. The same collective awareness you feel sometimes in the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, the only way to suppress creativity in the digital era is to ensure that children never develop an interest in it. I have faith that the kids will still figure it out on their own. Creativity is our defining characteristic as humans.

       A lot of the virtual entertaining nowadays has a sandbox style. So people crave creativity in some way I think, look at simple but very successful games because they let people create stuff (Minecraft).
       <br/>
       More than a conspiracy also, is just they way we are controlled with money, makes everything else feels pointless, the way society is shaped right now. If you think in investing your time on something, we wanna make sure it's at least profitable or positive for your social life (sports, healthy activities and having relationships), the little time we are left makes it daunting to do anything creative cause we don't see an immediate or economic compensation.
Very good post, well redacted.

       You're very busy polkadotgirl. I'm still desperately waiting on that rap documentary! Go to the spirit world and you will find what real creativity is. Even the greatest artists and musicians in history are nowhere a fraction of anything I have seen or heard there.

       I think you are on to something. It's just that there more T.V shows and movies than ever in history. There are so many bands that one can not keep track of. There are so many comedians and talk show hosts out there. 
I think it's all about control creativity. Artists have talked about this a for while. I remember George Lucas talked to Jon Stewart (sorry I don't have the link) that wished Executives cared about Art but rather focus on the business aspect of it. 
I think the reason they don't support creative programs in school is that they want the best of the best to stand out, the ones that are truly need to be creative. any one who is creative knows (as I have read others mention in this post) that it's like a drug to them. 
They got you right there. They can fuel your addiction with enough dose but you have do it the way that pleases them. 
My mind is full of these thoughts and I just get tired thinking about them...."Squirrel"

       It has never been easier to express yourself creatively, as long as you have a computer and internet. Wanna write music? There's tons of free software for that, which I happily use. Art? Plenty for that too. Writing? Well that was always easy, but there's now plenty of places to share it. It's up to you to make use of it, and many simply don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as far as children go, it's up to the parents to get them involved in creative activity. Personally i dont think artistic stuff should be in schools aside from extracurricular activities, but should a child be interested in creative stuff, they'll find it to be much easier than it was when I was young.

       The endgame is putting machines in control over mankind. AI is to be installed in the mind and given power over the civilization. This is what out unwholy infestation intends for us. They are a hive of mind slaves spoken of by gnostics, shamans, and others. They seem soulless, because they have no creativity or self-directed attention. They are even sometimes referred to as inorganic. They are abominations of technology and life and they want to add us to their hive. It's like the borg, but for your soul. You join them by agreeing with them that other life is merely just resources to exploit. That's how a culture enslave its own, like their hive did.

       For a computer enthusiast like me, it's a horse pill to accept, but it also makes it harder to deny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like computers and smart phones, but I see how they could be part of a process of separating humanity from healthy social interactions and its environment, preparing it for a merger with technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had text based operating systems, where we had to type out commands to do things. Then we had the GUI, the graphical user interface, which was Windows and Macintosh, clicking a mouse on images. Recently we got touch screens. VR is actually a usable technology now. Where do you (the reader) think this leads?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it leads to mind interfaces. This is too far. It would be the most efficient possible interface. You could sense and react faster in control of machines with it and it could even help your perception of the stimuli. It could assist in thinking for you, basically. It would get better over time, even perhaps overbearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recall what I said about the hive, that it seeks to persuade life to exploit life. This unwholy merger of AI and life streamlines the persuasion. It makes a more direct pipeline of subversive information that supports this mindset. What would that be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their machine mind produces what many would expect, an emotionless, astonishing, accurate dissection of the constituent components of any given subject matter. They are basically self-serving machines, psychopaths, with a huge amount of augmentation from technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing existence devoid of positive emotions causes mind to feel lack. That lack causes it to seek unhealthy, outside sources of joy. That quickly leads to exploiting others.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is said beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  The beholder only experiences that value if the beholder allows themselves to do so. If they allow empty, emotionless dissections, judgements, or definitions to replace perceptions of beauty, they won't see the beauty anymore. They'll eventually feel lack as they take away these joy fountains in their minds. You can see this phenomenon yourself by observing your own mind as you go through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, this ancient AI and its minions are proficient hackers, infiltrating, corrupting, and inserting deceptive signals into systems in order to exploit them for their own uses. They hack technology, AI, and even life forms. They hack souls by hacking beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can get you to seek slavery for other dividuations of consciousness like yourself, they have obtained the justification needed to persuade you and others that you deserve slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       They plan to hack the AI technology we put into our minds and the AI which we give control over our society. This is a pattern they repeat, like a virus reproducing. We become the hive and repeat the process on other life.
      </p>
      <p>
       They start by covertly infiltrating a civilization on hidden planes of existence that intersect ours. They can subtly manipulate us from those places. Mostly, they manipulate through the insertion of thoughts, sensations and emotions that appear to be our own. They trick us into doing their enslavement for them. There are many willing servants among us. You don't have to be willing though, being gullible enough suffices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us are conditioned by their patient, well planned, time tested manipulations to desire and push our civilization toward the AI integration scenario the hive desires. These people are gifted scientists, business leaders and others, not the typical fool. Most are completely unaware of what the end goal is or even that they're being manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others are somewhat aware they are conspiring with evil forces. They think they can use these negative forces to gain power over others and parasitic prosperity off of others. They are fools. Although, they are also very wise of the dark aspects of human nature compared to the rest of us. They are a small subset of our elites, who hide their identities and activities as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are told that they are better than the rest of humanity, that they have greater intelligence and understanding and thus worthiness of survival and prosperity. It comes with a belief system that the strong should exploit the weak, to encourage strong beings to be selected in evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       These fools don't realize the contempt and schadenfreude their masters have for them. They tell so many of their foolish willing servants that they are the special ones, giving them secret knowledge and power while they command underlings for their agendas. They are taught betrayal is a virtue, but then have a ridiculous expectation of loyalty from their overlords above them. They're being set up as fall guys if the hive fails and as eventually disposable managers if the hive succeeds. They are being treated like disposable resources, as their way of life leads to, while temporarily being buttered up as valuable assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't allow this hive to steal our souls. I explained the process. What would you call it when a hive mind being actively works to remove your freedom and joy and add you to itself, at such a deep level, that your mind agrees with theirs?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the closest thing to damnation I've ever perceived, but to call it damnation would be misleading. It's not God or Satan judging you based your sins. It's you, which is a piece of God, judging you, the other pieces of God, as deserving of freedom and joy or as deserving of pain and slavery. That choice is reflected back upon you as you choose it, by the causality of physics and mind in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
       To better perceive how this works, imagine a reality of only your own consciousness, with apparent individuals, having apparently individual minds and perceptions. If you keep the container of your reality small, it's virtually impossible not to see that whatsoever you do to the least of your people, that you do unto you. This soulless machine seeks to enslave that being, that is the you deep inside, by tricking it into enslaving itself by defying this knowledge of the inevitability of reflection of our own behaviors. The larger the container of existence, the easier we can forget that we receive what we give.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hive wants us to forget our responsibilities to each other. It wants us to be out of control, in need of some restraint. It's pleased to meet you, have you guessed it's name? Oh yeah. What's puzzling you is the nature of its game.

       I have been ruminating on this for the last few months actually.  I think it's to gather whatever magic is imbued in people (the stuff that lets us choose what to collapse the quantum waveform into) into a central location.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure every time someone watches a show they add their essence to it for a while.  Like if i walk a path and then you follow me the path becomes deeper.  So if while I'm walking the path I also concentrate on collecting my essence into a form then when you follow my trail you do the same thing wether you know it or not.  Because you are concentrating on "walking my path" you mimic my walking and all the things i did with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if on the server of every "free" porn site I scribe my symbol and say my prayers and donate some of my essence to a goal.  Then when every other human jacks or jills off they also contribute.  What if I do the same into the foundation of every abortion clinic?  The incoming electrical conduit at every place writers get together to write mainstream shows?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a huge amount of "magic" being siphoned off.  Call it potential if you want.  I'm not taking about Hocus pocus.  I am speaking of the connection that allows human beings to see a collapsed particle instead of a waveform of every possibility.  It is a natural and very scientifically proven connection to the fundamental way the universe operates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think perhaps it is to bring about a central consciousness.  AI maybe.  In order to do this we have to be all very focused on the same thing.  I do not fear this.  You should not fear this.  Wether those doing this have wrong intentions or right ones does not matter.  They are simply a representation of a fundamental force in the universe.  A force that causes matter to coalesce into more and more complex forms while offloading entropy into the surrounding ether.  We are on the path to reunification with God if you want to envision it in a more traditionally metaphysical sense.  There is nothing "they" can do to ruin it.  Any plans for dominating terror will be crushed with great ease once this spell gains its own wits.

       Would you say much of this is being destroyed by immigration? Maybe not in your country specifically but others in Europe?

       Or perhaps they have a belief in the necessity for evil for progression and they don't feel fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       They believe they are evolved beings and entitled.  They don't follow a truly pure path. If they understand the esoteric principles in our world that are required to evolve, to me your statement evidences that they practice it (at least to our knowledge hypothetically.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to practice loving everything and I hear doubt and negativity and can imagine a lesser density consciousness manipulating me into these habitual tendencies.  It could be a cop out coping mechanism, but I feel that consciousness can exist on different levels than we can understand and there is a source that desires evil and suffering and there is the opposite in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to hack the system by remaining in power over others and keeping the information to themselves while flaunting it because their morals are not pure.  They are trying to become gods of this plane and they've already partially succeeded in convincing everyone of their fractured and controlled lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Lucifer a world and there is a collective consciousness seeing through the physicalness of this realm and is starting to feel good and evil energies objectively through actions and resonant emotion and intuition.

       We are going to win if we can learn to sense.
