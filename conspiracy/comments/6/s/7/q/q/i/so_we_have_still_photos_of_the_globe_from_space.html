       as the title says we have all seen the pictures of the globe from space. This is plenty of evidence for a well trained eye as mine to spot the CGI. But it's not enough for everyone many people still believe these pictures are actual photographs because they cannot recognize the inconsistency between real photographs and paintings. Also there is the fact that all the different globe pictures over the years and inconsistent with each other as well

      <p>
       So the question is why can't we see a video now? We obviously (sarcasm) have the ability to take a picture of one side of the earth. Now why can't we record a video of it spinning? at the same quality as the picture. it should be child's play with all the satellites out there in space(sarcasm)
      </p>
      <p>
       could it be because a video would be much harder to fake?? we have seen them try to fake videos like these before. If you care to post a link to one of the videos of the "globe spinning" Ill tell you why it's fake.

       Would you know that the earth was spinning as opposed to the camera moving? Where would this stationary camera be operated from?

       If globe photos are CGI, wouldn't it be just as easy to CGI moving footage?

       You would know based on the light and dark side of the earth. This could be done. The satellite would just have to be super far away... the satellite would still orbit, just very slowly, slowly enough to see the earth spin a few times.

       i find it odd no stars are visible as this is obviously a compilation of smaller pictures collaborated into one picture to make it look like a globe. What about neil degrass tyson saying the earth is a oblate spheroid

       No stars are visible because if the camera was set to that type of exposure, the earth would be way too bright, the earth would be way over exposed.

       Part of the problem is many artistic renderings and composite images are implied to be single photographs when they're not. But, real ones do exist.

      <p>
       If you want a timelapse, you can get a new photo every few hours from

       For video (although not the whole thing at once), you might be interested in the live stream from ISS though, although you can only see the Earth when it's on the day side.

       the ISS is soooo fake. These timelapses seem too perfect. If it was edited in anyway. thats one hell of a stable camera. Which is not. plus neil degrass tyson says earth is a oblate spheroid pear shaped.

       You don't see stars in this image for the same reason you don't see them during the day... the Earth lit up by sunlight is much brighter. An exposure time long enough to capture the stars would lead to the  image being washed out by the Earth's brightness. Try it sometime, take a picture at night with a streetlamp overhead and see if you can get the camera to show both at once clearly.

       The "pear shaped" thing is a pedantic comment by Tyson. The actual difference in diameter between the Equator and the N-S pole is like 13 miles on a sphere almost 8,000 miles across. He's technically right, but even his tweet says "slightly"... as far as the human eye can tell, it's spherical.

       Here is a great one that shows exactly the effect I am talking about! You have the ISS looking at the night side, and you can see things on Earth as well as the stars. Then the sunrise starts, and the image gets washed out. Starts at 2:11 and lasts for a few seconds as they approach the terminator.

       to me these videos from the ISS look like footage from a plane at 30,000 ft that the patched together with the ISS . Why would the solar panel be visible? and why can't the camera pan around like every security camera ever. and why from 250 miles can we see the cities lights but then from the moon we couldn't see a single light or star

       We just had had a whole exchange about camera exposure times, and why any exposure time short enough to catch the dayside of a moon/planet is too short to catch stars or city lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see the lights from 250 miles up on the night side. I doubt you can see them from 238,900 miles.

       doubts are good. I doubt everything nasa says or does. The solar panel doesn't have to be visible the camera could be located on the direct bottom of the craft. instead they want to show you the ISS solar panel so you remember oh yea it's space station lololol FAKERY

       This is like complaining about a video taken from a plane showing part of the aircraft wing... doesn't make any sense to me that you would have a problem with seeing it. But ok, here are some ISS videos that don't show the solar panels all the time:

       I invite you to try to take a picture of the stars during broad daylight that also shows the Earth. It's possible to use a telescope pointed just the right way to observe a star during the day, but you can't just snap a picture of a sunlit scene and expect the stars to show up in it.

       You do not know what raw data is. You aren't familiar with NASA or how they manage their data. [or pretending not to be].
      </p>
      <p>
       HDEV is technically raw data - although its terrible quality and is frequently signal cut - out of service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pictures often seen like
       <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Spirit-night-observations.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       are raw data. And tend to be complete junk.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://pancam.sese.asu.edu/images/Sol643A_NightSky_annot-A675R1.jpg">
        This is an example of raw images
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally,
       <a href="https://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/HiRISE/news/images/JewelBox.jpg">
        This image by HiRISE
       </a>
       taken from Mars of a wide angle space shot [no clear examples exist] - is the best example. As its a raw image. The problem is its only:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        small portion of the full image, which is 20,000 x 35,000 pixels or 700 Mega-pixels.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you can find that full image you can prove NASA releases all their raw data.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't though. And those DISCOVR images are not raw. They are processed, edited. Coincidentally the only raw stuff NASA seems to release is either terrible quality or so selective and specific nothing can be deduced from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are apps and databases with more raw data but search forums and its clear most people cannot get the special systems to work, if they work at all.

       Raw images vs. raw data is a distinction you've glossed over in earlier comments too. Do you want untouched images, do you want 1's and 0's, what are you looking for? I've given you multiple missions worth of images at this point, including the live stream from the ISS which you don't like because it's not always on I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think all these images are faked then? How many people are in on doing this? DSCOVR alone would probably be more than a full time job, plus you have to handle how the people who think they're working on a real mission aren't, apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just quickly becomes a mind bogglingly complicated conspiracy involving many thousands of people and... for what?
      </p>
      <p>
       And am I to assume you have no issue with the HiRISE raw data then?

       No, actually, I work at a university (phd student) though I wouldn't say no to a job with them when I'm done. I think they are in a hiring freeze right now but maybe they won't be when I finish hopefully in 2018.

       If you want the full 700 MB image, I'm not sure where I can post it. IMGUR will only take up to 20 MB it seems. It's not like I can email it either.

       Follow up because I'm curious: HiRISE is an instrument for imaging Mars. It is, afterall, on the Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter. Why do you want an image taken from before it even got there?
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI you can find data from HiRISE in various forms here:

        https://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As well as here with the right search parameters (although it since they are already in image form here, they might not be 'raw' enough for your taste):

      <p>
       <a href="https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/search/">

       You cannot cite half-dozen different missions and treat them as the same thing. For instance, SOFIA seems very open - with easy access to what appears to be raw data. So is HDEV [although it cuts out too much and is crap quality]. So is/was the STEREO program.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in each of these programs people have decent access to data that doesn't appear to have been controlled to a heavy degree. Other programs are not as open. Or they are too narrow in focus when the program costs would merit wider search parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each produced a number of anomalies by independent researchers. Many sites that catalogued these things have long since disappeared and the only remainders are clickbait -type, not worth linking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is independent eyes with various outlooks which spurs novel insights [even if they get it wrong a lot]. At the very least its entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hubble is of no interest because its looking at the same thing any observatory is. From nearly the same perspective.

       I'm not interested in scouring their many, many images to find it. I hope you don't take this to mean that I'm a shill or something, I think I've been accomodating in many other ways. That particular image doesn't interest me, and I'm not sure why it interests you. It's "looking at the same thing any observatory is" after all. But if it's important to you, get their software or look through their weird file directories to find it. If it's not there, I would
       <a href="https://www.uahirise.org/contact/">

       Not much point to doing so, I imagine. Puttering around the solar system won't change what the stars look like appreciably, and missions sent to other planets are focused on their targets, naturally. The biggest difference is whether you're in our out of the Earth's atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could try heliocentric missions, stuff

       and Spitzer. Not technically Earth orbiting! Though they are trailing fairly close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voyager did a wide angle of the whole solar system but the images were meant to catch planets and not stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're really looking for are images from the star trackers on spacecraft that they use to orient themselves. But for the most part, I think those images are used onboard and never actually sent back. They're not scientifically interesting, and the star tracker images that do get sent back usually are because they have something else in the frame that makes a cool picture.

       Hayabusa used its star tracker to track an asteroid, there might be better versions of these images elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       And LISA Pathfinder returned an interesting image on its way out: a picture of the Earth's atmosphere at night and some stars.

       Could be considered not worth it given how it's not the purpose of the mission, and the vast majority of people involved feel that the common model is overwhelmingly supported anyway. These images are worse than what good telescopes on Earth or in orbit dedicated to the purpose can capture. Every bit of downlink time spend senting useless star tracker images is time spent not downloading the data the mission is sent to collect.

      <p>
       To do a proper time lapse of Mars like DSCOVR did for Earth, you would need a spacecraft in a synchronous orbit around it or a lagrane point, somewhere it could observe the whole planet. I don't believe there are any currently.

       How about a time lapse of some stars as seen through Saturn's rings by Cassini? They were only incidentally captured in the image; like I've said, the spacecraft isn't there to look at the stars. We have Earth orbiting/ground telescopes that can do that job much better.

       Seen that before. ISS is 400km out - Earth diameter is ~12,000km. I've looked through a lot of space imagery. Granted maybe not as much as someone in a program but my point is only interested in a very specific picture.

       Still not clear on why the field view matters to you. It would be helpful to have specifics: What number of stars do you want to see? How many degrees field of view? How far away from Earth do you want the image taken from?

       I've already pointed you to where you can find that specific image, since you seem so interested in it. If you can't find it, I'm sure the HiRISE team would be happy to point you to it.

       I assume that this must be the sort of image that you were asking for, because we have now moved on to implying it's doctored/fake instead of saying it's not what you want. That's progress, I think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting that they make a fake starfield one by one, and misplaced a few, instead of taking a picture of the existing stars and adding in a blotch to represent Jupiter? That would seem rather convoluted, no?

       The labeled one I linked isn't from NASA; it's some random person's flickr account. Entirely possible this guy has just mislabeled the image, or you're doing the same.

       Makes sense to me given you have to set your exposure time based on the planet you're looking at instead of the stars in the background. If Jupiter wasn't in the frame they could use a longer exposure and catch more of the stars. The atmosphere on Mars is also often dusty, even though it's thin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, let's look at another night's worth of MASTCAM, this one doesn't seem to have a planet and so there are more stars:

       Once again the daytime photos are first, so scroll down.

       Is there any established research that proves the star positions are the same at Mars, as in Jupiter as in Earth? Besides the assumption they are.

       They would be slightly different, but not to human perception I think. Alpha Centauri is 4.whatever light years away, Mars is like 400M km, something like 0.004% of the way there. Like taking a step to one side in New Jersey and expecting your view of the Manhattan skyline to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the stars were much closer, you could tell the difference. But given we can measure the distance of the stars with parallax, I don't think they're orders of magnitude closer than they are supposed to be.

       If on the other hand there is a celestial sphere (I don't believe this) we should maybe expect Voyager 1 to hit it sometime.

       You aren't making any sense here. Using calculations is not the same as
       <strong>
        observable
       </strong>
       evidence. If the observation doesn't fit the calculation the calculation is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look at the Mars orbiter pic yourself and map the stars. They do not line up. At the very least there are dozens of uncatalogued stars in the image. Which means:
      </p>
      <p>
       The earlier claim that "star tracking data has no scientific relevance" is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the rovers are analyzing star tracking data
       <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/spacecraft/parts/gnc/sensors/">
        10 times every second
       </a>
       , how did Voyager do this without sending data back? Ah
       <a href="https://oce.jpl.nasa.gov/mib/VOY-1.pdf">
        it's star tracker only tracked a couple different stars
       </a>
       and it the module failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But modern craft have back ups.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two star trackers provide full knowledge of the spacecraft's orientation....As is the case with many components aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the second star tracker is a backup in case the first one fails.
       </p>
       <p>
        The star tracker is a very smart camera that
        <strong>
         takes a digital picture of the stars and then compares the image with those in its own catalog of thousands of stars to identify the stars in the image
        </strong>
        . Once it does that, it knows exactly where it was pointing when it took the picture, and it sends a message to the computer conveying that information. And, it does that 10 times every second!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is observational evidence and there is theory and models [simulations]. So far the only observable evidence produced suggests the stars are in different configuration at Mars. Did they design the star trackers to be all inclusive machine operating -  without sending data back - on purpose?

       It sure did! The investigation reading was interesting. I'm currently trying to debug some annoying electrical work and it makes me feel better about myself to know NASA has struggled with similar issues even on flagship missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the failure only occurred on Voyager 1 and not 2 to my knowledge though.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can keep info on thousands of stars on spacecraft these days because memory is cheap compared to the 70s, making the process much more reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you suggesting star trackers don't work? If the position of stars changes so rapidly, they would all fail because they are based on apparently fixed stars. Yet Voyager 1 had this problem and not Voyager 2 or most future spacecraft. Why?

       Or, artifacts, which is why the raw images are often cleaned up. You were the one who insisted on images

       they've been processed... which is why you might see junk that isn't really there. I think mostly all that flickr user did was add some labels which may well have been wrong; he's just some guy on the internet after all.

       By what mechanism do you suppose this happens? We have totally independent measurements (parallax being foremost among them) confirming the tremendous distance of the stars from Earth.

       I've shown you the MASTCAM images where they seem to take a dozen pictures every few sols... look at a few more nights of them if you aren't satisfied. I am getting tired of doing your homework for you and linking to data from what must be twenty different missions at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to hear a proposal for how the stars change position between Earth and Mars, while staying consistent with parallax measurements of their distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you haven't answered my other question: why would this cause the star tracker on Voyager 1 (which failed because something on it
       <em>
        broke
       </em>
       and not because the stars were wrong, according to what you linked me) and not others? Why are most interplanetary spacecraft able to orient themselves just fine using the same principles?
      </p>
      <p>
       If star trackers don't work (and they can't work if the stars are mysteriously rearranging themselves), how many people are involved in the conspiracy to hide this fact? Is it Big Star Tracker trying to maintain their profits?

       No one claimed the stars aren't there. If they are in another position the trackers would work fine but they would need a more robust system with lots of computing power. Kinda like what exists on the Mars systems which analyze them 10x / second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would be a pretty good mapping system too if they are in different configurations. But then you claim none of that data is sent back so...
      </p>
      <p>
       Never asked you to do homework. You made a claim you should provide proof for the claim. It should be easy to find a stellar image with each star location mapped in the open space program you claim to be a part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no different than mapping the local back woods [which if someone asked for the map there'd be no problem giving it] or taking a picture of the night sky and listing the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already spent enough time on the picture you linked. Chi2 [x2] Ori is directly opposite the Nucatai - the only triangular formation across from Chi2 on the picture you posted
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3Cx1egS.png">
        seems to be the one highlighted as Nucatai - seen here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is there is no other relation to stars in the picture though. I named what appears to be stars in the general area but it doesn't make sense. It doesn't seem to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no star map done from Mars or further that can be simply overlaid on an Earth-Sky-Map? Really?

       No? If they're assuming the stars are a certain way and they're not, they'll get the wrong results. If you assume the empire state building is in Brooklyn and it's not, you'll end up in the wrong place if you follow it.

       If they're actually programmed to account for stars shifting dramatically when you move around the solar system, but its pretended otherwise, how many people are in on the conspiracy to hide this?

       You posted a time lapse from heliocentric orbit? The clouds did not move. If moving through space is moving through time perhaps time is different relative to the other position in space. But to the observer it moves the same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words an orbit on Mars is 1.9 years from Earths frame of reference - but on Mars it moves at the same speed but Earth relative to it is moving ???? [or perhaps not moving].

       They do move, and you can see them move if you look closely, just not much on that scale. Weather patterns don't change entirely (I mean on the scale of continents) in only a few hours between images.

       Ok, so in this view Mars and Earth appear to move at different rates depending on which one you're standing on? I suppose if they were orbiting at relativistic speeds you could get some weird time dilation going on. It has to be quite fast before the Lorentz factor really matters though.

       Careful wording there. They do though. If you watch global radar they move quite a lot in very short timeframes. In fact if you check the ISS data they monitor these changes as well.

        Ok, so in this view Mars and Earth appear to move at different rates depending on which one you're standing on? I suppose if they were orbiting at relativistic speeds you could get some weird time dilation going on. It has to be quite fast before the Lorentz factor really matters though.

       So there is engineering and there is theoretical physics. Engineering doesn't give a shit about things are "meant to work" or how "they are supposed to work" - engineering only cares about "how do we make this work".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is extremely important because the people designing systems are not the people in the rooms coming up with the explanation as to why they work. Engineers in general focus on tangible data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that NASA models various missions with Flat models, Heliocentric models, Geocentric models, etc.... - it means that for novel interpretation [aka - only relying on what we know] we do not care about previous explanations [though they may be useful in many aspects] we only care about observational data.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look back on previous attempts at explaining observational data and there are gaps in basic explanations [e.g. star mapping Mars celestial sphere] - this raises a lot of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Whether or not you can model observational data in a convoluted manner has no bearing on a simpler interpretation for it to be modelled.

       I see where your confusion is coming from. Mars' sols are just under 40 minutes longer than Earth days. This is why NASA sometimes tries to have the teams working on Mars rovers live on "Mars time" adjusting their schedule appropriately each day. It's led to some amusing and maybe predictable results:
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-employees-almost-mutineed-over-living-on-mars-time-2013-1">
        people don't like changing their sleep period constantly
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's figure out the effects of this!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2017-06-26 09:19:04 UTC - Night
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If Mars and Earth days were the same duration, you would expect any image taken near the same time to be daylight. So at first your confusion with:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2017-07-13 09:37:54 UTC - Day
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is understandable. It's less than 20 minutes later after all. Assuming it wasn't taken right before dawn, you might assume it would still be day. But let's factor in the difference between sols and days.
      </p>
      <p>
       With each Earth day that passes, Mars is 40 minutes short of having passed a full sol. So 1 Earth day later, on 6-27 09:19:04 UTC, Mars' rotation is now 40 minutes behind Earth. 1 more day later, on 6-28 09:19:04 UTC, Mars' rotation is now 80 minutes behind Earth. That is, Earth has made two full rotations, while Mars is 80 minutes away from completing its second rotation. That means that if a chosen location on Mars and a chosen location on Earth happened to have the sun rise at the same time on 6-26, the same Mars location would see the sun rise 80 minutes later than you would expect on 6-28 using a clock from Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do this out for another 15 days and you're 17*40=680 minutes or 11 hours and 20 minutes behind. In other words, Earth has just completed it's 17th full rotation at 2017-07-13 09:19:04 UTC, but Mars has only completed 16 full rotations and is 11 hours and 20 minutes away from completing its 17th.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that clears things up!

       Not always. Just one example, the recent discovery of water (well, brine) on the surface didn't fit many people's model of the planet; I for one believed it was totally barren of liquid water (present day) until that was discovered. I was happy to be wrong in that case though!

       Yes, the images will match the "theoretical model" of a heliocentric (ok, barycentric, but close enough) solar system with distant stars and so on. If you're talking specifically on the Mars day/night thing, it will match what "Mars time" and the Martian seasons are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiments return one-off incorrect results all the time, the FTL neutrinos thing being just one recent, news-worthy example. This is why a cornerstone of science is repeatability and independent confirmation. Which incidentally is why I'm glad there are multiple space programs and many independent astronomers across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget that another cornerstone is actually proposing a new hypothesis and testable predictions if you think your observations differ from the stablished model. Would love to see some of those from you!
      </p>
      <p>
       You are surely asking this as a lead in to claim one of these images has an incorrect or doctored time stamp, thus blowing the lid off a global conspiracy involving millions of people over the years.

       "Global conspiracy" is such a loaded term. A false dilemma. If there is a simpler method of modelling the universe [or even a more complicated one which shows the current one is inaccurate] it would be easily concealed [or hindered] by controlling the data and access to raw data [even unintentionally]. Which is already apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The data is controlled at the experiment level and at the distribution level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there ever a record of 24 hour period on Mars that was photographed? That would be interesting. The shift work must be terrible because the team operating seems to work very strange hours. One week its 6AM-12PM UTC - next is 6PM-11PM UTC another is 1PM-5PM. So on and so forth. Yet there doesn't seem to be a 24 hr period where record was taken consecutively each hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange hours the rover team works. Strange if there isn't a 24 consecutive period.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you expect people to come up with new hypothesis if they don't have access to all the raw data, or what is "omitted" during experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Logically speaking it does not make sense that there are missing gaps in the recorded data. No 24 hour period on Mars recorded [that can be found] - No star maps from the other planets - etc. (Many more like this) Sometimes the story is told by what's left out of it.

       The idea is to match their schedules to the actual schedule of the rover. I think it only drives during the day, for example, and they want the people controlling that part of the mission to be on duty then.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not the best plan in my opinion. I think they would be better served by working in stable shifts. But I can see where they are coming from.

      <p>
       When you say "gap" you make it sound like a missing piece of footage from a CCTV security system that otherwise records constantly. That would fit something like, when the ISS live stream goes down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I take one picture and then another at a later time, that's not a "gap in the recorded data." I've just recorded data at two different times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that there are many instruments besides just the cameras, and not enough power to run them all at once constantly. When the rover is not taking pictures, it's doing other things. Often that includes returning the result of actions its taken and waiting for a response, since the round trip communications time can be many minutes depending on how far away Mars is at the time.

       Unfortunately, they are raw data (you did ask for it after all), and raw data does not always come in RGB format. Example: hypothetical image is collected using more than three channels, not just RGB. How can you preview 10 channels on a 3 channel screen?

       Without having access to free flowing data [transparent experiments with no question to their legitimacy] its hard to envision a workable model. Ill give you a list of considerations:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/75/85/40/75854003fd699b010f5b2e286b50c93c.gif">
        This is what the celestial sphere looks like
       </a>
       so it should be relevant. Not sure how it can be incorporated but to think we see this at night and in basic experiments suggests to me it must be correlated some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hawking's
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/World_line.png">
        "Light Cone"
       </a>
       is interesting. Toyed with the idea the solar system is on the hyper surface and the Sun and celestial sphere are opposing sides of the cone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting to note that "space" could be seen as expanding by temperature. Any experiment will create pressure with heat. Pressure could be defined as the amount of "free space" in the system growing. If so the sun would seem to be creating space and 'space' [2.4K] would be immensely dense. Anywhere you find hot plasma [ionized] clouds would be an increase in space. Meaning 'space' would be like a fractal vortex [think like the atomic force microscope which just keeps bringing up new landscape]. Relative to pressure differentials that limit each system. Really it's the ultimate 'relativity'.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Space" or its fabric would be envisioned as flat.

       and others like it - where you only see half a planet - it would be on a 2d plane [explains the ecliptic - not sure it can be explained without]. Toyed with the idea mushroom shaped planets curve in on themselves. The backside on the underside of the bright half. But if the Saturn pictures are correct then it kills this [I think] - since the rings appear in 3d space.

       Some days the sun sets and stars are immediately visible, other days the sky is baron for a very long time until all light is gone. This discrepancy would be able to be calculated if [heat/radiation = increased space] its accurate. [no claims made just visualizing the idea]. Essentially the sun is changing the amount of "space" and the stars would be distorted or perhaps not even behind it [hard to explain - think like a bubble inside a bubble] -

       This leads us to the Ozone layer and the plasma problem. 99.9% of the observable universe is plasma. Ignoring so called "dark matter" the missing 97%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ionosphere is ionized gas. Basically plasma. The Ozone-Oxygen cycle cannot work as described when we apply experimental evidence to it. There's no experimental proof Ozone can be created simply from UV light but thats in the model. In fact, Ozone needs either a photocatalytic substrate [Tio2] or it needs an electromagnetic field - electricity - which is exactly why we smell it after lightning storms.
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/gif/2015/05/exploding_sun_2.gif">
        Experimental work
       </a>
       shows that a UV laser frees Oxygen from Co2. If it also creates o3 it should be present in the same experiment. But chemistry doesn't have many reactions where adding more of the same thing causes a novel reaction. So (based on experimental data) either there is a catalyst substrate in the Karmin Line [a dome - FE'ers would love this] or the Ozone creation is likely directly related to the electromagnetic field - which makes sense because the Karmin Line is right where the Ionosphere begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Ozone-Oxygen paradox leads me to visualize leaning towards an electromagnetic interpretation but that doesn't explain matter. Perhaps just really slow moving plasma going down the Vortex drain. No idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever model is used as a fundamental understanding of our environment &amp; space - it should really take into account all of these observations. The plasma reality is one of the hardest to incorporate. Plasma requires electrical input. Period. Planets and Suns have magnetic fields. The universe seems to be a giant dynamo or electric machine. But then we don't see ourselves as plasma - so matter needs to come into the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the machine makes the matter that we see on our plane of the solar system where the dynamo is spinning and spitting out planets. If the observer were in any other position [another star] the Earth would then be a ball of plasma to them - different time frames [this requires the time-frame point I was making earlier]. Essentially nothing would exist in Earth's time frame except Earth and whatever is on the solar plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not so much that this isn't being investigated or considered or experimented on - just that its all done in very compartmentalized fashion [in the public sphere] so the public is left to take interpretations of complex math based on modelling based on mathematical models that were used to interpret data. Math is language - ruled by numerical logic. Vocabulary is language - ruled by philosophical logic. Both can be applied incorrectly or convoluted. Observation is needed to support either - which are simply visualizations of the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of experiments that seem to indicate underlying natures of reality but they're done simply focused on that subject - or at least published with narrow focus.
      </p>

       Very happy simply not knowing but free to consider the possibilities. There must be an easily explainable answer. Occams Razor.

       Nothing wrong with questioning everything, but what sort of transparency are you looking for exactly? You can get countless gigabytes of results from numerous missions updated constantly. Surely these experiments are more transparent than the vast majority of papers often published without their dataset in other fields.

       If I'm understanding you correctly, the eclipse will be a great time for you if you can get to the path of totality. The stars should appear even though the Sun will still be overhead. Being opposite cones from a hypersurface doesn't mean they're physically on opposite sides of the earth, but it should still be interesting to check for you right?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm sure you are aware of the more widely accepted model for this: temperature is proportional to the kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance. Then pressure is felt from those molecules bouncing off the container with more momentum than they had earlier. In a vacuum temperature doesn't have as much meaning (background radiation and occasional particle aside). If heat is a property of just space and not substance, why is heat carried by molecules (convection, conduction) as well as radiation?

       You can view Saturn yourself easily, so I'd say yes it definitely does kill that. If the pictures weren't correct then millions of backyard astronomers would have noticed. A 100x telescope is cheap and you will be able to make out the rings, though depending on how sharp your eyes are you might have a hard time distinguishing them from the planet. Something like 150x is better.

       This would would be like picking a specific paper to cite for the density of aluminum. Materials scientists don't do that--there are many materials properties databases. Is that field hocus pocus too? Again, c has been measured many, many times. I'll reiterate one way in a second.

       I believe we are headed straight for the notion that all of these missions are faked, right? "Claimed to be used" and all that.

      <p>
       We have already talked about the moonbounce any amateur radio operators can do with reasonably accessible equipment ($thousands, but not $tens of thousands). That is a way to measure the distance to the Moon that is independent of the speed of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't matter whether space is a vacuum or liquid nitrogen or plasma or whatever else you want it to be. If the speed of light changes it might take longer to get where it's going, but still travel the same distance there and back, and in the process cover a certain distance across Earth between its transmitted and reflected/received points. Unless it takes so long that the Earth rotates underneath it, but the moon bounce only takes a couple seconds. Don't take my word for it, ask the countless amateur radio operators who have done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you've measured the distance to the moon, and you also know how long the signal took to get there and back again. Then its easy to find c asy you can imagine. It might be a little off depending on any latencies you have anywhere else processing or whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you know the speed of light in space, you can then use that speed to find the distance to planets that have probes at them, by how long the signals take to reach you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless all the probes are fake, of course.

       The fact that star maps do not seem readily available from Mars or outer planets suggest to me the other idea is better. Where time-frames are different and it would explain why stars are not in the right position.

       If I vacationed in Italy I could draw a map of the hotel I stayed at. Maybe even draw out the boot. If this happened in the 80s or 90s I'd still have the hand drawn map [or an actual map with planned routes penned in].

       The fact that not a single star map from Mars or Saturn or Pluto [New Horizons] seems to exist is wholly unbelievable for a ~70 year space program - ~40 of which they were out past the next planet.

       Ozone generators that use electric fields (corona discharge) also exist but they are a separate thing. In fact they work well under different conditions: UV generators are better suited to work in humid air than corona discharge generators. Yet over time, they "
       <a href="https://uvsystems.com/faq/solarization-rates">

       </a>
       " producing less UV light. When this occurs, they also produce less ozone. Why is this, if UV generators are just creating ozone by way of an electric field anyway?

       Here is another paper: Production, Concentration, and Decomposition of Ozone by Ultraviolet Lamps:

       Why does this occur from an ultraviolet lamp and not so much for a visible light fluorescent, if it's just the electric field that matters? The only difference between them is a different phosphor on the tube that emits UV instead of visible light.
      </p>

       Let me guess: this paper is fake or the researchers are wrong? You've asked for experimental evidence, but I have a feeling you will dismiss any that is provided as fake or incorrect without explanation.

       I want to make sure I understand your contentions here:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) UV ozone generators produce ozone, but they don't do it because of the UV radiation itself, rather because of an electrical field.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Other fluorescent lamps don't produce ozone (I don't think you disagreed with this) because...?

      <p>
       Containment field... like gravity? The reason Earth retains an atmosphere to begin with? Gases do escape gradually though, especially lighter ones (hydrogen, helium). Earth having a magnetic field helps; not having one is part of why Mars has only wisps of an atmosphere left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the air gets thinner as you go up, this is why pilots and mountain climbers need to bring gas with them to breathe past a certain altitude. If there is indeed a super dense fluid instead of a vacuum in space, why is there a low pressure region in between the dense part of our atmosphere and that?

       Whats the wavelength of the plasmas before they hit the glass? How do you ignore the glass itself in the causal chain? Especially when changing it removes the effect. It's absurd.

       If you apply the same effect to the Ozone layer again we have a glass dome overhead.

       False. They do so because its low pressure [the air is the same]. There's not enough pressure mediation allowing the lung to absorb air. The lungs work by pressure mediation.

       The IACO Standard seems to be theoretical. SR 71 used to melt in high atmosphere - supposedly a low pressure, low temperature, low density environment.

       I've only seen one high altitude density experiment done on Everest and it didn't meet the predictive model.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you seem to be confusing density and pressure. All experiments on Earth correlate higher temperature with lower density, low temperature with high density. While there is a variance to this the relative position [of pressure] lower temperatures always coincide with higher density.

       If distance is unchanging how does gravity affect "space-time"? If the speed of light is constant it means density is thus a measure of distance [which changes] relative to light.

       If there's less stuff (mols) present, you can have low temperature, density, and pressure even though decreasing the temperature might make a higher density than it would have otherwise. In other words,

       and
       <em>

       The effect depends on the body you're talking about. The Moon barely bends light at all compared to something like a black hole. For the purpose of this exercise you can neglect the effect completely, but we can
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lensing_formalism">
        work it out
       </a>
       if you really want to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of the Moon's somewhat elliptical orbit matters more than the gravitational lensing effect.

      <p>
       My entire point is that you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       use the time of light travel to calculate distance. You use the distance and the time of light travel to find c. Or if you prefer, the
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       of c over the distance since it will be slightly different in air versus in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Draw a triangle from point A on Earth (transmitter) to point B on the Moon, then back down to another point C on Earth (receiver).
      </p>
      <p>
       You start off knowing the straight line distance between A and C, which is a chord through the Earth. Depending on the distance it might not go far beneath the surface, in which case you can approximate the Earth as flat if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       You then work out the angles A and C that the antenna had to elevate from that chord to point at the Moon. So now you have a triangle of which you know two angles and one side. Obviously you can find the angle B needed for A+B+C=180 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can from this work out the length of the other two sides. Call their combined round trip distance D.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can also double check the distance to the moon in other ways, like
       <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/91120/do-it-yourself-guide-to-measuring-the-moons-distance/">
        using a lunar eclipse
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway:
      </p>
      <p>
       (average)c=D/t. If the lunar distance is what we've found above, and the intervening distance is filled with something that massively slows light down, the travel time should be much longer. But it's not. It's only a few seconds round trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the opposite of using c to find the distance to the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can run the calculation the other way, by first getting the value of c in some other measurement. Incidentally it agrees with the value from moon bounce experiments... curious coincidence? Then we can estimate the distance to the moon based on the travel time and speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can find the distance to the moon first and then work out the speed of light from the travel time. Or if you find the speed of light (some other way) first then measure the travel time to the moon, you can compute a distance to the moon. These numbers agree with each other.

       Density could be modelled measure of space within the system. If you heat "molecules" they are said to be excited, but even in that model they then occupying different frames - expanded - meaning there is more "space" in the system. Definition of "space" expanding. And its all causally linked to temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two mediums different densities - same observable space. 1cm3 of metal for instance, speed of sound travels different rates through different types. Just as light does in gas or liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
       They occupy the same observable "space" yet could be said to have more or less "space" inside them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as light travels different speeds in various mediums. If you say light speed is constant, speed of sound should be as well - it's no different. Neither can be measured in a
       <strong>
        true
       </strong>
       vacuum. Sound for obvious reasons - light because a true vacuum doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what relativity implies. If light is a constant then it travels at that constant. In dense mediums it observably slows down meaning it travelled the same speed but the actual "space" it travelled increased [within the system or medium].
      </p>
      <p>
       There should really be a disclaimer for relativity.

       So finding the distance of the moon can be done with or without taking a value for the speed of light ahead of time.

       Then once you have a value for c (either because you found it from the moon distance+travel time or you already had a value and used it) you can use it for other purposes, red shift included.

      <p>
       Let's start with the first part:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you agree with the method I outlined for finding the distance of the Moon from the Earth (
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       first having the speed of light)?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do, then you can find the speed of light from the travel time and distance traveled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, you can find the speed of light in some other way first. Then,
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       doing the trig distance calculation, you can find the distance of the .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not circular. Circular would be:
      </p>
      <p>
       (calculate d to the moon based on t and c)--&gt;(calculate c based on d and t)--&gt;(repeat)
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is you can do:
      </p>
      <p>
       (calculate d to the moon WITHOUT c, and measure t)--&gt;(calculate c based on d and t)
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       (measure t, and have a value of c you already found through some totally different experiment)--&gt;(calculate d from t and c)

       To make things more concise I'm going to refer to experiments #1 and #2 for short:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Find d to moon using geometry, find c from d and round trip t.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Assume c based on some other experiment, find d from c and round trip t.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It also ignores the mediums surrounding it. Light travels different in those mediums.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This only affects the result of experiment #2, which I will agree you can dispute if you say the light travels at a different speed in some medium in space you aren't aware of (so you assume it's a vacuum by mistake).
      </p>
      <p>
       In that case, at what altitude does the not-vacuum start? I think you said it was something that slowed light down to 17 m/s (correct me if I misremember). Since round trip to the moon is on the order of a couple seconds in these experiments, the Moon must be right in the beginning of that medium in your model.

       Ok so this one is for experiment #1.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure where you got those angles from. They will vary by the time of day and you are forgetting about azimuth. This whole thing is way, way easier to calculate if you pick two places that are the same longitude. The reason is that if they're not, you need to consider the effect of azimuth as well as elevation. When they're at the same longitude, and the moon is highest, then one looks ~N and one looks ~S above the horizon to see it. This makes the math much easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it will look like this
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ae8D0">
        mspaint diagram
       </a>
       that isn't to scale but I hope gets the idea across.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to use similar latitude to what you already gave, but change the longitude to be the same: Point A: 45 N 80 W and point B: 16 S 80 W.

       Moon is at its height at 13:20 in both places. 60 deg and 58.9 deg respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to draw the triangle correctly we also have to account for the angle from the chord between the two points, not from the horizon. See what I mean in the same
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ae8D0">
        mspaint diagram
       </a>
       . If we just measured the elevation of the Moon from the horizon (i.e. from a tangent line to the circle) we would be leaving out part of the real angle of the triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       To account for this, we add half the great circle angle between them at each point. So imagine, since they are 61 deg latitude difference, someone at point A would have to drill into the Earth at an angle 30.5 deg to the horizon to reach point B. So the elevation of the moon
       <em>
        from that tunnel
       </em>
       is 30.5 deg greater than it is from the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The great circle angle between them is 61 deg, so add half that to each elevation:
      </p>
      <p>
       90.5 deg at point A, 89.4 deg at point B.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get 3830587.718 for one side and 3830651.898 for the other. Both well within the range of the Moon's distance.

       This is not a hypothetical. It has been done many times by amateur radio operators, and if you're just interested in the geometry (and not the radio distance) you can do it with two friends who live some latitude apart observing the inclination of the moon at its height on the same night.

       It's funny when researching these things that in every case they mention how Cassini or Keppler or whoever "used the correct way to measure the distances" but then "they were very wrong in their conclusions" is always added in and the actual distances are not mentioned unless they "were surprisingly close to what we know today" the rest were "errors" or "miscalculation".

       It's a calculation. You can calculate the world on a back of a turtle its still just a calculation. Wanna do it again from each pole - north pole / south pole. You won't have to add or remove any degrees for the angle of the great circle.

       It's a calculation based on observation. Remember amateur radio groups hold competitions for moon bounce transmissions... countless people have done this themselves.

       You didn't answer the question though: do you agree with the calculation? Which part of the geometry do you think is wrong? Do you think that the Moon doesn't actually reach the inclination indicated at the time indicated?

       You still haven't told me if you disagree with anything about the previous example.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I think you made a mistake here; I almost made it too. When I clicked to set lat/long and changed from -84.2672 to +84.2672 it changed successfully but it also changed the time zone (why, I don't know).
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/84.2672,-99.1406,0/2017.08.11/05:19/1/0">
        Compare the time stamp (05:19 UTC-5)
       </a>
       with the time stamp on your link (05:19 UTC+0).
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon is 2.96 deg elevation at the north point at 05:19 UTC-5, and 4.86 deg elevation at the south point at 05:19 UTC... but this is not the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I adjusted to 00:19 UTC-5 (which is 05:19 UTC, not sure why it won't let me change the time zone) and found that the moon was barely not visible (-0.35 deg).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I found a time when the moon is visible from a similar pair of locations.
       <a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/80.2667,-99.1333,0/2017.08.12/05:18/1/0">
        Here

       and
       <a href="https://www.mooncalc.org/#/-80.2667,-99.1333,0/2017.08.12/10:18/1/0">
        here
       </a>
       . Note the time stamps being 5 hours different with a time zone difference of 5 hours... checks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll start with the chord length. I get 12678.26 km between the two points: 80 deg 16 min N to 80 deg 16 min.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see an apparent elevation of 6.41 deg at the south point and 11.37 deg at the north point.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the moon is this close to the horizon we need to take into account atmospheric refraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a flat earther might disbelieve in atmospheric refraction, but you're not one. The effect of atmospheric refraction has been determined through observation of stars. As stars are moving overhead they seem to move at a constant angular rate. Yet as they approach the horizon they seem to slow down slightly. This is because as they approach the horizon the effect of atmospheric refraction is increasing. The amount of refraction matches what we expect from the refractive index of air (varies with temperature, but negligibly for our purposes), which has also been empirically determined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway here is a table of values we can use:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1703/thomas.pdf">
        http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/td/td1703/thomas.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Table on p. 282 (p. 4 in the pdf).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refraction at 7 deg apparent inclination is 7.4 min, and refraction at 11 deg apparent inclination is 4.9 min.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our actual inclinations are slightly different but I'll use these values as an approximation for now. We get an adjusted ("true") inclination of 6.286666667 deg and 11.28833333 deg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Results:
      </p>
      <p>
       If I use the apparent inclinations, I get a value of 425956.9049 and 426500.3817 for the triangle sides. This is about 12% too long to be the 379106 km value the webpage gives for the distance of the moon at this instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we use the inclinations corrected for refraction, we get 376660.6721 and 376110.6083 km for the side lengths. This is very close, within 1% of the 379106 km value the webpage gives.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didn't even bother interpolating the refraction adjustments! If I do that, the approximation gets even better, to within 0.04%! Very nice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, it's certainly not 3000-4000 km!

      <p>
       Here is the calculation done after the first-order refraction correction (but before I did interpolation to make it even better):
      </p>
      <p>
       Side AC: Chord length from North to South viewing sites. 12558.58 km.

      <p>
       Angle A: South point inclination (6.268333 deg)+80.26666667 deg (80.26... is half the great circle angle between 80 deg 16' North and South, same procedure as before.)=86.535 deg
      </p>
      <p>
       Angle C: North point inclination (11.28333 deg)+80.26666667 deg (80.26... is half the great circle angle between 80 deg 16' North and South, same procedure as before.)=91.555 deg
      </p>
      <p>
       Angle B: Triangle must be 180 degrees, so C=180-91.555-86.535=1.91 deg
      </p>
      <p>
       We want to find sides AB and BC.
      </p>
      <p>
       AB/sin(C)=AC/sin(B)
      </p>
      <p>
       Solve for AB:
      </p>
      <p>
       AB=sin(C)*AC/sin(B)
      </p>
      <p>
       Plug in the values from above. sin(91.555 deg)*(12558.58 km)/sin(1.91 deg)=376660.6721.

       Yeah, knew there was something fishy going on there. The "great circle" angle is engineering the equation to fit the desired result.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's curious an Astrolabe works by a flat plane with a celestial sphere and is incredibly accurate. Yet you need to buff numbers for this to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this works if the world is inside-out correct? Not opposed to that or even the model but it requires many assumptions. It's not "proof" of anything besides another way to model it.

       I refer you to my
       <a href="http://imgur.com/14qhTBp">
        diagram from before
       </a>
       . How do you measure the two angles in that triangle that are on Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you see how the elevation from the horizon (the horizon being tangent to the circle) isn't the whole angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       If two observers were exactly at the poles, they are 180 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction would they have to turn to look at each other through the Earth? They would have to look straight down, that is, 90 deg declination from the horizon, into the ground. 90=180/2. This is obvious right?
      </p>
      <p>
       They start walking towards each other. Eventually they will meet at the equator and be able to look straight at each other (looking at the horizon 0 deg). In between, the angle they need to look down to point at each other is the same as each of their latitude, and half the difference in latitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Move them to 45 deg latitude N/S. Now they are 90 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction do they have to turn to look at each other through the Earth? They each need to look 45 degrees down from the horizon. 45=90/2. Draw it yourself if you don't believe me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same story when they are at 80 deg N/S. Now they are 160 degrees apart from each other on the circle. What direction do they have to tun to look at each other through the Earth? They each need to look 80 degrees down from the horizon. 80=160/2. Draw it yourself if you don't believe me.

       Okay I see what you are doing now. Congratulations then? You modelled the Earth and Moon after being told the distance and it worked. Back to the original point.
      </p>
      <p>
       A model of it being other shapes work as well. So Im not sure what its supposed to prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       This model wasn't used before the lunar distance was learned. It was learned in Project Diana [classified] and another project [classified] and shortly after the range-reflectors were put on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to link the original [classified] experiments on how they came to their conclusions it would be of some actual benefit. You can model the world as a grape for all I care, if someone told you it was you'd be trying to convince me with math. Where's the original experimental data?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any luck figuring out what the 100-200 day lapses in the planetary orbits are?

       You never read about the distance before learning this method of calculation - When was it conceived? They use geometry to guess the distance of the moon for thousands of years - with observations. It wasn't until the classified experiments by the Navy did a incontestable narrative come out about the distance.

       For one - the model

       What does that have to do with it? If someone tells me something is 3' long and then I measure it with a yardstick, the measurement isn't invalidated because I was told what it would be ahead of time.

       of the moon's angle combined with grade school geometry and the shape of the Earth.

       So I'll ask real specific here: supposing that the Earth is convex-spherical, do you agree with the calculation? In other words, your only argument against this result is "the earth is a different shape than you think" right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you do think the Earth is a different shape, please do the  math on how you compute the moon's distance in your model as I have done for mine.

       You still haven't posted the original classified work calculating the distance. Are you suggesting experiment design cannot be made to get intended results? There's a reason much of that information is still classified.

       The density thing was a misnomer. Since there's various meanings behind "density" - like apparent density and particle density. If you visualize everything being attached to a substrate or 'aether' it starts getting confusing. Just stick with pressure and temperature since its a better marker. The picture explains the point that was being made.

       It's a little irrelevant because the shape of the Earth changes the distances and everything else about the Moon. And yes it can be modelled multiple ways.

       That's the point of fleshing out the falsifying observations first. Because if the model is wrong everything is wrong.

       I provided the claimed model with photographic/observable evidence contradicting it. It's not built on any assumption of the moons distance. Since I cannot observe the moons distance I cannot verify its correct. You can fly in any plane or look at the hundreds [thousands - hundreds of thousands?] of picture as well as

       I'm going to try to ask this very clearly:

      <p>
       1) Assuming the Earth is spherical as described, you agree the lunar distance checks out according to those observations, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You say it can be modeled multiple ways--model it a different way. Describe the shape of the Earth and then work through the geometry of where the moon is according to the observations of it.

       I have proposed one for you to try. Why don't you do it? If I do you won't  believe me anyway. Measure the horizon with an inclinometer at sea level and then do it again at a great height.

       are correct. If there is falsifying evidence for those models are you not interested? I never claimed to have a model that works.

      <p>
       1) Assume for the moment earth is a convex sphere of the usual radius. Does the geometry I gave work out, and calculate the distance of the moon correctly? If not, do you disagree with how I drew the triangle or with the law of sines?

      <p>

       You aren't answering the first question either. Assume for the moment the Earth is a sphere as described. Based on the observations of the moon, and that assumption, do you agree with the calculation for its distance?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, I am asking you if there is an alternative--any alternative, such as the concave Earth you are suggesting--where these observations can be accounted for. In that model, where is the moon? Again, not asking you to say you know what the shape is. You said this works in a concave Earth--how?

       Listen, you brought up the moon. I didn't. You claim the moon calculations prove something. They only do if the true distance is correct or the model of the Earth is correct. Yet in the face of contrary evidence to both models you believe in you keep bringing up the moon.

       Forget the bottle since I've never done it myself and we are talking about relative density. I have flown in a private plane however. If the temperature changes the distance to the Earth, in a stated pressure zone - how is that not the amount of "space" in the system that changed.

       In a sea of bad information its very hard to know what is accurate or not. Which is why I stick to observable evidence as much as possible. Any time a model is built on theory or assumption [which the majority are] it leaves room for exponential error. Already said drop the bottle thing.

       All of the outer planets meet up perfectly with their position in the night sky relative to a complete circuit of the celestial sphere. What's
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       interesting though is that every few years or so the trip is
       <em>
        extended
       </em>
       by 40 days for Mercury,
       <em>
        decreased
       </em>
       by 100 days for Venus, decreased 200 days for Mars. As well as 200 day variations in Jupiter and Mars though the variations are smaller in comparison to the very long duration. Hence the "~" being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those missing days are very telling. If the solar system model is correct and this accurately predicts the years of planetary orbits than why are there missing days from their motion?

       On second thought I need to find the moon's max inclination more precisely than the site I linked will show (it only does 10 minute intervals, and the moon has a few degrees of azimuth at the greatest height... when we're working with angles so small I need to be closer than that).

        You are saying that the density of air is the same at higher altitudes? Why then do balloons have a maximum altitude related to the density of what's inside them?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely not. The density of air is correlated to temperature. What the true densities of air is at higher altitudes are no one can know because its almost always done hypothetically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The air is the same mixture on Everest or at sea level. Yet if you filled a plastic bottle with it and brought it back down the bottle would be sucked in. You can easily say the "space" the air occupies [since it has the same composition] is less. The observable space [the bottle] changes when its returned to sea level. Thus, the air occupies less "space".

      <p>
       Ok, so now you have the same mass of air inside the bottle but it occupies less volume. So its density has increased, density literally being defined as mass/volume. I think we agree on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've just argued that a bottle of air becomes more dense when you bring it down to a lower altitude. Or in other words, if you bring that same bottle back up, it will expand again and the air inside will become less dense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... air is less dense at higher altitudes? You've just argued that a bottle of it becomes more dense at lower altitudes.

      <p>
       How is it the same mass of air? The entire point is that the volume holds a different mass of air at different altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weight is mass * gravity. Are you positing that both bottles weigh the same even if measured at sea level?

       Let me make sure I understand the steps of this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Bring a bottle up to Everest
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Fill it with air there
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Close the bottle (right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Return to sea level
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Bottle gets "sucked in" and occupies less volume
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is what you meant, how did any mass enter the bottle? I suppose some could have leaked in, but that's not what you mean I think.

       Cannot find a single instance of Ozone being stored in a canister or vacuum. In fact all searches are directed to Ozone generators.

      <p>
       If its easy to generate why wouldn't there be canistered Ozone just like there is canistered [every gas there is]. Ozone has a half-life which is governed by temperature. It's claimed its because its an "unstable molecule" but its basically the exact same thing as a "nuclear" half-life.

       My understanding is the wavelength that creates ozone is absorbed strongly by the atmosphere in the process and doesn't reach so low. Of course we are far afield from my area here. Again: damnit Jim I'm an engineer not a physicist! :)

       I think this is actually the sequel mission, imaginatively named Hayabusa-2. That's what a long elliptical orbit around a body that is itself orbiting something else looks like. Consider a point moving around in an elliptical shape, then take that elliptical path and drag it in a circle around something else. The result will look like that image. The fact that the spacecraft moves faster at the periapsis of its orbit is one of Kepler's laws:

      <p>
       As for
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it obeys this (since Kepler's laws are only descriptive) it's Newton's law of universal gravitation which I'm sure you know.

      <p>
       For fun: You can get a similar looking effect (not exactly the same because it's moving along a line) by playing around with cycloids, here is an example image:

       I think the "ISIS" name was chosen after the Egyptian goddess. Though ISIS (terrorists) technically existed at the time the MRO was launched, I don't think hardly anybody knew who they were until 3 or 4 years ago. So in my opinion it really is a darkly humorous coincidence, like those poor people who were

       It wouldn't surprise me. I know celestial bodies are named after various pantheons. Jupiter and it's moons (many of which are named for the big guy's various lovers) are Greco-Roman, so are the rest of the planets and their moons. Of course the asteroids are all over the place, from Vesta (Roman) to Haumea (Hawaiian) and many others.

       Nefarious is a loaded word. Many people who keep secrets do so for the benefit of others [or what they perceive as a necessary evil]. Though others react in opposition to that because they don't want to be protected - or they are seeking deeper meaning or truth. And for gain as well.

       <em>
        aware
       </em>
       of something. Awareness can be described as [true] understanding the small and large implications of the environment. Which is basically wisdom. True sentiments that aren't overly specific applying across many situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't meant to imply nefarious action simply a statement of understanding.

       Ok, sorry for the wording. Still totally at a loss to what the pattern might mean. IMO it's just people making cultural references with the names. Ancient folks regarded the planets as symbolic of deities. Even though today we understand they're not, the naming convention continues  and bleeds over  to related subjects.

       What do you mean by "stationary location"?  Stationary in relation to what?  Everything in orbit is in motion around the earth's center of gravity, it's physically impossible just to "hang" in space -- in such a case the object would just plummet straight down to the earth at constant acceleration of 1 g.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would NASA send up a camera to just record HD video for 24 hours straight?  That would require a ridiculous huge amount of storage space given the weight and transmission limitations of spacecraft.  If you want, NASA does have

       sure that can be true but when you have a bunch of other inconsistencies from known liars people get suspicious. That is why flat earth is a major trending topic. Also cameras won't make whole continents appear different sizes. and delete the stars from the pictures. That is done with photoshop.

       Stars are much fainter than the Sun is, as well as the Earth and Moon (when they're lit up). They're not photoshopped out of these images, because exposure times short enough that the dayside Earth isn't washed out are too short for the stars to appear.

       every single star? really? plenty of photos and videos show the stars in the background. Plus if it was a real video we could see them adjusting the exposure to go from washing out the earth to viewing the stars. Why are you guys so brainwashed to believe the globe?

       Sure, plenty of photos at night, or composites do. In fact there is some good ISS video where you can see the nightside Earth and some of the stars at once. This is just some random guy's upload, the first one I could find:

       The problem is when the Earth is much brighter (during the day) you have a hard time with the exposure settings.

       I "believe" in the globe because I have proved it for myself, with radio moonbounce and other work that only functions in the established model of the solar system.

       these are fake. I know because I have experience making 3d images and editing photos with photoshop. You can tell because if you compare what a know real video looks like flying over a surface. The ground doesn't behave like that. This video from the ISS looks heavily edited. First it gives the appearance that the globe is small. The bottom of the image and the top move at the same speed unlike real life. In a real situation the objects farther away appear to grow slowly while the objects in the foreground rush past the camera. Its all perspective. 
look up any video of anything flying where you are looking the ground to see what I mean. 
These fake ISS videos are just a regular video from the cockpit of plane flying and then they added a bunch of effects. like the artificial curve .

       No. If you believe the video to be CGI, explain how you believe it is done in real time during the streams. I know it's not, and I'm not going to explain something I don't believe in.

       How does GPS work, then? Keep in mind you can look up open source GPS receiver code to check out how it works yourself:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these programs only work with the assumption of a round Earth with satellites in orbit overhead. If you don't believe it, download one of them, check the code out for yourself, and run it to see if it works.

       it's just another still picture.  I want to see real time un edited video. It doesn't have to be live. But this is 2017 it really should be live.

      <p>
       This unedited video should show the stars in the background and some satellites flying over the globe. Stars should be consistent with the actual position for that time the video was recorded and so should the weather patterns.

       OP should be vindicated, because the sun is clearly spinning around the Earth in this video, and this video proves the Earth doesn't spin at all.

       Except this is obviously CGI mindfuckery designed to keep everyone from discovering the truth, just as Flat Earth is a distraction from the

       this one is FAKE AF as well. why dont the clouds move in this one? for me if nasa has faked one image they faked them all. Imagine lying to your girlfriend.. now your girlfriend thinks you lie all the time. Rightfully so... because once a liar always a liar.

       I watched it all. like 3 people posted links to the same video. You can see the distinct line of the globe and no stars in the background obviously fake. Where is the atmosphere? it's gone? lolol. The clouds move the tiniest bit in the very end of the video yes I saw that but did you also notice the distortion of the clouds to bend to a sphere shape? It's like nintendo 64 graphics. lmao.

       If you've never seen the real sky, check out a weather radar or cloud cover map online. You can watch the clouds move over your whole region live. Clouds move quite a bit, and far over the course of a couple hours, which you should easily see over a time lapse video.

       That's 1/4 the whole diameter and not necessary to see clouds moving. The clouds over 200 miles should move quite a bit over a 6 hour or more time lapse video just as they would in an interactive weather map. 2000 miles of clouds moving would be much more pronounced. I'd like to see video of weather maps or cloud cover maps and compare them to the NASA "globe" video of the same date and time.

       2000 miles would not be more pronounced 😂😂 it would have to move a much farther distance for it to have a similar amount movement. If they're moving the same speed it would look like the bigger map moves a lot less than the smaller map

       no. The ISS footage flys from the dark side to the light side all the time. That video is fake AF as well though. Just inconsistent with everything else.

       The exposure settings change with time, but to get both the light and the dark in a single frame with both being detailed is different. You could do an HDR image but that would require multiple exposures

       2000 miles would not be more pronounced 😂😂 it would have to move a much farther distance for it to have a similar amount movement. If they're moving the same speed it would look like the bigger map moves a lot less than the smaller map

       I'm not sure if you're proposing that the earth is flat, you do seem to be skeptical of a 'globe' theory, but I'll assume you do believe the earth to be flat. I cannot present a video as proof,  it could be falsified, what I will do is pose two questions. First, explain a theory of tectonic plates and the shifting of the crust from the perspective of a non globular planet. Second, how would a satellite remain fixed in a position relative to a flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a third question for the hell of it, given the number of satellites in earths orbit, and the multiple countries and private agencies that have launched these satellites, how likely is it that a flat earth would remain controversial? Additionally, what benefit would come to those who held that knowledge?

       Looking into the Hayabusa now. It's weird we are spending so much time tracking down various projects and photos that don't really meet the expectation or specifics of the desired image - when the Jewel Box photo matches it perfectly.

       You claim the stars and the constellations are in the same relative position to each other correct? Prove it. It's an easily falsifiable claim.
