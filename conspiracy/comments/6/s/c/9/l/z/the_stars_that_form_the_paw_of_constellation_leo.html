        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the Revelation 12 Sign speaks of only 9 of Leo&#39;s stars, what if the remaining that make up Leo&#39;s paws, Omicron Leonis primarily, is the prophetic red dragon that will move between us and the sun for a period of 3 hours on September 23rd, 2017. 33 days after the North American solar eclipse. </p>

<p>Personally, I believe the Feast of Trumpets that is signaled on September 23rd, 2017 will be the beginning of tribulation. In 2020, as war rages on, the false messiah will announce his presence and by then the average human will almost be begging him to rule them because they would have wanted a messiah for so long. It is my belief that the rapture will occur soon after this. Thus signaling our adversary has only 3.5 more years before Yeshua&#39;s 2nd coming.. </p>

<p>And he shall tremble with fear although in front of no man. For the son of perdition understands his Father&#39;s wrath. He is fearful of just how long his personal Hell is going to be when he is thrown into the Lake of Fire that will ultimately cleanse him. He will relive and endure every terrible thing he has done and will be so stricken with fear behind the curtains that he will rampage and make his last final attempt to harvest any energy you lend through worship. Which transpires to be the Great Tribulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are a mid-tribulationist, correct (halfway through the tribulation the rapture occur)?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on pre-tribulation rapture?  </p>

<p>To me, a pre-trib rapture would be the perfect scenario to kick off the chaos, that is, to release the 4 horsies of the apocalypse.  And it would signal the 7 year trib in the process.  I can see how a mid-trib rapture would work also as well however.  </p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m right in what I&#39;m understanding, the verse that sways me to a pre-trib rapture is &quot;10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.&quot; (book of Revelation, chapter 3:10 - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3&amp;amp;version=KJV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3&amp;amp;version=KJV</a>).  However, I can see how that verse could apply to the mark of the beast &quot;line&quot; that is drawn, in which the mid-trib rapture makes sense.</p>

<p>Again, to me, a pre-trib rapture is very useful in creating chaos (and exangel led humans believing it was &quot;aliens&quot; that did it) and unifying the world, and also releasing the red, black, and pale horses quickly thereafter, then leading to the mark-of-the-beast economic system to fix everything, and then worshipping the one who provides the solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree whole-heartedly that it could be/is murder.  Murder is defined as unlawful and premeditated.  If God kills a being, it is lawful, therefore, not murder.  If anyone but Got kills, it is not lawful, thus murder.</p>

<p>Also, for those who are not raptured or if the rapture is mid-trib,   what will happen is when one does not accept the mark-of-the-beast and does not worship false deities, that being gets their head chopped off for refusing the system/refusing to worship.  So there will be some remnant of believers in God/Jesus who will not worship false beings and gets their head chopped off - that is, murdered.  The question is, will those people have been left behind or will they be the same as the believers?  Rhetorical question, as only God/Jesus know....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth of how these times will be played out will be revealed to anyone who truly seeks it out. Until the rapture God will willingly show you the path to salvation. </p>

<p>It is my understanding that those of us who have seeked answers whole heartedly have recently been shown the ways in which we shall die soon. This in my opinion has been marked by the animal of which you saw in that particular dream with the fiery red eyes. </p>

<p>It is true. Those of us who are re incarnated as the prophets of old and those of us who will not bend to Satan&#39;s Will, will be murdered at the hands of those who reject God&#39;s final messages and take his mark. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, as I can see arguments for both.  I can see how the bodies of those alive will vanish, like Enoch and Jesus (those two are precedents that it can happen), and I do think this is more likely, although, that would be for people currently &quot;alive&quot;, as those &quot;dead&quot; are taken as well, which means it&#39;s just the soul/consciousness. </p>

<p>However, I can see the soul (or soul plus consciousness) only being taken, meaning the meat-suits of those &quot;alive&quot; will be left here.</p>

<p>I lean more to a sudden catching-up/vanishing, mainly because precedents of vanishings occurring in the Holy Bible with Enoch and Jesus.  Check out these verses in the Holy Bible (1 Corinthians chapter 15:52, and 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:16-17).  Check out this website for more information on why this makes sense: <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/last-trumpet.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/last-trumpet.html</a></p>

<p>Sorry for all the information.  Only God knows though, the rest, is faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive had a dream when i was 14 years old. In the dream i went to a fortune teller. At first she didnt want to tell me what she saw, but after i kept askng her, she told me: You will have 7 years safely to live.</p>

<p>I had this dream 4 years ago. So, if this dream is true, i have 3 more years safely to live. 
2017+3= 2020.</p>

<p>Maybe this dream meant that in 2020 a war will happen?</p>

<p>Anyways i dont know a lot about dreams. I never remember what i was dreaming. This dream is one of the only dreams i can remember.</p>
