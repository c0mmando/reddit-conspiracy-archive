       I was talking to my girlfriend on the  phone about a  job tonight and i said i wouldnt be able to take it because my driving record probably would not be good enough to acquire a CDL, i never searched anything on google relating to that subject and i suddenly started noticing CDL training  ads popping up. A few other things i have noticed were advertisements for rings and honeymoon destinations which we have talked about but i have never searched for anything online about that. Have any of you noticed anything similar with ads?

       This is exactly it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always hear about these "It heard me say something then gave me an ad stuff", and i know of course some apps will do that while they listen in on you, but there is also the aspect that people always forget that everyone in your phone is linked and it builds a web of social media which they likely have done countless analyses on to determine who would likely best influence other people in their social network and what ads would be effective in that sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know because i have never had that happen to me until the other day i got an ad for a casino that i know is local to me and i go to all the time but have never got an ad from before on facebook. Then later that day my gf calls me and tells me she's looking up concerts at that casino and i figure out that since we're both on facebook it linked us together and targets us with similar ads. I'm sure other services utilize similar tactics like g+ and twitter etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       it's likely that many convos people have about buying something or going somewhere they've googled either before or after this event. So of course you'll see ads relating but it could be from other people you know googling it not just you.

       Don't you have to give the Facebook app permission to use your microphone in order to use it? I feel like I read a whole thing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say it's so they can listen in the background for "songs playing or TV shows your watching"... or, ya know, the private conversations that you're having with friends and loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I deleted the Facebook app well over a year ago for this reason.

       Congrats! don't just delete the app... delete your entire account. You can google how to download a backup of your FB so you can keep all the pictures and what-not (that was my biggest thing) and you can permanently delete it (not just deactivate it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I did this about 3 years ago and I never regretted it one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to get my Gf to delete hers. I was talking to her about my travel hack cc's (she doesn't even have a credit score let alone a cc) and her FB started advertising Chase travel cards (the ones you need 730+ credit score to get) on nearly every page she visited. She never googled anything about it on her laptop and she doesn't have the FB app on her phone. She goes on FB from google chrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure how they're recording us, but FB 100% is and I would bet a bunch of other sites are too!

       You're welcome! I have since tried to log back in and it says the account doesn't exist, which tells me I can't get it back if I wanted to. I would highly recommend deleting it, not just deactivating it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing that you can download all the content helps too. I think that's a big reason more people don't delete it - They don't want to lose all the memories they put on there in the past 5-10 years. I'll be honest though - I haven't looked at the backup content since I deleted it 3+ years ago. It's just nice to know I still have it.

       Just delete Facebook and remove the app from your phone. Or at least remove the app from your phone and use it over a browser if you need to. Same goes for Google. I use duckduckgo as an alternative. Oh and snapchat.

       It's weird and I'm sure that it has to do with the actual phone and not facebook, facebook is just the vehicle to sell the ads. The phone  is whats collecting the data.

       They still have found clever ways to get information if you have an android, the gps finds out where you work and where you live based on your schedule. whoever you call gets searched so they know every business you have called.

       What I always tell people -
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a FB and FB is a multi-billion dollar a year company, but how much money have you ever given them directly? None.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if that's the case do you think you're a customer? If you don't give them money and they offer you a service I'd argue you're actually the product.

       I don't know mate. its all tied together. my fake online persona I am on my phone on reddit on my work computer on reddit. no facebook, snapchat, or any other social media but everything else is powered by google who also doesn't charge me for their services. I have noticed search results pop up first for something we were just talking about. IT IS ALL TIED TOGETHER. are you on the internet? do you have a smart phone? do you have any information at all anywhere on the web? always watching you monitoring you listening to you. selling everything you are doing.

       Actually they have a lot of info. They know your location (unless you use vpn), what you're interested in and what device your using. If they compare that to info from other sources they can pin point who you are exactly.

       I'm not saying I'm invisible, but I do try to make it a bit harder for them to figure out who I am then to simply post it all openly. But yeah I agree, it takes a TON of work to stay completely invisible, which I'm sure if they cared to know who you were they probably still could.

       Nobody should have the Facebook app on their phone.  The mobile site works fine for most folks.
The app plays a silent audio track in the background at all times. It is always on no matter what you do.

       If you want to figure out if your phone is really listening, put it in front of a radio or TV on a channel in a different language like Spanish and see if the ads change language.

       Facebook has admitted to using audio fingerprinting to identify songs and TV shows in the background to serve you targeted advertisements. They claim this only occurs when you intentionally activate the microphone (for a voice call or voice-to-text) and that the information is never tied to your profile.
       <br/>
       As I mentioned in a post earlier today, some advertisers are now broadcasting ultrasonic tones in media (and in stores) that can be picked up by certain apps to track you or tie your IRL identity to your online identity.

       ok fair... i know about all the spying since it was revealed...well i was suspicious before...but i suffer from a over active imagination...i still somewhat believe the planet x/nibiru theory...i sometimes think im just a nut case...and that "my phone isnt listening to me" ...i have too many people that oppose my opinions and thoughts so i just stay quite and keep it to myself, this is the first time someone else that given an example like this, at least i have noticed

       realistically though, its not so much spying as it is advertising research/targeting. Do they do anything else with the information they get, well probably, but at least from an aspect where we can actually see the results, it seems to be used specifically with ad targeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my personal experience, so far it has been more of a convenience then a nuisance, but maybe that is just what they want me to think....

       I thought it was pretty common knowledge that smart devices are listening at all times, how could they be initiated by and respond to voice commands otherwise?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard
       <em>
        anecdotal
       </em>
       evidence that someone started watching Mexican soap operas to help improve their Spanish and after a while their phone started serving adverts in Spanish! I'd take it with a pinch of salt unless I was able to reproduce it.

       He probably posted about it on some form of social media after buying it, as people often do. "Look at this new thing I got that you don't have!"

       Alright, now take off your addblock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Printscreen the screen and count all the adds. All. And not in facebook but some more neutral thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Count all the concerts, count all the items, everything they want you to buy and every event they invite you to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then count from those the events and items that are
       <em>
        strangely
       </em>
       private to you.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         It doesn't count that Metallica is playing, everyone listens to it. So if 80% of your friends know the band, item, it doesn't count.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No generalizing. "Hey, I eat food, they are showing me food!" The item needs to be specific, like a specific adapter or 20 year old movie without a sequel.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The conversation in reference needs to be recent. "Hey I talked to Bil about Detroit 6 months ago and here is a travel agency mentioning Detroit!!!" It has to be recent and specific.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You must be completely sure that you have never mentioned that or googled it online. You must be sure that you had the conversation completely unrelated. If you talked about "Bob's Burgers" because they have an advert on the radio, you can be sure the company will have adverts other places too. So it needs to be completely random. And you have to be sure that the conversation partner has also not googled it. If they tag you in FB constantly and you both use the same IP (and whatever other algorithms may hide there) it's a closed case.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So do all this. Critically check the amount of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       coincidences there. Of course, what you perceive as "real" and how big of a number you will need so that something is "proven" is completely up to you. Still, I suggest you do all these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not me denying this shit happens. This is approaching it scientifically not to denounce, but to continue the investigation, so to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you see that there are some wicked shit showing up, try to figure out where did the "leak" happen. If it is a phone conversation, a real conversation near Smart devices or a purchase in Walmart, act accordingly. Check that shit out. If it was a conversation on phone, call your friend and talk about "Planning a trip to Ontario", "Buying a Lexus S3214". Make sure the examples are very specific but, at the same time, something still in the market. Then monitor all the adverts and count how many you see til a relevant one pops up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should not be idle sitting around in a wank-circle and telling spooky stories to each other. Check this shit out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me myself, I have also noticed these adverts. But they have always been in connection to things I've done on the internets. I do not have phone conversations often and I don't live in an English speaking country, so I'm not a good "example" or data point.

       I remember several times my wife and I talking about stuff and then ads popping up on my phone, and it happens quick enough that it doesn't slip my mind that I was just talking about that, supposedly if you leave your phone next to your TV and have the Spanish channel on you'll start seeing ads in Spanish, haven't ever tried it though.

       I know they record and use conversation, but I kind of feel like it's reading my mind sometimes too. I know that sounds so crazy. Random things I only think about and then notice popping up. I'm trying to test it lately, thinking about something random and specific, not mentioning it at all and waiting to see if it pops up.

       Didn't they come up with an update on how they are gonna hear people talk? I wouldn't worry much about the ads. I do know it is algorithm based. Google itself can't track everything about where they appear. But they can always sell your info to marketers.

       I would worry about it because this is not where it will end. These are baby steps in monitoring us. Don't you see that everything always starts harmless and benign [otherwise people wouldn't agree]. 
It is at these early points that you should start worrying where it will go. But because most people don't [you included], you get slowly boiled, like the famous frog.

       Actually, I still use cell phone for that exact reason despite how much people tried to shame me about it. As I said earlier, the ads are harmless. I have them. I took a look inside adword also. Those are not the problem.

       I've mentioned things we need to fix around the house. Never googled them or called for any estimates. Within days, sometimes hours, i will get an email from Craigslist with offers that are so specific to what I've talked about fixing. I emailed them and asked them and got the generic response. "We respect your privacy, it's what the deals are in your area, etc." Apparently everyone in my zip code needed their dryer vent cleaned out, their living room painted, their bathroom remodeled, a new backdoor, an awning, and sod.

       Last week I was listening to an audiobook which was some guy's memoirs.  In one chapter this guy learns his accountant has embezzled his savings and the guy is broke and can't pay his mortgage or his bills.  The next day the ads on my computer were all related to this topic:  getting out of financial difficulty, need help with a loan etc.  It wasn't me talking but the words of the narrator of the audio book played from my phone that google (on my laptop) responded to.  So the eavesdropping tech isn't perfect yet.

       I deleted Facebook from my phone for this reason.  Too many times stuff would come up related to phone conversations I'd had.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example:  I was on the phone with a friend telling him how I had grieved over a certain childhood situation and was now feeling like a psychological block was removed since doing just 5 minutes of crying over this situation.  This would be a very unusual conversation for me, not the kind of thing I normally talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day there was an ad on Facebook for therapy.  Never seen anything like that before or since.  Creeped me out.

      <hr/>
      <p>
       Every time you go shopping, you share intimate details about your consumption patterns with retailers. And many of those retailers are studying those details to figure out what you like, what you need, and which coupons are most likely to make you happy. Target TGT +0.52%, for example, has figured out how to data-mine its way into your womb, to figure out whether you have a baby on the way long before you need to start buying diapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charles Duhigg outlines in the New York Times how Target tries to hook parents-to-be at that crucial moment before they turn into rampant -- and loyal -- buyers of all things pastel, plastic, and miniature. He talked to Target statistician Andrew Pole -- before Target freaked out and cut off all communications -- about the clues to a customer's impending bundle of joy. Target assigns every customer a Guest ID number, tied to their credit card, name, or email address that becomes a bucket that stores a history of everything they've bought and any demographic information Target has collected from them or bought from other sources. Using that, Pole looked at historical buying data for all the ladies who had signed up for Target baby registries in the past. From the NYT:
      </p>
      <p>
       [Pole] ran test after test, analyzing the data, and before long some useful patterns emerged. Lotions, for example. Lots of people buy lotion, but one of Pole’s colleagues noticed that women on the baby registry were buying larger quantities of unscented lotion around the beginning of their second trimester. Another analyst noted that sometime in the first 20 weeks, pregnant women loaded up on supplements like calcium, magnesium and zinc. Many shoppers purchase soap and cotton balls, but when someone suddenly starts buying lots of scent-free soap and extra-big bags of cotton balls, in addition to hand sanitizers and washcloths, it signals they could be getting close to their delivery date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or have a rather nasty infection...
      </p>
      <p>
       As Pole’s computers crawled through the data, he was able to identify about 25 products that, when analyzed together, allowed him to assign each shopper a “pregnancy prediction” score. More important, he could also estimate her due date to within a small window, so Target could send coupons timed to very specific stages of her pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One Target employee I spoke to provided a hypothetical example. Take a fictional Target shopper named Jenny Ward, who is 23, lives in Atlanta and in March bought cocoa-butter lotion, a purse large enough to double as a diaper bag, zinc and magnesium supplements and a bright blue rug. There’s, say, an 87 percent chance that she’s pregnant and that her delivery date is sometime in late August.
      </p>
      <p>
       And perhaps that it's a boy based on the color of that rug?
      </p>
      <p>
       So Target started sending coupons for baby items to customers according to their pregnancy scores. Duhigg shares an anecdote -- so good that it sounds made up -- that conveys how eerily accurate the targeting is. An angry man went into a Target outside of Minneapolis, demanding to talk to a manager:
      </p>
      <p>
       English: Photograph of abdomen of a pregnant woman
Target knows before it shows.
“My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”
      </p>
      <p>
       The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Nice customer service, Target.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”

       Welcome to the Internet - not as it was, but how it became - where individual/corporate data patterns is the most-precious-resource mined for social coercion and further development by those now in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little more than fifteen years ago this was a fringe concern, then
       <em>
        conspiracy
       </em>
       theory, now unsettling reality. Everything you do, say,
       <em>
        and soon
       </em>
       think has/is/will be utilized as the primary means of social prediction and control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suggestions: stay clear of
       <em>
        social
       </em>
       and moreso
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       apps , sites, and services unless you have measures in place to limit reference to your actual individual. Know that
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       expressed or researched on or around "connected" devices is susceptible to outside access and will be used to influence everything you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       For most, it's too late to
       <em>
        keep your individual privacy.
       </em>
       Data captured years ago, in the infancy of the Web and social apps/sites, is already out there, and likely sufficient to have established a comprehensive profile on one's ideology, preferences, and future tendencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you intend to wipe what you have access to, then unplug and remain off-grid for the remainder of your life, these intrusions on individual privacy and sovereignty are part of our digital age.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have
       <em>
        nothing to hide
       </em>
       , right?

       Get used to it, everything do or say is being logged and collected somewhere and all fed into an AI driven D-wave that can chew you up and spit you out in less than a nanosecond. The more info it compiles the less what is throws at you is anything like a second guess and more like mind-reading in real time and that's the end game.

       I walked past a wood splitter in Sears and it was a nice design and cheap. I mentioned to my wife that we will have one of them when we move to our new property next year and that this is a reasonable price. I have never searched for them. I do not facebook.

       Ive had this happen to me before back when I was doing some construction gig. Most of the other employees only spoke spanish, so I spoke it too in order to communicate with them. We were also using multiple generators, as the house we were working on hadnt been wired electrically wired yet. At the end of the day while I was home, I was getting ads on FB, and twitter for generators, and those ads were in spanish. Pretty creepy stuff

       Are you sure your girlfriend hasn't been using your computer to search those things? Also, you're going for a job that requires a CDL and you've never even tried to find out what the requirements are? Guess what, you're probably not gonna get the job.

       By now, I figure that everything every human does, while being hooked up to WiFi, is tracked. To the government, we're a social security #. That number, I am sure, is tracked as it is attached to basically every phone you've bought, every laptop, every blue tooth item. It's all in our names and can be tracked. I'm sure they know what we like to eat, what our psychology is like, what porn we prefer, where we spend our time, what we plan to do in the future, how we're feeling, who we talk to, I mean literally everything. All they have to do is go into the super computer they have and check our SSN. I'm sure everything about us pops up. Everything has been tracked and we've been fed this technology without being told what it's really being user for. All of this tech is so that we can be monitored. It's so that we can

       I made up a totally fake Facebook account just for shits and giggles to see what notifications I would receive.  First I made up an email account using gmail.  Only used this for Facebook and nothing else.  Made up my fake Facebook account with just utter bullshit.  Now I sat back and waited.  Also, I never logged into this on my phone or any type of app.  Just my pc at work.  After about 1 week or so I logged into that gmail account, which also was never logged into by my phone, I had numerous notification emails suggesting friends (I never friended anyone when I made the account)  The people it was suggesting I make contact with were people I actually knew personally or knew of.  How in the fuck did it know who I was?  I have zero personal info on my work pc other than the outlook email server that we use that's passworded.  I could of understood the ads because of browser history but It knew who I was and who I know personally.

       Because it had the same login IP address as your real account, so Facebook assumed it was another member of your household. With no information about you searching for people or friends, phone numbers or people who had that email address it fell back on the lowest common denominator which was location.

       Well, the data companies are most likely profiling each and every individual. The amount of data they gather through gps/bluetooth/IoT is powerful enough as it seems, according to your description. I wouldn't be surprised if my phone gave google every single information it can get from my environment. Be it IP codes/WLAN access points and other technical information. After all your phone is searching for that stuff on it's own on a constant basis.

       Here is a little info for you.  It's from 12 years ago.  Please keep that in mind that this is what we had over a decade ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I contracted to a small "credit rating" company.  No sign on the building, no website.
       <br/>
       They had an incredible about of data on 93 million US citizens.  I'm talking every time the major discount grocery card users swiped, it was minutes before the had the data.  Bank transactions through major credit companies, utility bills, all of it was aggregated an analyzed.
       <br/>
       Here is where it freaked me out (12 years ago).  You spend $1,283.12 at Best Buy (random example, may or may not have participated).  The company knows, by comparison of the cost sheet, that you either bought one specific television model, two laptops, 12 washing machines or 1,000 movies.  It weights the probabilities.  Not long after the additional power you use after you get home at 5:30pm matches that specific model of television.  The match is now certain.
       <br/>
       Here is a fun one for you.  Next time you go through a toll booth or some round about, ask yourself this.  "What information was just pulled from my tire pressure sensors?"...

       Your phone is listening. So is Alexa, your gaming console, your nice "smart" tv and remote. Hell even your "smart" meter is a surveillance tool to monitor you.

       So I'm glad I have no social media footprint. None. Not saying that to be cool. It's giving up too much personal freedom. I've never ever had a Facebook account.
      </p>

       I'm not even on Google search which is a small miracle since I have a unique last name.

       Oh yes!  Same thing with me and my partner.  We were talking on Skype about certain stuff and then when we open our FB, ads related to what we were talking about just popped out.  Not only that man, one time we bought a box of this English Breakfast Tea using our credit card.  When I got home and logged in on FB, there it was - an ad of the English Breakfast Tea that we bought.  Yes, same brand and all.  There's no privacy anymore!

       Google is definitely listening in as well.  I've lost count of the number of times I have been talking with someone about something totally random that I've never googled before and what happens next?  I go to the google search bar and type in the first three letters and like magic exactly what I'm looking for pops up.  It's getting worse too, I've been tempted to break my phone many times over the last few months.

       It's actually been happening over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year, in June, I visited my grandparents farm.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the dinner table, I mentioned a dish my mom makes some times with kale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never searched kale on any device, or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally less than two hours later I had an ad on Instagram (owned by FB) for kale.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty creeped out by it, but mostly amused at how poorly aimed their targeted ad was (I hate kale).
      </p>
      <p>
       However I've noticed the ads are becoming more finely tuned to my lifestyle.

       The other day I was telling someone that they might consider uninstalling the facebook app and only using the web interface if they were concerned with privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not 2 minutes later I opened the facebook mobile page in safari and was greeted with a banner at the top, which I had never seen before, telling me how great the app was and that I should install it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea how it even caught that but I almost feel like it was just to fuck with me.

       Do you have the Facebook app? I read a story where english speaking people left their phone next to a Spanish speaking radio for hours, with only the Facebook app installed (but not open) on their phone, and they started getting ads in Spanish. I can't confirm this is true or not, but it wouldn't surprise me.

       Yup. I mentioned to my buddies that "After a good night of drinking, Pedialyte will cure what ails you"... 2 days later I started getting ads for pedialyte almost word for word what I originally said. Neeeeeever seen a pedialyte ad in my life. I also caught my phones mic on at random times. It would suddenly do the beep when it is waiting for you to talk.

       I was at the bar yesterday and searched my phone for vacations at sandals in Barbados when a commercial for sandals Barbados comes on the tv. I understand searching and it coming up on my Facebook, Reddit or twitter feed but a tv in a random bar, an ad about one of the more obscure sandals locations?

       it happens to me all the time. It's most likely your phone. Read the terms and conditions of apps. You allowed them access to all kinds of stuff including your microphone. Same reason they say not to talk about finances in front of the newer Samsung TVs.

       I had a very odd case happen too me. I had a friend thatsthat's Finnish and I'd never heard conversational Finnish. I asked if he could give me a sample. He talked for about 3 minutes. I had my phone in my hand but not on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day I'm browsing Reddit and the sidebar ad is an ad entirely in Finnish. I had never and since seen an ad in any language other than English or Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only 2 explanations are coincidence. Or someone is listening.

       Yes I know exactly what you mean. It's happened to me recently too (bringing up ADT adds and I only mentioned it once on the phone). It's crazy to see someone else post this.

       Happened to me a few months ago. At work, another department got new (specialized) computers in. I had been discussing the new computer systems with a colleague of mine, a few hours later, lo and behold - here's an advertisement for the computer systems we were discussing on my facebook feed.

       Yes it's mostly generated by Facebook, in their terms they specifically say that you agree to allow them to listen through your mic for certain things like ads

       This has been happening to me a lot lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was getting my hair done and commented on a cool lamp in the salon. The girl said 'thanks i got it on wayfair!' I had never heard of this site, never been on it. Next time I check Instagram, I see an ad for wayfair. 
This has happened at least 3 other times with things that I have no digital record of, only spoken. And here's the kicker. My mic is 'off'.

       It is absolutely a phenomenon. A common one even. I was once telling my friend about a specific tattoo artist opening up a private studio in my city, and Facebook almost immediately created an advertisement for that studio using it's FB page, and posted it in my feed
