       Ok I have some slight insomnia and so after I got called "toxicly masculine" the other day (soon afterwards it was changed to just "surface level toxic masculinity" which I think is just a petty way of saying if you first met me you could think I am some kind of Chad but let me assure you I am in no way a Chad) which spurred me to research more about it because I was taken aback by it, and then I told my bro who has similar views to me and he said it was an effort by cultural marxists to feminize the west. The more I read into it tho, it was just a bunch of people who think they're hot shit for being PC immediately dismissing it as a conspiracy then going on and on about how the people who buy it are just anti-Semites and racists. This bothered me because I definitely understand how too much cultural marxism (at least my understanding of what that means) can be a real problem due to the reliance on ad hominem attacks like "racist", "misogynist", and the like to be employed when they cant counter an argument; yet I would not consider myself to be any of those kind of things I believe everyone should have equal opportunity and the like because anything else is irrational IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that made sense I haven't been able to fall asleep for 2 days so please forgive me if my English sucks but anyways that leads me to my questions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is it possible that so called "cultural marxists" are actually well intentioned but have just resorted to name calling when I am not satisfied by their assessment that the masculine/feminine dynamic is inherently toxic?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why does it seem that being PC makes people feel superior? Those same people are sometimes just rude, mean, and most importantly won't have a calm rational discussion about how they may be turning people away from their cause by acting like they have the moral high ground and calling people like me toxic when I am in no way trying to opress people!! (I mean come on, just because I lift and drive a truck, stop labeling stuff as masculine and feminine it is counter to your cause of breaking down stereotypes) I just wonder if it's because of how the media is doing things or if they just think yelling at people and calling them names for saying retard once makes them defenders of those who can't defend themselves or something would love to hear what y'all think.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Could the fact that any mention of cultural marxism is dismissed simply for being a conspiracy theory could have anything to do with disinfo campaigns? (flat earth theory is the one that always comes to mind for me)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do any of you have people you know who you don't agree with on this sort of stuff and they label you then act super rude instead of having a discussion? How do you deal with this? (Maybe with this topic it's either you're with me or you're a white supremacist idk it's confusing when did people stop being able to talk to each other about issues like this damn)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If you read all that I love you and if not I totally understand sleep deprivation is one hell of a drug stay woke my brothers and sisters, I apologize if this is scattered as fuck I just have been doing a lot of thinking and I have never made a post here so yeehaw.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR I realized cultural marxism is and am trying to better articulate why I think it has gone too far

       Cultural Marxism is the degeneration of culture in order to allow easy occupation and invasion by all of the west's enemies. When you weaken a nation's morale and unity enough, it becomes ripe for invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the enemies of the west include Israel, Vietnam, North Korea, Russia and China from the outside, as well as cooperating forces like Clinton, Obama, Trump, Macron, Merkel, Abe Shinzo and Justin Truedau from the inside. Together, all of these forces will bring the west to its knees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inner traitors are especially dangerous as they turn their host population's brains into mush, which is the purpose of cultural marxism, so it can be safely invaded without fail.

       Thanks for responding I've got a few questions about this
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think foreign nations such as the ones you mentioned are currently a part of the reason PC culture has grown like a cancer? I guess since the Frankfurt school was a Jewish organization (iirc) it would make sense that Israel could still be trying to fuck us up but it seems like the Zionists love their attack dog that kills Muslims for them too much to put it down just yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it too late for the west? I guess it seems like in Europe you can barely look at a minority weird without getting arrested (exaggerating but basically it's just a lil too hardcore PC) and in America liberals are absolutely taking control of all intellectual institutions and CNN/more MSNBC are very left leaning it just seems like time is running out if we can even stop it (prob not imo)

         Yes, Foreign Nations like Israel and Russia are the second most major propagators of cultural marxism. The most major are the traitors on the inside.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If everyone resists all of a sudden, say 70 percent of people in the world know what the hell is going on and start resisting by refusal to cooperate with global tyranny and illegitimate governments and the federal reserve, the globalist round table groups and the freemasons were actually driven away, it will be quickly over. Unfortunately, most do not have the bravery to do so.
        </p>

      <ul>
       <li>
        By mass incooperation i mean:
        <ul>
         <li>
          Public Schools begin to teach cultural marxism, all of the parents homeschool their children and refuse to go to the public schools
         </li>
         <li>
          European Union or Obama wants to export muslims and mexicans into the borders of the countries, all of the locals stand up and have an "to hell with them" position
         </li>
         <li>
          Every single citizen refuses to own a television and those who do throw it away or refuse to turn it on (It is a propaganda machine)
         </li>
         <li>
          Every single citizen boycotts all media and networks responsible for promoting cultural marxism in the internet
         </li>
         <li>
          Impeach and Arrest all presidents, congressman, attorneys and media outlets who have no purpose other than infiltrating and eating the country from the inside
         </li>
         <li>
          Abolish the federal reserve
         </li>
         <li>
          Whatever legit institutions remaining should be able to detect and drive away any agents that are suspected to degenerate the quality of the institution and bar them from any further education related jobs
         </li>
         <li>
          Legit Congressmen should refuse and reject any unconstitutional laws
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Remember, a civil war and violent revolution is what they EXACTLY want. Do not fall for it.

       That would be sweet as hell wouldn't be? I'd toss out cell phones too or at least educate people about the dangers of being addicted to your phone/social media. But yeah if only everyone was as concerned about the world around them then the world would be great but alas your average Joe couldn't give 2 shits about finding shit out for themselves they just read Trump tweets on CNN and get all the instant gratification they could ever want on the computer in their pocket.

       Any chance you could elaborate on what you mean by that? I guess I can see some connection between postmodernism but if I'm not mistaken postmodernism came after Frankfurt school correct?

       Good rant. Cultural Marxism is a made up term that shows no understanding of what Marx was all about, and can function as disinfo or at least can be very misleading. If you're upset that women are standing up for themselves against oppression, if you're frustrated because non-white people are demanding their human rights, you're part of the problem. Call me whatever you want. SJW, socialist, marxist, libertarian, whatever. Just don't call me made up words that make no sense. I'm not a child.
       <br/>
       "Pff that's just more cultural marxism" is like saying I don't care about history, language or meaning and I like to combine words I don't understand.

       You ignored the part where I said I had more problems with ad hominem attacks which if I'm reading your comment correctly you implied I was both a racist and a misogynist which is not true. I have a problem when it goes "over the line" where the tactics employed by "cultural marxists" (which if you think that is not relating to Marx you gotta read up on why it's called that my dude) are actually harming their stated goals. Never did I mention or imply that i had a problem with people having equal opportunity because equal opportunity is the most equal a society can be in my opinion. The problem arises when people are so concerned about being PC they forget we are animals and so fighting nature trying to make boys into girls and vice versa is actually harming the society as a whole because they are ignoring the dynamic that allowed society to flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would appreciate if you fully read posts (maybe a 2nd time if you are confused) before doing the exact thing I get frustrated about. Thanks for your comment tho and I hope the ad hominems will stop because thats like admitting you have no counter to my argument.

       But just as any part of language, phrases and words can evolve. Of course cultural Marxism has nothing to do with Marx, but Marx would also turn in his grave if he saw most self proclaimed "communists" today. Cultural Marxism is a very real thing as a concept regardless of it's dissociation with Marx .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no coincidence that so many of the people in power seem to be pushing the exact same agendas and narratives, parroting each other in a giant echo chamber of "proggressivism."
      </p>
      <p>
       While the common brainwashed fool fighting for this cause does it because they believe that they are on the right side of history, a la the civil rights movement of the 60's, they are unaware of their corporate/deep state masters whose end goal is a borderless, globalist society. We are witnessing the first stages in the development of a new world order.

       Perhaps we can use different wording then, as Marxism stands against global capitalist empowerment.

       I have no problem with that, there's just a dissonance between people claiming that cultural Marxism doesn't exist because the original term was disinfo, and people who recognize the agenda that the use of  the term cultural Marxism today defines despite the accuracy of the title.

       Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School's critique of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">
        The Culture Industry
       </a>
       . It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them."
       </p>
       <p>
        "this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger."
       </p>
       <p>
        "The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape" -Theodor W. Adorno,
        <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">
         Enlightenment as mass-deception
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that "progressive politics" could also become repressive and regressive in it's own ways:
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and The Birmingham School warned that
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">
        culture was drifting away
       </a>
       from local culture. Due to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">
        Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That's when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">
        to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it's SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.

       For me "Cultural Marxism" is a bullshit concept that doesn't exist. What you call "Cultural Marxism" is, in fact, what Marxist thinkers like Gramsci, and even more so Walter Benjamin called "Fascism". Fascism is a derivation of socialism, a kind of twisting of it. Like Benjamin correctly indicated: "behind every Fascism you will find a failed revolution". There are several things that characterize Fascism, all of them being clearly present in SJW and identity politics mindset: a. Centering around immutable identities for their "liberation" and "unjust order". In Mussolinism it was of course the Italian nation. In Hitlerianism it was the Aryan race. In all cases you will find that a kind of immutable, vague identity ("the nation", "the race", "los descamisados" in Argentina, etc.) superseded the clear class-based preocupations that should have inevitably arisen as a byproduct of Capitalist economies. b. Conspiranoical revanchism. Not only are those identities the center of their policies, but such policies are revanchist. I.e., they seek justice through "revenge" against the "Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy", the "injustices of Versailles", "Yankee/British Imperialism", "the red scourge" and whatnot. In a way, failing to solve the social tensions produced by Capitalism, Fascism merely diverts the class struggle and converts it into a "national/identity struggle", which has no solution. The struggle perpetuates itself, and assures the supremacy of the Fascist leaders. Today, regressives use "patriarchy" and "systemic racism" to promote their revanchist policies. Such revanchism is, almost always, ultra-conservative solutions. They try to solve injustice with injustice - thus promoting segregation, mob rule and other things that make such people regressives. c. Essentialist conservatism. The identities that must be "liberated" in Fascism must be done by returning to a "essencial" point where said identities were not "corrupted" by whatever force made them oppressed. Spanish Francoist Fascism is the best example for this, though German Hitlerianism is also a case in point. For regressives, who are Fascists, there is a notion of "returning" to a moment when a mythical "black culture" as able to express itself in its "essence", before the corrupting influence of "white culture". Such mythical, ultraconservative aspect is present in both Fascist movements and regressive thought. So you see, it's not "Cultural Marxism". It's Fascism. There is one last thing why I disagree with you: you should know where the concept "Cultural Marxism" originated from. It came from what the Nazis called "Cultural Bolshevism", using it to denounce all modern art that broke traditional aesthetics and promoted all those thoughts that made us question the prevailing authorities and systems that dominate our current political, economic and cultural environment. When people denounce "Cultural Marxism", what they really mean want is to defend ultra-conservative notions of society, where people don't question the intrinsic injustices of the prevailing economic systems that grant us, first worlders, the comfortable lives at the cost of the masses of exploited labourers in sweatshops around the globe. Culture, especially art, is supposed to make us think, not conform. It seems to me that "Cultural Marxism" is a mere semantic mutation of "Cultural Bolshevism" in denouncing the questioning of our conformist cultural tendencies. I am sorry for making this very very long. These are the points I disagree with you here, though I love a nice insight into these things. Salut!﻿
