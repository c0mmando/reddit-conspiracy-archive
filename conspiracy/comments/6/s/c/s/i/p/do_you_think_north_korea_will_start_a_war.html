Since the world has decided to boycott even more trading with north korea, which will lead to poverty there. I think north korea soon has to make a choice. Either to apoligize and make deals with us or start throwing bombs.</p>

<p>Im not seeing the apoligies happening so....</p>

<p>What do you guys think?
Is there something more to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think America is possibly trying to get nk to start one. Sanctions on nk are the &quot;first shot&quot; that we&#39;ve taken more than once. But luckily for the nk people (and the rest of the world), Kim hasn&#39;t succumbed to the pressure.</p>

<p>We all know what would happen immediately following an attack on the US, South Korea, Japan... NK would be <strong>leveled</strong> within the hour. There&#39;s no questioning that.</p>

<p>So what happens if they don&#39;t ever attack? They&#39;re untouchable. <em>Because</em> they have nukes. If they didn&#39;t have nukes, they would&#39;ve long ago followed the path of Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and literally dozens of other countries who&#39;ve had different ideas, and then are suddenly invaded by the military of &quot;the good guys&quot; until they agree to join the evil banking system.</p>

<p>The <strong>last</strong> people on Earth who want a war with North Korea, are the people holding any amount of power or freedom within North Korea.</p>

<p>The intriguing part (in my opinion) is the image that the world has of life behind the scenes inside North Korea. Wretchedly poor, slave labor camps, general widespread squalor, eating styrofoam fruit just to keep their poor stomachs full. And all the while, brainwashed into believing that their fearless leader is somehow not the equivalent to Asian Hitler.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve never been there. I&#39;ve never met anyone who has. I&#39;ve never seen any evidence of slave labor or starvation (starvation that <em>isn&#39;t</em> caused by crippling sanctions). I&#39;ve only heard about it from..... the MSM. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever get to know what life is really like there. Because once it&#39;s blown to smithereens, the world will only be rejoicing, for they just saved so many &quot;slaves&quot; and set them free on the path to true <em>unrealized</em> slavery. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed!
But if north korea fires a bomb at america, will this bomb get unmantled? America is watching every action of NK, so i guess they will know when they fire a bomb.</p>

<p>And if they fire a bomb, do you think we will just drop a nuke on them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>If you really look into NK&#39;s actions internationally. Most of their threats make sense in the context of US threats of invasion and destruction. We killed something like 25% of their population in the 50s and they&#39;ve been paranoid and defensive ever since. I think it&#39;s more likely that Trump uses a nuke before NK does. From their perspective, having nukes is one of the only things preventing a US invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK never apologizes, it just will stop the rhetoric for a while.</p>

<p>The elites have a nice life in NK, but they know in the event of a war, that lavish life will be over. Since thr majority of thr elites are also in the military, I doubt this will go anywhere.</p>

<p>China doesn&#39;t want a war for many reasons. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>They don&#39;t want a united Korea. They see it as a threat. Just look into the history of China and Korea, it&#39;s pretty bloody </p></li>
<li><p>A war would result in the liberation of NK. That&#39;s 34 million starving, un skilled people who will start crossing boarders. There&#39;s not a lot you can do with them</p></li>
<li><p>China likes a buffer between them and the US. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the case that the regime falls (there has been a huge famine in NK, if the elites have to start rationing food, there could be a forced regime change) UN and NATO would essentially be called in, lock down the country, and set up economic zones. </p>

<p>It would be a WWII like scale of thousands of planes landing supplies to feed, house, and train the population, costing hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Or we could send them 2 billion in imported rice, and they will just STFU for about 3-4 months, which has been the norm the past 15 years at least. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s pretty doubtful. #1 priority for the regime is survival of the holy family and their system, and I think their nuclear-development belligerence is just tough guy posturing and consolidation of patriotism amongst the populace. Just as the US always needs a boogeyman poised to destroy our system, NK needs theirs. The Trump administration is happy to fall in line here. Any legit war will probably be spurred by CIA action, I guarantee China, Japan and South Korea want nothing to do with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been at war with North Korea since 1950. There was no peace treaty. The ceasefire has lasted for almost 64 years but the war isn&#39;t over yet.</p>

<p>I think North Korea is being goaded into breaking the ceasefire so America has an excuse to ignore the UN and spend US taxpayer&#39;s dollars on more Lockheed products and Blackwater contracts.</p>
