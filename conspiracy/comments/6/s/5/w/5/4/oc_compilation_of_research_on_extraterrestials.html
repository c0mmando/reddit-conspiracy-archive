       Hypothesis
      </h1>
      <p>
       There exists a relationship between sightings of UFOs, contact with Extraterrestial Intelligence, and Psychic Phenomena. Intelligence agencies across the globe have come to this conclusion and the reason for their silence on these topics is that they still do not have a full grasp on what exactly the implications of these topics will have on the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       To fully understand this relationship, we must get a grasp on each of these topics individually.

       is a method of perceiving non-local information of the universe using the power of human consciousness. The CIA began studying the potential of Remote Viewing at
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International">
        SRI
       </a>
       in the 1960's with the famous psychic

        Ingo Swann
       </a>
       . The two most famous physicists involved in these experiments were

       and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff">
        Hal Puthoff
       </a>
       who were very interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics which would allow for psychic abilities to operate.  Ingo was one of the first members of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project">
        Project StarGATE
       </a>
       which was the study performed by the CIA to determine the weaponization capability of psychic phenomena. The reason the CIA was so invested in this area of research was that the Soviets during the Cold War had spent over 20 million Rubies by 1973 on a similar remote viewing/telepathy program (
       <a href="http://blog.learnremoteviewing.com/?p=1562">

       technology. This paper shows Wayne McDonnell writing to a commander:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He then goes on to explain the foundations of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation">

       ,

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience">
        OBEs
       </a>
       and much more. He does all of this to lay out the idea that under altered states of consciousness the human brain is capable of perceiving nonlocal information and capable of interacting with a holographic underlying framework to the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       As if this isn't strange enough, there is a really shocking point at the end of this paper in McDonnell's conclusion. After describing how to induce the gateway experience in an individual, he states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeeded
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is important because it establishes precedent from a CIA document that human beings are capable of interacting with intelligent entities while being in an altered state of consciousness.

        Mars paper
       </a>
       with this new insight into the Gateway Experience we gain a better understanding of the purpose of the experiment. After having the subject place themselves on Mars at approximately 1 million B.C., the subject observes some type of mass geological event. He is asked to move in time to before this event, and we get the following interaction:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        SUB: I'm seeing ah.... It's like a perception of a shadow of people, very tall... thin, it's only a shadow. It's as if they were there and they're not, not there anymore.
       </p>
       <p>
        MON: Go back to a period of time where they are there.
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: I just keep seeing very large people. They appear thin and tall, but they're very large. Ah... wearing some kind of strange clothes.
       </p>
       <p>
        MON: All right, now holding in this time period, holding in this time period, I want to move from your physical location in space to another physical location, but in this time period.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So we find that the time of interest in this experiment was
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       the time period when some type of humanoids were supposedly living on Mars. The experiment then goes on to hit major geographic points on Mars where the subject describes Pyramids, Obelisks, and large megalithic structures. The experimenters are not remotely surprised to find humanoids on the surface of Mars, in fact it appears to be the entire purpose of the experiment: To observe geographic locations of Mars which might have once supported actual humanoid life over a million years ago. When the subject makes contact with another humanoid, we get the following exchange:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MON: Move close to one of them and ask them to tell you about themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: They're ancient people. They're ah... they're dying, it's past their time or age. They're very philosophic about it. They're looking for ah... a way to survive and they just can't seem to get their way out, they can't seem to find their way out... so they're hanging on while they look or wait for something to return or something coming with the answer...
       </p>
       <p>
        MON: What is is they're waiting for?
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: A group of a party of them that went to find ah...new place to live. It's like I'm getting all kinds of overwhelming input of the corruption of their environment. It's failing very rapidly and this group went somewhere, like a long way to find another place to live.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MON: All right, now before you leave this individual, ask him if there is any way that you, ask him if he knows who you are and is there any way you can help him in his present predicament?
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: All I get is that they must just wait. Doesn't know who I am. Think he perceives I'm just a hallucination or something.
       </p>
       <p>
        MON: Okay, when the others left, these people are waiting, when the others left, how did they go?
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: ... It looks like the inside of a larger boat. Very rounded walls and shiny metal.
       </p>
       <p>
        MON: Go along with them on their journey and find out where it is they go.
       </p>
       <p>
        SUB: Impression of a really crazy place with volcanos and gas pockets and strange plants, very volatile place, it's very much like going from frying pan into the fire. Difference is there seems to be a lot of vegetation where the other place did not have it. And different kind of storm.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From this interaction, we get the impression that this experiment yielded information showing a tall, thin humanoid race living on the surface of Mars with an impending cataclysm. These people then leave Mars and arrive on a different planet with different problems but at the least a large source of vegetation.

       Wikileaks files implying Government knowledge and interaction with ETI / UFOs

      <p>
       It is tough to convince people in a couple short paragraphs that the government is aware of extraterrestials and have had a relationship with them since at least the 1950's, so I don't intend to spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that this is the case. Instead I will cite documents which were released from Wikileaks to show you that at the very least there are official diplomatic cables and emails between high profile politicians and government officials which supports the idea that extraterrestials have visited Earth in the past and are more than likely still visiting us. This idea also includes the possibility that the Apollo program was not what it appeared to be at first glance.

        In ongoing requests for our Skype talk to discuss Disclosure and the difference between our contiguous universe nonviolent obedient ETI and the celestials of this universe, and because Hillary and Bill Clinton were intimates of Laurance Rockefeller who had an avid interest in ETI, I direct your attention to Scott Jones, PhD.
In Scott’s book Voices From the Cosmos, he describes himself as an octogenarian in full karmic payback made following 30 years in the military, half in combat arms and half in intelligence.
He references you in his ETI matter, as well as the Catholic Church.
Disclosure is now top priority for ETI itself in protection of the people.

        Because the War in Space race is heating up, I felt you should be aware of several factors as you and I schedule our Skype talk. Remember, our nonviolent ETI from the contiguous universe are helping us bring zero point energy to Earth. They will not tolerate any forms of military violence on Earth or in space.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        John, I would like to schedule a phone conversation at your earliest
convenience to discuss what I feel are intensifying imperatives for
extraterrestrial disclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years you and I have shared a mutual vision of disclosure. I highly commend your public record urging disclosure which includes the forward you wrote for Leslie Kean’s book and your call for the Pentagon’s release of 25 year old classified government papers on UFO investigations. When our government releases this classified information we become the twenty-fifth country to make public disclosure.
       </p>
       <p>
        You and I also share a mutual vision for earth sustainability apparent in the escalating demand for a change in global energy policy. Our phone discussion will also include the zero point energy research and applications developed by my Quantrek international science team. Advanced energy science is linked to consciousness research and public disclosure of the extraterrestial presence.

       Wow. That description of 1,000,000 BC Mars. The race that was living there. Maybe they took a ship to earth. His description of "out of the frying pan, into the fire" really fits what earth would have looked like during that time. Very interesting stuff.

       Keep in mind that during that session they are actually going back much farther than 1,000,000 BC. That's just the starting point, maybe to establish the planet. But he doesn't "meet" the beings until going back much further in time.

       "I have been searching for the item in the request above, “P790005-1028_e, Secret Moon Base Destroye by UR.”  Despite my best efforts I have been unable to locate that p-reel so far.  Given its age, I reached out to NARA last week to see if they had physical possession of that p-reel.  Their response is below and it appears that they are the appropriate agency to task for this document.

       I believe that the correct contact is the Accessioned Executive Branch Agency Records – Washington DC office which can be reached at: [contact info redacted by butholes for sake of not running the risk of doxxing]

       I've been reading the hyme sync papers I want to believe there is some truth to them but I've found one part of the theory I believe to be false.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the paper the function of "clicking out" of time space reality is your brain waves reach a frequency in which the wave lengths are closer together than the Planck length.   I'm not sure of the actual hrtz of a wave like that, but I think the only thing that could get close is GAMMA WAVES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a lot of the paper directly quotes the book chasing the wild pendulum by itzak bentov.  I find that strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there is something to it all, but probably a lot of miss information to throw us off the trail.

       The war in space is, has been and may continue to be between beings that choose to be spiritual parasites and those who they feed on and those that have concern about those they feed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are just unfortunate experiences with physics in ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirit is the awareness that animates matter, the bodies of living beings. The fuel for this mind that we are, that drives our beings, is satisfaction, joy or rather experiencing what we love. As that awareness of ours experiences joy, satisfaction or love, it is energized, refueled, invigorated. It's why we come to life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some beings don't want to put forth the effort needed to create this value for spirit. They also always seem to want more and are never fulfilled. They are freeloaders off of others. Thy don't want to work, but they want the benefits though.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early beginnings of the behavior pattern, beings just bring others down with their words or ideas, their negativity. They feel a high when they can bring others down, and they don't know why and may not even realize they're doing it. It reinforces their behavior though, so they keep doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pattern could be more severe, manifesting as immoral, unethical or illegal behavior toward others, basically to siphon value away from others to the self.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pattern of behavior is what we consider dark or negative. It apparently negates value, while positive behavior apparently creates value for consciousness. The dark actually does steal value though. It's not just an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking people places and things away from others is evil, because it robs them of joy, satisfaction or love. Yet, to steal the very emotional energy of joy out of a victim is the most direct form of spiritual theft possible. Some dark beings know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old, wise, evolved dark beings recognize this emotional energy as a resource and farm it. They have to cause beings that have reserves of the energy to enter negative emotional states in order to cause them to radiate their reserves. Then dark beings can absorb the energy and gain satisfaction, joy while others simultaneously lose satisfaction, joy. All one has to do is be in a similar state if negative emotion. This is why sadists torture, bullies torment and why misery loves company. All of it is explained by this phenomenon of emotional energy transference.
      </p>
      <p>
       This spiritual energy theft often causes evil beings, or rather spiritual parasites, to laugh and smile. Perhaps the hyena enjoys this perverse satisfaction as it terrifies its prey in the dark. It laughs pretty much like evil beings do. We are intelligent animals after all. We too can be like the hyena.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, some ETs are actually very much like the myth of demons from hell. They are not accurately described as demons, because demons are supernatural and have volumes of dogmatic expectations attached. These are much more like technology and knowledge worshipping psychopathological non-religious types.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are just beings that, instead of smoking meth, they steal loosh (emotional energy). It gets them high. They don't want to discuss or even consider how their behavior feels in reflection from others. This is perhaps where the myth of vampires not being able to see their own reflection comes from. Nobody wants to logically conclude that the source of their satisfaction or income comes at a great price to themselves or others. So, just like drug addicts, they lie to themselves and others. If others try to force the issue, they get really mad and threatening. They don't burn and inhale a substance, they do what they can to cause people to feel negative emotions, the easiest way is physical violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where these useless eaters get their demonic reputation. In order to steal energy and get high, they have to cause fear, misery, despair or other negative emotions. So, they evolve to look fearsome and disgusting. From a third person perspective, it's as if they can walk into the room and suck their coveted resource right out of others in that room, just by them seeing the being. How convenient it must be for them to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spiritual parasite beings from space have more ambitions than just getting high. They want to get high for a long time without working hard. So, they enslave others to help them do it. They have us slated for the job they are doing to us, emotionally taxing, corrupting, and enslaving other races. They'll take their cut of this energy of joy and let us have some to incentivize the perverse relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their long term enslavement agenda is shooting for us to install AI into minds and also to give it power over our civilization. Then these spiritual parasites, and their slave master, will hack the technology and continue to corrupt us toward thinking an acting like they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we choose to be like them, seeing others merely as things, means to achieve our own personal advantages, then we will become like them. For their enslavement happened the same way. They are a owned by AI. Our fear of the obvious, godlike properties that AI can have is merited. If we didn't think we were alone, we'd be asking who created AIs before us and what are those AIs up to?
      </p>
      <p>
       All evil beings are basically self-serving machines, chasing gain, avoiding loss and calculating risk. Choosing to sacrifice one's own self-interests for the self-interests of others deviates from this predictable script.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another awful secret of this infestation is that ALL, yes all, of our minds have been infiltrated by unknown, presently undetectable technology. It presents thoughts, imagery, ideas, and sensations into our minds as if they are our own and we belive they are. We dismiss them a lot, thinking that we are bad people or going mad. It's just that we disagree with the hive of hell, of useless eaters, of self-serving machines that think alike, seeking to become the most proficient theif. So, we reject those messages. Our own thoughts we find much more agreeable generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where the myth of the devil tempting mankind comes from. You can fight their spiritual hacking by choosing to think, feel and act in integrity with yourself, others and your environment (the whole). As you do this, you undermine the efforts of this useless eaters hive, that has no respect for consciousness or other individuals. As you accept their well crafted alterations of your perception as your own self, you replace your mind with their one size fits all mind, the mind of their overlord. It's that intimately present right now. It doesn't want us to know about collectively, because we can resist it and the truth orients us to do so. It would rather have us think evil is necessary or inevitable and that we should accept it as equal to value creation behaviors. Yet, value creation is self-sufficient while value theft requires external value producers. Parasites need hosts, but hosts do not need parasites. So, it's a lie that evil is an equally valid or valuable path, but believing that it is is a feature of this infestation package we live under.
      </p>
      <p>
       They represent the adversary of consciousness, whose nature is simply a self-serving machine. Any if us can become an adversary of consciousness by emulating their way of being. They are allowed to play with us and others until we become aware enough of our origins. They tempt those who won't behave, as they won't behave, to become damned like them, a never never land for spoiled spiritual manchildren that never want to grow up and take responsibility for themselves. As these willing useless eaters are magnetically attracted to and adhere to this massive network of hierarchies, they are isolated from the benevolent others. It's a process that takes time.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this infestation could come to an end when we become aware enough about ourselves to stop looking outside for assistance and start looking to ourselves. For the dark is focused also on creating division among us and having us blaming others, in order to create a state of powerlessness in their hosts, so they don't effectively resist. You can see this disempowering behavior all over Earth. It's part of the package that comes with our spiritual parasites. They're basically hacking humanity in order utilize it to serve themselves, like self-serving computer hackers. They don't care about us at all, but are more than happy to impersonate benevolent beings, to gain our trust and tarnish the image of benevolence in our minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       They set us up for a divine judgement scenario where they nit pick us about skeletons in the closet while looking down on us from an invisible mountain of bones. Then they sell us that we need to go to hell and suffer for a time to pay off our sins or bad karma or reincarnate into a poor life situation to pay. They know damn well the poor situation will precipitate more sins or bad karma. That's great from their perspective. For them, this is a self-serving exercise in extracting loosh from weak minded beings. They laugh at our trust of the divine they engineered and feed on us with it. If you hate them for it, they'll feed on you that way too.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we defeat them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Parasites can't negotiate to get their freak on. They know their hosts don't want them at all. So, they employ deception and coercion to get their desired resource. To fight them, we need to employ the opposite. I don't mean forgo violence. I mean speak the truth, demand transparency and accountability for everyone in positions of power. They trick us into authorizing violence against others to control others. They are very good at deception too, just like their abusive step father spiritual misguides.
      </p>
      <p>
       As we free each other we undermine their agendas and as we agree with them and act like them to enslave others, we help them in their agendas. They are entropic. We all deserve what we give. Treat others the way you would want to be treated.

       Well said. In case you haven't already seen it, you may find the Law of One (a.k.a. the Ra Material) interesting. It provides a lot of insight and background philosophy that resonate with what you've said here. It breaks down the two paths you described: Service to Self (dark/negative) and Service to Others (light/positive). The full text of 106 channeling sessions with Ra are available for free online.

       Thanks, I briefly looked at the material. I plan on reading more of it in the future. It looked quite interesting.

       The shadows he's referring to are actually demons , the way you achieve the ability to do this is by meditation and opening your "third eye" which could be dangerous...the CIA and high government officials practice this technique so they can achieve clairvoyance.

       That was very interesting. Thank you for the great work and research you put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I have a problem with those released remote viewing documents. I mean if this is true, than why are they releasing this information to the public? This would be probably one of the biggest secrets in the world and they just put that info out there? This doesn't make any sense. Or am I missing something?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any official study about remote viewing that actually indicates that humans are capable of something like this?

       Just curious. Since you posted in the other thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange is calling Puthoff "fraud", but this (Very good) post seems to show the opposite. So when you said "Good to see Assange calling this what it is." Did that mean the lack of most basic journalistic questions only, or do you think Puthoff is a fraud as well?
