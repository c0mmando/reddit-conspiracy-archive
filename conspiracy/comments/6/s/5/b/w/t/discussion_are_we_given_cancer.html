       So I think I most of us here believe that some, if not all, of our governments are in the business of depopulation. This got me thinking, we don't really know for sure why we get cancer but we just do. Since it's really effective and can be used to get rid of people without any suspicion (John McCain?) at a rapid rate of success, do any of you believe there's atleast a possiblity we're purposely given cancer wether it be for economic or depopulation purposes and if you do, why?

       I don't really think so. Humans have been getting cancer for at least a few hundred years. I remember reading something about how they found bone cancer on an ancient Roman but I might be misremembering. I think cancer is just something that mammals get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I think that you could ague that we might be getting it right now at a higher rate than ever before, but my opinion on that is that were dying less of diseases now so cancer is more likely to be the cause of death.

       I think what some may interpret as "giving people cancer" is just greed. I'm sure big parma does not object to all the extra cancer, but I don't think it is the primary goal when these people get out of bed in the morning. But who knows? The older I get, the greater the capacity for evil it appears humans and industry have.

       How do we know if cancer is real?

       It seems pretty implausible in my opinion, if you damage something, you expect it to stop working/die, you don't expect it to start dividing uncontrollably.

       think about it as a method to reduce the average age of a population.
      </p>
      <p>
       young workers are cheap to hire and very eager to please employers.
      </p>
      <p>
       older workers are slow and set in their ways and awkward, they have families and outside interests. older people have illnesses and work related conditions.
      </p>

       old workers like to collect pensions at age 65 or so.

       According to the book the perfect health diet by paul jaminet, all the latest research indicates that all chronic diseases are caused by non-bacterial invaders, ie viruses, parasites, fungi, etc. for example, the HPV virus has been conclusively proven to cause cervical cancer, and they now have a vaccine for that type of cancer. Another example is epstein-barr virus (mono) causes chronic fatigue syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very healthy people have a tremendous ecosystem of organisms in their bodies. The more variety of things living in you, the harder it is for any one thing to take over your body and make you sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get a bacterial infection and take an antibiotic, you wipe out all the bacteria in your body. This gives the other types of species -- ie viruses, parasite, fungi, the opportunity to proliferate. Where these things settle in your body and colonize kind of depends on what the invader is, genetics and diet and lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor food choices make it that much harder for your body to fight off the invader from proliferating.
      </p>
      <p>
       And voila... cancer or diabetes or chronic fatigue syndrome or Alzheimer's... they are all increasing.

       There's an argument that I once heard in passing regarding this, which makes sense to me.  That argument was that there are a lot of conditions and weaknesses that in the long past would've greatly reduce the chances of survival, but as humanity has become more advanced we've found ways to conquer that danger.  Those weaknesses and such still exist and proliferate because we've gotten much better at treating them, so people with them will breed and pass along those genes.  We're getting closer to the point of eliminating them altogether in the genome, but that won't be an option for most people any time in the near future.  Basically, our advancements in medical science have changed the direction of our evolution as a species.  While I doubt this accounts for all of it, at least to me it might make sense contributing to some of it.

       That is definitely food for thought. My take on it is that we have traded acute disease for chronic, which i am happy to do. Believe me, there were many times in my life that i would have died without antibiotics! I have a chronic disease now, but i have learned to control it via holistic methods. I'm drug free and doing fantastic!

       This is a great point and one that many fail to take into consideration.  That being said, there are a number of other disorders that present themselves on a much smaller / no timescale and cannot be explained away like this.  Autism is the first / most apparent that comes to mind.  Because it's so tied to early development, I don't think that we're evolving toward increasing incidence.

       It's something like 97% of the population is infected with c8 (chemical made by DuPont for 50+ years to make teflon, poisoned water supplies, and is a known carcinagen)and they still make it, they just call it genx now. These chemicals stay in the ground and water for so long, they will be here after humans are dead and gone.

       Yes. Cancer drugs usually have heinous side effects -- such as congenital heart failure. Even if your cancer never comes back, you'll be beholden to big pharma for life for the other health problems caused by cancer drugs.

       I genuinely believe the AMA deliberately gives bad advice in order to ensure people develop chronic diseases and become customers for life. They need to ensure their doctors have work!

       While I think the government and pharmaceutical industry know what causes cancer (pesticides, preservatives, environmental pollution in water, tons of pharmaceuticals themselves, our industrial meat system, cell phones to an extent....) they don't have to introduce any new methods of inducing cancer for population control. They see the problem, know what causes it and know that the treatments they are providing for it, namely chemo, don't actually cure cancer. There are actually very effective ways to treat cancer which are never, ever mentioned outside of fringe homeopathic and private doctors. My aunt treats cancer patients in NYC as a private specialist (m.a. in biochem from Columbia) and has so far had a 100% success rate of the six patients she has treated with cancer. This includes her starting as her own patient, curing breast cancer in under a year period as well as a friend who was given under a year to live by the doctors. Anyway, the problem is that the pharmaceutical industry and it's faux regulatory agencies (which are literally run by the companies they're supposed to monitor) stand to make all the money in the world, not just by making a killing of the cost of the medical procedures and treatments, but by preserving the future of the cancer industry itself by turning it into what you see today- a brand based in "awareness." By doing this I think they successfully shift the entire framework of the conversation. So instead oft people asking
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       every one is getting sick, but not really everyone. Depending on your demographic, income and area that you live in are getting sick at rates 50x higher than others. This is more than just people reporting high rates of cancer because they live near heavy toxins or other cancer causing sources of environmental pollution. The processed food we eat today has so much junk in it that we would have to completely restructure our entire food system if we wanted to actually address cancer rates. Not to mention our entire pharmaceutical industry, as well the way we regulate and subsidize both industry's. And the cherry on top is the for profit charity industry which organizes and whips up the support. They serve a key role in shaping the conversation and glamorizing it but also I think an incidental result is that we now have a multi billion dollar fund raising industry which recycles almost all of its donations back into ceo pay, political gambling and self promotion. Not to mention more fundraisers! Tax dollars fund the research in state universities, the tax payer gets killed with extreme medical fees and a horribly organized healthcare system (or perfectly designed depending on who you are), tax dollars fund public hospitals, individual donations are taken by for profit "non profit" cancer organizations and then once you get through the chemo and drugs you realize that depending on the type of cancer it's most likely going to come back at some point, and when it does its most likely not going to go away again.

       So we know sugar/glucose is the main food source so I guess we might need to look at when we started adding it to all our food products to see if anything possibly correlates or looks like a cancer introduction.
