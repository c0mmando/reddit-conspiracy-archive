    <div class="md"><p>I actually think we get some services from those companies, albeit we are getting ripped off with $500 toilet seats etc...and I really don&#39;t think these tech companies would even be profitable without the huge govt dollars for surveillance info or whatever they pay them for...ad revenue my ass...all bs.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>False. First, it&#39;s not magical... they are a massive provider of cloud computing services, it&#39;s not surprising that they would get that deal.</p>

<p>Second, their first profitable year was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/business/technology-amazon-reports-first-full-year-profit.html">2014</a>, a decade before the CIA deal. And they had been operating for twenty years before that deal. But they needed the CIA deal to be profitable? Absurd.</p>

<p>Third, Amazon had a revenue of <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn/financials">74 BILLION</a> in the year of the deal. Up to 130 BILLION this year. The one time $600 million from the CIA is an insignificant fraction of their operations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its nice that you cherry pick the one year they were profitable in 20 before that deal.  <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/amazon-nearly-20-years-business-it-still-doesnt-make-money-investors-dont-seem-care-1513368">See article from 2013</a>.  If wall street and govt were not propping this turd up it would have gone under years ago.

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t cherry picking, it&#39;s refutation. You never, I said when.</p>

<p>Further more, it wasn&#39;t &quot;the one year&quot; they were profitable, it was the first one. They made $210 million in 2007, $380 million in 2009, <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/15/15610786/amazon-jeff-bezos-public-company-profit-revenue-explained-five-charts">$420 million in 2010</a>. So no, 2014 was not their first profitable year by a long shot.</p>

<p>Read that article for an explanation of why their profit is usually so low despite their multi-billion dollar revenue. TL;DR: They put it right back into their business to continue growing.</p>

<p>What in the world would give you that idea? Do you mean as a whole? Macroeconomic performance has little bearing when reviewing the revenue of individual companies, especially tech unicorns like these.</p>

<p>Do you understand what the word monopoly means? It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;big business&quot;, which is how you seem to use it. There is not competition in a monopoly. Two huge companies fighting for market share is not a monopoly.</p>

It continues on by including grocery stores taking farmers crops hostage paying as little as possible as the crops are held hostage in their trailers. They move into banking, and cards, analyzing spending data which they use to profit further, it morphs into moving wealth into foundations which they use to lobby for legislation changes that drive more profit. Before you know it their money is a driving force in charter schools where their companies produce the educational material they create and they profit further running the schools.

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what you&#39;re talking about are tax credits at the local level in exchange for doing business with a particular state or municipality. It&#39;s legal and makes good sense for many small cities. My city would be ecstatic to bring a Google office into town. Their employees are highly compensated and well educated, every city wants more of them. That&#39;s why a lot of places dish out tax credits.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with Walmart. If you&#39;re the mayor of Salem, AL (population 6400) you&#39;ll do anything you can to bring a Walmart into town. It brings commerce in from neighboring towns where they don&#39;t have a large discount store and provides a few dozen jobs. Other businesses tend to set up shop nearby. Most of those townspeople do their shopping at a local dollar store and then drive to a Walmart an hour away whenever they need harder to find items. I can definitely understand the temptation for towns, cities and states to give up a little tax revenue in exchange for added commerce and development.  It&#39;s a little disingenuous to call that a subsidy. </p>

<p>Technically you&#39;re right but in common usage the term &quot;subsidy&quot; usually refers to a direct payment from a government to a company or individuals and not in exchange for goods or services. Corn subsidies are a good example. Oil, airline and train system subsidies are all direct payments from the government to the company in question.  Tax credits aren&#39;t really a traditional subsidy in that sense. If I claim a $1500 tax credit for charitable donations  it would be strange to suggest that I was being subsidized by the government. Neither is the charity. The tax credit might have encouraged my donation but usually for things like that people&#39;s minds are already made up </p>
