       Watch alex jones. He has sources to the White House. I don't care about his snake oil or all of his gay frog shit. But he has sources to the president, it's interesting to hear what he thinks of things.

       lol I'm not gatekeeping, that requires me to control access to information. I said avoid alex jones, take it or don't. This doesn't mean i'm controlling the information, just answering a question with my opinions.

       Now, if I answered with sites or people to go to or listen to would you call me a shill for pushing information?

       I try to stay away from identifying any source as objectively good or bad. I just kinda read everything, file away the interesting bits, try to corroborate factual items, and see where I end up after stringing some ideas together. I treat it all as infotainment and stay in a place where I'm believing nothing, but considering everything. That isn't to say I don't take certain subjects seriously, this is just my approach so I don't miss anything.

       I'm in the same boat as you. As a newbie, i agree it's definitely difficult to wade through all the sites and information that is out there. I usually pick one topic per week and research accordingly. Good luck on your journey.

       Instead of relying on a single site always be critical of everything. The good thing about this place is that we all have our own place or contacts where we get info and we can share them and talk about them here.

       just inform about the conspiracy you want to know more about, on several websites, see what they got in common or havent and decide which ones are the real deal and which ones are clickbait shit. ps: read about bluebeam as it seems to become true in the next years or so.

       You should learn to develop your own abilities for discernment and fact checking.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you rely on others to make this call for you, you do a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You subject yourself to their stated or unstated agendas.  Someone telling you to avoid a particular source may very well be a disinfo agent and trying to steer you from truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You also engage in the game of labeling people.  For the sake of discussion, lest say you'll label some sources "worthy" and others "unworthy".  You'll put more trust into the worthy sources and less in unworthy sources.  This will lead you to suspending your critical analysis of worthy sources and overly applying it to unworthy sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why is all that so bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well because often unworthy sources will source truth and worthy sources will simply be telling lies, advancing an agenda and/or playing games.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you develop your own senses, you won't be so much worried about the messenger as you will about the message.  This is a much healthier approach and one that will continue to help you throughout life.

       For conspiracies, I've found easiest way to keep yourself in the loop is using boards and forums; Reddit being one of many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boards and Forums also have the advantage that they generally act like a hub for further reading; users will automatically link to the juicy stuff, and will often post compilations containing months worth of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are sites I like:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/">
        Above Top Secret
       </a>
       Been there for +- 10 yrs, it's a popular site, altough there's alot of shilling. (Esp on the political)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.conspiracyoutpost.com/">
        Conspiracy Outpost
       </a>
       The one I currently use, mainly because flat Earth is allowed and being discussed in a reasonable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       And obviously this and other subreddits.

       Whatever site you use  I recommend checking thier sources(annomynous or not) If they don't have sources that's a big warning sign. Look into thier sources and see if they reported accurately(if it's annomynous find one that isn't). After checking the accuracy between thier report and the source, look for additions they added that's not in the source, if this is the case it's another red flag and they are selling a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they pass I give them some credibility.

       Yep. Nothing true ever comes from there. Just one big social experiment. Also the Beatles, Aldous Huxley, and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd are all connected.

       A simple list:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If a writer of a conspiracy site seems too popular avoid him. You can't just openly write and stay safe, you know? A great example is Alex Jones with his sites. I tracked his contents for about 10 years. The guy is an opportunist who goes by what appears to be hot in the conspiracy department for the year.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Typically, a conspiracy theorist who knows how the world operates does not target any average group for hate or affiliate himself with any mainstream political party. So if you see a site mixing useful and such info you can say good bye to it. Examples: jesussisavior site and godlikeproduction forum.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sites which promote flat earth, 9/11 no plane, dooms day and AMERICA IS GONNA COLLAPSE THIS MONTH theories.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sites that have awkward articles with lines such as "Putin just received a report about how US army is out to get star gate in Iraq". You will usually get these articled on other sites copied word for word.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Vigilantcitizen.com is quite great. It is kind of difficult to debunk the writer of that site. Even metabunk forum confessed that. Abovetopsecret isn't bad either. But at the end of the day, nobody can get everything correct. So you have to be a little careful.

       Yeah, I agree. GLP is poison. I didn't know all those others were connected to Tavistok though.

       Lol stop playing victim. You got so defensive, it's also hilarious how many upvotes for a shoddy comment like yours got. And yea maybe some people think you are a shill.
