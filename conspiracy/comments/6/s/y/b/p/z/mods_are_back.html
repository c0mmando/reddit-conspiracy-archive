       One of the top mods realized how obvious it is that Trumpling mods are censoring the discussion here and how that takes away all credibility from a sub about conspiracies. My guess is he/she saw people bleeding away to r/conspiracy2 and is trying to head off a big migration by some empty rebranding. We're supposed to believe the mods who censored anti-Trump news did some meditation and saw the light and now are totally enlightened.

       I do not like it. Take the franklin scandal for example. This was a political scandal and eventual cover-up. Will this topic be banned? How about the Dutroux affair, or Iran Contra? Will these be banned too? Shit... The meat of the most serious conspiracies, cover-ups, and scandals are political in nature. This is disturbing.

       Yep, the US government is the largest conspiracy in the history of the world. The two major parties in the US conspire to enrich their "donors" who bribe them with campaign contributions by literally killing people. It's confirmed fact that Obama literally had a kill list of people he planned to have murdered extrajudiciously and you can bet Trump has one too and so will any other president until or unless we can stop the corruption that has a stranglehold on the entire government.

       And this is what I don't get. Do they honestly think users will just stick around rather than find a new platform? I'm amazed when entities just assume their actions couldn't possibly cause a collapse in the user base on which they rely.

       What's the point?  The thread is just going to get hit with shills and liberals who are loyal to the State.  "r/conspiracy is pro government now because they support Drumpf!"  "tee hee of course drumpf is establishment, he's the president, can't get any more establishment than that." etc.  It's just a bunch of shills and easily influenced liberals that know dick about anything.

       This sub needs to get back to conspiracies.  The only conspiracy going on with the US government is Russia and that's been thoroughly debunked so isn't worth talking about at this point.  Every other sub on this fucked website constantly talks politics.  Could we have one that doesn't?

       Yeah definitely, but remember those conspiracies that "don't involved politics" usually indeed do involve politics to a great deal. Take the many alien conspiracies as an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also think about important topics like MKultra, the franklin scandal, Iran Contra, and the dutroux affair. These are heavily tied to politics, yet they are still very important topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what you mean as far as the vitriolic left vs right stuff goes. I have been involved with that stuff myself, and at times have taken it too far. So you make some good points. I just do not want to see any topics silenced with the excuse that they are "too political". Thats all.

       You're right they are important topics.  If you bring them up the shills and rabid leftists will not touch it.  They are programmed to attack anything with Trump in it.  They don't care about anything else.

       I posted about it along time ago. Politics and conspiracy are intertwined. If you remove politics from conspiracy it means very little.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I ultimately think there's the spiritual element, but most dismiss that here anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       So politics is as close to examining conspiracy as some can get.

       I totally understand that.  The thing is it may be giving the mods an inch while they take a mile on censorship.  I think over time it is pretty easy to spot spam and shilling.  I scroll through sorting by new pretty quick.  It is time consuming but I feel like it is the price you pay to an extent to have open discussion.

       I'm an Australian, I'm not implying anything. However it's quite clear that many Americans can't wrap their brain around the concept that their chosen political party is the same tool as the other party, used by TPTB to control them.

       It truly saddens me how little many (not all by any stretch, I know a lot of intelligent Americans who are very aware of the false narrative their cultures patriotism has given them) Americans know of the world and geopolitics outside of their own bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. has more military bases around the globe then any other Empire in history has ever had. America has made their politics, the world's politics. The entire globalist agenda was created by America, or at the very least, America was the tool used to create it. Then Americans are bewildered or offended when other nations speak about their politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia's PM has publically stated today that we will provide whatever support the USA needs if they request any for NK. Just like we have for every war since WW2. Quite literally, your politics involves my politics.

       You sound like a very angry young man, I'm not going to respond with another pointless comment. I'm not a liberal, Australians don't have that same mindset, I vote left or right and even green depending on what's happening in my local area. In Australia, we don't directly vote for a PM, we vote for a party and I vote for the party that's going to make my particular area at the time, better.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I will do, is explain why I said Reagonomics, because I want you and others to read it. If you choose not to, the  so be it. But you say I know nothing so let me try and explain the globalist agenda from a perspective you may have never heard.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Neoliberalism, the economic theory, was colloquially named Reagonomics in the USA, but is named neoliberalism in Europe, Australia, Japan and (I believe but don't know for sure) India. In the UK it was colloquially named Thatcherism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It involved the roll back of government and the regulation to allow corporations to have more freedom and greater free market reign. It started in the early 80s after the massive inflation and stagnating economies of the western worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So think about what happened. Government was reduced (most of us in the conspiracy community would think that's a good thing), yet it was at the expense of letting the free market replace services (And we know who owns those corporations right, TPTB, the Zionist agenda).
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the great Zionist play: at the same time the developed world was brainwashed into believing that socialism and communism was pure evil, implying that government management (control is another word if one thinks that way) is far worse than free market. Except we have seen time and again over the last 36 years that TPTB are always the head of the umbrella companies that provide our services and make money of us all (e.g. privatised prisons, privatised catering at schools, privatised utilities, etc , etc). And whenever they crash a market, they rape more public money from government to reset the agenda, in the form of "bail outs" to financial institutions and businesses which are deemed "too big to fail". Yet small time companies (which probably don't have Zionist links) never get anything, let alone average joes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a socialist, but I do enjoy many of the ideals of socialist democracy, but please don't argue against me for that. Australia was very much a socialist democracy for nearly a century, but the last 15-20 years has seen us slowly slip down the neoliberal path and our state subsidised medical care, social services and the like are all disappearing which resembles the U.S. system. However, this neoliberal/Reagonomics swindle allowed social safetynets to be ripped away and free market growth, it's capitalism on steroids and without the regulation, pure capitalism is only going to end up with monopolies or oligarchy, which we all know is the Zionists because they have the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I know the concept of more government scares many, but I believe there's a difference between local government and intelligence organisations. Intelligence organisations are full of selected brainwashed and authoritarian personality types who are happy to control their own people and commit acts they know are morally dubious. It's easy to manage that type of environment, whereas local councils are just elected officials from local population bases and wpuld be far harder to control for TPTB. Generally speaking, although occasionally we might find them to be dicks, there's few local councils which would commit nefarious acts greater than just making some small time cash for themselves, they are generally people who love their community at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my humble beliefs. I don't think it was the start of the globalist agenda, but Neoliberalism/Reagonomics was the huge boost that the Zionists needed to implement their agenda. Of course, it never took off in socialist and communist countries because they can't get into their governments, which is why those types of government have always been overly demonized in our media. That and true communism is shit anyway, but socialist leanings are very human, in fact I'd argue that it's how our species evolved bit I've talked too much and will explain that one another time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you at least think about what I've said, I'm not blaming reagon, or blue or red. I'm just showing what I think was a tool they used.

       Only an American would say this... 
You lecture everyone about everything but can't even point out your own capital on a map. 
Guess what? You are sharing the system with a couple of billion other people. They might have something to say about it.

       We are sharing nothing.  Take your Communism else where.  And what you have to say about America does not matter.  You know nothing of America.  Stick to your politics, which you probably know nothing of either.

       heres what happened. the mods were all invited to a meeting where the MIC part or our sub disclosed all the stuff after that, they met up with the ashtar draconian adamite annunaki angel demon entity named mike. he brought coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       they talked about how exactly are things actually going to be disclosed and vetted and what the deuce is actually gonna happen. Then they toured the vatican vaults.
      </p>
      <p>
       i made this up btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       for real... hey mods thanks for "herding the cats" on our behalf. no easy task, kudos.
