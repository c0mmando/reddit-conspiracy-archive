    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve always loved the idea of astrology, not so much horoscopes, but the idea of it being a giant coded clock of calculations always got my dweeb juices flowing. I&#39;m not personally an astrologer but I&#39;ve looked in to it a decent amount over the years and this is what I&#39;ve found about what is going on.</p>

<p>People have been talking about this year being another big one since well before 2012. If you were able to filter out the fear mongering and just find people talking about the base information, they referenced a series of years that were going to be ripe with oddities in the field. We&#39;ve passed three of those odd years since then, this is the fourth.</p>

<p>Each stage tended to get people more worried than they needed to be because the vast majority of information out there is usually less than stellar.</p>

<p>But, guess what? There&#39;s one more &#39;odd&#39; year yet to come before it all calms down again astrologically speaking, for about another two hundred years.  </p>

<p>What do I take this to mean?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the end. Do what you can to live a good human life, and leave spacing out to the potheads.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much an event, just like 2017, 2015, 2013, and 2012 weren&#39;t an event. If anything, aside from a good life the only thing to really prepare for is a new wave of people obsessing over numerology in the style of 11:11. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a 100 years since Our Lady of Fatima--a Gnostic vision of Mary/Sophia/Ma&#39;at by three young girls in Portugal.</p>

<p>In the Nag Hammadi Library, &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, we are told:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the consummation [of the age], the whole place will shake with great thundering. Then the rulers will be sad, [...] their death. Then the age will begin, and they will be disturbed. Their kings will be intoxicated with the fiery sword, and they will wage war against one another, so that the earth is intoxicated with bloodshed. And the seas will be disturbed by those wars. Then the sun will become dark. And the moon will cause its light to cease. The stars of the sky will cancel their circuits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Syzygy may correspond to the solar eclipse of August 21st.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And a great clap of thunder will come out of a great force that is above all the forces of chaos, where the firmament of the woman is situated. Having created the first product, she will put away the wise fire of intelligence and clothe herself with witless wrath. Then she will pursue the gods of chaos, whom she created along with the prime parent. She will cast them down into the abyss. They will be obliterated because of their wickedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sophia is also Ayahuasca. Like Christ, she is thrice great. Think of them as Ma&#39;at and Thoth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stay calm.  Nothing bad will happen.  There are two celestial events that people see as important this year.  They happen to be related to biblical prophecy too, which is what some find exciting.</p>

<p>August 21 afternoon, total solar eclipse across much of the USA.</p>

<p>Sept 23 - star and planetary alignment that hasn&#39;t happened in thousands of years and some feel fulfills the woman giving birth with a crown of 12 as described in Revelation 12.</p>

<p>tl;dr: goto youtube and search for &quot;revelation 12 September 23&quot;, and you will find amazing info vids that break down the why.  If religious, pray.  If not religious, be ready for weird behavior.</p>

<p>It actually happened in 1827, you can confirm this yourself with a star-chart program:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  But as was posted in another thread I can&#39;t pull up at the moment, this event is the first time Virgo has a baby for the length of a human birth (42 weeks) and has it passing at the right time.  </p>

<p>I never verified this in a star chart - but you could very well be right that this is a common event that happens every few hundred years.</p>

<p>12 A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. <strong>5 She gave birth to a son, a male child</strong>, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”[a] And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. 6 The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As previous thread mentioned, sounds like Jupiter was just moving into place in Virgo or something similar.  I&#39;ve wanted to get a star program and verify.</p>

<p>as that webpage states, Jupiter in Virgo for 42 weeks and exiting at the right date is special.  I haven&#39;t verified it yet.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Virgo is clothed in the sun</p></li>
<li><p>Virgo has the moon at her feet</p></li>
<li><p>Virgo is crowned with 12 stars (Mars, Venus, Mercury which are wandering stars, Leo which has 9 stars)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not very close, September 23rd is the perfect match to what is written in Revelation 12. You keep showing me still images of similar looking positions but youre completely ignoring the most important part: Jupiter will be in retrograde motion inside the box or &quot;belly&quot; of Virgo for 42 weeks which is the same as the human gestation period. None of those images youre referring to show that because it didnt happen. But all 4 of the conditions will be met perfectly on 9/23, it&#39;s up to you to accept that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I just got up to open Stellarium so I could see and obviously not even close, once again. Jupiter enters Virgo&#39;s belly on 7/26 1056 and it leaves Virgo&#39;s belly after a whopping (less than) 2 months. So it automatically fails the test.

<p>&#39;The total solar eclipse of June 8, 1918 crossed the United States from Washington State to Florida. This path is roughly similar to the August 21, 2017 total solar eclipse and was the last time totality crossed the nation from the Pacific to the Atlantic.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do wish something very bad would happen. It desperately needs to, in my opinion.</p>

<p>This world is quite terrible for most. 80% of the world lives on less than $10 a day, and half of that 80% lives on less than $2.50 a day - while 20,000 children starve to death every single day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in America - people die to health issues related to over-eating. While wasting 33 million tons of food a year $165 Billion worth - (Enough to eradicate world hunger 5.5x over).</p>

<p>These ideas aren&#39;t conspiracies, this is our sad reality that seems to be consistently overlooked.</p>

<p>So maybe it will take a global catastrophe for everyone to realize, again, that we must love Earth, and all of it&#39;s living things. As I believe that to be our only true purpose here.</p>
