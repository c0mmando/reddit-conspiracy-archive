       I'm feeling motivated to seek truth and expose it. Where the fuck do we start? Can we, as a sub, band together to expose the real enemy/conspiracy?? Obviously it is near impossible, but can we put together concrete evidence to at least give us a start? We can call it the "NWO", but that's not an actual name. The elite evil. I'm losing hope in society. Let's do something great. Sorry to get preachy, just feeling extra.

       I mean if you're easily giving up and putting off the garden thing then you'll probably give up on exposing corruption and seeking truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buy a basil plant. Talk to it. Love it. Watch it grow. Make delicious things with it. Learn patience from it. Watch as the plant is oblivious to you but always praising the life it's given. These are truths.

       I'm not gonna let that first paragraph trigger me but that is not the truth. Just a classic redditor low-blow. I'm 18, moving into a dorm this week, if my college has a community garden then hell ya I'll participate. But why do I care to explain, I've got nothing to prove to you I guess. I'm not giving up on anything. Hope you have a great day!:)

       We are moving into the Age of Aquarius, which is the the Age of Awakening. More and more people are waking up to the truth!

       What do you prefer? Video or written article? Do you want to see how all of this is in the Bible? For the record, I don't think the Bible was meant to be taken literally. I think it refers to the Astrological Earth Ages and us awakening within ourselves.

       Video and article!:) that's a cool take with the Bible. I've never read it through and through so maybe I'll do it with a new perspective.

       We do not need to come together as redditors. You are already near people everyday, people who you can help, I guarantee you there are people with hands reaching out into the community, but no one is reaching back to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't lose hope, if you lose hope, I will lose hope, so I will tell you that I have hope that some day, everything will get better, and their will be far more love in the world. Some of the most stressful stuff I have ever faced has been forced upon me, but I will never lose hope because their are people I see everyday I can help, talk to, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You feel it. It's not that you are preachy, it seems to me that you are evolving into a more empathetic and spiritually aware person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the fuck do we start?: There are people in our city, our neighbourhoods, maybe even in your home that need a loving hand, a guide, someone to show them how to take the first steps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we, as a sub, band together to expose the real enemy/conspiracy?: Why? We already have, we are all here, yes we have been infiltrated and harassed, but in the end they made themselves look stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously it is near impossible, but can we put together concrete evidence to at least give us a start?: No. We have tried to do this for years, and we have ever presented concrete evidence, comet pizza being a good one, anyone remember the "shooter event" where they moved the CCTV camera on that street watching the pizzeria during that day, so they could gut the place? People believe it was an actual fucking shooter. My mom thinks someone died during that day, she is fully controlled sadly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can call it the "NWO", but that's not an actual name.: No, we aren't going to call them by anything like that, they are parasites, people who must use others to even survive. Nothing is more spiritually weak or pathetic, un-empathetic as being unable to survive with controlling people. Control is the ultimate form of fear. Soo much fear, they MUST have control, so they can put that "fear" to rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything for a fact, but in my heart, something tells me their is Divinity, your right, it doesn't give a fuck about us atm, this dimension is clunky, dirty, and pathetic in terms of how the third dimension has been explained compared to higher dimensions. It is waiting for us to decide, or do something here, before it lends a hand. There are many gifted people in this world who will tell you it feels like they have a guardian spirit, I believe it is just some form of higher Divinity that is "unlocked" after an "achievement or task".
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the elite, if they must have control due to their mass fear, if their is something more than this life, then they are truly weak, controlled, and used, they may have control of us, but in the next, they are likely someones slave. It is said masons/cults/elites/etc know about other dimensions and etc etc, if these people know their is something more, why would they have fear?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it seems like these people have submitted to something that is not Divine, for power here and now, and their fear stems from some type of prophecy/or something a long the lines that they have submitted their souls, and they can no longer walk the Divine path.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your serious, just worry about what change and hope you can bring to the world surrounding you everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S: I recommend avoiding talking to anyone IRL about taking action in regards to conspiracies, enough action has been taken in the past and the results of those actions (nothing) have shown us that it is not the right path.

       So well put together. Thank you. I always think of the universe, why are we so pre occupied with our own beliefs that we will go out of our way to KILL for it? Abrasive and not open minded. Religion can produce happiness, but it divides. Sorry I'm all over the place. but this is something I always think about pertaining to the universe and extra terrestrial life: to me, it is a fact there are other intellectual beings out there. And maybe those beings are aware of earth. I always think of the PETTY shit they'd see while they observe us. Why would they reach out to us? This world is evil, they'd probably feel threatened. Why can't everyone just love... and be open to experience and what someone has to say. Fuck Pride. I'm only 18 and am losing hope. But you're right. focus on the things that make me happy. Family, and make someone else's day better everyday. I hope our society reaches a point where we have a common goal. To explore the beyond. Thank you for putting the time to submit that comment. I loved it! What's your thoughts on religion?? I truly think it needs to go. God can be a common belief, but not all the nuances that come with each religion. 
I feel (uniquely) motivated to create change. Speaking of divinity, I've had....signs? Idk we will see how it goes. Maybe I can make a name for myself hahahaha. LOVE.

       You don't need to make a name for yourself. You are already named.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply believe in Divinity and Evil. I believe we can choose to walk either path. People tend to say: "your life judges your afterlife", I believe your life is the precursor for what your afterlife is going to be, you paint your canvas, although people can poke holes, rip it apart, spit on it, paint on it, put fake words on it, etc etc, the canvas is still there as long as you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when reading Greek mythology, it talks about "The Furys", and the story of Cronus is obviously the story of Osiris from Egypt. It seems like we are actually tempted. I believe only evil entities tempt us though, as the path of Love/Light/Divinity is pretty straight forward, live your life, try to be human, help people, don't let your emotions control you, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion itself is a human barrier, it is a device/an idea created by whoever wants to maintain this control, obviously religions are based upon faith, but it was very quickly seen by the intelligent ones as an easy means of controlling the masses. Religious people don't tend to be bad, its people who fight over religious ideologies or beliefs that tend to be the people who allow the division to remain. I worked with a muslim man, he was the nicest man I had ever met, had a family, and I worked out of town, there would be many times he would offer me a ride home (gave me a ride many times as well) and everytime I offered him money, he would say no, and I would tell him every single time: "it is not about the money, it is about showing you my appreciation", and then he would take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Live your life like a normal person, and be nice, and don't let your emotions control you, if you had a bad day at work, don't take it out on anyone, etc.

       What study are you going to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best thing we can do is spread the information. Expose the truth to the people. They can only rule over us, if we let them rule over us. So when we dont except them as leaders, they are done for.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we do this? Making youtube vids, redditpages like this one, webpages, etc.
We should support ourselves tho. On this redditpage a lot of people are being toxic to each other, and ofcourse posts get downvoted waaaay to much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the best plan is for us to get influental in this world. So, focus on education, and we might get an influental job with which we can head this world into a better direction.
We are going to need young people for this, like you and me. The more young people, the more chances we have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep spreading the word, thats how we gain more people.

       i think you are on the right path even making and starting this thread. the mere act of taking g matters into your own hands is a marker for self responsibility that is needed to overcome thous in power.

       You know, you gotta get to a point that you can name your enemy and know you're naming the right people. As far as I've come, I can name the BIS and Fed Reserve as big targets, all central banks, and the Jewish controlled media. The problem is that there is no court who will hear our cases, or at the very least, we don't know how to use our court system to our own benefit, so I'm with you: I think it's time to take back our world, by force if need be. It wouldn't take much.
