       Bitcoin looks to be a great new digital currency that the whole world may someday use. However there are some odd things about bitcoin that deserve more exposure.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, Bitcoin was officially released by an unknown person who used a Japanese pseduonym, 5 days before Obama was elected. This person does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, bitcoin mining is designed to solve hashes in the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is a 256-bit version of an algorithm that is used to encrypt messages sent over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA invented SHA-256.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       As people's computers mine bitcoins, they are discovering solutions to SHA-256 hashes, which then get stored in to the blockchain, which is a digital record and repository of all activity within bitcoin to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each block is like one SHA-256 puzzle, that the computers try to solve. The only way to solve it is to guess the right answer randomly out of billions or trillions of choices. There is no algorithm or method to find the right solution other than guessing and then doing the computation to see if you were correct or not, due to how the algorithm is constructed (which is exactly what makes it good for security). So when computers mine for bitcoins, they are guessing solutions to that particular block's SHA-256 puzzle. When a solution is found, 50 bitcoins (now, 25, and soon to be 12.5 as dictated by the algorithm) are rewarded to the miner who found the solution. So it's a lottery of sorts. This is why people pool together to form mining pools, where the winnings are shared proportionally among everyone, weighted by their total number of attempted solutions. That helps take the luck out of it so everyone can get more reliable income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, these solutions are so hard to find that even with all the computers across the world mining for bitcoins, it still takes 10 minutes to solve just one single puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it's so secure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to hack a system that uses SHA-256 (which is a very encryption common system to use, alongside SHA-128 which is even weaker) then hacking it difficult because you have to guess over and over to solve this large prime number problem. However, if you have a
       <em>
        list
       </em>
       of all the prime numbers and their solutions (including many really huge numbers that haven't been computed except for this list) then that is a speedup to cracking a particular system using SHA-256, because you don't have to run all those calculations, you can simply look them up. In the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there is a potential the blockchain is an open distributed-computing SHA-256 solution repository, which enables hackers who know how to use it (like the NSA).
      </p>
      <p>
       With all this in mind, it's easier to see why countries are starting to accept bitcoin as a legal currency. Japan officially recognized it as currency just recently:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/japan-bitcoin-law-effect-tomorrow/">
         https://www.coindesk.com/japan-bitcoin-law-effect-tomorrow/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We know Japan is often a testing ground for US monetary policy (QE and Abenomics, for example) so this is likely to be the direction of the future, which makes it a good investment because this implies it's backed by the western central banks, which means it will probably prosper in the long term. Which is why we see so many rich people investing in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not so much with litecoin or etherium, which are some of the biggest competitors to bitcoin on the cryptocurrency market. You can see the largest coins by total market cap here:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">
         https://coinmarketcap.com/
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Litecoin uses Scrypt instead of SHA-256. Scrypt was invented by a person developing linux, apparently more of an independent actor.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">
         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Bitcoin dominates the market, being 20x the size of Litecoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think cryptocurrencies are great, but I think people need to be mindful of what is going on behind the scenes, and to ensure there are competing cryptocurrencies rather than a singular bitcoin monopoly that dominates the market. However it's good that one cryptocurrecy grow to prominence to establish the infrastructure of using them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think there is government backing because of the relationship of bitcoin to the NSA's SHA-256 algorithm. However over the next few decades, I think that algorithm will become less and less relevant as cryptography becomes more advanced, and thus bitcoin will lose government support because it will no longer be useful to the NSA. However there will likely be replacement cryptocurrencies by that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems like a short-term western global currency, but in the long term will likely have to be replaced as SHA-256 loses its relevancy, as computers become more powerful.

       2 things. The 10 minute blocktime is a time signature. 1 computer alone can solve it in 10 min, or 10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sha 256 is not solvable as you describe. There are third party random number variables (transactions) which make it not 'pre-solvable'.

       Alluding to the possibility of a hash function backdoor?
       <br/>
       Perhaps this "rogue" government branch is in possession of some hardware that enables this?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a thought experiment, let us assume the former statements.
       <br/>
       Could we think of a new motivation behind the relationship between Bitcoin and this NSA subgroup?

       I think one motivation would be to watch transactions between people who believe they are shielded.

       You're welcome. No I haven't seen that, but it's interesting. Seems to outline bitcoin almost exactly, which just furthers the idea that bitcoin is NSA developed. I can understand why they did the Japanese pseudonym, no one trusts the NSA.

       There is honestly zero doubt in my mind that it was NSA created. The only thing I can't wrap my head around is why they would want to create this decentralized ledger that can live forever with no real way of censorship.

       The transaction isn't anonymous, and that's all that matters. Like, imagine an ant hill... some guy once poured hot metal down the hole and then dug it up to find out what it all looked like. Well, that's bitcoin. Every black market is being mapped out. Silk road, alpha bay, all those transactions from all over the world, or maybe the russian mafia and all their connections all over the world, or chinese hackers, or terrorists, or whatever... they poured money down the hole and then dug it all back up in the blockchain.

       Digital currencies bring competition to the monetary system. That's a very good thing. As an individual it's good to have a basket of different cryptos not just Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin which are already part of the established system. Also there is a fight within Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash. Both sides claim the other side is evil an powered by TPTB. One sides censors the other not. Make up your mind and research what money actually is before entering the space.

       basically, only a tiny tiny fragment of the available space for SHA level primes is "blessed" for bitcoin mining. that leaves a nearly infinite field for similarly difficult (time consuming) solutions.

       That's true, they are only using a specified sub-set of solutions because of the way leading zeros are emphasized in the hash solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if when new SHA-256 hashes are generated, if they are drawn from a similarly limited pool. That would make the blockchain very valuable if they're the same limited pool. It's a great point I hadn't considered.

       I would advance a related theory about the meta-story behind bitcoin: perhaps it's an exploration into the number field to determine if prime patterns can be found in just a small zone. In this scenario, the leading zeros function as a microscope - you only look at one small focal area but if you find any interesting pattern you expect to see if that holds for other zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that squares well with the double-hashing that also complicates and constrains the bitcoin procedure. Not a mathematician. Perhaps someone with deeper insight would throw in?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know that the Prime Number Theory tells us we can know approximately how many primes to expect at every "level" of magnitude, and the Riemann Hypothesis suggests a way to describe why the primes vary from their predicted recurrence (long stretches or shorter than expected stretches between).
      </p>
      <p>
       If those areas could be clarified, possibly by supplying lots of necessarily empirically-driven data collection, like bitcoin, then perhaps all sorts of outcomes befall, in cryptology as well as other pursuits...

       Maybe a finding a hash with leading 0s has some special mathematical property?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin uses the sha256 algorithm
       <strong>
        twice
       </strong>
       which I always thought was a bit strange, but a double application means that you get a list of strings of a fixed length (I.e mod
       <em>
        n
       </em>
       , for a given
       <em>
        n
       </em>
       ) that map to smaller (in binary terms) strings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pure speculation, but maybe these 0 leading mapped hashes could be used for the Sha equivalent of a dictionary attack.

       So this means the NSA created bitcoin, but set it up in such a way that other people "mining" bitcoins are actually helping secure/or enhance the encryption. "So when computers mine for bitcoins, they are guessing solutions to that particular block's SHA-256 puzzle", I don't really get digital currencies, but it is beyond obvious that they are the next world currency, not like our current currency is backed by anything, just as this digital currency would likely not be backed by anything, it would just be super secure.

       Yes, but there are also multiple crytocurrencies based on SHA-256. And also just because it's the most popular encryption method doesn't necessarily mean it'll be the most popular cryptocurrency just because it's based on that algorithm.

       Good post, will use a similar progressiont to explain bitcoing to ym non-tech friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would tweak it a bit though. SHA-256 is not an encryption algorithm, it is a hashing algorithm. Hashing is a one way function, you put data in and what comes out is a 256-bits that mathematically represent that data. But the original data can not be determined from the hash. You may be able to figure out what data was used to generate a hash but you can't be for certain that it was the original data because there are collisions in hashing algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2
       <sup>
        256
       </sup>
       possible hashes using SHA-256. If I have a 512 bytes of data, that means there are 2
       <sup>
        4096
       </sup>
       possible combinations 512 bytes of data. If I take the hash of something that has 2
       <sup>
        4096
       </sup>
       possibilities but can only represent it with 2
       <sup>
        256
       </sup>
       possibilities, there will be collisions and that is why SHA is a hashing algorithm not an encryption algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again - Good write up, would just tweak it a bit!

       The solution you search for is one specific for the block you intend to add, it depends on the transactions you add to the block, as well as on the full history of the blockchain. Miners are not all trying to find the solution to the same problem, they're all looking for a solution to a different problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also not finding a 'perfect' solution, they search for 'good enough' solutions that have a value below a certain limit. Good enough for bitcoin doesn't mean good enough to decrypt things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, finding a combination of two values that gives you a third, which is all it does, is not at all interesting data, nor is it hard to find. You can perform millions of these calculations very quickly, going through the bitcoin system where all but a very very tiny minority is discarded is pointless. Only if two out of the three values are interesting would there be some kind of point. But they're not. None of the three values are interesting whatsoever outside of the context of bitcoins. The block hash you start with isn't, the value you try to reach isn't and the solution isn't.

       I can't supply that level of rigor here, if you can for the opposite statement then feel free to supply it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the logic of the OP is easy to see though. For bitcoin mining, you supply essentially two variables, the block information including transactions and a value you tweak to get the desired result. The two variables A and B are combined, then the SHA-256 algorithm is applied to get a variable C. This variable C is again put through SHA-256 to get a final variable D. If D &lt; target, you get a hit and have mined a block.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since any number below the target is accepted, it's a terrible way to find answers if you as a hacker have some hashed value you want to crack. There are essentially three ways in which you can hack things given knowledge about a lot of sha-256 hashes. Either you have a hash D and do a reversal, where you try to find the original value used that was likely used to get a certain hash. Or you have a hash D and do a collision attack by finding two values that produce that same hash. Or you find a way to solve sha-256 to do the other two options better. In all cases, the bitcoin system does next to nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversal wise, the bitcoin system could give you the information that some hash C could've been the input used for the answer D, or that A+B results in C. But even if you randomly do have a D sitting around somewhere that was used in the chain, which is extremely unlikely. Then you'll find that both A+B and C are useless pieces of information, they have no relevance outside of bitcoin. They are unlikely to have been the original inputs of whatever hash you're sitting on. There is no benefit here over just hashing millions of values and saving all of their results. That is a way faster method of building a database. By the time you've written the code to read the blockchain data, you could've easily gotten more results with a simple loop.

       The same issue is present for the other two techniques. You could do a collision attack using C, if you know that D needs to be reached. But the blockchain produces answers for A+B-&gt;C-&gt;D so slowly, that again, you're better off just computing millions of hashes yourself. You could try to infer something from the knowledge that A+B-&gt;C or C-&gt;D, but there's no extra info here over just hashing millions of values yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, to be fair, the benefit is not literally 0, since collision attacks could be done if you happen to have a hash that has been found in the chain. It would be such a weirdly inefficient way of building a database for that purpose though. One hash every so many minutes? If the blockchain is some magic Sha-256 crowdcomputing hacking scheme, it's an extremely dumb one.

       If it were possible to crack SHA by calculating lots of SHA hashes, it wouldn't be effective as a security measure. It would be cracked already. The whole point of a good hash function is that it's resistant to that kind of attack.

       Depends on timescales. No cryptographic security measure except for one time pads can last forever due to the continuous increase of intergrated circuit integration density and hence computational power and/or energy efficiency otherwise known as Moore's law.

       Because perhaps the backdoor relies on said bitcoin miners to keep it as obscured as possible? Backdoors fundamentally rely on security by obscurity, after all.

       Gonna need some actual evidence for this, there isn't any in your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government has zero incentive to back any cryptos because of what they see as an inherent protection for criminals that's built into the system. Not to mention the
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       cost for adoption. The benefits you claim in your post are massively outweighed by the detriments.
      </p>
      <p>
       This same protection is simultaneously seen by proponents of cryptos as a big pro - anonymity is good in all things.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why major US institutions refuse to adopt cryptos - it's expensive to make these sorts of major sweeping changes, and there are too many things "wrong" with the current state of cryptos to justify the obvious benefits.

       You're not thinking about this properly. If you can figure out the location of nodes you can also compile a list of technologically savvy people and figure out who has what computing power that could also be use for a brute force attack on secure government computers while simultaneously incentivizing people to participate in the system under the guise of it being crypto currency in principle which attracts technologically savvy people looking to make money. That way the NSA now has a list with everyone with the intelligence and hardware and expertise that could potentially try and breach their systems and the NSA incentivized people and organizations to do so monetarily. The Chinese have a large stake in bitcoin and Chinese hackers have presented a huge security problem to the NSA.

       They had even the earliest ISPs give them backdoor access to all of their data traffic and that was in the 80s and that is why it is so laughable that America was so up in arms about Edward Snowden.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NSA has super computers large enough to fudge the network and they have been collecting every single piece of raw analog signal on the planet since the early 60s and deciphering it in their basements for a really long time.

       There's an important point here that can be expounded on further. Bitcoin has lead to the creation of a multi-billion dollar SHA 256 ASIC industry - as foreseen by Satoshi Nakamoto. There are also Scrypt ASICs. In fact, cryptocurrencies using a certain algorithm for hashing is the tipping point that allows these ASICs to be created. The concern of backdoors in SHA 256 vs Scrypt because of creator are valid. However, the fact of the matter is that the existence of these cryptocurrencies establish a sort of multi billion dollar bug bounty on cracking or exploiting such exploits. Thanks for the great post - Just my two bits of extrapolation :).

       We will definitely see bitcoin replaced with a better version, not once, many times over across human history as our computing technology evolves. Soon SHA-256 will be too simple for our needs. We will need more sophisticated and secure systems to replace it, which will come with new cryptocurrencies. The security of the currency will dictate demand, which will allow for computer scientists to compete for the next best crypto for the consumer, a digital race if you will.

       I remember a good visualization of what it takes to guess a sha256 hash (randomly chosen (p@ssword isn't a password podesta)). It was 4 billion to the 8th power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something like
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Start with a single computer doing nothing but guessing (4 billion guesses a second)
       </li>
       <li>
        Make it as powerful as
        <em>
         every computer in the world combined
        </em>
        (4 billion total)
       </li>
       <li>
        Give said super computer to every male on the planet (4 billion)
       </li>
       <li>
        Ensure that all habitable planets in the milky way run the same setup (4 billion inhabitable planets)
       </li>
       <li>
        Ensure that all know galaxies run the same setup (4 billion galaxies in known universe)
       </li>
       <li>
        Do this for half a trillion years (4 billion seconds squared)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And you would have a 1 in 4 billion chance of guessing correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, we've got a quarter of a billion pre-guessed solutions... but sha256 is
       <em>
        haard
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if moors law and quantum computing and all those other words no one
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       understands... we switch to 512.
      </p>
      <p>
       sha256 - 1e+77   - 4bil ^ 8
atoms   - 1e+123 - 4bil ^ 13
sha512 - 1e+154 - 4bil ^ 16
      </p>
      <p>
       I really can't imagine we'll need to "up the sha" in my lifetime... but if it happens, I can't imagine we'll have to do it more than once or twice ever. Unless we solve p=np, in which case everything's fucked.
