        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My grandmother believes that the left are not only an ideological stance but also a group of individuals at varying levels of society who wittingly or unwittingly take part in the organised and systematic degradation of conservative values and ultimately the destruction of western culture.</p>

<p>I wanted to start off by telling you a story about my grandmother who I saw back in the day as a conspiracy nut.</p>

<p>When I was young (6-7) I often stayed with my grandmother. She told me: &quot;jaitaiwan, don&#39;t have kids, this world is fast heading for the dumpster&quot;. I somewhat believed her but as she explained why it made me think she was more nuts:</p>

<p>&quot;Jaitaiwan, the left want to remove the idea of biological male and female differences to break up the family unit &quot;</p>

<p>Once 3rd wave feminism hit our shores:</p>

<p>&quot;Jaitaiwan, there is an all out attack on the modern family. These people want more divorce and want to divide the family to increase depravity and allow them to go after all sorts of odd and weird sexual things&quot;</p>

<p>Then she&#39;d say:</p>

<p>&quot;jaitaiwan, the family unit is broken and now they will want to legalise homosexuality so that they can have children within their perverted idea of families.&quot;</p>

<p>Then once homosexuality came in:</p>

<p>&quot;Jaitaiwan they&#39;re going to use the same arguments to legalise consensual pedophilia&quot;</p>

<p>Now that it&#39;s already being argued for in the US:</p>

<p>&quot;Jaitaiwan eventually you&#39;ll be able to marry your dog, and you can get social benefits for caring for the animal children you have as a result of your dog getting surrogate children&quot;</p>

<p>And after each of these statements she&#39;d tell me: &quot;we need a balance of left and right views, but the left have such divisive and cunning natures that they will always cunningly head for their socialist agenda and undermine the conservative values and foundations western society is built on. They will achieve this by ultimately changing the meaning of truth. Once objective truth is lost then anything can and will be justified&quot;</p>

<p>Now to why I&#39;m here: I&#39;ve definitely seen an attack on free speech, democracy, logical thinking etc but what I&#39;m wondering is if there is some sort of evidence or signs that point towards this being a systematic and calculated attack on the right wing? I&#39;d really like it for it not to be a thing in some ways because then I don&#39;t have to worry about some sort of overbearing authoritarian power but then if there isn&#39;t one orchestrating this, then I have to worry about the chaos that we are descending into and how we can possibly get out...</p>

<p>What will be interesting is if this post gets deleted for rule #1...</p>

<p>The mass murder and racist though are true. Even if you don&#39;t believe the holocaust happened he certainly wanted the mass murder of the slavs at the least. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to claim he&#39;s not racist </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s hard to call someone racist for locking up a group of people who declared war on the country he was running.  He actually allowed many of them to leave the country before the war started.  The ones who remained or returned were put into the camps, along with the jews from other countries that were imported to the camps.  It seems racist on a base level, but if anyone declared war on you then you would put them in camps too.  If you lose and someone spins a good yarn, you become the world&#39;s boogeyman forever held up as what the next targeted country&#39;s leader resembles because of reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet surely he would have understood not all jews would have even agreed with that? Especially in Germany with some of the best integrated Jews anywhere in the world. </p>

<p>Also I thought there were other groups? You know like slavs who he believed were inferior for instance? Denying hitler was racist is lunacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granny is not conservative, otherwise she would have keep her ass in the kitchen and her mouth shut.  She&#39;s just cherry picking issues that appeal to her bigotry.  Listening to woman has been a problem since they were invented.  That&#39;s a real basic conservative value.  I&#39;m sure she took from those socialist programs with her only complaint being that Social Security checks weren&#39;t big enough.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely seen an attack on free speech, democracy, logical thinking etc but what I&#39;m wondering is if there is some sort of evidence or signs that point towards this being a systematic and calculated attack on the right wing?</p>

<p>Interesting you mention <strong>logical thinking</strong>. Do you consider yourself a logical thinker? If so, where did you learn how to think logically?</p>
