<p>I&#39;m looking for unbiased facts, I don&#39;t want any liberal or any conservative bullshit. I&#39;m not really looking for shit that could be a coincidence either or stuff like &quot;oh all the places around there have pedo symbols&quot; I like cold hard information, not speculation.</p>

<p>I already know about like the code words and shit like that, but this is a huge rabbit hole I&#39;m ready to go down.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to check out some convincing emails from the Podesta leak if you guys could link me to that as well.</p>

<p>But yeah any info/articles/videos you guys have would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Edit: Keep the downvotes coming people, you can&#39;t bury this topic</p>

<p>Edit 2: Was at nine outvotes now I&#39;m down to zero, keep it up shills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It should probably just be 1) pizzagate 2) facts</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine with downvotes, but I want each person who does so to consider that OP asked for &quot;cold, hard information&quot; and &quot;unbiased facts&quot; about Pizzagate, and I don&#39;t see any of that in the most upvoted comments above. Just insinuation, peripheral information, loose interpretation, and invitations to explore myriad disparate subject matter. Now I know this is a conspiracy forum, and things can be messy and complicated, but not one person has clearly presented anything in support of the Pizzagate theory which is remotely convincing.</p>

<p>I was keenly interested in the responses this post would receive, but anyone who believes in Pizzagate <em>and</em> has any capacity for critical thought whatsoever should be extremely disappointed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t bother finding any smoking gun in the emails. Imo the only really wtf email is the pizza hankerchief one. That one deserves a look through. There are some other fishy emails, but like I said, that&#39;s not where you&#39;re going to find anything too big</p>

<p>Imo the real connections emerge when you start connecting dots. Look into Haiti. Pizzagate is honestly so massive that it&#39;s hard to just hand you a single link. All I can say it start digging. When examining pizzagate you have to look at the bigger picture. Sorry I can&#39;t send links I&#39;m on mobile and really lazy </p>

<p>Because when I think about ping pong for kids, I think about a single shady table, look at the drawing on each one of the pages: a hot dog? a baby? a goat? a wrestler?</p>

<p>Shady webpage&#39;s as friends is a major point from PG that most people seem to ignore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly.. and I&#39;m not one to brush off everything PG, in fact see my immediately previous comment for something truly gross..</p>

<p>But I also think this beanie baby email is just some kind of dumb joke email or something. Note that it&#39;s addressed to all law faculty and staff at Georgetown (premiere university in DC). I guarantee you that not everyone.. in fact most people.. who would be on that email list are absolutely not down with the bullshit. We&#39;re even talking secretaries and underlings. </p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s possible that they would assume that people who wouldn&#39;t catch the &quot;lingo&quot; would ignore it or assume it&#39;s a dumb joke, but that sounds unnecessarily stupid and risky from their pov. And the people on that list aren&#39;t stupid. I just have a hard time with this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I even doubt that really. I think it&#39;s more likely some bad joke of an email or maybe inside jokes, and less likely a college law professional has 400+ beanie babies he has to sell off before mommy finds out. There are better places to sell beanie babies than letting your colleagues know you&#39;re a weirdo scared of mommy&#39;s opinion. </p>

<p>Whichever the case though, yeah, I see nothing nefarious in this email.</p>

<p>Compared to the numerous conspiracy theories with evidence like 9/11, anunnakis, NWO, illuminati, etc.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s a conspiracy theory and not a police report case, when people say this I completely believe they know nothing about this sub.</p>

<p>The moment a conspiracy theory gets actual evidence it stops being a conspiracy theory my friend, welcome to the sub.</p>

<p>Haha, I invite you to read my first comment again, there&#39;s no magic link or magic 5-minute video, you have to do your own research on this specific topic, your problem is you are expecting some source for you to say OH! I believe now!, but that&#39;s not going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every thread on Russia here is full of people saying &quot;No concrete evidence!&quot; Maybe you&#39;re new here?</p>

<p>And, like I said, every time I&#39;ve researched it I get the feeling that it&#39;s all manufactured propaganda. I believe there&#39;s pedophile rings and weird sex fetishes involving people in power (Catholic church, the British group, Hollywood), but the idea that there was a child sex dungeon operating out in the open out of a pizza shop for an extended period of time without a single victim coming forward doesn&#39;t sound credible. All the other pedophile rings had victims coming forward and getting shamed into silence or ignored, but here there&#39;s none of that, just some vague emails.</p>

<p>So, keep pushing your bullshit, but you&#39;ll have to research it if you want to learn how you&#39;ve been manipulated by right-wing and Russian psyops who pushed Pizzagate to sow division and chaos.</p>

<p>Are you really this dense? lmao</p>

<p>Man, the Russia thing is a conspiracy theory, you know why people were saying that? Because it was in the fucking NEWS!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy without evidence as much as PizzaGate, but the news tells you one is stupid and the other one is real, when neither of them have concrete evidence, people were pushing the Russia conspiracy as real news, that&#39;s why people said that.</p>

How damn weird that it was assumed from the outset that it was some sort of skeevy party. &quot;kids in a pool? Yep, that&#39;s a rape pool.&quot;</p>

<p>In this super backwards and fucked up way, pizzagate sexualizes children to a shocking degree. In that any referenced interaction between a child and an adult that has fallen under the pizzagate shadow is just assumed to be sexual in nature until it can be proven otherwise.* That is a deeply unhealthy way to reflexively view interactions with children, even if it&#39;s all being projected outward. </p>

<p>*Of course it never can be. You can&#39;t prove a negative, and the stain never ever goes away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha. I was just a little confused by your wording and thought there might be a book I was unaware of. &quot;The Franklin Scandal&quot; contains the actual Customs Report from when the government raided several properties used by the Finders around D.C. They found all sorts of damning evidence, but then the CIA came in and killed the investigation while also sweeping everything under the rug. You should check out the book if you&#39;re wanting to learn more about all of this. I can&#39;t recommend it enough</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence synthesized together in Nick Bryant&#39;s book, which was mentioned further up on this thread and also in another comment I made to you. He spoke to several victims and witnesses, and cites from original documents produced during the 1980s and 90s. Much of the documentation is in the book, and a lot can also be found online:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://franklinscandal.com/links/">Notes from the Franklin Committee investigation and investigator Gary Caradori</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/fd_pdf/">Larry King&#39;s flight receipts</a></p></li>
<li><p>Audio interview snippets: <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/audio/">1</a>, <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/otheraudio/">2</a>, <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/eulice/eulice/">3</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ne-court-of-appeals/1252943.html">Court documents for Dr. Leslie Collins, a Boys Town counselor</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the book itself is essential to putting all of this information together and building a coherent narrative.</p>

Although I can&#39;t seem to find it anymore, someone had left a comment with a long list of links connecting scanned news articles and notes from the head investigator for the Franklin Committee. I was actually in the process of reading the information. I had just gone through a an article about someone from WVA in relation to a escort service in DC. If I can find the links again, I will continue to look into things. That said, so far, I have seen nothing that has swayed me from believing the grand jury&#39;s decision in the matter isn&#39;t honest and correct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Franklin grand jury and Alisha Owen perjury trial were a blatant miscarriage of justice, as Nick Bryant&#39;s book <em>The Franklin Scandal</em> explains quite well. Some examples of how the trial was a farce:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Troy Boner said that he learned the &quot;hoax&quot; from Alisha Owen (6 hours worth of testimony) in a 20-minute phone call that was proven by phone records to have never taken place.</p></li>
<li><p>Boner also said he imparted the &quot;hoax&quot; to Danny King at the bar of the Residence Inn, a hotel which didn&#39;t have a bar</p></li>
<li><p>No real explanation was provided for how Paul Bonacci, one of the victims, could name other victims who had come forward but whose identities weren&#39;t yet made public</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Wadman, who Owen accused of raping and impregnating her, talked about a blood test allegedly proving he wasn&#39;t the father of her child, but the state didn&#39;t introduce this into the evidence for the scrutiny of the jurors. An appeals court later admitted that the state &quot;erred&quot; in this decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Wadman lied multiple times to make it seem like Owen&#39;s description of him was incorrect: about his arm being severely injured, about not carrying a gun since his time as a federal agent, and about not playing racquetball</p></li>
<li><p>A deposition proving that he lied about not carrying a gun mysteriously disappeared from the evidence and the jurors couldn&#39;t view it during deliberation</p></li>
<li><p>The judge told the jurors not to watch a TV program about prominent people being accused of sex crimes that interviewed Robert Wadman and Troy Boner. Almost all of the jurors then went out and watched it.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence that was never brought up during trial, a supposed letter from Michael Casey telling Owen about how she could profit from the &quot;hoax&quot;, was planted in the jury room (according to multiple juror affidavits). This letter was said to come from a search of Owen&#39;s cell conducted on March 8, but was dated March 15.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, after just barely managing to get Alisha Owen convicted, the state then dropped perjury charges against Paul Bonacci. I sure wonder why they did that, if it was such an obvious hoax that it would have been easy to convince jurors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ben Swann Pizzagate report is what you are looking for.</p>

<p>The short and skinny is that the intelligence community has established listed parallel governments using a network of NGOs and think tanks and one small part of their unethical manipulation of the masses is to use blackmail/bribery circles to ensure politicians who all have been working to expand the authority of these parallel powers.</p>

<p>The intelligence community runs guns and drugs and everyone would be naive to think that they end at people.</p>

<p>Cults are a big part of the bread and butter of the intelligence community, because controlling a cult means you have people who will do anything without regard to consequences.</p>

<p>The media is in on it to the fullest extent, meaning that most politics and war is theater because the real power exchanges are done through infiltration.</p>

<p>Everything is infiltrated. Political groups, environmental, religious... every cause.</p>

<p>Start at Tavistock and US Air Force, &#39; Some Principals of Mass Persuasion &#39;</p>

<p>Tavistock scientist wrote a book called &#39; Battle for the Mind &#39; by Sargent. Includes cult behavior, interrogation, resetting people&#39;s brains.</p>

<p>They are connected to Stanford Research, Brookings, Esalen, ARK and through those entities, the Clinton Foundation. </p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation is a CIA proprietary. It takes money for the political influence and forensic interruption capabilities of the parallel machine.</p>

<p>Bizapedia reveals other businesses like J T Packing that has the same Board of directors as the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>People like Kadzik, Holder and Comey have been part of this machine for many years as exposed by the FBI vault. </p>

<p>Clintons pardon Marc Rich of Glencore, appoint brother to board of VCS mining, arrange Uranium One with Frank Giustra... all mining operations that use slavery.</p>

<p>The Clinton Foundation is in bed with slavers in the mining industry and help cut red tape around the world to exploit other countries&#39; natural resources.</p>

<p>That is what funds the massive Web of Psy ops upon the population.</p>

<p>George has been researching and reporting this stuff for over 280 days, every single day. It all started with Eric Braverman, CEO of the Clinton foundation saying &quot;follow the money&quot; and wikileaks publishing emails that revealed many different ratlines and connections to organizations than have been mentioned in the media. </p>

<p>George started talking about the awan brothers at least 150 days ago, and he just got arrested a couple weeks ago, and the mainstream is beginning to catch on to the story. I highly suggest you look them up because they have the most in depth and objectively fact based reporting on the massive government conspiracy that has been operating for the last 20 years</p>

<p>The problem is that no one will believe a summary because the investigation is so huge. People just think George makes shit up, if he hadn&#39;t crowdsourced a lot of information and publicly documented his progress, at first glance I&#39;d probably think he s schizo. </p>

<p>So people need to get out of their own heads, recognize that this man has been deep in the information every single day, all day, for nearly 300 days, and he has a better understanding of the big picture than any of us do on our own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah cheese pizza means child porn. Cheese is little girl (Which was used <em>many</em> times by the way. Pizza by it self doesn&#39;t technically mean anything but if it is used by itself it means something CP related. For example the handkerchief email.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43113">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/43113</a></p>

<p>The way they talk about the &quot;walnut sauce&quot; kinda makes it seem like it&#39;s something... Exotic? So yea it makes sense that it would be a person of color. And I&#39;m not sure how your certain that code was never used.</p>

<p>Actual pedophiles posted the code words originally on 4chan (Perhaps the politicians?) and then 4chan started using them. Not the other way around. Although the idea of Podesta lurking 4chan is pretty funny.</p>

<p>Also I want to say what made me believe that pizzagate was real. Which would be the raw percent chance. Which is EASILY over 99% And that&#39;s just from a couple hours of looking into it. Seriously theirs THOUSANDS of circumstantial evidence. And dozens of those are odd emails. (Hundreds if you include the &quot;art&quot;). And the main argument against the code and art is &quot;It could mean anything though&quot; Which <em>only</em> works if theirs a few or so. Not dozens.</p>

<p>And since I have a feeling your gonna retort something like &quot;Well Trump is a part of it too!&quot; Or &quot;Trump isn&#39;t going to do anything about it!&quot;</p>

<p>I would refer you to the blatant jab Trump made at the Red dinner about Hillary and Haiti villages.</p>

<p>They happen to have art depicting children sexualised when they also have strange code that is very obviously about child trafficking, So yes it&#39;s not solid proof (Which for some reason you are bringing up the retarded solid proof argument even though I was talking about the chances being over 99%. Odd.) But it sure as hell is circumstantial evidence. Also a quick question, Do you seriously not find the art morally objectionable or weird?</p>

<p>&quot;Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?&quot;</p>

<p>The belief from investigators is dominoes = BDSM Domination, So &quot;Do you think I should dominate a girl or a boy&quot;? Also the rest of the email is somewhat oddly worded, But not enough to point out I&#39;d say.</p>

<p>The common argument against this one is that they really were asking if they would play dominoes better if they ate pasta or cheese.... Which is a retarded argument in multiple ways. First off the way it is worded implies it was playing dominoes <em>ontop</em> of the cheese or pasta. So unless they misworded it ain&#39;t that. And second of all it makes <em>zero</em> sense as a joke. Even for weird old people.</p>

<p>Theirs also the 65,000$ hotdog email. </p>

<p>First of all white house doesn&#39;t accept outside food. Never seen a explanation for this one &quot;oddly&quot;. Just diversions.</p>

<p>Second of all the price is obviously ridiculous. <em>Even</em> for a large party. Which is the main argument against this.</p>

<p>Third of all the &quot;Waitresses&quot; (Literally quoted in the email). The arguments&#39; for this one is either it straight up prostitutes/drugs or  it was just someone making up the &quot;Waitresses&quot; thing. Hopefully I don&#39;t have to explain how retarded that is, But most of the time people just don&#39;t explain it. For obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Theirs one email (Which I can never find sadly) where it was them getting excited about eating one month old pasta. (Or something along those lines). Government elites eating one month old pasta... Huh. Them eating leftovers at all is strange.</p>

<p>Theirs the pool one as well</p>

<p>No code is this one (Which you oh so hate), But just a lot of strange wording.</p>

<p>First of all the word transport is strangely formal. Second of all the person mentioning the kids ages is odd. And then theirs the most incriminating part of all.</p>

<p>&quot;so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.&quot;</p>

<p>The first part suggest that the people there are getting entertainment from the children... This could be excused it they were family... But their not. And the second part implies that the kids would be &quot;Willing&quot;. Since before this they said a swim was only a possibility.</p>

<p>Like seriously why are they making such a big deal about the children being in the pool? Why is it so important?</p>

Are you aware that this is a Stratfor email from 8 years ago and not part of the DNC or Podesta emails in any way? The man who wrote the email about the $65 000 hot dogs is Fred Barton, and other emails from the same leak included him saying things like  “towel heads”, “camel jockies” or “sleezy arsehole ragheads” to describe Arab terror suspects.

<p>I love this email, because it&#39;s the most ridiculous of all. People think it&#39;s so unreasonable that people would consider children as entertainment.</p>

<p>I was a family dinner the other night, where several relatives were watching a 7 month old playing on the floor. The 7 month old plays a game where if someone coughs, he does a fake cough in return. My cousin, when I arrived, said &#39;Oh Wesley&#39;s just been entertaining everyone for the last half hour&#39; when I asked what they were up to.</p>

<p>So yes, people really do say things like that. It&#39;s not that weird, and it&#39;s sinister only if you assume pedophilia going in. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because people think their children (or grandchildren in this case) are the most important things in the world, and like to believe everyone else will love them as much as they do.</p>

<p>Is this really the best you got? Words taken out of context and forced through a distorted lens? &#39;Weird phrasing&#39;? And an email from someone not even related to the pizzagate accusations?</p>

<p>Do your research. I did, because I started off as a believer, but as I examined everything that came up, none of it held together. </p>

<p>You seem to have a misunderstanding of what Pizzagate is. It&#39;s a conspiracy theory on a massive pedo ring in the US government,(Or global). It&#39;s not just limited to some people. Also it Burton not Barton.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>BULLSHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess that you first believed in Pizzagate because you guessed that their was a global pedo ring already... Yet you act as if Pizzagate is a small group of people? Extremely contradicting by the way.</p>

<p>Or if your saying you first believed it because of the kinda things we were talking about and looked further and &quot;none of it held together&quot; then you forcefully thought of ways that they don&#39;t hold together. Even when your arguments are shit or literally make zero sense (As I have shown above) you still believe they are valid. Either because of bias (I don&#39;t know your political leanings) or because it hurts you too much emotionally of the idea that their really is a massive global pedo ring.</p>

<p>Actually I just want to point out that I started as a non believer, Even when I was a Trump supporter since I only saw a few snippets (I thought it was too unlikely for a pedo ring like that to be caught), But then after some hours of research it became clear it was real. Also their is the MKUltra thing among others that help it not being caught.</p>

It was worded as if they were on a substance, as in &#39;on drugs&#39;.  I addressed your second point directly, I feel like you&#39;re not reading what I wrote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You didn&#39;t address the somewhat odd wording. Just reverted back to the &quot;It&#39;s Italian food and their Italians therefore It can&#39;t be pedo code!&quot; argument... Actually perhaps that&#39;s where the pedo code first originated? Ya know with all the pedo priest drama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did address the weird wording. I addressed it /directly/, but I&#39;ll do it again. Here&#39;s the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ps. Do you think I’ll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me parse that out for you. &quot;Do you think I&#39;ll perform better at the game of dominos&quot; is the first part. Here&#39;s where you think they&#39;re talking about playing it on top of cheese or pasta, but that&#39;s not how it&#39;s intended. As I said, it&#39;s a stupid joke pretending the food is some sort of performance enhancer, or luck providing substance. So what they are saying is &#39;Would I do better at the game after having eaten pasta or having eaten cheese&#39;, not &#39;playing dominos on top of pasta or cheese&#39;.</p>

<p>That people can&#39;t seem to grasp this is honestly baffling, and gives me no hope for actually resolving this conversation. This is so clearly, unambiguously what is meant, but because some people already believe these people are pedophiles talking in code, they twist it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You seem to have a misunderstanding of what Pizzagate is. It&#39;s a conspiracy theory on a massive pedo ring in the US government,(Or global). It&#39;s not just limited to some people. Also it Burton not Barton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because that&#39;s what you say Pizzagate is doesn&#39;t make it so. Pizzagate ran out of steam so people tried to fold it into some global conspiracy and label it Pedogate.</p>

<p>I am in no way denying there is pedophilia among the elites, but pizzagate was a theory that came from the Podesta emails and tied to comet ping pong. However, neither of us is the final arbiter about what the definition of Pizzagate is, so I don&#39;t see any point arguing it. However, the &#39;code&#39; and emails that you have been referring to have all been from the podesta emails. If you want to argue outside of those emails, I&#39;m not going to deny you. But within those emails there&#39;s only bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok your actually not reading what I&#39;m saying are you? I literally said if it was family then it was acceptable and pointed out how they weren&#39;t family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it only acceptable to find kids entertaining if they&#39;re family? Many people love kids. I brought my newborn to my dad&#39;s office just this week and all of the staff were crazy to meet her. People love kids, especially people who are parents. They don&#39;t have to be family for it to not be weird, that&#39;s an entirely arbitrary line you&#39;ve drawn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh what? What the fuck does their children being important to them have to do with them being in a pool? Seriously what the fuck are you talking about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do you need to justify kids being in a pool? Kids love people, and adults love seeing kids enjoy themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m going to guess that you first believed in Pizzagate because you guessed that their was a global pedo ring already... Yet you act as if Pizzagate is a small group of people? Extremely contradicting by the way.
Or if your saying you first believed it because of the kinda things we were talking about and looked further and &quot;none of it held together&quot; then you forcefully thought of ways that they don&#39;t hold together. Even when your arguments are shit or literally make zero sense (As I have shown above) you still believe they are valid. Either because of bias (I don&#39;t know your political leanings) or because it hurts you too much emotionally of the idea that their really is a massive global pedo ring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pizzagate, as I refer to it, is the podesta emails the supposed code for pedophilia, as well as the Comet Ping Pong connection. That is the scope of what I am discussing, and that is what I consider to be utter fabrication. </p>

<p>If you want to discuss some global elite pedophilia ring, go ahead. I&#39;m not going to argue, because it&#39;s probably accurate and I know nothing about it. However, the content of these emails is available for everyone to read, and that is what I&#39;m discussing. </p>

<p>Lmao I like how you just gave up on your original argument on this. And again adults only love to see kids enjoy themselves if they are <em>family</em>. And I don&#39;t see how they have absolutely have to be in the pool to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>a) they are still using the domino/cheese/pasta code

<p>I&#39;m not even saying Podesta is not a pedophile. I don&#39;t know if it he is or not. What I am saying, and firmly believe, is that the podesta emails have no evidence of pedophilia, and they do not contain codewords for discussing pedophilia or the trafficking of children.</p>

<p>How come you miss what I mean every.single.time. It&#39;s pretty odd.
What you were saying was you believed in a global pedo ring but not a small group of people you think pizzagate is about. <em>I</em> pointed out how Hillary (Again a representation of the deep state AKA what would be a global pedo ring) is directly connected to Podesta.

<p>Changing the word usage doesn&#39;t help your argument. She said &quot;They would definitely be in that pool&quot; Your word usage suggest they would be in the pool of their own volition. And again it would only be family that enjoy kids having fun.</p>

<p>Your not changing your mind because you completely ignore my main point which (again) is that all the circumstantial evidence no matter how unlikely <em>adds</em> up. And I only use the word retarded if the argument is completely broken at a fundamental level. With you it was usually contradictory statements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m one of those people that gets very tired of the LCD parts in areas of interest like this, the fun one liners based off circumstantial evidence only keep me satiated for so long until I feel the need to get something more concrete or move on.  Fortunately the latter has happened in this case, albeit the title isn&#39;t pizzagate for me anymore.  Even if the people there at day one like me had a reasonable construction of possibilities based on tangible things, it doesn&#39;t really matter because now people associate it with &quot;haha you think they have KIDS under every pizzashop in DC&quot; and I don&#39;t really find it necessary to fight over what I think a meme word means, especially when I&#39;ve already watched so many people divide themselves up and in-fight instead of continue looking into things (just like [Insert TPTB of your choice here] wants you to.  And I&#39;ll be completely honest, there&#39;s a lot of mouth breathing retards that have a fetish for hashtags and sensational claims that shit everything up in the wake of the early/refined pursuers of information, and sometimes even worse in the front of us—for example the people writing shit on Alefantis&#39; Instagram that alerted him to disable it, etc.  But its ok, because all the details and facts still keep coming up and they&#39;re the same even if you call the whole thing something else, or try and look at a perspective (often bigger, and in cases easier to influence positive change in).  Taking a detour to see to better perceive the machinations isn&#39;t a bad thing.  Don&#39;t take this as a message to blow off everyone in the comments section, just keep up with how you sounded in the post and be prepared to continue down a whole bunch of rabbitholes of different directions (and be able to turn around when it bottoms out).</p>

<p>imo you should check out this reddit post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">The Mountain of Evidence for a Massive International Pedophile Ring Protected by Police and Intelligence Agencies</a>. Besides the McMartin Preschool, of which I&#39;m skeptical of after reading <a href="http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/viewFile/77/96">this further analysis</a>, there&#39;s some good info here about some historical events and out of them I can comfortably recommend looking into the Dutrox Affair—as for the others, they have varying levels of tangibility. The Lincoln Nebraska Scandal and The Finders stand stronger out of rest to me, and while kind of hard to find further information beyond the standard line, I have had a few instances of people going into further detail into The Finders tangentially in a way that boosted the validity of the claims and I&#39;d place that second after Dutrox.  That being said I separate these from the Dutrox Affair because they don&#39;t have enough to stand on for my own taste. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re fake, just that there&#39;s a LOT of documentation on things you&#39;d never expect that I&#39;m far more confident in standing behind.  So definitely read all of it and collect all the facts, but even if you disagree with some of it I&#39;d take in the themes and ideas because you&#39;ll notice patterns in the future.</p>

<p>As for The Dutrox Affair</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for unbiased facts, I don&#39;t want any liberal or any conservative bullshit. I&#39;m not really looking for shit that could be a coincidence either or stuff like &quot;oh all the places around there have pedo symbols&quot; I like cold hard information, not speculation.&quot;</p>

<p>I could keep going but I&#39;ll just say go look at anything you&#39;re interested in on the site, its nuts</p>

<p>Hopefully you&#39;ll be interested in this more historical documentation on the rabbithole, if anything I think it just made me more interested in getting to the bottom of whatever&#39;s going on in those emails, whether pizza is kids, pizza is weapons, organs, whatever permutation of food and horrible shit we keep seeing. On that topic, I&#39;d check out George Webb&#39;s investigation (or the daily live streams on current activities/news w/ Crowdsource The Truth for those with less time to binge this) as a last recommendation—its finally come thru in the eyes of many after the stories he was chasing and his findings bubbled up to the MSM, and I feel quite a bit more comfortable recommending his now 280+ day investigation log consisting of multiple uploads a day on his findings, working theories, and later on his daily movements around the country looking at leads.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of it is speculative. I think there is value in going through a lot of the coincidences and deciding for yourself what you believe. If you aren&#39;t willing to do that you won&#39;t have a very meaningful opinion on the topic. Though of course it is a conspiracy theory topic dealing with very connected people doing some horribly evil shit so it is inherently difficult to be factually informed so if that is vital to you forming an opinion on it you might not want to even bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I already know about like the code words and shit like that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This right here is the biggest element of misinformation involved in this conspiracy. (and I don&#39;t mean that as a personal attack on you, I am positive that you have good intentions) </p>

<p>It is just accepted as fact that the whole pizza code is legit, usually that it came from the FBI. But that FBI memo talks only of the symbols. The pedo pizza code was invented purely on 4chan, and has no validity. The exception being that Cheese Pizza has been used on the internet to wink at Child Porn, and this seed crystal of truth is used to sell the whole lie. Cheese Pizza was only ever used before this happened, more of a tongue in cheek thing than a code. Just &quot;pizza&quot; never meant kiddy porn/abuse before this. However, it is VERY common to use &#39;pizza&#39; to allude to drugs and prostitution.</p>

<p>Taking it one step further, there is a wealth of evidence that elites have been abuses children for ages, in a really organized fashion. Why, after doing this for hundreds of years, would they suddenly adopt a simple corruption of a script kiddy reference to child porn? Surely they would have developed their own way to wink at this somewhere along the centuries. I mean is the idea that some Rothschild was trolling 4chan for lolis and just happened to pick up the lingo and pass it along to the rest of the elite in a decade or so?</p>

For a while articles of &quot;100&#39;s of arrests in sex ring busts&quot; and &quot;thousands of children go missing a year&quot; are wielded as evidence, and they sound connected from the headline, but you find the arrests are sex workers, pimps and johns who are usually back on the street busted multiple times...not some helpless children slaves of government power players.

    <div class="md"><p>it was in the devil politico as far back as march 1st at least. It didn&#39;t blow up because they got investigated and they hadnt found anything, even still he hasn&#39;t been charged with anything related to the accusations, so the MSM reported on the initial accusations, but nothing new happened with it until recently</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, you are a &quot;left/right&quot; dude, ok then.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in participating in that divisive bullshit but I&#39;ll tell you this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every thread on Russia here is full of people saying &quot;No concrete evidence!&quot; Maybe you&#39;re new here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you really this dense? lmao</p>

<p>Man, the Russia thing is a conspiracy theory, you know why people were saying that? Because it was in the fucking NEWS!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a conspiracy without evidence as much as PizzaGate, but the news tells you one is stupid and the other one is real, when neither of them have concrete evidence, people were pushing the Russia conspiracy as real news, that&#39;s why people said that.</p>

<p>No surprise you can&#39;t get anything out of Voat, you are one dense mother fucker haha.</p>

<p>Anyway, have a good day and weekend man, as I said nothing good will come from our little chat here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence synthesized together in Nick Bryant&#39;s book, which was mentioned further up on this thread and also in another comment I made to you. He spoke to several victims and witnesses, and cites from original documents produced during the 1980s and 90s. Much of the documentation is in the book, and a lot can also be found online:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://franklinscandal.com/links/">Notes from the Franklin Committee investigation and investigator Gary Caradori</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/fd_pdf/">Larry King&#39;s flight receipts</a></p></li>
<li><p>Audio interview snippets: <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/audio/">1</a>, <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/otheraudio/">2</a>, <a href="http://franklinscandal.com/images/stories/eulice/eulice/">3</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ne-court-of-appeals/1252943.html">Court documents for Dr. Leslie Collins, a Boys Town counselor</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the book itself is essential to putting all of this information together and building a coherent narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can start with the sword and scale mentioned here - has a good number of victim and investigator interviews; and I hadn&#39;t actually saw that until today. Regardless it has many of the actual interviews mentioned and very little commentary.</p>

<p>Funny how you don&#39;t know the police treated this as a runaway for no reason, did no proper investigation, and think only their records are relevant. Truly naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeeeeep. So much, if not all, of this whole mess is attributable to folks not understanding sub-communities Parents, gay people, the art world, and especially children themselves. They each see and talk about the world differently. Those differences are getting leaned on and relentlessly smeared as kiddy fucking, it&#39;s gross and really weird. </p>
