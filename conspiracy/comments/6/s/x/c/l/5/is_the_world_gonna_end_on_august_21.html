       Ton of obscure American churches and a couple of occult groups have been pumping infographics into social media about the eclipse.

       Maybe they are serious, maybe it is a social experiment...

       It had been quiet for awhile after the 2012 hysteria.  Maybe they are crawling out from under their rocks again?

       There is no proof.  There are people that feel some of the things in Revelation 12 are indicative of a sign of the end times.  But there is nothing to say /this/ is the sign of the end times.  Just a sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for extremes.  This has been up for discussion for months.  There are signs, but none of them are definite, no matter what your friend says.

       It may or may not be a sign of the "end times", however, the Bible clearly states that it is not the end of life on planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book of Revelation chapter 21 states "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea" -
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&amp;amp;version=KJV
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the "end times" are not "the end of the world"/planet Earth.  I'd agree that the "end times" are the beginning of the end of this age, and a new beginning, that is, Jesus' 1000 year reign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the Holy Bible, we have at least x number of years to the tribulation period, 7 years of tribulation (last 3.5 being the Great Tribulation), then 1000 years of Jesus reign, then x number of years of satan being released from his imprisonment to deceive the nations, before chapter 21 of the book of Revelation begins where the first Heaven and the first Earth pass away".  So we're at least 1007+ years away from the planet Earth as we know this world from ending.

       Yeah it sucks, seriously.  There's a choice to be made by every human, and God/Creator is laying down the line.  Choose God/Creator/Jesus and have eternal life (though you may suffer greatly here by the hand of the "Adversary" if the rapture event isn't real) or worship Lucifer/Satan and be destroyed (and you will suffer greatly here by all of the natural and God/Creator made disasters/attacks/wars, and then suffer more in the afterlife/Hell and then in the Lake of Fire (in other words, lots of suffering for choosing to not worship God/Creator/Jesus)).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not fun either route, but only one route leads to Heaven/Eternal life.  If you believe all of this stuff, and choose this route, it will be good of you to pray for for those who are open to the idea of Heaven/Eternal life but don't quite believe or aren't saved by Jesus yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       God/Creator/Jesus bless.

       You don't question a book written by a bunch of guys. Critical thinkers question everything or are at least willing to do so

       The examples listed above are a good starting point. Plus most historians on the bible argue that fot instance exodus couldn't have happened the way it did in the bible and most likely the pharoh employed Jewish mercenaries etc.

       Perhaps I have questioned it, and have come to a conclusion.  You didn't even ask me if I did, you just stated your opinion as "fact", which you seem to do a lot of.

       I addressed your claim of "Genesis is just bollucks" inaccuracy in one of my posts above as an edit.  I think I added onto that post while we were going back and forth, so sorry for that.  I wasn't trying any trickery, I was trying to address your points.  Again, my apologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You are claiming god made man in his own image then made woman from a rib bone"  No, I am not claiming it, God (capital G to me) is, and I believe it.  So I claim that I believe God did make man in his own image then made woman from a rib bone (to show what he can do) and from dust of the Earth (where he made man from).
      </p>
      <p>
       A few months ago, I was curious and I searched online to see if modern day man has one less rib than modern women do.  They don't.  My reasoning suggested The Almighty God is within his power to not affect the DNA structure that was passed down when he removed Adam's rib bone, although, The Almighty is within his power to have removed the rib bone from man and also to have modified the DNA that was passed down genetically to Adam's offspring, however, evidently He chose to not affect the genes passed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What about the contradiction over Joseph's father?"  I'm assuming you mean that the book of Matthew chapter 1 states that Jesus' lineage has his Earthly father Joseph's Earthly father as Jacob, while the book of Luke chapter 3 states that Jesus' lineage has his Earthly father Joseph's Earthly father as Heli, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       The book of Luke, chapter 3, verse 23 includes the text "so it was thought" in the verse "Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began is ministry.  He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli"...
      </p>
      <p>
       The short answer is, that the writings of Luke, a doctor, would have utilized traditional record keeping in those days, which would not have listed Mary (Mirriam) but her husband (in keeping with the husband being her protecter) although Luke is tracing Jesus' lineage from Mary's side, thus, Heli was Joseph's father-in-law, Mary's father.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of Matthew's tracing of Jesus' lineage and Luke's tracing of Jesus' lineage was to show that Jesus is the rightful heir to the throne of David, according to the laws of Jewish royalty.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Or the nonsense of having Joseph and mary travel to Bethlehem?"  As for this contradiction, I'm assuming you mean the argument that the timeline for a census would have Jesus born later (about 6 AD) than when Herod the Great was slaughtering babies, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot to this, so I'm going to go with the short answer: There is evidence of multiple censuses (Chapter 34 of Res Gestae Augustus states, "When I administered my thirteenth consulate (2 B.C.E.), the senate and Equestrian order and Roman people all called me father of the country, and voted that the same be inscribed in the vestibule of my temple"), and also, that Augustus may have not yet been governor at that time but more like a mayor when the census during Jesus' birth came about.  This would corroborate Luke's writings on Jesus birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to change your mind about being a Christian or believing in the Holy Bible or God (capital G to me), however, I am trying to say that believers can and do think critically, even if they come to different conclusions than non-believers, and to frame them as people who don't think for themselves (or read what so-called scholars have to say about the subject), is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusions may not be what you believe.  I recognize that your beliefs are your beliefs and I'm not trying to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take care.

       I would love to hear how you defend a sign in the heavens happening this September that was foretold 2000 years ago in the Bible. You know, back when they didnt have the technology to view it ahead of time and because it's never happened as far we know. And the many other prophecies that have been predicted with 100% accuracy and that are still being fulfilled.

       I disagree partially.  The Holy Bible has parts that are to be taken literally, but also has metaphoric and allegoric writings as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are aspects that deal with physical signs and revealings (book of Revelation).

       The sun is in Virgo in September-October every year, the moon is at the feet of Virgo once or twice a month, Jupiter is in Virgo's "womb" once every 12 years, and the planets have aligned there several times in the last millenium, and, perhaps most importantly, there are more than 9 stars in Leo, so the "3 planets aligning" theory isn't even relevant. It's over 12 no matter how you look at it.

       Well it is a sign (and one of many prophecies) predicted in the Bible about 2000 years ago. I would just take it at that, who knows what is going to happen other than that great sign in the heavens.

       So you want to see an actual woman in the heavens, where the stars and planets dwell? Virgo is an ancient constellation and I think it totally makes sense that we expect that to be the woman in the sky, not an actual woman in the flesh.

       Well it's a supernatural occurrence at work, why not go all out?  Moses didn't have to rely on astrological mishaps.  Why speak in codes that only a very small number apparently have figured out?

       I'm distrustful because of all the other times something big was supposed to happen, all the other clues added up to nothing.    Why would this be any different?   These systems aligning just has no bearing on life on earth.  At other times, random things would line up from the viewpoint of Mars or Venus and they never go haywire from this.

       Those never really had any bearing, that was all mass hysteria over nothing. Im not even saying anything will happen but to deny this very specific sign in the heavens that has never happened before as far as we know it isnt something Im going to do just because of some hysteria over "the end of the world" which I never even bought in the first place.

       All of these signs have never happened together at once. Leo has 9 major stars and the 3 wandering stars that align right below it make 12. Deny it all you want, but this sign is happening for the first time in thousands of years (or ever). Doesnt mean the world is ending.

       You mean the womb? And thats funny, in 2017 Jupiter is gonna be just to the right of her right knee. Funny place for a womb isn't it? It's a constellation, to say the "Womb" is ridiculous, in the constellation the spot that we know of as the "womb" is represented by the space between her stomach and arm in Stellarium.

       Leo has 15 stars in the constellation. The 9 "main" stars aren't even the brightest in the constellation.

       Yes. Planets have been referred to as wandering stars for a very long time. The womb of Virgo is the box formed by 4 of the stars in the constellation, not the picture that Stellarium draws of it. It might sound ridiculous to you but Virgo is known to be the "virgin" constellation and it has a "womb" because it is supposed to be a woman. Jupiter has never floated around in the belly of Virgo for 42 weeks (human gestation) while wearing a crown of 12 stars, while also clothed with the sun and the moon at her feet. Leo has 9 major stars and it has always been that way. The stars are not dictated by their brightness, google "leo constellation" and every picture you see will have 9 major stars connected to form the lion. This sign is real and it hasnt happened as far as we know it, whether you like it or not.

       Don't patronize me on astronomy, I literally just showed you an example where Jupiter is more in the womb than it will be this year with all of the other " criteria" for this "sign" fulfilled from the 13th century. I know what Virgo is and what it stands for.

       Im not patronizing you, I bet you really do know your stuff. That picture is after Jupiter has exited out of the "womb" of Virgo which is on September 23. It doesnt matter if it exits out a little to the right or right in the middle. It is still exiting out of the "womb" or box in between the "legs" of the woman. Before that happens, it will be in the box/belly of the constellation for 42 weeks, which is the most important part.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I just went into Stellarium to check Jupiters activity around 1293 and it turns out that it was never even in the belly/box of Virgo for 9 months (more like 1 month) and after it exited the belly (after about 1 month on October 13th) it did so around the same spot as it is going to in September of this year. So, again, the important part that I think youre not understanding is that Jupiter will be moving around
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       of the box of Virgo for 9 months, which is nearly exactly as much time as a baby spends in the womb of her mother.

       Because youre wrong and you cant admit it. Youre an astronomer but you just cant accept that what Im telling you is true and there is a major sign in the sky coming up. Btw, I also have a job, thats no excuse. Anyways, have a good one, refer to my earlier comments if youre still confused on the whole thing.

       Not sure what that means, Jupiter will be spending 42 weeks in the box of Virgo. Not sure what is so hard for you to grasp. You just cant let go of your own ego and admit that the Bible predicted a sign in the heavens. That is too hard for you to do I guess.

       Welp, I tried my best to explain it all in the simplest of terms but that didnt work. Your problem. Not mine.

       I don't think the world is going to end on August 21, nor in  September.  I especially don't think the world will end on August 21 because there's a subsequent event in September; however, I don't think it all ends in September either.  Is it the start of the 7 year tribulation, possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you define the world is going to end?  According to the book of Revelation of the Holy Bible, this world, Earth, won't end for another 1000+ years, after Jesus' reign for 1000 years:
"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea" (chapter 21 of the book of Revelation).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe that, there's at least another 1000 years before this world/Earth passes away.

       Thats not a difference at all, Jupiter does that with every sign. It has a 12 year orbit, spends about a year, usually 9 ish months, in every sign.

       It may or may not be a sign of the "end times", however, the Bible clearly states that it is not the end of life on planet Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book of Revelation chapter 21 states "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea" -
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&amp;amp;version=KJV
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the "end times" are not "the end of the world"/planet Earth.  I'd agree that the "end times" are the beginning of the end of this age, and a new beginning, that is, Jesus' 1000 year reign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the Holy Bible, we have at least x number of years to the tribulation period, 7 years of tribulation (last 3.5 being the Great Tribulation), then 1000 years of Jesus reign, then x number of years of satan being released from his imprisonment to deceive the nations, before chapter 21 of the book of Revelation begins where the first Heaven and the first Earth pass away".  So we're at least 1007+ years away from the planet Earth as we know this world from ending.
