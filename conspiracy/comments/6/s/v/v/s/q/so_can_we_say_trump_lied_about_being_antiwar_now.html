    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true. However, he took a dramatically different stance from Hillary Clinton and the rest of the establishment. He is pro-military, but only if it is being used for legitimate reasons. To the Bushes, Clintons, and Obama, the military was a political and economic tool. Military strategy was focused on geopolitical outcomes, rather than the more traditional perspective that we should be focused on winning wars swiftly and only fighting in response to legitimate threats.  </p>

<p>The big question with North Korea is whether or not the threat is legitimate. I don&#39;t think there is a clear cut answer either way, in this situation. </p>

<p>That said it seems Hillary would have been way more pro-war and pro-invasion (when comparing their campaign rhetoric and taking into account her past actions), which is why people may have thought he was antiwar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s distraction. If they thought about it, congress initiates bills, runs them through committees and votes them in. The figurehead has little or no say in that process. By letting people focus on the figurehead, congress basically gets a free ride in enacting what the power elite/war machine wants. </p>

<p>Case in point: Notice that everyone hated all the executive orders, yet there is no strong visible voice to get rid of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dig a little deeper on the sabre-rattling. North Korea is obviously not a threat, we have interceptors that could take down any missile they fired.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the sabre-rattling for, then? It&#39;s all about China, which is threatening <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-and-india-face-off-in-the-himalayas-1501681328">war</a> with India right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missile defense is a tricky, tricky business. If anyone fired 10-20 nuclear missiles at once, there is no chance that we would intercept them all. Obviously the DPRK can do no such thing at this time. However, it was only a year or two ago that the conventional wisdom placed DPRK missile and nuclear weapons technology slightly above potato quality. Now they have functioning ICBM&#39;s and mininukes? This seems like a big step up. Did somebody help them or is the intel just false?</p>

<p>Russia is the only country that could really devastate the US with nukes, because they have subs to send them in at low trajectories, where they can&#39;t be shot down easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a lot more familiar with the technical development of missile defense systems than you realize. Yes, we have achieved many milestones, but there is quite a lot of grandstanding and overstating of capabilities, in part to justify large continued budgets. We have gotten surprisingly good at it, but it really wouldn&#39;t take that many missiles to overwhelm the system and let a few through.</p>

<p>But how anyone could have looked at his campaign and seen anti-war is beyond me. He occasionally spoke of non-intervention, but that was gone within a few weeks of him becoming president.</p>
