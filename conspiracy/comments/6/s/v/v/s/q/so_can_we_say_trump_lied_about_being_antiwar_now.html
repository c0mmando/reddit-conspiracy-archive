       It's true. However, he took a dramatically different stance from Hillary Clinton and the rest of the establishment. He is pro-military, but only if it is being used for legitimate reasons. To the Bushes, Clintons, and Obama, the military was a political and economic tool. Military strategy was focused on geopolitical outcomes, rather than the more traditional perspective that we should be focused on winning wars swiftly and only fighting in response to legitimate threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big question with North Korea is whether or not the threat is legitimate. I don't think there is a clear cut answer either way, in this situation.

       The Trump administration already authorized drone attacks and it dropped a bomb weeks ago. Any antiwar stance by his administration, if ever there was one, was done away with long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said it seems Hillary would have been way more pro-war and pro-invasion (when comparing their campaign rhetoric and taking into account her past actions), which is why people may have thought he was antiwar.

       Yeah, it's distraction. If they thought about it, congress initiates bills, runs them through committees and votes them in. The figurehead has little or no say in that process. By letting people focus on the figurehead, congress basically gets a free ride in enacting what the power elite/war machine wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point: Notice that everyone hated all the executive orders, yet there is no strong visible voice to get rid of them.

       Technically it has been our country's nuclear policy to simultaneously say we won't use nukes because they're horrible and then at the same time say that we will use the nukes if we fucking have to. Nothing being said currently is any different from the past history except its Trump and we are in a need for material to shit on him this week because the Russia narrative has been in low demand lately.

       Missile defense is a tricky, tricky business. If anyone fired 10-20 nuclear missiles at once, there is no chance that we would intercept them all. Obviously the DPRK can do no such thing at this time. However, it was only a year or two ago that the conventional wisdom placed DPRK missile and nuclear weapons technology slightly above potato quality. Now they have functioning ICBM's and mininukes? This seems like a big step up. Did somebody help them or is the intel just false?

       I'm a lot more familiar with the technical development of missile defense systems than you realize. Yes, we have achieved many milestones, but there is quite a lot of grandstanding and overstating of capabilities, in part to justify large continued budgets. We have gotten surprisingly good at it, but it really wouldn't take that many missiles to overwhelm the system and let a few through.
