       Do water filters work? I assume boiling water doesn't do anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately I do not a ton of extra money currently to buy some of the things people recommend.

       I fear i will not be able to successfully cut a majority of the fluoride from my diet but something is better than nothing right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i have read you can communicate to the astral plane once your pineal gland is detoxed. how does one go about starting that process?

       Get rid of all fluoride and aluminum products. Some Deodorants and baking soda contain aluminum. Get rid of all aluminum cookware. Get rid of plastic(BPA) items that come into contact with food or drink...containers plastic bottles, storage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Aluminum molecule is attracted to the fluoride molecule. The fluoride molecule has the ability to pass through the blood brain barrier and haul aluminum into the brain. Aluminum is a known neurotoxin that causes dementia and Alzheimer's. Fluoride then goes on to calcify the pineal gland.

       Cut off meat , alcohol , weed and junk food. It will probably save you some money. Do not use fluoride toothpaste or water with fluoride in it. 
Eat lot of vegetables, fruits. Its summer time in Europe so it is very easy to get free vegetables and fruits, because some of them are growing.  Do some exercise do detox body from shits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep us update with your progress. 
I wanted to try detox pineal but i am to lazy to eat right. 
GOOD LUCK!

       I dunno where you live or your financial situation, but as for water - it is affordable for you.  Just about any chain grocer will have a fill it yourself water option.  My local whole foods has it at .59 per gallon. Meijer has primo like another user mentioned.  You can find it for sure. Even if some brands have flouride in it, it'll be less than your tap, and any step in that direction is a good step. Store brand spring waters are usually around .80 here.

       Cut of everything what fuck up your mind. Let it rest from alcohol and yes weed. As i read some other tutorials, people often said that better cut of weed, as you do not see dreams when you smoke (probably not everyone). It affect your pineal gland too.

       Don't cut off weed people are retarded for thinking that, weed wraps around your pineal gland and makes it extremely active. There's a reason why the governments have been trying to keep it illegal.

       yes water filters work.  berkeys are great.  you can get flouride filters for them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       other than the water thing: avoid processed foods; limit meat consumption; experiment with intermittent fasting; eat organic or foods that come from sources you trust.

       Unfortunately filters do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       rid the fluoride from water. Only reverse osmosis gets rid of most of it. Finding a natural, untreated well nearby may be an option to consider.

       If you're looking into astral plane type stuff, I'd recommend meditating everyday to calm yourself into a more relaxed and mindful state. You can't be surfing the universe if your mind is all wrapped up in what you're gonna do later or whatever. Be
       <em>
        present
       </em>
       . Enjoy the little moments of peace throughout the day. With practice, your mind will be able to wander further and further as your body begins to behave in a healthier manner. It's a hard practice to keep up though because we are plagued with many distractions. There is nothing more worth your time than exploring your own mind.

       Only when tripping on shrooms. I was hangin' with my friend on the porch and suddenly I was simultaneously floating in space near a giant pyramid shaped light. It felt like my mind contained the infinite knowledge of the universe. Fuckin incredible honestly. Felt like I was a shaman for about 30 minutes.

       Meditation can also get you there, it just takes practice. A
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of practice. It's great though because every time you meditate is a little different and you go through stages along the way. You begin to
       <em>
        understand why
       </em>
       things and people are the way they are. The more you understand, the further into the truth you can go.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they all say; the truth is inside yourself.

       It started when my parents hid that I was Jewish, growing up in Montreal in the sixties. I was brought up Catholic, and by 12 made a firm resolve to be atheist. I caught the caboose of the hippie era so drugs and music led me to explore different spiritual avenues. At 16 I discovered the Tibetan Book of the Dead and its Tantric Buddhist philosophy. That's when the magic started. I call it synchronicity; it's when events are perfectly timed to communicate messages. A lot of people report experiencing these meaningful 'co-incidences'. With me it was psychedelic, involving lights dimming and brightening and the breeze. An idea such as 'If you love something set it free; if it comes back to you it's yours' would take a week to be explored in my consciousness, by someone wearing the slogan on a t-shirt in the bus, followed by another stranger telling me all about his loss, and the idea coming up in the media with random precision. It all fit in. These synchronicities are love notes from our own consciousness. By the age of 31, the voice, which so far had expressed itself through a mosaic of events, came to life and I became possessed. It's all about love. The voice is male and I am female, and we're madly in love, even after 25 years. I attribute it to the awakening of our kundalini, which Buddhism explains as a coming together of the ying/yang male/female energy, to enter a blissful state of non duality. Besides making me feel great all the time, the voice speaks in my mind and through my mouth... never to compromise my sanity in front of strangers, although I'm convinced he could make me strangle myself to death if it wished to. On the contrary, he super loving and hilariously funny. The codes use storm names and other names in the media, even dead celebrities, so there's a tragic element to it as well. Check out the blog, video and Twitter for the latest synchs if you're interested in this sort of communication. My feeling is that communion with the love within us will become trendy and more prevalent, or at least I hope so... if only the Deep State controlled media would allow this kind of emancipation.

       I've been listening to a lot of Bill Donahue and his in-depth analysis of biblical texts and related materials - it's incredibly eye-opening.  A great TLDR for anyone interested is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, the oldest, original religious texts are all about deep meditation and consciousness - and how to elevate and raise yourself into the "kingdom of God", which is WITHIN every being on this planet.

       The fluoride molecule is smaller than the water molecule. Anything that water can pass through, fluoride will come right through with it.

       This is a simple protocol that has activated my pineal gland. 
1. Iodine drops for 10 dollars from amazon. 2 drops a day. This Will help replenish iodine stores that have been depleted by flouride. 2.Drink reverse osmosis water (primo brand is a good one that is sold at Walmart). Label must say that it is flouride free. Spring water brands add flouride. Reading labels is very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.Meditate: I like sahaja meditation. It only takes ten minutes and directly activates the 3 red eye.

       Yes, the meditation is comparable to hallucinogenic levels. Without any use of any drug to enhance it. I think as the pineal gland becomes decalcified, the meditations grow more vivid and more intense. Also I feel amazing since supplementing with iodine. My family has noticed it and have added it as well. It is a critical nutrient that we simply do not get adequate amounts.

       Hmmm I do not know. I follow dr. Bronsteins protocol. Iodine is a critical nutrient for the glandular system. This includes breast tissue, prostate, thyroid and pineal. He goes into it in more detail. I am no expert. So I simply followed his expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I found simply searching decalcifying pineal gland:
       <a href="http://energyfanatics.com/2012/06/13/how-decalcify-pineal-gland/">
        http://energyfanatics.com/2012/06/13/how-decalcify-pineal-gland/

       Studies have shown that iodine supplement may help the body remove fluoride, a toxic waste that is known for causing pineal gland calcificatio

       The natural version of flouride is called flouride, not calcium flouride.

       That link was just for illustrative purposes that there seemed to be many sources of discussion. I do not think it was data at all.  I can not speak for decalcifying the pineal gland research. That would take me several weeks of research and I don't have the time. There seems to be many links that discuss it though.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for me I follow the dr bronstein protocol. It took me about 2 weeks of research before I decided to take a chance. Dr. Bronstein uses iodine both as a supplement (it is an essential nutrient) but also therapeutically. To help cure diesease caused by lack of iodine. 
So there are different dosing guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are only some of the links that I used in my research. It's important to do your own research. Health is a personal responsibility. You already seem to know that I just want to clarify. :)

       I was trying to save op the trouble since his post was about inexpensive ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       My purpose when starting this protocol was for health purposes. Decalyfing the pineal gland was secondary. The reality is that I used to think flouride healthy and actually bought fluoridated for my self. So based on learning what I learned it was clear to me I was not getting adequate RDA ( recomended daily dose ) of iodine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know longer follow  the American minimum RDA. Since Americans have such high thyroid disease and cancer rates. I believe the RDA to be too low in USA. I follow the Japanese RDA, they have very low cancer rates and thyroid disease rates. Japanese RDA is much higher than USA RDA for iodine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iodine is an essential element but it is not a magic bullet. I also use hilmalyan sea salt, I use selenium and magnesium. I use four drops of lugols iodine. I exercise and I eat as healthy as I know how to. I fell wonderful and I have vivid dreams every night. That is enough for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are American chances are you are lacking a critically essential nutrient: iodine. Not getting an essential nutrient produces disease. Getting too much produces disease too. But I already had disease so the benefit outweighed the risk. I am not worried about taking too much iodine since I can always reduce the dose. I shudder to think about the public injesting too much flouride or bromide that is mass fed to them. There is no way to adjust that dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day inform yourself of the benefits and the risks and make a choice. If the benefits outweighs the risks you will know, if the risks out weigh the benefits then you will know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you well on your health journey truly!

       I hope it helps. If not just drink some salt water and you risked only about 12 dollars. Since I started supplementing 5 family members and one friend have followed suit. They all report only benefits. I wish it was more studied and that information was more available. I guess it is a true conspiracy. There is a lot of money to be made by keeping a large segment of the population sick. Sad.

       From the wiki on iodine, "Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The lethal dose for an adult human is 30 mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4 grams for a human weighing 70 to 80 kg."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are 7 foods with iodine in them,
       <a href="https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/iodine-foods/">
        https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/iodine-foods/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it is safer just to eat iodine in foods. I tried taking magnesium before, but it was too much or too little. In the end, I decided I got enough in my food that I didn't require supplement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I see absolutely zero science saying anything about iodine doing the miracle things people are claiming. Again, it may stop fluoride from storing in cells, but I've seen nothing to say it cleans fluoride out of cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only a 2nd year chem student, and I only have first year biology, so its hard fpr me to outright shut you down. I just, need to see science back up arguments. I dont trust doctors who make millions off of snake oil sales.

       Iodine indeed is a miracle cure for people who do not take adequate amounts. Remember that iodine is listed as a critical nutrient for proper health at all life stages. By the national institute of health. 
(See below)
Inadequate intake of iodine can  cause many symptoms. Even causes cancers.  Are you familiar with the symptoms of thyroid disease or cardiac disease or auto immune disease? The list of diseases caused by a lack of iodine is long. The symptoms vary greatly and if due to a lack of iodine, then yes simply supplementing with iodine will be a miracle cure. I recommend you take more time to research this topic. You have barely scratched the surface. There is a wealth of information out there. I added a few links below for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly am not trying to convince anyone. I simply was sharing my experience and the medical recommendations that I chose to follow. Do you mind if I ask what is your interest in this topic. I am confused as to why your goal is to debunk and label this quackery?
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI: iodine is a critical nutrient. From the NIH fact sheet for health professionals: 
"Due to its important role in fetal and infant development and thyroid hormone production, iodine is a critical nutrient for proper health at all life stages." Link follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/#h5">
        https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iodine-HealthProfessional/#h5
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note I refer to fact sheet for health professionals. The information geared to patients lacks specifics. That site also mentions range for RDA. Upper limits for RDA. However only lists the actual minimum amount. The Japan health institute (see below) lists both minimum and upper limit.  Also please note WHO has higher recommendations for RDA than the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japanese RDA's are listed here:
       <a href="http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/english/research/pdf/dris2010_eng.pdf">
        http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/english/research/pdf/dris2010_eng.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       FYI : by my calculation my dose is still below the RDA of Japan and the WHO recommendations. Dosing for iodine is complex and diet as well as soil content need to be taken into account.in addition to other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure what quack doctor you are referring to? Mercola? Didn't you link to mercola before?  Dr bronstein? He only sells his books but the videos are available online for free. 
What is the quackery you were referring to? I am confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       An open mind will lead you to the truth but sometimes that means you have to put aside your preconceived notions and prejudices. .
      </p>

       Good luck on your health journey.

       I didnt say quack. You did. Mercola is a Dr I figured you would trust. He doesnt seem to be a bad guy altogether, but I really dont trust anything except an actual scientific study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen no studies which show that it is possible to decalcify the pineal gland. I have seen a study which indicates that iodine may limit the storage of fluoride. That same study uses the word fluorosis, which may have been referring to dentistry, and not soft tissue at all. It's not at all clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want things to be clear. I am training to be a scientist (in college), and so my interest is to find the truth regardless of what it is. However, it hasn't yet been presented to me.

       Thank you for explaining. I was very curious. 
When I was researching I found a lack of solid data. Empirical and historical data yes. But there is a lack of data on iodine supplementation. If you find any research please link to me. I would appreciate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Bronstein makes a good case for supplementing it. I decided to take the risk. I am glad I did. I wish there was somewhere this could be reported but I don't see big pharma having an interest in going to expense of research and development of a cure they cannot patent easily. Especially since disease management is so profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did it for health purposes. Is my pineal gland still calcified? Who knows? I have vivid dreams now, and love meditating. From dr bronsteins protocol it takes 6 months at 4 drops per day to reach glandular saturation. So I bet I have a ways to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly I too got sick off of magnesium. Specifically the chelates magnesium. The non chelated one seems to work, but maybe I am not absorbing it. Lol.

       Just on the fact that iodine is an essential nutrient, makes me lean towards the idea of supplementation, but if I did decide to supplement, I would start by simply eating kelp.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do appreciate that you are mentioning the potential negatives of taking. This is sort of long, but I wanted to quote this website on the matter,
       <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/vitamins-supplements/never-take-thyroid-supplements/">
        https://www.consumerreports.org/vitamins-supplements/never-take-thyroid-supplements/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "We need only 150 mcg of iodine per day in our diet, according to the Institute of Medicine. “That tiny amount of iodine enables the thyroid to manufacture just the right amount of the thyroid hormone thyroxine,” Lipman says.
      </p>
      <p>
       But ingesting excess iodine can cause health problems. It is particularly worrisome for people with thyroid nodules—bumps on the thyroid glands that can be very small and often go unnoticed. “If you have a nodular thyroid—and chances are that 50 percent of us will develop one or more nodules by the time we’re 60—even a slight excess of iodine can cause your thyroid to go into overdrive and produce excess thyroxine,” Lipman says. “An overactive thyroid can cause sudden weight loss, a rapid or irregular heartbeat, sweating, and nervousness or irritability.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, studies also show that too much iodine (more than around 400 mcg per day) can cause the thyroid to slow down or even stop producing hormones in certain people—the opposite effect of what many people hope these supplements will do for them. That can result in weight gain and fatigue, and can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease,” Lipman says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet many supplements contain more than 150 mcg of iodine. For example, both Enzymatic Therapy’s Metabolic Advantage and Whole Foods’ Thyroid Complete contain 200 mcg per two-capsule serving. Follow the recommendation on the labels and swallow two capsules three times a day and you’ve ingested 600 mcg of iodine—enough to cause health problems in certain people if taken long term."
      </p>
      <p>
       It shouldn't be hard to do an actual scientific study on this. When I become a scientist I will do tests on stuff like this, and many other things that I am interested in. I want to filter my own water, 3D print my own house, car, chairs, spoons and tools, clothing, and more!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have lots of ideas. I constantly have to remind myself to write them down!

       Lol. You cast a wide net. Narrow down your search would be my suggestion. At the time I focused on nascent vs potassium iodide. There are many ways that iodine is packaged. I decided to go with the least risk to test it out. 
What these sites fail to mention is that we are bombarded with halogens in the form of bromide and flouride. Bromides are added to bread and flouride to water. This literally crowds out the little flouride you injest through salt. Especially people who opt for sea salt or kosher salt (like me) 
The recommendations also do not take into account the upper limit range recomended by the NIH,or the WHO. Illness, diet, also impact the ideal level. Remember it is a recomended range not a bare minimum. 
My two cents: there is a conspiracy to make us sick. This was common knowledge for health professionals 100 years ago. It was considered safe and effective. Today thyroid disease is epidemic. Breast and prostate cancer rates are like never before. Yet iodine supplementation a critical nutrient is kept at minimal levels instead of advising patients to achieve optimal levels. It's just my opinion. Not one doctor ever asked me if I was using iodized salt. Yet a lack of iodine seems to have caused many of my symptoms. 
Your idea on kelp for example: the Japanese injest very high levels of iodine through their diet like kelp. Now when we look at the Mediterranean diet it was simple to draw the conclusion that olive oil should be taken. Is it possible that more kelp should be recommended? Just like using olive oil is recomended without further studies all we have left is guesses, history, and empirical data. 
I am very excited for you, you have a calling! Science is an amazing field of study.

       Selenium is super tricky. There are three forms. One is easily absorbed and good, one is good but poorly absorbed, and one is toxic. I forget which is which, but if someone really wants to know, i will look it up. It is impossible to know how much selenium you are getting from food because it varies wildly based on how much is in the soil the plants grew in/that the animals ate. You can get too much of the good form and poison yourself. So supplement lightly and make sure to sweat every day so you sweat out any excess.

       Brazil nuts from brazil tend to be high in selenium because the soil there is high in selenium. Brazil nuts grown other places, not as much. Selenium is absorbed by plants if it is in the soil, but since its a non-essential nutrient for most plants, its not added to fertilizers. Animals are the ones who need it, and animal meat in theory should have plenty of it, but that is only true if the animal's food has plenty of it.

       That is a great question. I used to assume all spring water was not supplemented with flouride. However, I am a conspiracy theorist and recently decided to verify that. It turned out several brand name spring waters had flouride added to the label. There seems to be some shady labeling issues. Primo brand is reverse osmosis and they claim on their label there is no flouride.

       Are 4 drops too many? Been doing 4 drops twice a day in a glass of water. Also been taking selenium after reading somewhere that it helps to take it with iodine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effects I notice seem rather small and may be in my head, but the lugols is relatively cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a brokey like me and can't spring for an RO filter, a much cheaper zerowater filter will remove 99.99 percent of chemicals. Not perfect, but tastes way better than our 99ppm tap water.

       Also be aware that bread is brominated me bromides also deplete our iodine stores. Bromides are halogens just like flouride a. I Lerner to make my own bread....yummmm! Just to void the bromides.

       How many nmg per drop? You can safely take upwards of 2 mg per day. If your drops are about 100ish nmg each, i'd start with 2 drops and eaxh month add another 2 until you feel like you're getting too much, then cut back to the max you are comfortable with.

       I started at 225 ncm and I immediately felt much better. As i upped it, i continued to feel great until i got to 2,025. Then i developed insomnia and just didn't feel as good anymore. I backed down to 1800 and went back to feeling good and sleeping well. I've since had to slowly but steadily cut back. Once the insomnia starts, i back down 2 drops and the insomnia goes away.

       I am taking iodine for high cholesterol, which is a symptom of my kidney disease. As my kidneys are improving, so is my cholesterol and this I don't need as much iodine.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side tangent, i find it very interesting that the AMA doesn't disclose that iodine is an effective treatment for high cholesterol and instead recommends people take statins, which have terrible side effects.

       Oh ha, my bad. Makes perfect sense. The origins of modern American medicine trace back through the Rockefeller dynasty and their selling everything petroleum based. Homeopathy and natural cures and things that generally improve health weren't that important to the bottom line.

       I found when you buy at the store the label either says nothing or admits to adding flouride. There are no legal rules about labeling water it seems. So I chose to go with primo since they claimed in writing that there was no flouride. I never knew that bottled water had flouride. In fact years ago I used to buy fluoridated bottled water thinking it was healthy! Very sneaky of water industry to it be Clara's in their labels.

       Appreciate the tips on iodine. As someone who suffers from (at times severe) bouts of night terrors and night sweats, it seems both can be attributed to the pineal and thyroid glands, both of which seem to potentially benefit from iodine dosing. Excited to give it a shot.

       These guidelines were the easiest to understand and they summarize dr bronstein protocol. If you feel bad you should take salt water . It does help. I only had to do it once after two weeks. Since then never again. I had Lyme disease and my thyroid was affected. The iodine has definitely helped me dramatically. Good luck!

       Drink distilled water. Don't use FDA approved toothpaste or mouthwash (fluoridated), but instead organic versions, or alternatives like sea salt w/ H202. Minimize your scat intake: sugar, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and poopie. Eat a lot of lemons and garlic, they're detox food I hear helps the penial. Research flat Earth and smoke herb

       First, your pineal gland is an actual eyeball inside your head. If you can dream, then it works. It provides the visual effects you see while dreaming. It's an eyeball with cones and rods, hooked up to the opticial lobe.
Second, eat turmeric.
Third, if you own a house, pay 1.5k to get a reverse osmosis filter.

       I have been wanting to get a full house reverse osmosis filter. I don't mind spending a few thousand for it either. Can you recommend a good brand? I'm in America.

      <p>
       Also, what you wrote makes sense. I'm on Paxil (and trying to wean myself off and stop taking it). Paxil is bad for the pineal gland. Anyway, on nights that I skip taking it, I have really vivid dreams!

       I just googled "reverse osmosis [my city]" and found a company that does it for $1.6k.  Don't know of the brand.  But, they offer all types of filters that are not reverse osmosis, but they specifically offer and recommend the full reverse osmosis system and service.

       Obviously stay away from all the bad stuff: Sugar, alcohol, artificial things, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number one thing that improved pineal gland decalcification for me was Skate Liver Oil. This stuff is no joke. Within a couple days of taking it I could literally feel my Pineal Gland when I was laying down in bed at night. A week in it felt like it was throbbing in my head. One of the few supplements that I've taken that had quick and evident results. Skate liver oil is very good for you, as it contains EFA's (essential fatty acids/omegas). I'll post the link below. I'm not whoring for this company, they are the only company that I can find that makes it.

       Similar in the way that it's a fish oil/oil with omegas. However, it's from a completely different fish. A skate is a fish that is completely made of cartilage and cannot grow bone. The skate liver oil is fermented before sold as well, adding benefits.

       Also, (kind of on the same subject), my son has mild autism. He is 18. Years ago I started giving him the Omega 3 Fish Oils and Cod Liver Oil (in gel cap form). Everyone could see a difference in his behavior too. He was more "aware" and made eye contact more. He still takes both of these every day. So maybe after I try the skate oil, I will let him try it too.  :-)  I always take things first before I give it to him, just in case there are side effects, etc.

       There are many cases where children with Autism benefit greatly from supplementation. My cousin is autistic and his parents said you can see a big difference when they changed his diet. Cutting down severely on sugar and anything artificial worked wonders. There is also a very good liquid multivitamin as well called Beyond Tangy Tangerine(You can buy it on Amazon too). It has no sugar and 90 essential nutrients. Since it's liquid, it's much better absorbed than a multivitamin pill. You also want to make sure that you are taking probiotics and digestive enzymes as well. If you gut is not in order than it doesn't matter what you take, it won't be absorbed. All health starts in the gut. That's the very first thing to get in order. Make sure gut health is on point then move forward from there. Hope your son continues to improve!

       Pinch of Harataki powder before bed every night. It's a mild laxative so keep that in mind with dosing. Helps boost the detox system and activate the pineal gland.

      <p>
       Baking soda in your water. I do this ever morning on an empty stomach. It alkalinizes the water, and well you. Great for detoxing.

       Spirulina also good for detoxing and activating the pineal gland. I sometimes combine it with baking soda to heighten the effect of both.

       You appear to be interested in removing fluoride from your diet. I'll help you with that, but I also want to point out that fluoride is not the only toxin we are exposed to. There are so many better reasons to filter your water.

       Have a read through

       . Water is not the only route of exposure to toxins. Some areas have to deal with people faking the water quality test reports and many manufacturing plants openly and illegally dump waste into rivers without punishment and some of those chemicals can not be sufficiently filtered out of tap water. There is a lot of information in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to do is not to worry too much. Do whatever you can reasonably do to lower your exposures and then enjoy your life. Worrying will make things worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's one example. Filtered water. There are a couple ways to filter out most toxins. You can buy a 200-300 dollar countertop water distiller. You can buy a reverse osmosis system for your tap. You could buy a "Zero Water" filter, or a combination of these. I used to have a countertop distiller and I ran the distilled water through a Zero Water filter afterwards. It worked just fine and it was actually a lot cheaper than buying jugs of water in the long run. Distillers cannot remove everything, and the filters last quite a while if you are removing small amounts of whatever is left in the distilled water. Brita and similar brands are terrible by the way.

       I hope that helps.

       eat lots of curry with lots and lots of spices , they help get rid of mucus in the body and clean the blood , this pulls toxins out of the brain via blood , the hotter the curry the better , stay away from processed foods , sugar is a pineal assassin so avoid , drink lots of RO water to get rid of sugar in the system , switch to a yogic diet , meditate and vibrate with that hum in c . this is most important you need the vibration in the skull to dislodge  the build up of toxic metals that you are going to pull out of the gland with cilantro

       Does iodine
       <em>
        really

       decalcify the pineal gland?

       I've read that calcium deposition in the pineal gland is linked to aging. I didn't think this was reversible.

       I hope it helps. If not just drink some salt water and you risked only about 12 dollars. Since I started supplementing 5 family members and one friend have followed suit. They all report only benefits. I wish it was more studied and that information was more available. I guess it is a true conspiracy. There is a lot of money to be made by keeping a large segment of the population sick. Sad.

       I didnt say quack. You did. Mercola is a Dr I figured you would trust. He doesnt seem to be a bad guy altogether, but I really dont trust anything except an actual scientific study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen no studies which show that it is possible to decalcify the pineal gland. I have seen a study which indicates that iodine may limit the storage of fluoride. That same study uses the word fluorosis, which may have been referring to dentistry, and not soft tissue at all. It's not at all clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want things to be clear. I am training to be a scientist (in college), and so my interest is to find the truth regardless of what it is. However, it hasn't yet been presented to me.
