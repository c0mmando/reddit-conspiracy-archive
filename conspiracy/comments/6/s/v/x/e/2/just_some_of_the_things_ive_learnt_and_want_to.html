       Greetings from The Netherlands. Before I start, please know that I truly wish you all the best and hope that in the near future you'll get your country &amp; government to work as they should, to the benefit of all people, and not only certain groups. This isn't some empty criticism or the blame-game or something of that nature. I became intrigued with geopolitics and covert power-structures and other hidden things after 9/11, and have been closely following and researching major global and US events ever since 2003-2004. The following falls under that narrative and I am writing it because I wish to be a voice of (some) reason in a sea of BS, although I don't claim that everything I say is is the perfect &amp; absolute truth, but I do want to say that most of it, the gist of it, can be easily verified if you try, while some can prove a lot harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to me, it seems that the gloves are coming off and the covert police-state is becoming more and more visible to a broader segment of the population. The people running the show (who pay your politicians, who own and fund your media, who have vested interests in the military-i-complex and elsewhere) are seemingly pushing for major domestic and international escalations. In the case of the US, it can mean different things, one of which being civil war in the US. The conditions seem ripe with the general population ready to burst with their dissatisfaction at how the country has been pushed to social, economical/infrastructure and military exhaustion (next stop: moral exhaustion which will result in "okay, give us a police state if it means this shit will stop"). The police shootings &amp; great divides being created between black/white/muslim/cop/rich would certainly serve an agenda that seeks to bring (their) control through chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the outside world, in regard to US foreign policy, most significantly the term "nuclear" seems to be the key word when it comes to the North-Korea showdown between the US and China, which is equally, if not more suicidal than pushing for civil war to justify a more "security"-oriented state (fascism). 
Pres. Obama was very hesitant about a serious escalation with Russia or Iran, although he had his problems with them. But Trump seems to resist threatening to deploy nukes much less as made clear by his recent threat to NK. Before Trump got elected, he repeatedly asked a pentagon official "why" it's a bad idea to use tactical (smaller) nukes in Syria &amp; Iran and elsewhere, as if he was obsessed. This is a big part of the reason why i'm writing this because Trump seems hellbent on nuclear war and it's extremely doubtful that other nuclear powers won't respond in kind if their ally is reduced to glass &amp; ash. Afterall, Russia knows it is next after Syria &amp; Iran and China knows that it is next after North-Korea. They will respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be perfectly clear, if nukes are launched by any nation, there is a great possibility that it will result in a cascade effect of retaliatory strikes which could very quickly escalate to the 6th great extinction event that Earth has suffered over the aeons. Tens of thousands of warheads going off all over the globe. It is no joke whenever a leader of a nuclear power states he's considering the nuclear option.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that you people across the Atlantic are bombarded with incredible amounts of irrelevant bullshit (a bit more than most of the world), everywhere in the media, and therefore sometimes tend to forget the importance of actually relevant events that happened. When everything is hyped up so much in the media (from beyonce bs to sports bs to more celeb bs to a great scare &amp; disasters and other bs to neutralize critical thought), the truly significant events that actually deserved the attention at the time, will be drastically lowered by importance and actual amount of critical thought and consideration given by the individual. This also means that if a society experiences a lot of things being hyped daily, that they're much more easily made to forget things that are actually in their best interest to remember and pursue. There are also other things like cognitive dissonance going on, which unfortunately affects almost everyone to some level, and that reverts some people to a more primitive state of mind which makes a person or group more reactive, following predictable &amp; controllable patterns of logic or emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophy &amp; sociology aside, let's talk about a few red-flags that are more concrete which I think we should all be reminded of (there is much more but in the interest of saving time i'll keep it relatively short).
Snowden has already shown the existence of a gigantic digital &amp; physical infrastructure that gathers very detailed information on more than a billion people in the world, including the general US population. It was, and is an illegal (unconstitutional) program as the US constitution overrules by default, any lower laws/programs that it conflicts with. They LIED about the existence of those programs
       <em>
        in congress, under oath!
       </em>
       . And then when we found out that it was very real, when the first leaks were released, nobody as much as went to jail for lying under oath, let alone conspiracy.
Gen. Petraeus also gave away national secrets for personal gains and got away with it (brushed off as a "scandal"). Snowden shows the existence of an extrajudicial (illegal) entity within the intelligence agencies, and he gets burnt at the cross as a "traitor"... Something very fishy going on, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Banksters knowingly rigged and poisoned the markets &amp; watched with great joy when the global economy was almost brought down, and some of 'em got insanely wealthy off of it ($ billions "free money"), yet noone of significance gets punished and no meaningful legislation is passed to further limit possible future damages. But if you ask them, it's the welfare recipient that's really the problem to society. While they give themselves multimillion dollar bonuses high up in their ivory towers, looking down at us as if we were ants. More than $ 700Bil was given to the banksters IN ONE DAY (the total over the years is in the trillions) to bail them out, and exactly $0 was spent on bailing out any of the people who lost their homes and their lives because they were sold bad credit by those crooks in their ivory towers. Look up how Iceland of all places handled the "economic crisis" in case you want to see what a government
       <em>
        for the people, by the people
       </em>
       is supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       US Congress has already shown itself to side with money &amp; power (they are bought- it's an open secret), even if it means the people get to suffer. You can find clues to this virtually anywhere where a congressman or the US congress itself is involved.
One of the biggest red flags to you people should have been when they sided (under Bush Jr 2nd term I believe) with the already too powerful corporations over the already too weak &amp; misrepresented US citizenry when CITIZENS-UNITED was so disgustingly made and passed into law, and billion dollar corporate entities &amp; $Trill multi-nationals became legal persons having all of the rights of the individual... effectively putting the "regular Joe" and, say, McDonald's or Lockheed-Martin in the same arena. One quick side note: TPP and the many variations of it will raise corporations above even state entities in special courts. This would make it possible for a company to sue (and bankrupt) an entire nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the Executive branch, Presidents have for long promised and said one thing, and done another, because before they are president they don't know that being president doesn't mean you truly rule/lead and get to do what you want (in the 2nd term MAYBE some things). It means you are a very high level power-broker between the families &amp; corporations and all sorts of different structures within the government itself and other groups of great influence(national). Presidents have always serviced both the needs of the elite (the super-wealthy), national interests and that of the general population, but over the last 30 to 40 years that all seems to have drastically changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world has felt the evil of corporate greed and influence via US(and other) foreign policy and warfare for decades now. And lives don't matter to them. 
To me it seems that the military/intelligence apparatus is in the process of also aiming inwards, at the US population itself which is a very bad sign if we look at history and what usually follows (well-timed event or events that lead(s) to massive scale social unrest). I've observed this change, and preparations happening in the last 10 or so years in different layers of the system.
intel drones over US are becoming a thing. The purchase of billions of rounds of ammo by internal services happened a few years ago (now we can see why), legislature like the PATRIOT-ACT and NDAA authorise &amp; make it "legal" to activate an emergency-response that will result in an absolute martial law in the event of ANY "crisis", anywhere in the world; with the POTUS, director of FEMA or DHS in charge of the government. &lt;-- The flashpoint of all of this dramatic change towards a security-state is 9/11 by the way. Without that event, none of this could have ever been shoved down the throats of the people of the United States (and the rest of the world).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police-shootings are becoming either more common, or the media is over-exposing them (compared to the past) in order to greaten the divide, to breed tensions and disdain among the population and all the different classes, so that the anger and dissatisfaction that people have is aimed between themselves if shit ever gets to hits the fan. Internationally, I'm afraid is just more bad news; most notably is the worsening of tensions between the US, Russia &amp; China, and the increase in tensions in the M.E. 
I don't care what a person believes in politically and in what type of labels he views the world, a nuclear showdown is the equivalent of putting a gun to your temple and pulling the trigger. Only, billions of people will die, and civilization as we know it will end and the survivors (if there are any) will have the great prospect of a new middle-ages to live through (this time with radiation and mutants and perhaps a new ice age).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe we're all gonna die in a nuclear hellhole? I'd like to think not, but let's just say Trump running things at the white-house doesn't inspire any confidence.﻿

       Very well put you pay more attention than most i see on a daily basis in north america i live in Canada but people here love their phones more than their souls its actually very sad. I want to tell everyone that we should spend more time outside and away from t.v. "programs" and electronic devices but the people i have opened up to dont want to hear it. At least this past year ive figured out im not alone and i have a lot of fellow brothers and sisters that are here with me to help. Its nice to know and i appreciate you so much fellow human!! There are the wolves the sheep and the sheep dogs and i think more and more of the sheep dogs are waking up and trying to figure out how to help the sheep find a safer calmer path. The wolves are doing whatever it takes to lead the sheep down their dark anti-universe path. Time for the sheep dogs to shine.

       I don't think Trump is running anything. The bribery checks which the majority of American politicians accept is chump change in comparison to the real bloodlines who are ruling behind the curtain-- so to speak. I do agree with most of your analysis however I am left wondering as an American citizen, what do I do? I mean I have my ideas but I am not under the same spell that most people are in. Basically Trump, Bush and Obama are the same people to me.

       I don't think Trump is insane, but he is a braggart.  If he thinks he has an advantage, he will press it to gain something -- in this case, a more compliant North Korea.  I believe that some people voted for Trump because they felt he was less of a war monger than Hillary.  I feel that Hillary is part of the deep state and it is the deep state that has been and continues to push for war.  North Korea is a rogue state and many people think they need to be reigned in.  Not being forceful emboldens weaker states.  No one knows how things will pan out, but I would not make a direct correlation between Trump rhetoric and what he might actually do.

       Not a braggart, just a business man who feels his Corpation ,The US of A, is being threatened and is responding appropriately. None of the other past 4 presidents have done this and actually stood their ground on behalf of the people who freely elected him Insert the fact that "Mad Dog" Mattis is at the boson helm of the armed forces, they know Shit will go down, as it were, to show that we aren't going to be intimidated. Mark my words that if that miniscule maniac is having seconds thoughts right now, just like the school yard bully just figured out he isn't the top of the pecking order.

        To be perfectly clear, if nukes are launched by any nation, there is a great possibility that it will result in a cascade effect of retaliatory strikes which could very quickly escalate to the 6th great extinction event that Earth has suffered over the aeons.

       What is your evidence that this is possible? Have you considered

        the possibility

       that nukes are a propaganda device?

       I've considered that. Do you have a tl'dr or any other links about a possible nuke hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be some very genuine footage of huge nuclear explosions(including one that is like microseconds of the initial blast) from back in the day, but one can never be certain.

       USA becoming a police state? OK, how about in Germany - Merkel is already having people arrested and/or their homes raided for "thought crimes" i.e. anti-migrant posts on facebook.

       Trump in the White House is like someone trying a flight simulator for the first time with no instructions - except its a real plane and the whole world is riding in it.
