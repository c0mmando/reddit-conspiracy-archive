        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So my parents neighbor in the rural little Texas town they live in is a retired high ranking officer in the navy and these days he runs the water company for the area. He&#39;s a super nice dude and when I&#39;m down visiting the family he&#39;ll invite us over there for any sort of get together he has from time to time. Now on one particular occasion after a night of drinking and after most of the party had tapped out leaving a few of us heavy weights drinking around a fire we got to talking about all sorts of stuff and one of the topics was I brought up, &quot;so what&#39;s with the fluorite in the water?&quot; First thing he said was don&#39;t drink it! That stuff is basically nothing more than a tax break so to speak for them. You see it&#39;s an acid that fucks you up but the government has found it also suppresses something in us to make us a bit more agreeable and after a few generations of this being in the water supply it&#39;s had a negative effect on a vast array of different parts of our brain which he says is speculation to why we&#39;re seeing so many dumb ass&#39;s in this country (his words not mine) not sure to make of all this but I&#39;m sure someone here would know </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is of course what everyone already knows. Fluoride is in the water and your toothpaste. You take a shower and spray fluoridated water on the largest organ of your body - your skin. It&#39;s literally in everything: beer, juice, bottled water, canned goods with water, yes and even cereal. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t brush with fluoride unless you want a lifelong struggle with teeth problems and brain problems. Use fluoride free toothpaste like Tom&#39;s and rinse with hydrogen peroxide. </p>

<p>Check your shampoo and body wash. Get up right now and go read the back and tell me if you can tell me what your putting on your skin that your absorbing. You can&#39;t. Get bar soap made from Mom and Pop types off eBay that use simple list of ingredients.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reverse osmosis filters are definitely the best way to remove flouride. A few notes on why drinking distilled water is bad for you. It has to do with osmotic pressure and the outer membrane of your cells. Generally speaking, water can pass thru the cell membrane freely, whereas other minerals and things cannot (pass freely at least). Distilled water has almost nothing in it except H2O. When you drink distilled water, it will attempt to dilute the good salts, minerals, and ions inside your cell. Osmosis occurs when 2 solutions separated by a semi-permeable membrane (like a cell membrane) have differing concentrations of salts and minerals. Water will flow from the less concentrated solution to the more concentrated solution in an attempt to establish an equilibrium (equal concentration of salts) on either side of the membrane. Therefore, when you drink distilled water, it will flood your cells attempting to lower the salt, mineral, ion concentration, eventually causing your cells to burst like an inflated water balloon. This is why IV solutions have a certain concentration of NaCl (usually 0.9%). Hope that made sense. Osmosis is why drinking distilled water is bad, but reverse osmosis is a filtration technique for removing flouride.</p>

<p>100% correct.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Have to say 75% correct. Again, the minerals and ions generally don&#39;t move across cell membranes freely, but water can. Influx of water bursts the cells releasing minerals, ions, and cell junk, causing said deficiencies and health issues.</p>

<p>If we were talking about storing distilled water in a metal container, it would leach metals into the water bc of said solvent properties. Some metals are resistant to this tho. Semantics. You are correct.</p>
