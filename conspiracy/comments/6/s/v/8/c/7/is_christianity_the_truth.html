       I imagine the music in heaven is going to  be really loud
 .I half suspect its going to be  pentatonic heavy metal just so it will hamonize better with the cacophony of screams coming from hell.

       But....yeah. Not exactly a massive stable. But I also think the corporate media manipulation machine isn't exactly trying to foist Christian (or even "Christian") artists on us. Their goal is to dehumanize us, not elevate us.

       All music comes from heaven, the lyrics either come from God or mans own heart or Satan. And Satan according to the ancient record was the head of the heavenly orchestra that praised God and that satan himself in himself has pipes that plays beautiful music. Thus why the music industry is heavily into satanic practices.

       I concur with religion being a sham, but having a relationship with God is something superb and filled with love, one can only come to be a better person after knowing God and to live for Him, to let God's will be done.

       If God is real just like you and I then He's a being on His own accord in our reality whether we like or not and therefore we should be able to talk about Him on any format, just as we talk about Donald Trump on this platform.

       "It" does not mean "imaginary".
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes.  You're actually right.  Among other things, God is indeed imaginary.  God is that at the very least given that the imagination is an offshoot and a facet of Cosmic Divinity.

       I always ask though, with the fear being god might be Satan or it's a lie, would an all loving god require subservience? Or create us and test us for our subservience? Or only leave one door open for a happy life? I don't want to feel as if those who don't have access to his words or his teachings are doomed all around the world in less fortunate places. Or or even those without education. Kind of a "me or worse" life doesn't scream all benevolent etc &gt;&lt;. Also don't want to think I got lucky enough to hear about him and others didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a last random thought, if ignorance of him excuses not living in him--does knowing about him present a test? Would ignorance be bliss? And better?

       And atheism is not a cop out on someone being frustrared with it all so they say "FUCK it none of its real" is any better? Since the rise of Atheism,  nothing good has come from any government that has excepted its philosophy. Relgious nations have a bad rap, since they have spots in their history of extremism. But my gosh people living naked in the woods and forest to this day live happily even though  they font have what we have and they believe in something of a high power. Try and take athiests who have no moral high ground except what they picked and chose from Chrsitianity and tell them to thrive on a desert island. You will have chaos like you saw in every communist nation.

       Religion is a scam and those people in the Vatican &amp; the pope are very religious and they scam the people for money and their preist are fondling our children, they are definitely a religious establishment that doesn't represent Jesus Christ in any manner and they're subject to their own agendas, rather than serving Jesus Christ.

       What makes a relationship with Jesus Christ unique is that He offers you eternal life if you simply believe in Him and repent of your sins, we are at the full mercy of God for forgiveness, we cannot attain forgiveness through good deeds, we must humbly ask for our forgiveness in honesty &amp; in truth, through God we are made better.

       I disagree, i don't think there's any truth to that. When you see how derivative Christianity is you can't help but understand it to be a creation of man meant for, at best, comfort. At worst control. Christianity isn't the only religion offering eternal life in exchange for faith, so that's not too unique.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have anything to apologize for and certainly no god to serve. The promise of eternal life is, to me, blackmail for subservience.

       Christianity for more that 2000 years have serve kings, popes , pastors, high rank politician's  etc. to make them rich and powerful. This religion is done more evil than good for mankind, for countless wars, assassinations, slave movements, land taxation's and forcing people to join this religion. And all this was done in Jesus name.

       The Bible contains literal, symbolic, and prophetic messages that all need to be interpreted, so there is no one size fits all approach to the bible, each message has it's own interpretation, just as the lamb caught in the thorns after Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Issac, Jesus is the lamb caught in the thorns and the thorns He was caught in is symbolic for the crown of thorns He had on His head when He was crucified.

       That which is commanded to us like feed the poor and help the weak and take care of the fatherless and widows, dont steal dont murder and dont lie etc. All these are commandments that are made for us to treat each other as God woyld want us to.. the Old testament doctrines of not eating pork or not wearing multiole tyoes of cloth are no more. Why? Beacuse the new testament says so. But the laws on how to honor God and how to treat each other is always literal like a boss tells his associates what to do or a father instructs his kids to do a task. Prophesy and imagery is the only thing that can be interpreted.  Not a direct order.

       The reason that verse is important is because, there something called cymatics and it's the science of sound and it is known that all matter is held together by vibrations and sound is made of vibrations and these sounds and vibrations creates shapes at different frequencies.

       If I recall, God is God and He can cast judgement on His creation, He has all power over us and He has the right to judge us.  God said the wages of sin is death, then it is so, He flooded the earth to eradicate the corruption, we should be thanking God for what He has done for us.

       That's why I advocate for parents killing their children if they step out of line. They created them so of course they should get to murder them whenever they want.

       This what I have to say about your response.  Our parents didn't create us, our parents are the vessels in which we came through, God is the one who created all humans and everything in this universe, God created all life and therefore He alone has sole power over all life.

       We're living proof of God's creation.  something didn't create nothing, otherwise there would be nothing for an infinite amount of time, the truth is that God always existed and He created all life and everything in the universe, otherwise there would be absolutely nothing for an infinite amount of time, because nothing begets nothing, but something will always begat another.  As far as I know, there has never been a case where a car was built by nothing.

       Saying "we're living proof of God's creation" isn't an answer. There are no tests available we can perform on ourselves to prove a God. You have zero proof that we came from God, all you have is an assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to conventional science, since there is mass + gravity + electricity, life is bound to evolve from a single cell organism. The only thing conventional science doesn't know is what happened before the big bang... string theory and quantum mechanics has lots of theories though, theories that have actual math behind them unlike your assumption.

       Christ said he is the Truth, the Righteous Way and the LIFE. All lige has come from him. Who ever is alive is alive becuase of his mercy. Who ever causes evil in the world disobeys his Righteous Way.  Thus if the land gets full og unrighteous people, he made it clear, plagues,  pestilence, famines and death will come to you. NOT BECAUSE he wanted too but because WE ALLOWED it.

       If it's "his creation", then he created all of it.  It's his sin.  His corruption.  His death.  His genocide.  Thanking God for wiping out humanity, for the "corruption" he himself created, is psychotic and hopelessly delusional.  You're a good little tool, fit to be ruled by the Devil himself.  If you read your Bible, you'll find that the only real devil, throughout the ages, is Yahweh.

       If you have kids and you teacg your kids right from wrong but later as they grow up they do bad shit is it still parents fault? No it fuckin aint. Free will is given to us and his teachings on how to treat others is clear.
Feed the hungry, take care of the sick and needy. Look after the fatherless and widows, defend the weak, love your enemies and honor all men, but respect nature as God intended and dont sleep around. Fucking pretty good stuff.
Real question is, now look at Islam.

       My "parenting" analogies are much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like this one time, when I put a rasberry bush in their room (just because).  I said, "don't eat this, or you may die.". Well, shockingly, they ate one.  So naturally, I kicked them out of the house,  inflicted terrible diseases on them, cursed them and my future grandkids, called the cops and said they stole my stuff, told the neighborhood kids to go smack em around and steal their shoes.  A few years later, I killed all of them except one.  I didn't let the surviving 8 year old back in the house, but I was generous enough to tell her to google up a phone number for a homeless shelter.  I know.  I'm very caring and benevolent and wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few weeks later, I found out that she was in a homeless shelter downtown, so I went over and burned it to the ground.  To teach lessons, n stuff.  So, she got passed around on the street for a few years, then I mysteriously showed up one day, while she was laying in the gutter.  I bent down and whispered in her ear:. "I did it because I love you."
      </p>
      <p>
       "And those were
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       rasberries dammit."
      </p>
      <p>
       My analogy is disturbingly more accurate than yours.  And my kids even got to keep their "free will" the entire time!  Isn't that special?!

       See you still dont get it. You have the mind of greed rather than a well balanced one, and you take the side of the pubishable greedy culprit instead of the fair gift giver.
If you had the whole world at your pleasure just like Adam amd Eve did, which was exactly the promise God gave them. Not just some tiny room with a plate of food like you poorly described. But a whole fucking planet to eat and live on . And you are told NOT TO EAT THIS ONE FRUIT. To this day you and me have many fruit that we cant eat due to just poisons or allergic reactions. But having the mature mind of past trails and errors we dont endulge in such stupidity. 
Adam and Eve had no experience what so ever on being disobediant. So thats their sin. You sinned before and so have we all. And its majority of the time doing things we were not supposed to do and did it anyways. Punishments came and went and we moved on. 
God had every right to honor his own word and kick them out for disobeying pretty much the simplest law to ever exist. But to them it was the only one.
So stop blamong God for doing exactly what he promised to do and stop defending curiosity that is based on ignorance. For as the saying goes. "Curiosity killed the cat" well thats the same as temptation. And how many people got sexual transmitted diseases through temptation? How many people got arrested by stealing? These are no different than Adam and Eve because like them we all are aware of the punishment but dont believe anything will happen because we followed out foolish hearts instead of using logic and reason.

       You sure do have to jump through a lot of hoops, for God's murderous psychosis to "make sense.". Take a look back, at all those mental gymnastics you have to do, to justify heinous actions.  If God created the world, didn't he create the rules?  Didn't he create the tree, specifically for this purpose?  He certainly didn't need it for himself, right?  And since he obviously didn't need  it, it was created just for Adam and Eve.  Then he set it right next to them, in this small garden, knowing that their naivety would lead to them eating it.  Just like any ignorant baby would.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure.  Blame the kiddos, for what was a sadistic setup in the first place.  Just know that you follow the Devil.  He's the most evil character in that book, and nobody else even comes close to the sick shit he does.  Satan is just an underling amateur, compared to the sadistic Yaweh.  I guess he hasn't caught up to his father, in that respect.

       No, god made us with a free will. This allows us to choose between good and evil. He set up this tree to test his creation, nothing wrong here.
      </p>
      <p>
       He couldve not set that tree there, ofcourse. But then, how could his creation choose?
      </p>
      <p>
       He couldve made us different. Like creating us that we only can be good. But what is the purpose of that. That would be stupid. 
This way humans cant grow, this way humans will always join heaven. Or so, this way he couldve better created nothing, because its just a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, stop disrespecting God. He is the creator. His rules are clear and good. You can only be mercyfull to him because he is giving you a chance. The body you live in, is his. You are only here because he gave it to you, with a free will, so you can grow in the way he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you created your children. And you want your children to walk on the good path. They need a free will to choose for this good path. But because "good" is made, there is "evil" too. 
Your children have the free will to choose for the right path. You even gave them the rules to do so. You created them with human nature, which means they know it when they are sinning/when they do something bad. Cuz they will feel bad when doing so. And you promised your children to join you, when they have grown as beings and chose for the right path. The children who fell for evil, you ofcourse wont take them with you. You have given them enough chances.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this as a farm. You will only farm the plants that grew the way you wanted them to grow. (Or so taking them to heaven). And the plants that didnt grow the way you wanted, you will ofcourse not take with you.

       Wow i see your not normal as i used nothing but common examples of life to make my point,  and you called them loops?. Now you blame God for having a tree which he enjoyed but told them, (Adam and Eve), not to eat that and hes now the bad guy for just having it?
Do not parents drink alcohol or smoke today? And dont they have it for just themselves and tell thier kids not to do it? Knowing full well kids might sneek a sip or try a puff? 
Come on get real. Your trying to just Hate hate hate instead of being understanding.
We are humans and we know things before they happen like the examples i just easily gave you,  but we do it anyway for OUR enjoyment. 
God said all creation is for his enjoyment. The Tree of Good and Evil was like alcohol for kids to Adam and Eve and when they ate it they didnt die right then and their but like alcohol it says "Their Eyes were open knowing good from evil" and what did God say? He said "look now they are like Us knowing good and evil". 
Its so freaking easy to understand yet you are doing everything in your power to just hate God and not want to underdtand.Stop it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hate religions and stupid man made doctrines and  traditions Sure. But to hate the creator of the universe who is the life force of all life just because you havent tried to just sit down in a room alone and give all your heart to him so he can finally find a place in your heart and life again is all on you. He wants to have a relationship with you but you dont let him. You refuse it because of nothing but pride and guilt. Its not like only a few wacky wierdos talk to Christ in some mountain somewhere. Billions do it and have been doing it for thousands of years. Like the lame Disney song goes "LET IT GO" lol . Let him in and your life will change.
But if you need convincing even more and need something to break open your stone cold heart , type in on YouTube "Muslim or Jew or Atheist or Buddhist, or Satanist .. turn to Christ " you  will see hundreds of videos of these. But turn it the other way around (christian to whatever) you will see maybe a handful of options amd they are as lame and empty as watching a commerical. There is no depth, no passion, no heart breaking realization of reality,  all those people have is hate.

      <p>
       I can find a lot of debate that Jesus died by crucifixion.  I can find mythicists which claim Jesus was a myth so there was no crucifixion, I can find plenty of scholars that claim that there was a historical Jesus, but that the stories about him are myths so the crucifixion is out, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you meant to say that religious believers don't doubt or won't debate the crucifixion, that might be true for a segment of the population, but it certainly not true for every member of a set.

       Jesus gave up something that we find precious, our life.  Life as in meaning staying alive, to be able to live to the end of your days, most people wouldn't want to cut their life short willingly, especially knowing that they'll be tortured, spat on, and then be crucified for their sins, but Jesus did endure those things and He conquered death when He rose on the 3rd day.

       Summary, Jesus died but not really died.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the above paragraph expresses is a metaphysical contradiction that you avoid.  In order for there to be a sacrifice of life, it has to end. Not end for a little bit and come back like Lazarus or Jarius's daughter, or like when the dead man  touches Elisha's bones and be raised.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kings 13:21 (KJV)
21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you can't commit to a real sacrifice, to a real death of god theology. If you did then Christianity would be false, but you could salvidge the belief in a deity etc.

       Okay so a lot of religion all has similar contexts. They all say to follow simple rules about not being a dick to each other and that you are part of something bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some go further and give rules on food prep and what can / can't be eaten which rules more around what was safe back then and basic principles that they believed (like not torturing an animal before death and not eating the legs of animals because it's lived it whole life standing in shit ect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most larger religions have lost the actual values and are more focused on forcing others to view the world through their blinkered belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       God gaia Allah it's literally all the same thing just in different words.

       Religion shouldn't cost money. 
Religion shouldnt make money.
Religion shouldn't be preached or pushed upon anyone else, but should be taught so that people sent left ignorance. Ignorance breeds fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say if you want to find what's true, then study a few religions and see what feels right for you.

       God is allowing this to happen, so prophecy can be fulfilled, this is why we have a war going on in Syria and for the first time in a very longtime since the cold war, we have the two greatest war powers fighting against each other in a proxy war in Syria and both camps have their troops in this nation.  It will only take one accident to start up a large war in Syria, between the US and Russia.  All of this stuff is meant to happen.

       If you were in control and started out giving simple commandments. Ie Dont kill anyone , dont steal ,dont lie dont sleep with someone elses spouse etc.  And you tell them that "hey if you need anything pray to me and i will hear you, but if you are not listening to the rukes i previous gave you i wont listen to you unless you say your sorry and dont do those things anymore " but then the little shits you created start immediately disobeying you on those very simple rules and then they bitch and moan why things dont go their way but you keep your word by not listening to them unless they chsnge their minds. Do you break your word? Hell no. You got rules to follow because if you break yours then the rules you gave them dont mean anything. You said you will forgive them as soon as they repent and chsnge their behavior but they refuse. So in tur. You let them alone to do their own works. And their own works will bring their own destruction.

       When I was in catholic school as a kid, one lesson really stuck with me. They said that God
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       love. Like God = love. One and the same. That's what created us.. an emotion, or a
       <em>
        feeling.
       </em>
       A vibration that brings life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The son of God would then be love (God) + humanity (Mary) = Jesus.

       I'm with you OP. Good question, hard to get people to see how the problems that psychology itself tries to fix is one where faith can restore. However, its not like a pill you can take and feel better. Its a mountain you have to continually climb. Sometimes its easier, sometimes its very difficult. I think you're doing a noble thing OP, thanks for your faith

       Remember though, a good chunk of stories about jesus were omitted from bible. One "1ST hand accounts" was a story about him blowing some kid up because he bumped into himself, put him back together.

       So I think the biggest misconception with religion is Love.
      </p>
      <p>
       God did not 'show' love, he IS love. So, if you love, you are going Gods work. You don't have o believe in God to love, but if you do believe it gives a sort or purpose to the love. Jesus WAS love in the flesh. he wasn't a magician or wizard, he infact was so much love that he had full capabilities over love and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       now people use religion to hate so much and they have for thousands of years. you see how using love to hate is the opposite of everything he teaches. and importantly, you can see that with love there comes no judgement, no worry, all positive. and positivity and love grows, so when you pray, it's not to this white beard dude in the sky, you are praying to love, and the love and energy that is omnipresent in the world will receive your loving intent and dish it right back at ya. When you worry it's the same but the opposite, but think about how an entire mass of people all praying good intent for something actually makes a difference. you see it happen time and time again. It's all love, it's all energy. God is love.

       The religious people responding in this thread make me sad. Compare the Bible to the Egyptian book of the dead. The shits plagiarized in so many examples. Next we will talk of flat earths and the dinosaurs existed 6000 years ago and carbon dating is an unprovable theory and an angle is watching over me.

       God created humans who have the ability to make choices, humans choose to disobey God and now we have knowledge of evil and ever since then, it has corrupted every human, we all need forgiveness from God for our sins we commit, God didn't make robot slaves, God created humans with the ability to make choices, such as to make the choice to believe or not believe, the choice is yours.
