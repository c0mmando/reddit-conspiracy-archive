       The real Nazis were smuggled into the U.S. via Operation Paperclip, or escaped to Argentina, or were captured by the Soviet Union. Or fled to Antarctica. Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       White gang members in prison covered in swastika tattoos are not Nazis. They are white gang members in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racists waving swastika flags or posting on 4chan are not Nazis. They are just racists.

        Nazis are real bad dudes.
       </a>
       Legit bogeymen. They are fascists, they push population control, they overthrow governments. They poison our water, they control our education system. They control the highest offices of what can be described as the "American Shadow Government."
      </p>
      <p>
       These kids at Charlottesville are not Nazis. They're disenfranchised youth who feel marginalized and don't know who to blame. They're then brainwashed by Charlie Manson types, who are in all likelihood getting their marching orders from some federal agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Helter Skelter is COINTELPRO. So is Charlottesville.

       <a href="https://youtu.be/QYcAfOoGagw">
        can't fathom the idea of a federal agency infiltrating 'extremist' groups and coercing them into committing crimes

       Hmmmmm I wonder how many tributes to the Hindenburg there are in the USA... that would be a fun little social experiment for some 4channers to try to pull off... see if ya can get the Hindenberg disaster spun as a  thing to celebrate. People don't seem to see picture of it before it took aflame very often...

        When we look at Zionism in terms of what it actually is rather than some devious, self-serving Zionist definition we find what?
       </a>
       “Nationalism, traditionalism and the importance of the ethnostate.” We also find the essential elements of fascism in general, the arrogance of group ego and the assertion of an a priori privilege that trumps any such fripperies as civil rights, human rights, international law or even common human decency. Coercion and force majeure are the means and virtual enslavement or extermination of the “others” (the goyim) are the ends. Characteristically, we also find the common element of a sense of infinite entitlement based on perceived prior victimhood.

       Applepie was the code name for capturing Werchmacht general staff, RSHA, and Sicherheitsdienst officers for debriefing and future employment opportunities.  Significant portion of Sicherheitsdienst debriefing transcripts were not declassified after we finished up the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act compliance.

       Project 63 was a coded project name of the 'job fair' that placed former engineers and aerospace scientists in jobs at Lockheed, NAA, and Marietta.

       I try to be precise with my language. "White supremacist" means one thing; it's generally what people mean by Nazi. "White nationalist" means they want people with different skin color living separately (I know one in person), I vehemently disagree with that, however, I acknowledge that some of these people are well-intentioned. I know because I listen to the interviews. Some of them even call themselves socialists. They really believe that integration is the cause of a lot of problems, and we'd be better of living separately. Like I said, I couldn't disagree more, but let's have the conversation. Theirs is a losing battle, but it's better t have the conversation than a shouting match. The hard-core white supremacists, though, who people are calling neo-Nazis- these people are dangerous and extremely nasty.

       Essentially, this is a thread of pedantry, and discussing semantics is a waste of time. I actively argue against using labels to identify human beings. But I have a greater idea that I'm trying to express, without saying it (which is a poor method of spreading ideas).
      </p>
      <p>
       The real point behind this thread is that there is
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       evil out there, and these kids in Charleston are not it. They're hooligans at worst. Labeling people is a way of dehumanizing them (and it works brilliantly) which makes them easier to victimize, whether you're bombing terrorists or punching Nazis. This is a plot by the folks at the top (who coincidentally are far more closely related to Nazis than these kids are) to spread evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism sucks, man. But you're never going to stop racism with more hate. The people who are punching Nazis need to take a good long look in the mirror and realize they are just as bad, if not worse, than the racists. Hating a racist is just going to make him even more hateful! The only way to cure racism is through love. The kids who are harassing the racists are the same type of people, who are exacerbating the problem by committing evil, and they are all jeopardizing their immortal karmic souls.

       I completely agree with you on your major points here. These open racists are bit players and shouldn't be given too much attention- I agree with that. However, it's a big media story, and every media story is an opportunity for education, so I've been on YouTube with an anti-racist message, just trying to swing some young people the right direction. And I strongly agree that the "punch a Nazi" line is really negative bullshit. I wrote as much on Facebook this morning. That said, Antifa is relatively very small.

       I watched it yesterday. It's disgusting. Those kids are embarrassing themselves. It was very cringeworthy and full of hate. Racism is shameful, and so is instigating violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, hate begets more hate. The kids who are attacking these white nationalist kids are reinforcing their racist ideals and actively worsening the entire situation. If you're a Nazi-Puncher, you
       <em>
        are

       exponentially creating more hate, and therefore, you are just as bad as these racist jerks.

       If you want to stop racism, the only way is through love. I am here preaching love, for every man, and yet you insinuate that I am somehow a Nazi. Take a look in the mirror.

       No one but you in this current discussion is saying that the two sides are the same. What I see are a bunch of commentators who likely see in shades of grey (how the world actually works) trying to have a discussion with you, who I wonder if grey is even a color in your mind so to speak.

       The English language is more nuanced than that. Of course both sides are different:
       <strong>
        that is not the point those posters were trying to make.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Read, think and take your emotions out of it. You are supposed to feel strong emotion on these subjects because for a lot of people it is tied into their core belief system. That's not an accident.

       Delve into information about the known, unknown and anything in between. The saying is that there are 3 sides to every story.

       Find the truth. Do not divide but unite those that

      </p>
      <p>
       This is the message people are trying to get you to see. You have to be willing to entertain the "crazy" or else you are susceptible to what can essentially amount to brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am simply not willing to condemn the "oppressed young white male" portion of the alt-right for their confusion and misplaced anger. They have been manipulated for (likely) 6+ years for this exact purpose.

       Fuck the KKK, fuck neo-nazis and fuck white supremacy.

      <p>
       Calling a large group of people nazis for this is, at best, going to further cement that ideology as the "correct" one in their heads. That is counter-productive and socially harmful.

       Again you are equating a large group of people (hateful groups that have been allowed to do things like this for far too long anyway) and the actions of sub-groups to brainwashed youth. Did you attend the rally in Charlottesville? If not, how can you so confidently say that everyone under the alt-right umbrella was doing the things you said? Even if every single person in that Charlottesville rally was (which they weren't) doing these things; are you then willing to extrapolate that nationwide based on a small sample-size in Virginia?
      </p>
      <p>
       That has never been how logic works.

       That's actually a brilliant idea. A small group of flower children committed to spreading the idea of peace could probably go a long ways to enhancing a message by minimizing the distraction of violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the counter-protesters had countered these hateful people by being kind, they would have actually had a positive impact on these people instead of further entrenching their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that girl would still be alive today if the counter-protesters had maintained the moral high ground and responded to the hate with love. Blood is on their hands just as much as the rest of the racist instigators that went there.

       The CIA basically absorbed the Nazi intelligence network in the USSR/Eastern Europe, while effectively leaving Nazis in control of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember all the various South American anti-communist dictators.  If the CIA helped Nazis escape to South America, and the CIA helped South American regimes kill leftists, theres probably a connection.

       hey OP start looking into who the nazis were from Operation Paperclip and look into the military industrial complex and who the people from Operation Paperclip went to work for ..
      </p>
      <p>
       nazi sympathizers are everywhere , there is a hidden power struggle in the US , it involves the jews and nazis  . guns and money..
      </p>
      <p>
       ill give you a clue , it isnt the Freemasons of Illuminati pulling the strings ..
      </p>
      <p>
       apart from german knights who else fought in the crusades ?
      </p>
      <p>
       who makes billions from donations and has a red cross as a logo ?
      </p>
      <p>
       thats right , the red cross , behind the red cross is the knights Templar .. who owns freemasonry ? thats right the  knights Templar do ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the red cross is a scam , a front . everyone know it is but most dont know it was knights Templar who brought the nazis to america.
      </p>
      <p>
       fund a war &gt; profit from guns and ammo .&gt;profit again by rebuilding &gt;continue to profit from aid work and medicine &gt; pull in more profit by providing private security &gt; laugh as you make even more money by keeping wars going for longer than they should ..
      </p>
      <p>
       they learned all this from the crusades  1095 – 1291
      </p>
      <p>
       take a look at people in government who are freemasons and who is also a member of the knights templar .
      </p>
      <p>
       now look into who is a jesuit
      </p>
      <p>
       now see the war ?
      </p>
      <p>
       dont worry OP , neither side is the good guy so dont relax just yet
      </p>
      <p>
       all the world is a stage , from the queen to the pope , all are under one banner . deceit ..
      </p>
      <p>
       you want to know who runs them all ? ask elton john , he played a private show for him in the 80s and 90s

       the true knights templar are not christian , no freemason who takes jesus christ as his lord and savoir will ever become a 33 degree mason, this should tell you what the relationship is , many Illuminati are also masons .   Illuminati wants to destroy the holy roman church .

       god has nothing to do with it , money , land and power , the knights templar are said to have discovered the secrets of king Solomon and king david under an old temple in Jerusalem , these secrets are said to be incantations and rituals to the idol known as Baphomet
      </p>
      <p>
       this is where you roll your eyes just as i did but please bare with me .
      </p>
      <p>
       these rituals are said to summon demons . same demons as the jews used to summon , islam calls them jinns ..
      </p>
      <p>
       in more modern times we have come to know them as the greys ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem is , the elite , yes them , found out that these demons were not demons but aliens , 2 races , at war , both with a firm grip on the rulers of the planet ..
      </p>
      <p>
       rome -  baal , the holy roman church is an inclusive religion , you do know this part yes ?
      </p>
      <p>
       ok so    where ever rome went it took on the religion of the people , this is why we have christmas and easter , pegan festivals ..
      </p>
      <p>
       rome has nothing to do with the one true god of the jews in the bible as jesus was only human .. its god is many gods , for the people tho the "holy roman catholic church" had the one true god as its god and his son jesus , you follow ?
      </p>
      <p>
       knights templar and freemasons god is Baphomet , to the people who their god is the one true god and his son jesus ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the one true god and his son is a facade.
      </p>
      <p>
       its reptile aliens and greys ..
      </p>
      <p>
       the knights templar are rubbing the holy roman churches nose in dog shit right now with the erection of the gates of baal in london and the us

      </p>
      <p>
       to them this is a trophy , the queen does not worship baal or the elite , this is BS  by people who dont know history .
      </p>
      <p>
       best kept secret in modern and ancient history was the crash at roswell , this showed the nazis who were working at white sands  the truth .. demons dont fly space ships . this truth filtered out over the past 50 years , the trilateral industrial complex its self is a battle ground for 5 sides , the american patriots , jews , nazis and the jesuits along with knights templar/freemasons ..
      </p>
      <p>
       winning is the templar/freemasons nazis

       funny you should ask , story i was told my a freemason is crystal balls are reflective and you are able to use them like a mirror , he said there is another way , its a pair of glasses with 2 different color lenses , one i remember him saying was amber , if you have access to a crystal ball , use it next time there is a rainbow , what is supposed to happen is the crystal enlarges the bands of color as they reflect off the curve of the ball

       a rainbow is the bands of light that make up the visible light spectrum , if you were able to magnify them you would get a larger  "hole" to see into these individual spectrums

       Weren't many of the original Nazis disenchanted youths who didn't know who to blame? People can come to evil ideologies for all sorts of reasons, that doesn't make the ideas any left harmful, or their commitment to them any less real.

       It also doesn't make these people any less human (which is what attaching labels to people does). And it doesn't change the fact that you can't defeat evil with more evil (punching Nazis). Only love can defeat hate.

       We shouldn't dehumanize people, agreed. I'm a Christian. I believe all people are made in the image of God, even real Nazis. But I also believe there are wicked and harmful ideologies, and we should not diminish the evil of those ideologies because broken people come to them in their brokenness. I also believe murder is evil, and that murderers should be brought to justice.

       Well, for the record, I don't support punching nazis who haven't committed crimes. I do support acknowledging what they themselves profess to be, and calling it out for what it is. But no punching, agreed.

       I don't think calling yourself something makes you that thing. There are a few fundamental differences between White Nationalists and Nazis -- for example, practicing the occult, and fascism. I'm willing to bet most White Nationalists are either atheist/Xian and republicans (as in, they support republics -- not the Republican Party).
      </p>
      <p>
       These are garden variety racists and, more importantly, young kids who have not fully thought out their ideology (or else they wouldn't pretend to be something they are not).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to argue labels, even though that's how it's coming across... I'm just trying to humanize these kids. There's no way we can 'solve' this problem, as long as we keep calling them Nazis.

       After studying that time period from primary sources, I don't think there was anything wrong with Nazi Germany or their people, or even their supporters.  They weren't any worse than most other movements at that time, and certainly better than the communists on their eastern front.  The propaganda war and the lies about Nazi Germany prevailed because the enemies of Germany won WWII...They certainly weren't Saints, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't acknowledge the truth about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who claim to be Nazis today are largely fakes.  On the other hand, people who claim to be National Socialists are generally much more educated on what that label means.

       "Nazis" are just nationalists. the "Shadow government" is globalist and anti-nationalist. This is beyond moronic. Fascism just means nationalism. It is symbolized by the Roman fasces, carried by a prefect. You don't have any idea what you are talking about. This is honestly the dumbest subreddit I've ever seen.

        Kennedy expressed approval of Adolf Hitler before his conquest of Europe began. His father sent him to visit Nazi Germany in 1934. He wrote to his father, praising Hitler's sterilization policy as "a great thing" that "will do away with many of the disgusting specimens of men." [2] He explained that "Hitler is building a spirit in his men that could be envied in any country."[3][4]

       I'm not really interested in splitting hairs however I would hesitate to label someone who sympathized with some of Hitler's ideas a Nazi. That being said the most important distinction to be made concerning men of that era is between those, like Kennedy, who cut all ties to Hitler once the US declared war on Germany vs. those, like Bush, Ford, Rockefeller and Dulles, who continued to fund, support and profit from the Nazi regime following the US' declaration of war.

       That's a fair point. But if Lindberg isn't a Nazi, because he didn't fight for Germany, despite espousing some of their beliefs, then neither are the boys in Charlottesville, right?

       I don't think Nazi is the best term to describe them no as the racial superiority was only one part of Nazism-- a much bigger element of Nazism was the marriage between corporate and state power.  The losers in Charlottesville, imho, are best described as white supremacists.  If we're going to start pointing fingers at Nazis throughout history, then let's start at the top with folks like Dulles, Ford, Bush. et. al.

       funny you should ask , story i was told my a freemason is crystal balls are reflective and you are able to use them like a mirror , he said there is another way , its a pair of glasses with 2 different color lenses , one i remember him saying was amber , if you have access to a crystal ball , use it next time there is a rainbow , what is supposed to happen is the crystal enlarges the bands of color as they reflect off the curve of the ball

       Again you are equating a large group of people (hateful groups that have been allowed to do things like this for far too long anyway) and the actions of sub-groups to brainwashed youth. Did you attend the rally in Charlottesville? If not, how can you so confidently say that everyone under the alt-right umbrella was doing the things you said? Even if every single person in that Charlottesville rally was (which they weren't) doing these things; are you then willing to extrapolate that nationwide based on a small sample-size in Virginia?
      </p>
      <p>
       That has never been how logic works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Help the youth see the light because not all of them are yet in the thick of this.
