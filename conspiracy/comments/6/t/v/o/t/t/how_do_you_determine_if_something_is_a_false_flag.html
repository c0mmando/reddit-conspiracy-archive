<p>I feel like it&#39;s become a boy who cried wolf situation when everything is immediately called false and then just keep changing the story to fit the narrative that was already chosen.  For Charlottesville, it was changed from different car, to different guy, to he was attacked and scared, etc.  But it&#39;s still pushed as a false flag?</p>

<p>Seems like people are choosing the story and trying to find the evidence to fit it instead or following where evidence actually leads.  How is that trying to see the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are incorrect.</p>

<p>The MEDIA decided that a crazed white supremacist smashed his car into a crowd of people in an act of &quot;domestic terrorism&quot;. It was a tragedy and a hate crime that happened because of the president empowering Nazis. And white people are terrible!!!</p>

<p>THAT is the narrative that is currently being shoved down our throats by the media almost <em>immediately</em> after the incident. When you closely examine the evidence supporting the narrative you find multiple glaring inconsistencies and red flags. But the media count on you to believe what they say without question; they are authority and you&#39;ve been trained to respect them. They create an immediate emotional response in the viewer which clouds their ability to look at the evidence subjectively and critically. The media also have an interest in creating social unrest and division among the American people. </p>

<p>If you look at the hard evidence (videos of the incident) you will see some strange things. One of the strangest is that the driver supposedly wears glasses. In the only photo that exists of the driver <em>during</em> the incident, he is not wearing glasses. How can you explain the driver&#39;s ability to reverse at about 15 to 20mph for two blocks, perfectly straight without hitting a single parked car or even swerving really, WITHOUT his glasses? This is merely one of the inconsistencies in the official narrative. What about the two police officers who were following the driver in a helicopter? They crashed and both of them died. We haven&#39;t heard much about that story and the details (photos, images, potential videos) have not been released. Seems a little fishy right?</p>

<p>What other context can there be? There was a neo-nazi/white supremacist rally that was promoted very widely and for awhile in forums like the_donald or stormfront that was then met by counter protesters.</p>

<p>It was a legally organized demonstration called Unite The Right. The organizers had contacted the city and gone through legal means to plan the event. There were multiple different groups there: people who have conservative political viewpoints (some of them extreme like Nazi or White Supremacists), and people who have more liberal viewpoints (also some of them extreme, like ANTIFA). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are story tellers, going back thousands of years and the stories for the most part are good and evil right up until this day. There are bad people doing bad things and good people who have to stop the bad people, it&#39;s probably the oldest and most recognisable archetype in the world. Unfortunately good and bad aren&#39;t always easily applied to humans in real life, there&#39;s a lot of grey area, people looking out for their own interests, people with incomprehensible goals and motives that some people don&#39;t understand and a crazy and chaotic world that doesn&#39;t always conform to an easily understandable script. That&#39;s scary to some people, it&#39;s easier forcing complex events into these story parameters; &quot;these bad people set this up because they want to do bad things to other people&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there are no conspiracies, I&#39;m not saying there are no false flags ever in history, but an overwhelming amount of the time people use the false flag narrative because it&#39;s simple; bad vs good. It&#39;s also a lot less scary to believe that there&#39;s someone pulling the strings behind every bad event, that someones in control of it all, when in reality the world is just a crazy, chaotic place and people have great capacity to be really shitty to each other without the need for a puppet master.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m so cynical of our government(s), that I consider nearly every big terror event to be a false flag of some sort.  Whether it&#39;s a direct attack like 9/11, or using agent provacateurs, ala Charlottesville.  I&#39;m at the point where, if the government/media told me that water is wet, I&#39;d have to seriously rethink my assumptions about water.  I exaggerate a little, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The biggest red flag, imo, is that each of these events seem to have a pre-canned message that go along with them, and are pushed <em>heavily</em> by the media, long before we know any &quot;facts&quot; about the situation.  You could chalk it up to ignorant sensationalism, but the pattern over time indicates a specific agenda, which the media puts out deliberately, and not just as a cheap trick to get ratings.</p>

<p>Ding ding ding, we have a winner.</p>

<p>Any event that gets blanket media coverage to push a political agenda is likely stage-managed from the very start. The controlled media would never risk a real event possibly spinning out from under their carefully crafted plotline, so real events get little or no coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.... This doesn&#39;t answer your questions, but it should give some insight into why some people are so skeptical, especially in light of the nearly automatic and seemingly coordinated media response.</p>

<p>One of these groups, like them or not, had the proper permits required for lawful assembly. The right to free speech does not always equal the unfettered right to assemble in some places. </p>

<p>The city tried to move and/or shut down the rally in the days leading up to the event. The city was sued and a court order was issued by a judge demanding that the city allow the protest to take place inside the park.</p>

<p>What followed these events is truly frightening.</p>

<p>Regardless of if you agree or disagree with whatever hateful rhetoric was flying around, this is America, and just because you disagree with someone does not give you the right to assault, harass, instigate, or walk around in the streets unlawfully.</p>

<p>Through the many videos of the event, I have seen with my own eyes the blatant disregard by the police force to protect the rights of those that chose to lawfully assemble.  The police&#39;s first mistake was not confiscating any and all weapons brought to the event. Baseball bats have no place at a protest. Anybody showing up to a protest carrying a baseball bat obviously has other motives. </p>

<p>The police literally stood around while hundreds of &quot;counter protestors&quot; flooded the streets unlawfully. Many even carrying baseball bats and other weapons.  The police stood around while people from both sides of the &quot;protest&quot; instigated each other and escalated the situation to the point of violence. </p>

<p>Once violence occured, the police decided that the whole event was an unlawful assembly and told everyone to disperse. </p>

<p>Do you remember how long it took the streets of Boston to clear out after that was declared a state of emergency? Do you realize that hours after Charlottesville declared a state of emergency, people were still roaming the streets, unlawfully assembling, still carrying weapons?</p>

<p>Do you realize that there was still a declared state of emergency in effect when the tragic car crash took place? </p>

<p>Nothing is simple about the events that took place on Saturday and to reduce it down into hateful identity politics does a disservice to the people and their rights that were neglected. The police were given the order to not engage until further notice. That notice never came. The entire event escalated out of negligence by whomever gave the police the order to not engage. It&#39;s going to get dirty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that I want it to be. I just know well enough to suspect that it could have been a planned event, with a actors and operatives present for the purpose of pushing an agenda. The immediate reaction by the media and the extreme focus on the incident without presenting any real context of the overall happenings that day are suspect enough in my opinion. Coupled with blatant inconsistencies and the crash of the helicopter killing two police Rd officers, of which little to no evidence has been released about...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell by how the media covers the event and the narratives they put out.</p>

<p>You can tell the big Islamist attacks in Orlando and France were legit because of how the media was silent at first and never really delved into the issue. Some people still don&#39;t know about the extent of the horrors in the Bataclan, including genital mutilation, men had their testicles cut off and women stabbed in the vagina, this info was withheld from the public for months after the incident. In the Orlando case the Obama DoJ tried to censor the shooter pledging allegiance to ISIS in the 911 tape, and their deep state operatives spread a false narrative of Mateen being a disgruntled self hating gay as the reason for his attack. The media spent as little time as they possibly could on these incidents and quickly moved on to other shit after a few days</p>

<p>With false flag shit just watch the media and you&#39;ll see that they&#39;ve got tons of shit ready to go. Every celebrity and media personality talking about it. Buzzwords to say dozens of times every 10 minutes. Every late night host and media outlet saying the same thing and using the same words. Mass astroturfing on reddit. Basically they expose the fakeness of these events with how prepared the media propaganda is and how everyone is on the same narrative instantly after the event. also by how long the event gets dragged out, for example that Republican Baseball shooting was already out of the news by now and the news is still Charlottesville 24/7 right now</p>

<p>What other context can there be? There was a neo-nazi/white supremacist rally that was promoted very widely and for awhile in forums like the_donald or stormfront that was then met by counter protesters.</p>
