    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I also remember reading about how the governmental agencies worked closely with the bankers and corporate interests to spy on and infiltrate the movement. </p>

<p>I remember reading that because it was published in a not-too alternative media source at the time, and was searchable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty amazing how far we&#39;ve come in such a short time.</p>

<p>The question is - how to focus on unity? How to focus on the real forces that oppress versus all of the energy spent to pit us against one another?</p>

<p>For now, I take it as a mission to ensure my personal and day to day actions are in alignment with this value and belief. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Really the only way to lead is by example.  Any other form of leadership is pure deception. </p>

<p>All we can do is strengthen and follow our moral resolve.  We have a moral responsibility to take care of ourself and those around us.  In practicing this, and in holding less and less stake in the bullshit system, we can truly unify.</p>

<p>The idea of revolution I think is appealing to most.  But no one knows how to take a first step.  No one wants to be the first out of the gate, &quot;There is to much to lose&quot; we tell ourselves.  But if we don&#39;t decide to risk the little bit we have... soon... we will be left with nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say most of us already have less than nothing due to living in a debt slavery system. But the key, I suppose, is to wake people up to that fact.</p>

<p>In some ways, I believe the whole BTC thing has a potential towards that end, although it&#39;s not clear to me.</p>

<p>I think one of the other difficult things about a revolution is to nail down that which we would be revolting against. </p>

<p>My current best guess is that it&#39;s a potentially non-human force that&#39;s been at work here for a very long time and knows very well how to disguise itself and hide in the shadows. Not expecting anyone to follow me on that idea of course. But I say it out loud to demonstrate the issue that until / unless we even know what is really dividing us, it&#39;s difficult to formulate a cohesive response.</p>

<p>So yes, I come back to coherence within.</p>

<p>Inner peace will ultimately result in outer peace, especially if it spreads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The BTC thing along with open source and decentralized networking does have potential to change the technology paradigm.  In my lifetime, the Internet is the most amazing innovation.  I would love to see what it is capable of taking the regulators off.  </p>

<p>Same for humanity.  I love to imagine what kind of world we could build if people weren&#39;t spending all of their days making money, taking the money to the bank, and spending money to distract themselves from their misery. </p>

<p>To your point about who to revolt against.  I think that picking an enemy defeats the purpose.  Instead you have to choose your freedoms, and what type of world to create for your community.  Then the enemy will show itself.  </p>

<p>Starting from a &quot;We need an enemy&quot; mind frame will prove counter productive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different groups are focusing on different things. For me personally, I have a keen interest in learning more about truly sustainable / off grid living, and acting on that learning. In other words, I want to learn how to live in greater balance with nature. </p>

<p>Learning how to build and live in an Earthship is a concrete example of this.</p>

<p>Perhaps striving for utopian ideals is one way to actually move ahead, even if those ideals are not achievable in and of themselves?</p>

<p>I won&#39;t claim to know how the crypto currency story will unfold but that would be a different ideal of what people are striving for and trying to achieve, which is to say money outside of governmental control (keeping it simple here).</p>

<p>I have spoken with countless people into &#39;conspiracy&#39; who want to go &#39;off grid&#39;. You know how many actually have? NONE. It is simply the conspiracy version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNMZGSzB7EI">&#39;Shell Beach&#39;</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you clarify your Shell Beach point? Are you saying there is no such thing as really going &quot;off grid&quot;? That it&#39;s all an illusion?</p>

<p>If so, I would agree in some ways. There are times when it feels like Earth itself is a prison planet, or perhaps a school of some kind is more the case.</p>

<p>In any case, the real reason I am interested isn&#39;t because of any belief I may or may not have in conspiracies. It simply aligns with my values.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I have met people who are completely off grid. There&#39;s more of it going on in New Mexico than I have personally found elsewhere. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a glamorous life, to be sure. </p>

<p>But the earthships are one way and one example of actually making it happen. So I figure I&#39;ll start there, as it provides a hands on way of learning first hand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not an all or nothing thing for me. Even getting 70% or 80%  &quot;off grid&quot; would be an improvement.</p>

<p>Or perhaps this interest is simply a stepping stone to learning about something else that will take me further or in a different direction.</p>

<p>Not quite. I would imagine that some people, a very, <em>very</em>, <strong>very tiny</strong> proportion of people who ever claim they will go &#39;off grid&#39; actually do so (long-term). Roughly the same proportion as that who win the lottery. This ephemeral dream that they allow themselves, several times per day, allows the <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/epsilon-agenda-thumb-revised-1-800x445.jpg">Epsilon</a> to believe that they are going to a &#39;better place&#39;. That if they just keep doing what they are doing, eventually they will get to utopia.</p>

<p>The reality, of course, is that they are deluding themselves. We all delude ourselves to one degree or another. Some just take it much further and buy into stories about how, in the future, they will be doing this or that.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? Keep an eye out for people on this sub talking about what they are &#39;going to do&#39; in the future. What they &#39;plan to do soon&#39;.</p>

<p>Once you see it, you can&#39;t unsee it. Like when you notice that news programs regularly talk about &#39;medical breakthroughs&#39;, and realise this is just a way to convince the masses that &#39;medicine&#39; is their friend and that they are &#39;lucky&#39; to have access to it today in a time of &#39;technological progress&#39;.</p>

<p>No shit they do. This is why the US&#39; global alliance system covers only the developed countries in the world, and leaves all the countries that actually need protection out in the wind - (ie countries like Rwanda where governments are so weak they couldn&#39;t prevent the Rwandan genocide if they wanted to). This is why Germany/Japan/Italy became America&#39;s best friends just six years after they declared war on the US.</p>

<p>Even in Microeconomics, one of the first things they teach you is that you can only make value judgements if all things are held equal - the &#39;et ceteris perebis&#39; principle. So far the only in poor countries have socialist governments formed. They know once it takes root in a economically developed country, it will be much harder to &#39;de root&#39; than in the Eastern Bloc.</p>

<p>Honestly, I still believe things are &#39;too good&#39; for the average ignorant consumer. Although things are sucking more than before, and the suck keeps increasing, the average American can still expect much more reward per hour of work, than the vast majority of the world&#39;s countries. </p>

<p>I believe the chance for socialism that you allude to will come only when other (not US allied) countries industrialize enough to compete with US business, and wages will have to come down HEAVILY to be competitive with those countries. At that point people will realize that their historical success in the US was mainly due to chance, and will either accept much lower standards of living, or start pressing for socialism.</p>

<p>In some ways, I believe the whole BTC thing has a potential towards that end, although it&#39;s not clear to me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was recently reading a book called The Internet of Money which is really a compilation of speeches made by Andreas M. Antonopoulos. His talks are free on YouTube it just takes a while to find to right one.</p>

<p>One thing that really struck me with his ideas on the future of currencies is the question of How many cryptographic currencies will there be. The answer is as many as you want. You see, the legitimacy of these currencies does not lie with a cabal of central bankers backed by the violence of the state, instead, it depends on those to perticipate in using that currency.  The rate of money creation does not get decided in smokey rooms of the fed, instead it is a mathematical formula open to all. </p>

<p>You see, if Bitcoin dies tomorrow, it is not the end of crypto currency. It is like if your camp fire dies at night doesn&#39;t mean fire will cease to exist. The invention of the Block chain is like the discovery of fire. Many currencies will use its principals to achrive different means of value exchange. Some fast, some slow, some inflationary, some deflationary. And the value that gets exchanged can hop from one currency to another depending on the will of the user.</p>

It feels like when you get deep enough in to these topics, you realize that there is something that is missing. Some intangible part of the puzzle seems to be catapulting us forward, as we are manipulated and driven to a predetermined goal of subjugation. I understand that on one had there are multiple groups vying for power and it isn&#39;t a totally concentrated effort. As we have seen with Trump their plans can still be thwarted. However, in certain arenas, or over long periods, the plan of the elite seems too structured and multi-faceted to be pure coincidence either.</p>

<p>This is exacerbated by the weird information available about the elite and occult rituals. I still wonder if there is a supernatural element, or if the world is just chaotic. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not a very reliable barometer of whether someone is telling the truth or not, particularly since he didn&#39;t predict the future a lot, and because no one can do this with 100% accuracy, even with complete insider information.</p>

<p>This is where you&#39;ve fallen apart. Badly.</p>

<p>You made an unsound argument to begin with. Then you doubled down on it, and made a horrifically unsound argument. Thinking for yourself is bad? Really?</p>

<p>In order to fully demoralize you, let me tell you how big of a fuck up this is. You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve seen in many months making attacks like this against High Level Insider. The shills used to ignore all of those posts, but now, all of a sudden, I&#39;ve got someone jumping in an making ridiculous attacks on them again.</p>

<p>Which tells me that it has now been communicated that this is a threat to those who want people to come onto reddit and make ridiculous, unsound arguments to control discussion.</p>

<p>In short, you&#39;ve given me incredibly valuable intelligence, as you guys always do whenever you post here. Not only do you never win, you frequently give us valuable information that brings the demise of the deep state even closer.</p>

It&#39;s also way too long-term to matter and it won&#39;t be possible to recognize &quot;they,&quot; so it&#39;s clear he made is vague enough to convince blokels like you he&#39;s still legitimate. Face the music: you&#39;ve been swept up in some guys articulate bullshit.

Either way, I&#39;m getting pretty sick of it.

<p>Hate comes from fear, period. And the best remedy for fear is openness and compassion toward ourselves. When we start to figure out that our fears of others are really a reflection of how we feel about ourselves, we&#39;re free to show ourselves and others compassion. If we all as individuals become open instead of fearful toward others and ourselves, unity is almost inevidable. No one person is the enemy. Disease of the spirit is. </p>

<p>Its like a close football game. It becomes plausible that any play that had a significant influence on the direction of the game might have made the difference by itself. So when someone dismisses the idea that outside interference (produced fake news from Russian sources, Russian hacks that leaked damaging information on just Clinton), it possible that one of those was a tipping point. </p>

<p>What&#39;s funny is that often times someone will mock you for suggesting that leaks could have had a significant impact on the election, will in the next breath tell you that she lost because the DNC is corrupt, the main evidence for which was suspected to be Russian hacking.</p>

It&#39;s consistently the issue with these movements, it&#39;s nice that everyone has an idea and supports it - but it&#39;s like those facebook posts &quot;Like this to show support for X&quot; it doesn&#39;t accomplish anything to have an idea - you have to actually do something about it.</p>

<p>Until enough people are actually willing to do something, then it&#39;s not going to change.</p>

<p>That at the end of the day it&#39;s the trap we&#39;ve in, we are a content people at the end of the day, for the most part we are comfortable and safe, and enjoy a reasonable level of luxury. Very few people are willing to risk this to stand for change.</p>

<p>If you go look at the threads at the time, and any threads calling for a movement you will see comments of people calling for action - but refusing to take it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me the issue of unity starts on simply agreeing on where to go from here. We are getting to a point where free speech is being challenged openly and even considered terrorism. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t believe the Nazi/KKK agenda is reasonable or even acceptable, but it starts the first page of censorship of free speech in America.</p>

<p>How can we unite groups that don&#39;t agree on an ideological level? Is it even possible? Or is the 99 percent always doomed to be divided naturally because charismatic leaders influence those that follow?</p>

<p>The idea has to be simple and agreeable by both sides of a conflict. Non-partisan issues are ones that concern people closest to this, but we are talking on an even simpler scale here. The vast majority of people won&#39;t agree on something that has their best interest at heart when someone like the 1 percent can convince them otherwise.</p>

<p>And this is the crux of the problem. Those that have amassed enough wealth to stifle competition do so by using wealth to influence those without it.</p>

<p>Until you can develop a system that takes decision making on a government level away from those in power there has to exist someone who will abuse that power. Our current controllers (if you will) are bankers, royal families, and unknown individuals that work off of human need or desire of wealth as oppose to virtue. Returning the government into a people&#39;s government involves many layers of convincing that simply can&#39;t be reached by those without funding. The idea of doing so requires an effort on everyones part working to see past the elaborate differences that set us apart in the first place. Finding common ground is difficult let alone finding a potential idea that can be agreed upon and moved towards.</p>

<p>I think the government needs to be taken out of the hands of humans and turned over to technology, return voting into a democratic standard, and not letting corporations get a hold on voter manipulation (this last one is difficult because of how invested corporations are in changing people&#39;s opinions).</p>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just a bystander.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, what about asteroids, global warming or Fukushima? Get a grip, humanity is not one body with one mind and one tiny agenda. Crushing feminism will not yield more helpful hands for your own goals. Trying to do so is counterproductive to your goals, because it needlessly alienates people. Perhaps you could get some feminists to care, but you&#39;re going to even turn away feminist sympathizers with your misguided behavior. </p>

<p>Asteroids: Incredibly important, can be prevented by building an <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">orbital ring space elevator</a>.</p>

<p>Global warming: also solved by the space elevator, because solar power will be cheaper than fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Fukushima: clean it up, shift power production to space solar panels, as described above.</p>

<p>Saying feminism isn&#39;t as important as millions of dying people is a far cry from &quot;crushing feminism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s interesting to me is that both Occupy and the Tea Party movement both started as protests to the Big Bank Bailouts. Both were protesting some pretty similar issues (government spending, the national debt, bailouts for the rich, economic inequality). These were primarily economic movements that had a lot of overlap. Of course the wealthy could have none of that. Imagine if both sides joined together? </p>

<p>lol, no we weren&#39;t. Occupy’s chief accomplishment was changing the national conversation by giving Americans a new language, the 99% and the 1%,  to frame income inequality and the corrupting influence of money in politics. Despite the public’s support for Occupy&#39;s message, that the economic system is rigged for the very few while the majority continue to fall further behind, Occupy failed to produce concrete results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not prophecy man. The economy according to the experts is doing well. I cant or wont debate that point. What I will tell you is that my company is struggling, we supply construction related equipment. We are slow, because construction is slow. There are jobs, they pay crap. I hear this from angry twentysomethings and the angry fellas that elected Trump. Those angry fellas, who were supposedly angry because they didn&#39;t have jobs and not because or racism or phobias, are still angry. I dont think they would be angry if they were busy with a GOOD job and the money and leisure time that go with it. </p>

<p>But go ahead and wait for the trickle down from this boom in the economy. I hope you find a piece, I really do. But most of us wont. My company just cut our hsa contribution. And this will only be the second year including last year out of like 25 + with no profit sharing</p>

<p>He&#39;s mainly seeking to do what Republicans have sought to do for years. It&#39;s all in the second link, you <em>proficient seeker of truth</em>.   He wants to get rid of taxes that primarily impact the rich. He wants to get rid of the dealth/estate tax, a tax only for estates worth more than $5,450,000. He wants to reduce corporate tax. He even proposed gutting the 39.6% top marginal income tax rate down to just 15%, a tax currently paid by only the 0.2% richest. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll ignore it and continue to pretend Trump gives a flying fuck about the working class. You just irritated me enough to read the links I sent you to get the exact numbers. It&#39;s a plan much like what Republicans have proposed in the past, and any politically savvy liberal could tell you that. I&#39;m betting you&#39;re conservative though, so you&#39;ll probably conserve that distorted worldview by ignoring data, and by using dishonest rhetorical tactics like you already have. </p>

<p>Honestly, how else could people like you who pretend to have concern for working class economic interests miss his intent or even the longstanding Republican intent? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to push any ideological agenda, but instead offer advice: No one person probably can fix everything, but can still make a difference, and you can make a bigger difference locally. It might take some effort, and may not be viable for everyone, but find a local politician (or someone running for office) that fits your beliefs, and maybe also doesn&#39;t seem to be noticeable beholden to any financial or ideological pressures. Again, not easy, but if you find that someone, support them. Not just in  voting, but attending rallies, putting up signs, maybe even volunteering for their campaign. That&#39;s building political capital, to be blunt about it, and after the election (a lot of small races happen in off-years, like this one) continue to follow them, and call/write their offices somewhat-regularly, and not only point out when they do wrong by you but also when they do good. That means continuing to follow them year after year, but making it clear your support is based on something sincere and not to push your demands) that could mean something, especially if they run for higher office later. (Or you can join a group of like-minded individuals who can persuade politicians on your behalf). That is tangible political capital money can&#39;t buy, but it takes work and it might not pay off, and you have to be reasonable in your expectations, but the more that do it, the better off we&#39;d be (more politicians listening to us rather than their donors and other elites making the decisions). </p>

If you removed the .0001% - .00001%, the true power, you&#39;d see that the remaining 1% is more like the rest of us than you think. I mean, what&#39;s the problem with success?</p>

Was their any kind of leadership or decentralized group of people working together to simultaneously overthrow the roughly 8000 people running shit? Sure there were bombshell leaks and people waking up, peoplle r still waking up and there r still bombshell leaks but there has to be a decentralized group that performs a coordinated attack of some kind...not necessarily violent but I wasn&#39;t aware of the closeness to the toppling of the regime....</p>

<p>Collectively we couldn&#39;t dedicate enough time, energy, or even attention required to initiate any sort of sustained action. OWS was a blip on the radar of the public consciousness easily trivialized and extinguished by the mainstream media. </p>

<p>I recommend listening to this podcast interview with Adam Curtis (of <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/the-century-of-the-self/">The Century of the Self</a> and <a href="http://thoughtmaybe.com/hypernormalisation/">HyperNormalization</a> fame. Towards the end of it he goes into a monologue about what change really means, to whom it means the most, and what people are willing or not willing to do to get it. Very eye opening.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want their money. I want them to suffer and beg for mercy.</p>

<p>No matter who we elect, it&#39;s always the same exact program from the same unelected Shadow Government goons. Bush, Obama, Trump. There&#39;s no difference. Either way, the Tomahawks get launched, the old military-industrial complex stock nearing the end of its shelf life gets cleared out, and random brown people die for reasons that aren&#39;t quite clearly explained.</p>

<p>Did you know that Libya had one of the highest standards of living in North Africa before we bombed the piss out of it? Did you know that Syria is one of the few countries where Muslims, Christians and Jews live in harmony? Did you know that the CIA was sending thousands of metric tons of ordnance worth billions of dollars to religious extremist lunatics who scream Allahu Akbar while shooting at Syrian Army tanks? Look it up. Operation Timber Sycamore. Trump just put an end to it, and the CIA got seriously pissed off.</p>

<p>That is a BGM-71 TOW missile. That is $60,000 of the American taxpayer&#39;s money, being manhandled by a psychotic who is shooting at the uniformed armed forces of a sovereign nation and their allies. Healthcare indeed. Our government cares enough about the health of the Syrian people that we arm foreign terrorists and mercenaries to brutalize them. If our government cares so little about basic decency, why should they care about the rest of us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah the occupy movement.  They didn&#39;t understand that these bastards try to control everything and were able to crush this movement.  They make our currency (money) and can make as much as they want, when they want it, for what ever purpose they want it for!</p>

<p>The most astounding purpose they use this &#39;money&#39; for is the payoff to the MSM whores!  How is it possible that Katie Couric gets a 10,000,000 salary!?  And how is possible that Steve Harvey gets millions in compensation!?  They can&#39;t build, grow or manufacture shit or clean anything.   I guarantee they will not say anything that goes against their master&#39;s plans.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me the issue of unity starts on simply agreeing on where to go from here. We are getting to a point where free speech is being challenged openly and even considered terrorism. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t believe the Nazi/KKK agenda is reasonable or even acceptable, but it starts the first page of censorship of free speech in America.</p>

<p>How can we unite groups that don&#39;t agree on an ideological level? Is it even possible? Or is the 99 percent always doomed to be divided naturally because charismatic leaders influence those that follow?</p>

<p>The idea has to be simple and agreeable by both sides of a conflict. Non-partisan issues are ones that concern people closest to this, but we are talking on an even simpler scale here. The vast majority of people won&#39;t agree on something that has their best interest at heart when someone like the 1 percent can convince them otherwise.</p>

<p>And this is the crux of the problem. Those that have amassed enough wealth to stifle competition do so by using wealth to influence those without it.</p>

<p>Until you can develop a system that takes decision making on a government level away from those in power there has to exist someone who will abuse that power. Our current controllers (if you will) are bankers, royal families, and unknown individuals that work off of human need or desire of wealth as oppose to virtue. Returning the government into a people&#39;s government involves many layers of convincing that simply can&#39;t be reached by those without funding. The idea of doing so requires an effort on everyones part working to see past the elaborate differences that set us apart in the first place. Finding common ground is difficult let alone finding a potential idea that can be agreed upon and moved towards.</p>

<p>I think the government needs to be taken out of the hands of humans and turned over to technology, return voting into a democratic standard, and not letting corporations get a hold on voter manipulation (this last one is difficult because of how invested corporations are in changing people&#39;s opinions).</p>

<p>But what do I know, I&#39;m just a bystander.</p>
