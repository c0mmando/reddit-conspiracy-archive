<p>You mean this military copter that melted worse than bldg 7 even though they are taught to crash into tree canopys in flight school and has 2 back up systems to locked rotors. And in addition it has fuel that is flame retardant so it doesnt do that.. yeah. Sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just dont get how it exploded anyway. I know they can catch fire but in a war zone its from the enemy weapon.. these things are made to do exactly what that pilot did. Land on a tree canopy and not burn. Their man danger in a crash from that height is definitely injury and death from impact but its super rare. Those have safety features galore. It likely coasted down even if the main rotor and both back ups failed. That fire is fucking insane. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call bullshit on the whole story. His plates. Her plates. Also us Jews may be zionists or elitists but not really Nazi&#39;s. I cant really link you how my rabbi looked it up but if google how we keep records and the utmost importance we have kept in it for 6000 years... at any rate that lady in the interview is either not Samantha Bloom or the kid they caught is not James Alex Fields but rather James Meyer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im sorry you feel that way. Its not a secret or urban legend. A persons mother decides if we can go to Israel anytime we want. And from our past.. thats a good option to have. I do wanna say i appreciate you talking to me and taking the time to draw that layout for me because it wasnt making sense. Im still inclined to believe there were 2 cars in this. I believe that family that posted someone of middle eastern decent was the driver. I find it more believeable that Mossad could pull this off than that kid. Because that heli crash has to be connected because a nation state of sorts would be involved to completely melt that heli. </p>
