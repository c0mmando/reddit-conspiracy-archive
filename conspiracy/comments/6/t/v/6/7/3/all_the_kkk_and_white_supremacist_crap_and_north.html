       might have to walk and chew gum at same time. If there is a larger assault on free speech occurring, that cannot be ignored (not necessarily speaking of the free speech of white supremacists, but of video producers who lack a platform, employees afraid to speak their mind, web users afraid to visit certain protest web sites, whistleblowers under attack from high ranking officials, and so on)

       Says the guy who has produced no evidence of new developments that the DNC hacked the elections. All you did was make a statement. Provide us with a link to a new development that is being covered up by all the KKK and NK Bull shit. Until then stop complaining about people calling you a shill with fake narratives.

       That narrative is tons more believable than yours though. The ones drumming up the North Korean situation was the government, so why would it be a distraction for the benefit of their political opponents?

       Project Veritas exposed the DNC underhanded and illegal activities during the 2016 US election. The DNC used hired agitators to mess with other parties rallies and meetings. There was also talk about organized voter fraud.

       These are admission

       Something like 44,000 of 150,000 ish voter rolls in LA County were supposed to have been removed/cleaned up etc but weren't last national election. That's 1 county in California alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in Cali they were posting lists of registered voters so people can walk in anx pick out a name.  In that 1 county you have a 33% chance of picking someone dead or moved away or duplicated if you are committing voting fraud.

       Most big elections are rigged.  There is too much at stake to not.  Politicians  and a lot of other jobs are simply a special club that only some people can get into.  Trump was able to game them out of it due to their recklessness with their information and help with the Russians and WS.  There is too much omission at the top that they got sideswiped.  I don't understand why they hate populism so much.  Its effects  are what is needed now post recession.

       While I admire the intentions here, how do you propose to go up against the mainstream narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are easily triggered and controlled by emotional stuff. When this starts to fade, it seems all too easy for them to highlight or orchestrate a replacement distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have thought that the last election would have been enough on its own to help people realize that the news is a complete and utter sham, regardless of who they voted for. But nope.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you wake people up to the simple idea that they are being fed an endless stream lies, and then wondering why they're still hungry for the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what if they prefer the lies and the drama to the truth that they've allowed themselves to be manipulated to the point where that which they think is real is not? The ones that they've placed their trust in most of their lives are really only there to abuse or feed off of them? What if they want to stay asleep or go back into the matrix where they can at least savor the false sensations of comfort and safety?

       Lol just let them be. You are seriously exacerbating the problem and fueling their beliefs even stronger. You can't change a persons thoughts, actions or behaviors. Example what happened recently. If they weren't met with an opposition. There wouldn't have been any fights or deaths. Let them exercise their rights, do their stupid parade and call it a day. Instead these other fucks tried to infringe on their RIGHTS and created chaos. Unbelievable how the oppostion dont see how they created all of it.

       <p>
        So, academia is indeed more liberal than America, just as other professions, such as the clergy and the military, are dens of conservatism. But where conservatives get it wrong, Gross says, is in their simplistic assertions that academia’s leftward lean is a result of bias or discrimination. Rather, he argues, academia is liberal because… it has been attacked for being liberal. Gross’s analysis concludes that the ivory tower’s well-known political reputation has encouraged a kind of self-selection effect, where conservatives gravitate away from it, and liberals towards it.

       Basically conservatives seem to think academics are inherently liberal, so they push away from it.

       Just wanted to say that in college i was a liberal. It was a honeypot for liberal ideas. But once I got out and got a real job my views drastically changed. Both my parents work in academia and are both flaming liberals. But I have learned that the old saying of "what you learn in college doesn't matter" stands true to the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       To simply say that liberals are more educated is exaggerated unless you are specifically talking about college education. Because there are multiple types of education and people can be smarter outside of the "common core".

       According to the second article -
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         An email was sent out by a foreign policy advisor suggesting meeting with the Russian government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was repeatedly refused by senior campaign officials.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Manafort refused the meeting.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There is no Russian collision. Open your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manafort may be guilty of other crimes (he has been under multiple federal investigations since 2014), or they may slap him with legalese bullshit in relation to this. But these emails prove, perhaps more than any evidence thus far, that this notion of Russian collusion is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today's "developments?" They don't effect Donald Trump or his legitimacy. He is your President. He will continue to be your President. It's time to move on.

       Do I think that Trump might have some conflicts of interest with Russia and did he and his team have some questionable meetings in ways that they shouldn't have, yes. Do I think this means that Russia hacked the election or directly did something to influence the election, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes specifically this comment was to point out that just because something else is dominating the headlines currently (only days after something happened), that does not mean that the media has given up on another narrative that they had been pushing. Its as if some people here just started watching the news this election cycle and had no idea what it was like before hand. This is typical news cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not a new concerted effort against neo-Nazis (et all), throughout the years there have been neo nazi rallies that got headlines for a couple days and then fizzled out. But those never ended with someone getting run down.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is  a difference now though. Because Neo-Nazis and KKK have held rallies regularly every year for as long as I can remember. But now the opposition is not tree hugging hippie boomers that are counter protesting, it is younger millennials who will scream and fight when someone opposes their views, ON BOTH SIDES.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while I do feel that the situations have shifted, I do not believe that the media has given up on any narratives they have been pushing simply because something else happened in the country that is national news.

       You know why it is imortant to smash any election rigging info? Because both sides need to be relatively equal and this would squarely put the right in an insurmountable lead. Because of this, TPTB are making sure to balance the scales as much as possible now.. On one hand, downplaying election rigging facts, and at the same time drumming up the support of the left by scarecrowing the alt right movement into something it is not.

       Over the last week other news included more information about the DNC leak/probably not a hack, N Korea backing down, China trade practices questioned, Another insurance company moves out of ACA area, Los Angeles City Council rushes vote to approve 2028 Olympic bid in which cost overruns are theirs/probably us taxpayers, China-India on brink of war, 2 car rammings weeks apart in France.
      </p>

       Don't get diverted, pay attention to other news and issues, especially now because the current news cycle is like a late night legislative session-people won't even know about until they wake up.
