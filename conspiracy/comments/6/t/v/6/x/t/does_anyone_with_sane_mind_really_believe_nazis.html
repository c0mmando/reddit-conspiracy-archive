       I mean honestly. What's the next 'big scary group'? The Ottoman Empire? Napoleonic Frenchmen? Get it together America. The only thing I find frightening is how effective these low effort scare tactics are on the general population.

       I know this is a joke, but did you know
       <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment/">
        the FBI also categorizes Juggalos a gang threat?
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most crimes committed by Juggalos are sporadic, disorganized, individualistic, and often involve simple assault, personal drug use and possession, petty theft, and vandalism. However, open source reporting suggests that a small number of Juggalos are forming more organized subsets and engaging in more gang-like criminal activity, such as felony assaults, thefts, robberies, and drug sales. Social networking websites are a popular conveyance for Juggalo sub-culture to communicate and expand.

       This is pretty much exactly what liberal Germans were saying during Hitler's rise to power. "No one actually supports this guy, he's crazy, his ideas will obviously fail." The fact is that a Nazi killed a woman on American soil this weekend and the president is up there saying "hey ya know both have their sides pluses and minuses" instead of "hey, don't commit terrorisitic acts or chant hate speech or shout slurs or try to intimidate minorities because I don't want the support of anyone who does. If you're in Charlottesville, marching in lockstep with a group hoisting Nazi flags, you've massively missed the point and are contributing in a gross act of indecency.

       What the fuck are you prattling on about? I'm making ICP jokes here and you gotta bust in all sliding the comments cause I got the top post? There has gotta be other places you can pull your hair out over Trump and receive the kind of response you desire more easily.

       Re-read this thread and ask yourself if your comments make any sense. This is a post about if the Nazis are a credible threat. Remember, the people who started the most catostrophic war of all time and set up death camps for 11 million people. This wasn't 300 years ago, it was when our grandparents were growing up. You made some dumb joke you continue to reference because I guess you care more about surface jabs than the very real fact that Nazi's killed an American this weekend. So yes, they are a credible threat. If you still think they aren't a credible threat, tell that to the person who was killed by one Saturday.

       I'm not gonna read this thread... I'm sure it is heaped high with steaming piles of "hot" comments... It's just one person... plus I'm white... I got nothing to fear from a bunch of Nazis. (Shhhhhh don't tell them I am Jewish! Cause if ya don't tell them they'll never know! Cause I look just like a regular white person!)

       It's not like those are real Nazis... you'll have my attention when a submarine busts out from under Antarctica and launches a swastika emblazoned missile at the whitehouse... cause then you'll know that it is
       <em>
        real

       Nazis... not a bunch of fat fuckin' posers.

       So you're not going to concern yourself with a problem until it sends a missile at you? So in your example, the Nazi's putting a submarine in the water with a missile on it wouldn't alarm you, it would only alarm you when they shoot it? Don't you think it would be too late by then? Do you see that pre-emptive planning and awareness is important to national safety? Do you see why it's important to stamp out these threats before they launch a missile somewhere?

       Nah... not concerned. Even if they fired the missile I wouldn't be concerned cause they ain't gonna aim it in my direction... but I'm a laid back kinda guy... I'd just be interested cause dude...

       Nazis... and they were hiding under the ice... that sounds badassed. Some fat fuck with a couple of nazi memes on his facebook smashing a car into a crowd of protesters ain't what I consider a real Nazi threat...

       It sounds like you think it's badass to be unprepared say 'fuck it lol' when a movement responsible for the deaths of millions crops up again. I'd encourage you to read more world history. Most major genocides and large-scale assaults were a result of being unprepared because they didn't take the threat seriously.

       Yup. Very easily too, only took 1 quick google search to find out the driver has been arrested, charged, and he even got denied bail too.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A judge denied bail Monday to an Ohio man accused of slamming his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one of them, during a white nationalist rally.
       </p>
       <p>
        James Alex Fields Jr., 20, appeared in Charlottesville General District Court by video conference, where a judge read out the charges that include one count of second-degree murder, several counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit and run.

       James Fields was driving that car, one woman died and others were hospitalized, and James Fields is in that picture wearing the vanguard america uniform with other white supremacists.

       These are objective facts. You can't refute or disprove any of them though, that's why you don't try.

       Prove to me Antifas were at Berkeley; could have been paid operatives in black masks and crisis actors getting punched. Prove to me Micah Johnson killed those cops; could have been a hired assassin who shot them, then drugged Johnson to talk and act guilty until he was blown up. Prove to me James T. Hodgkinson didn't have a chip in his skull commanding him to shoot those congresspeople. If nothing in reality is real, then what's the point of this post?

       An elegant example of why "white nationalists" are pushing the false flag narrative so hard. They need it to be false, so they can pretend to just be happy friendly neighborhood racialists, instead of violent racists.

       Yeah except that assertion falls completely flat when you realize the same people have debunked the past year's false flag's blamed on Muslims from ISIS as well.  So call me a Muslim-defending racist if you will.

       Same people? Uhhh, no. Maybe a small handful of them were. A shit-ton of them were busy talking about how Islam is an inherently violent religion, Muslims are hopeless savages, and that the entire culture needs to be wiped off the face of the Earth.

       I've been going at it with him for two days. He thinks it was fake, like, orchestrated. That the people who were hit were stunt men and that no one was hurt. Basically he doesn't want the Nazi guy to get blamed for it because he doesn't want the his fellow Nazis looking bad.

       So do you think Harry Potter is a Nazi? After all he appeared on a video screen in white supremacy attire and is clearly seen here doing a Nazi salute.

       Yes, Danielle Radcliffe is definitely a Nazi because he played one in a movie. And Christian Bale is Batman. And Tony Danza is a garbage picking field goal kicking Philadelphia phenomenon. Please, be genuine for once.

       The people you referred to as "Nazis" are pretty obviously paid agitators. My point is that just because it's presented on television doesn't make it true. The media have gone from demonizing ISIS, to Russians, and now back to the old tried-and-true Nazis.

       It's theater of the absurd. Probably a small percentage of people on both sides who really showed up to support their "cause," but almost entirely choreographed and staged.

       Not the original video I saw, but definitely shows the nonsensical nature of the fake fighting.

       Yeah you like conspiracies yet all you do is frantically discredit them. Been quite busy over the last few days, darting from thread to thread and moaning about Nazis. Obviously none of the "poles and shit" (hope you're not an English teacher) connect, and there are no injuries to speak of. Not to mention the cops don't intervene, another obvious giveaway that this is all fake, as if it could be more categorically proven at this point.

       As long as the video comes from someone on your side right? There's plenty of video showing Antifa and BLM violence against the Unite the Right protesters, the press and bystanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       This entire event was orchestrated by the DNC. Democrat Governor Terry McAuliffe fought the permit to hold this protest to remove the statue and when he was overturned by a Federal Judge, he set this event up with the help of Charlottesville's Democrat Mayor. The protest was mostly peaceful until Antifa and BLM showed up. That's when the Governor decided to overturn the Federal Judge and shut down the rally. The cops had barriers on 3 sides of the park and allowed Antifa and BLM, armed with bats, clubs, pipes, mace, homemade flamethrowers, water balloons filled with urine, chemicals and paint to fill the streets in front of the park. Then the police formed a line and used shields to push the two groups together and when fighting started, they just stood back and allowed it to happen. I'm not going to make any excuses for the guy who drove his car into a crowd of people. He is part of one of these white pride groups that I don't support but I certainly see how the events that led up to it, caused it to happen. Charlottesville police were there, State Police were there and the National Guard were there but none of these groups lifted a finger to stop the violence before it escalated. In fact, they instigated it, fueled the violence and then watched as innocent bystanders were beaten, maced and run over by a car.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't just watch the videos from websites or Youtube channels you agree with. There was violence on all sides but it was started by Antifa and BLM. They are hate groups the same as these White Pride groups. This was nothing more than an opportunity to sow more division and hate and use it to push their narrative and tie Trump to Nazis.

       That woman's death wasn't a concerted effort by any hate group. Also who the fuck thinks there should be something called "normal every day murder?" What the fuck is wrong with you.

       It was a guy who participated in the hate group rally a few streets over. Lol. You know what I meant by "normal every day murder." The terrible kind of thing that has been happening since humanity came to be.

       Oh I get it. Sort of like a man leaving Mosque and then blowing himself up to kill innocent women and children at the local bus stop due to his extremist views? That local mosque is responsible too right? We aren't each individually responsible for our own actions because our bias was reinforced by third parties. I get it.

       Was the local Mosque holding a service in which people were waving ISIS flags and chanting "Heil Al-Baghdadi"? If so, sure, they're too blame too.

       If it were a concerted effort by the White Nationalists to kill Antifa members I might agree with you on shared responsibility. Unfortunately the evidence doesn't support that theory and our justice system doesn't casually toss in admittedly bigoted or hateful people "for good measure."

       I answered you and changed the subject. Seems like you lack a proper response so I will ask you directly this time. How does a massive varying group of admittedly bigoted people bear responsibility for the death of a woman that was has in no way been shown to be premeditated or planned?

       The Quran does say that. Sharia law is an interpretation of those sentiments from the Quran and Hadith that is widely accepted.  You are still responsible as an individual to determine how you practice and enact those beliefs in a way that doesn't infringe on other people's freedoms and rights.

       Yes it was it just happened to be carried out by a single person who was radicalized by a hate group, probably several groups in field's case since he had been interested in extremist far right groups from a young age.

       You don't get to just say "he affiliated with them" therefore "they killed that woman." It's the very same as our previous comments on whether a Mosque promoted extremism or not in the case of suicide bombers. Guilt by association is an associative fallacy.

       Right, one person got killed.  How many people in Chicago alone were killed either deliberately or in the crossfire by someone not affiliated with a designated hate group.  I bet it was a lot, yet not a word on national news.  You can bet if a 'Nazi' coughed in Chicago it would be top news for a week.

       If you want to pretend that bringing up inner city violence, like you originally did, isn't used by racists as a distraction/deflection then I don't know what to tell you. Because racists do that. Which is why my comment is being upvoted and yours isn't. Because people acknowledge that my point is true.

       Nice backtrack, typical fucking liberal. Why don't you go protest in the South side of Chicago, where, what, 2000 people have died this year. You want to cry for one while girl versus thousands of blacks.

       Whatever dude, you better hope the people you work for don't find out that when someone mentions violence in a city you immediately say it's black people.  That's the kind of crap attitude that could destroy a career.

       You're the one that brought up race, and either way you missed the point.

       You sound like someone that lacks perspective, there are a lot of white people in Chicago too.  The fact that you immediately brought race into it shows me who you are.  Racist.  Stop trying to backtrack.

       You know damn well bringing up Chicago, like you did, is a common tactic among racists. You can keep pretending I'm the racist, but I'll politely remind you that YOU were the one who used a racist talking point. You can go through my posts the last few days and see what I support. Otherwise you're just trolling.

       Isn't this basically what the Joker said in the Dark Knight? Black people are killed by the tens of thousands in gang warfare and an even greater number of people are OD'ing to death on opioids and other shit......all part of the plan. White girl died at a protest and everyone loses their minds.

       Hundreds die every month on the streets of Chicago. How many children die in the hands of CPS? How children die in Yemen from American bombs? How many....oh you get what I'm saying. Essentially I'm not scared of Nazis and you shouldn't be either. Oh look it's lunch time. Time to eat with my multi ethnic, multi racial coworkers.

       Don't listen to cries of "whataboutism."  It is a tactic used to dismiss valid points 99% of the time. Look it up on wikipedia and read between the lines, this is exactly what it was introduced in to american politics for.

       I don't think anyone is legitimately scared of them anywhere. But I think the fact that we have fucking Nazi's in the US, 70 some odd years since the end of WWII is a bit concerned. I think people are a little flustered and frustrated that we haven't progressed to the point where being a Nazi should be socially unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't care, but I understand why some people are upset and giving them attention. But I am one to believe fringe hate groups shouldn't be getting air time at all. It just fuels their base and helps them recruit.

       Think the point is that you didn't earn it; your race isn't something you create. So, you're proud of something that happened to you by random chance of life.

       All power to you if that's what you wanna do. You're not a "nazi" for being proud of your random outcome of birth. Only if you insist your race is inherently better than others

       You are fully alloud to be proud of something you have little to no control over. Like proud to be an American or proud to be heterosexual or proud have a son. I wasn't saying I'm proud that I'm white btw just that I am white and I am also proud of my heritage. My original comment was mostly just being sarcastic or fasecious because I'm proud white American I must be a nazi.

       So how many generations of American does it take before I can say American? American ancestors. I mean eventually we are all a small handful of the same heritage if you want to go back far enough. I was born in America my mom was born in America her mom was born in America her mom was born in America her mom traveled the Oregon trail in covered wagon etc my fathers side is similar sure my grandfathers father was German and my grandmothers fathers mother was Hungarian but I am an American with American ancestors.

       Im sorry I dont know what to say. Im politely trying to say I think it sounds stupid to say Iam white and proud of my heritage or Im a proud white Amrrican. I didnt want to be insulting but I dont know how to say it politely I guess.
Say you are a proud American, or a proud German, or a proud German American and i wouldnt bat an eye. But do Canadians call themselves white Canadians? Ive never heard an African call himself a black African, or a white African for that matter. I hope this gets my point across without being to insulting

       I understand your point and agree to an extent. If someone can be racist against someone because they are black then someone could be racist against me because I'm white. Is white a race? How about black? Is black a race? You wouldn't hear people saying that there is a hate group who only hates Jamaican Americans. My point was to point out my skin color because to be proud of my heritage, and white I must be a nazi... I mean I know white isn't a race neither is black but people are racist against skin color not heritage.

       I mean thats why when back people hear white people say they are proud to be white they assume that person is a little racist.  Its a weird thing to point out unless you are part of a minority group. I dont think people that say that are racists, they just dont see it the same way that a minority would.

       I understand your point and agree to an extent. If someone can be racist against someone because they are black then someone could be racist against me because I'm white. Is white a race? How about black? Is black a race? You wouldn't hear people saying that there is a hate group who only hates Jamaican Americans. My point was to point out my skin color because to be proud of my heritage, and white I must be a nazi... I mean I know white isn't a race neither is black but people are racist against skin color not heritage.

       This is one danger in demonizing an ideology or a point of view.  Innocent people - people who don't even subscribe to that ideology get caught up in the angry wave and ruined when they haven't done anything wrong.

       I think when you focus the lens on just Nazis in America it seems far less scary but when you zoom out to White males committing acts of terrorism it is actually quite scary.
       <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/part-i-overview-terrorism-cases-2001-today/">
        And in most of these cases it's often a white nationalist.

      </p>
      <p>
       And if you don't want to read the article from 7 months ago the summary follows and the numbers have gotten bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three race hate crimes (8 victims)
Three botched robberies (4 victims)
Two church shootings (11 victims)
One Sikh temple shooting (6 victims)
Two anti-abortion shootings (4 victims)
Two anti-Jewish shootings (4 victim)
One domestic (3 police officers)
Three cop ambushes (6 victims)
A militia group that killed 3 of its own (3) ... and the guy that flew his plane into the IRS building.

      <p>
       Of the thirteen lethal jihadist terrorists in the United States since 9/11:

       three are African-Americans;

      <p>

       You realize that assaults on homosexuals in black communities is far higher than white communities, right?  Also targeting those that didn't vote the same way as you is
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       much higher in the anti-Trump crowd and black communities than it is in Trump supporting or white communities.

       Sorry. Back at work and wasting time on reddit. The above link is not pointing me to anything in particular. There's a lot of data and frankly if the specific "assaults on homosexuals in black communities is far higher than white communities" can't be pointed out to me directly ain't no body got time to wade through mountains of data.

       Yes, but not the Neo-Nazi's the media is talking about. Most of the people being labeled Nazi's today are Neo-Nazi's at best, and the vast majority of the Alt-Right are merely yesterday's centrists or libertarians and are not traditional Nazi's or even Neo-Nazi's. Most Alt-Righters probably aren't even racists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the real Nazi's, over 1,600+ actual German Nazi's were brought into the US by the CIA under Operation Paperclip shortly after WW2. Many of these Nazi's held ranking positions within three letter government agencies, and arguably help establish the Deep State in the US. They may have even had a hand in the assassination of JFK, Dr. Martin Luther King, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be foolish to assume these guys simply died out, they helped build everything from America's space program (NASA), furthered the military industrial complex, big pharma, and many of the forces that are now enslaving the American people. I mean hell even Lyme disease is linked to Nazi scientists which is potentially a biological weapon that was either accidentally or purposely released on the American population in the 1970's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very same law firms that helped launder money for the Nazi's pre-WW2 even backed Donald Trump's Presidential campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       So are there Nazi's today with significant influence, and power? Absolutely, but they're wearing ties, driving BMWs, and own significant interest in the military industrial complex, and even have ties to the media. They are members of the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Neo-Nazi's you see at these rallies are mostly disenfranchised poor white Americans who have ironically been subsidized by the very Nazi's they worship due to their misguided understanding of American and World history.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fairly common political tactic to accuse other people of what you're in fact guilty of. Much like Clinton pushing the whole Russian narrative when she actually has equal or more Russian ties than Trump. By pushing this Nazi narrative, the media can reclassify centrists, libertarians, and anyone who is a threat to them as Nazi's and over simplify the situation to the left to completely divert people from the truth that the real powers that be are the elite. This is divide and conquer to get people to fight each other, instead of the system responsible.

       Good post. I only want to say, in regards to your first mention of the 'Alt Right', when I first heard that term I thought it was awesome. I thought it described me. Fiscally conservative, small government, think identity politics has gone too far, smokes dope, worries about the environment, no religion, thinks guns are cool, and does not give a shit about anybodys race, kind of including my own. Maybe my first interpretation of that term was wrong, but this was long before the 2016 election.

       I don't think you were wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people in the Alt-right probably share very similar views as you, and are not inherently racist or immoral people. In fact, many of them are less violent than those on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue Antifa was probably more responsible for violence then anyone else, and there motivations can also be racially motivated against white people. So racism is happening on both sides really, and if anything it is almost more acceptable to be racist against a white person now then it is anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously someone who is waving a Nazi flag who isn't trolling and has racists beliefs is a Neo-Nazi, but I wouldn't consider them Alt-Right even though many on the left and in the media do.

       I think most in the Alt Right go beyond that, though. They might not be full-on Nazis, but they are definitely White Nationalists at best and White Supremacists at worst. All of their figureheads at this point advocate for an ethno state.

       There are essentially two Alt-rights at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of Alt-right are nationalist MAGA supporters. Some of them aren't even white, and the ones who are white are not arguing for an ethno state. Most of these people either labeled themselves Alt-right or were labeled by the media when they're actually centrists and libertarians. Even classical liberals are being labeled as Alt-right now. Most of these people are not racist, and while they believe in nationalism, they also support free speech, and civil liberties for everyone. They're mostly peaceful, nonviolent, and enjoy making memes, shit posting, and purposely countering the Alt-left's extremism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the other Alt-right, these are the white nationalists and white supremacists. They're a fringe extremist wing of the Alt-right, and do not represent the majority by any stretch of the imagination. The media is doing everything they can to associate the two groups as one single racist faction but that's absolutely a false equivalency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not supporting or defending either of these groups either, just stating reality as I've seen it. I'm an independent who voted 3rd party and certainly not a member of the Alt-right or Alt-left.

       I think that used to be the case more than it is now. You can't really deny, at this point, that the white nationalists won the use of the term. The term has been inextricably tainted by them. And, in fact, they're the ones who coined it in the first place. I agree with your assessment, though, during the early days of the campaign. That's how a lot of people, myself included, used it. Until I found out it's origins and who was increasingly being known as the term instead of what I thought it was.

       I would argue that shift wasn't the Neo-Nazis necessarily but the media trying to associate people in the right with Neo-Nazis.

       I do agree though that the term is tainted, and frankly I'm not opposed to the term Alt-left to describe the insanity happening on that side as well.

       These parts are the only ones consistent with the left. He sounds like a Libertarian. I used to think that what Alt Right meant back before the election too and I kinda liked it. Unfortunately, I was ignorant to it's origins and eventually the trolly funny mask of it came off and it's true nature revealed itself to me. That's when I went back to identifying as Libertarian.

       Name one fiscally conservative thing about a multi billion dollar wall, their healthcare "plan" or their trickle down economics. Small government my ass, look at all these abortion bills and bathroom bills, combine that with hatred of medical marijuana and it starts to look like big government is telling you what to do. Donald Trump is the literal identity politics candidate, he was a white business man, that was his ENTIRE list of credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
       He came out and said he was "tough on crime", he would bomb the shit outta terrorists, mexicans are rapists, he would bring back coal, he would stop "inner city" violence all of these things are exclusively "white fright" small town worries, backed up by the fact he was talking out of his ass with no actual plans. He even had people all dress the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you bring up identity politics against the left when this week the right held a literal white supremecy rally and wasn't shamed by the president you need to rethink what it means to be on the right here. The left won every single minority in the election and almost half of white people so I have a hard time believing there is a concise identity among them all.

       Yeah world domination which they've mostly achieved by subverting the rights of Americans and enslaving most of the world through globalism and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've long past accomplished their original Nazi intentions. Race and eugenics were only a fraction of the Nazi agenda, and way too many people get hung up on those two issues. Many of the Nazis actually believed they were creating a utopian society and system through social engineering which is exactly what social media and mainstream media have accomplished in modern America.

        The Neo-Nazi's you see at these rallies are mostly disenfranchised poor white Americans who have ironically been subsidized by the very Nazi's they worship due to their misguided understanding of American and World history.

       Hell, look at the whole illegal migration situation. Most of these people attack the the actual migrants who come to the US, but they never put pressure/boycott the actual corporations/business owners who freely bring them in.

       Not Nazi's per say... but there's an ugly racist undertone to who gets called a terrorist. I would suggest that white racism among the general population serves to legitimize military industrial violence against poor brown people, when in reality the oligarchy just wants to steal a countries national resources.

       NAZIs are just a proxy for fascism: "you're either for us or against us" as the Bush administration famously said. The idea is always creeping in the background of any society. The notion of "pure blood" is a natural extension of the tribal mind.

       You clearly don't understand the differences. Nazism is a violently racist, expansionist political ideology which has hatred built into it. Completely irreconcilable with liberalism
      </p>
      <p>
       Napoleonic France was built upon liberalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So comparing the two is just very ignorant of the facts.

       Who's to say the nazis were even bad??? According to my research, the nazis were fighting Zionist globalism, and the holocaust was nothing more than a holohoax. Hitler had the most diverse army in the world and a bunch of other things that completely contradict the western worlds interpretation of him.

       The groups walking on the street,  no,  but if you know your history,  what happened after WWII,  when Nazis were brought into the CIA and State Department,  well,  Nazi techniques were implemented by the US intelligence,  foreign service,  and military.    Oh,  and NASA.

       So,  don't forget your history.

       Because it is the population that has already enabled the desolation of the people and their homes,  cities,  jobs,  everything in places like Iraq,  Libya,  Syria.   Nobody wants to consider that there will be a price,  that this genocide will come home to roost,  IS coming home to roost.

       In America? hell no. In Europe? Yes, they are actually a threat. Old Nazi(rebranded) and neo-nazi groups are getting more and more power, mainly in Eastern Europe and the poorest countries of europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part? They are supported by the EU and America to fight against the russian influence. The hypocrisy is astounding.

       Good post. I only want to say, in regards to your first mention of the 'Alt Right', when I first heard that term I thought it was awesome. I thought it described me. Fiscally conservative, small government, think identity politics has gone too far, smokes dope, worries about the environment, no religion, thinks guns are cool, and does not give a shit about anybodys race, kind of including my own. Maybe my first interpretation of that term was wrong, but this was long before the 2016 election.

       Blows connected man. They're even using poles and shit as weapins. Have you ever been in a fight, especially in a giant crowd like that?
Not every punch connects, and not every punch knocks people out, lol.

       Yeah you like conspiracies yet all you do is frantically discredit them. Been quite busy over the last few days, darting from thread to thread and moaning about Nazis. Obviously none of the "poles and shit" (hope you're not an English teacher) connect, and there are no injuries to speak of. Not to mention the cops don't intervene, another obvious giveaway that this is all fake, as if it could be more categorically proven at this point.

       Anyway, I've been a Redditor for several months less than you and have over 2,000x more comment karma, so you obviously suck at this and I'm not the only one you annoy with your persistent stalking and obfuscation.

       Don't listen to cries of "whataboutism."  It is a tactic used to dismiss valid points 99% of the time. Look it up on wikipedia and read between the lines, this is exactly what it was introduced in to american politics for.

       Hell, look at the whole illegal migration situation. Most of these people attack the the actual migrants who come to the US, but they never put pressure/boycott the actual corporations/business owners who freely bring them in.

       Re-read this thread and ask yourself if your comments make any sense. This is a post about if the Nazis are a credible threat. Remember, the people who started the most catostrophic war of all time and set up death camps for 11 million people. This wasn't 300 years ago, it was when our grandparents were growing up. You made some dumb joke you continue to reference because I guess you care more about surface jabs than the very real fact that Nazi's killed an American this weekend. So yes, they are a credible threat. If you still think they aren't a credible threat, tell that to the person who was killed by one Saturday.

       I'm not gonna read this thread... I'm sure it is heaped high with steaming piles of "hot" comments... It's just one person... plus I'm white... I got nothing to fear from a bunch of Nazis. (Shhhhhh don't tell them I am Jewish! Cause if ya don't tell them they'll never know! Cause I look just like a regular white person!)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like those are real Nazis... you'll have my attention when a submarine busts out from under Antarctica and launches a swastika emblazoned missile at the whitehouse... cause then you'll know that it is
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       Nazis... not a bunch of fat fuckin' posers.
