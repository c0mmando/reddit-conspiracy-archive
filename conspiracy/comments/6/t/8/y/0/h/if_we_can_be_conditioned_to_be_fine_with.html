<p>What are &quot;values&quot; even worth if they&#39;re nothing but habits?</p>

<p>And is that true?</p>

<p>Is that what conditioning does? Or is it rather that conditioning makes us comfortable with a THOUGHT through trickery while we still feel in our guts that something is &quot;wrong&quot;?</p>

<p>Edit: But then, what if our gut feeling itself is part of the conditioning? What is there to rely on? Is there anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see someone test that theory.  Not being sarcastic.  No matter the result I would find it fascinating to see what would happen to someone who full-heartedly doesn&#39;t believe gravity will effect them if they jump off a building.</p>

<p>This is my take on things.  Just because we can be conditioned, doesn&#39;t mean that the feeling we feel under that conditioning is genuinely coming from inside us.   What I mean is that people can be coerced into a certain structure of beliefs if they feel a large group of people are part of that same belief system.  We humans are naturally social creatures, we wanna feel acceptance.  We want it so badly that a lot of us will compromise our moral compass in exchange for acceptance.  A great example of this is the American attitude towards our military.  You will find the vast majority of the public has been duped into believing that the military is a fundamentally good, and necessary organization.  Few people question this belief because of how many people believe it.  When all your friends and neighbors believe the same thing as you do, you&#39;re going to be a lot less likely to question the things you believe because if you do the result is social ostracization.  Wanna see me say believe again?  Believe.</p>

<p>Anyway, my point is that we are not living in a world where there is no truth, we are living in a world where the truth is hidden from us and we are fed a false narrative by the people who have all the power in order to keep us docile and manipulatable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I would think that it&#39;s meant in a way that if you really stop &quot;believing in gravity&quot;, you likely exit this plane of existence (as a lot of other things dependent on that belief no longer work) and nobody will actually see you fly here. This would also explain why &quot;supernatural&quot; stuff doesn&#39;t really happen a lot to people here (or is not generally believed in). Maybe the, say, collective belief system of this plane of existence simply is one that we could call &quot;rational&quot; or &quot;physical&quot; and doesn&#39;t allow for certain things to happen. But if you were to analyze this belief fully and take all its consequences into account, you would just leave and go to a place without this restriction.</p>

<p>Now the really interesting question (if we hypothetically assume all this to be true) is: What happens when &quot;you&quot; leave? Does your self disappear?</p>

<p>And I think no. I think what happens is that a version of &quot;you&quot; stays here, but this version will never be successful in the endeavor to &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;deactivate gravity&quot;. So you haven&#39;t really exited per se ... you have just transferred your consciousness to a different version of &quot;you&quot; in a place where flight is possible.</p>

<p>All just funny speculation of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, life matters and truth exists.  Karma is a universal law that we have mostly forgotten by turning it into physics.  Dependent origination and the interconnectedness of all things are real.  You can rely on your own understanding, after removing conditioned thoughts by meditation.  </p>

<p>You are asking questions far too deep for even most &#39;awake&#39; people to ever seriously attempt to tackle in their own minds.</p>

<p>Nietzsche is quoted as saying:</p>

<p><em>He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.</em></p>

<p>I take this to mean that we ought to check ourselves, check our own motivations for asking questions which get us down. If we focus on the &#39;darkness&#39; we may become it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. But if that thought were indeed truth ... that would mean monsters don&#39;t exist and we can not be truly awake without stopping to distinguish between monsters and non-monsters. Just IF, of course. It doesn&#39;t seem quite right to me either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is reversion.    Study a bit of Carl Jung.    Study the fall of the Soviet Union.    Brainwashing only goes so far because when it get too far out of touch with the fundamentals of life,  it comes crumbing down,  reversion.    Even today,   as Google went too far over the line towards a mono-culture ideology,  there is backlash.    The pendulum swings,  sometimes violently.</p>
