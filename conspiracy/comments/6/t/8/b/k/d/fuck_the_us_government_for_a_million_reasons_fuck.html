        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m just a guy who never saw the Trump-Russia hysteria as anything more than a media circus pandering to the lowest common denominator. I stayed objective, read the articles, and clicked back looking for sources and undeniable evidence*. And I never found any being objectively presented to me. </p>

<p>Maybe I am wrong, I will openly admit that. But you know what, I am so fucking tired of being immediately and lazily attacked as a Trump supporter every time I question anything related to it. I am sure a lot of other people feel the same way. And that is the point of this post. So let me put this part in bold for the lazy:</p>

<p><strong>I did not start this thread to create a comment section full of reasons I should believe Trump-Russia. I started this discussion for the people tired of being attacked and labelled as a Trump supporter or member of &quot;T_D&quot; or a Russian shill. Labels immediately thrown at them because they feel like taking a step back before blindly joining the hysterical crowd.</strong> </p>

<p>(Also, I purposely waited until the weekend to post this because it seems to me that hundreds of both anti- and pro- Trump talking points suddenly slow down their attack on this subreddit during weekend hours, almost as if entire teams of people leave work on Friday.)</p>

<p>edit: * since this word is being harped on and misrepresented, understand the difference between undeniable <em>evidence</em> and undeniable proof. </p>

<p>Quite literally. He has absolutely no evidence, so he&#39;s going to force people to testify for hours at a time, hope they make a mistake.</p>

<p>Oh look, it&#39;s the guy I busted lying the other day. Remember when you said you have had comments get downvoted 10 times in a few minutes so they can&#39;t be seen &quot;lots of times&quot; and then I looked at your history and you had barely 25 comments, and only one comment that had been dowvnoted below -4?</p>

<p>u/Chuck_Rogers, everybody.</p>

<p>Because he&#39;s wasting his time trying to hang people with extensive, nitpicky grand jury testimony. Any evidence of hacking would have already been found under a FISA warrant, since it&#39;s electronic. You don&#39;t need, and don&#39;t want a grand jury taking testimony under those circumstances.</p>

<p>Mueller&#39;s investigation isn&#39;t solely into hacking, not even close.</p>

<p>Follow the news and you wouldn&#39;t look like such a fool.</p>

<p>FISA is surveillance, not hacking per se.</p>

<p>It&#39;s even in the acronym but I wouldn&#39;t expect you to be familiar with that, going on what you post now.</p>

<p>Here is a tip, when you can use your brain for less than 30 second and spit out an excuse like &quot;There are no shills working 9-5 office hours because, like, regular people use the internet at work and also leave on Friday! Wow, its so easy to figure out!

    <div class="md"><p>this sub is supposed to be a refuge for those seeking to explore tooics that get one branded a loon, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>trump-russia et al is a congressional and criminal investigation that people can and are talking about ad nauseum in every mainstream forum, be it reddit, WAPO, fb, twitter. this is not a conspiracy for the purposes of this sub. it is news of the day, mainstream news of the day.</p>

<p>that you don&#39;t have your mind made up about has nothing to do with it being a true conspiracy. conspiracies are where those in power perpetrate deceptions on the masses to entrench their power and &quot;train,&quot; demoralize, divide, and diminsh the masses. </p>

<p>this is not a situation of the powerful against the powerless. it is a situation of power against power. if all is true, all that was done was one candidate exposing the corruption of one candidate. no one has ever claimed the information released was false. no one has ever claimed that votes were flipped. poltical bribes and corruption are the way our govt works. this isn&#39;t even news. it is an axiom. </p>

<p>polls show americans do not care about this at all. if it were a true conspiracy, americans would be freaking out--if 9/11 was proved to have been the govt colluding with silverstein, the NY port authority, juliani, and isreal, and SA to commit insurance fraud and establish casus belli for the exhumation of NATO and furtherance of foruegn policy goals antithetical to american values and interests, shit would get real, real fast.</p>

<p>B. The scenario of &quot;false pretenses&quot; still brought the Trump team to the table. So lil Donny either attempted to collude, failed, and lied about it until he was pressured into releasing the emails. Or he attempted to collude, succeeded, and lied about it. Those are literally the only two options. Your boy got an email that said, &quot;we have dirt on your opponent that we want to give you as part of the Russian Government&#39;s efforts to help your father,&quot; and he took the fucking meeting.</p>

<p>I mean this in all sincerity, without deflecting to some Clinton crap, tell me how that isn&#39;t, at minimum, attempted collision with the Russian government.  </p>

<p><em>attempted</em> collusion bro. Learn to read man. You don&#39;t need a criminal investigation to see if someone tried to do something. You can literally read the emails for yourself. It&#39;s the basic premise of &quot;To Catch a Predator.&quot; Whether or not they technically committed a crime is one thing, the conversations and the fact that they showed up to the meeting clearly show their intent to at least attempt collusion with the Russian government, which they vehemently denied (a lie). I&#39;m not speaking to the legality of the actions, because the investigation will do that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people did not declare, even though they had substantial ties and pretty clear cases of influence peddling (money for policy). Most of the Trump people I have seen get over trouble for Russian ties are on the level of not declaring conversations in hall ways while travelling between meeting rooms, or passing Russian people on the streets while getting hamburgers from street vendors.</p>

<p>If they find substantial connections, then they absolutely should prosecute, but all I&#39;ve seen so far has been a media circus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you have no evidence afeter 8 months of deepstate investigation including spying/unmasking and the resources of every fake news outlet...

<p>Your main evidence is being hidden from FBI investigations and recently there are reports that it is a leak and not a hack due to transfer speeds..</p>

<p>Yopur best argument is that don jr was contacted by a Russian that said they had dirt on Clinton... he went to the meeting and left after 30 minutes... emails have been released and it appears he broke no law..</p>

Manafort and Ukraine and Flynn and Turkey.. aren&#39;t you sick of being wrong and lied too?  and to top it off there is much more concrete evidence tying Clintons to Russia...

<p>He was part of the campaign.</p>

<p>Pretty often. They go for evidence. They don&#39;t always go for arrests.</p>

<p>How often do you get undeniable evidence on anything posted here? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the time. You seem to believe that when I said &quot;undeniable evidence&quot; I am asking for &quot;undeniable <strong>proof</strong>&quot;. These are two separate things entirely. </p>

<p>Like for 9/11, I have a video of WTC7 falling into its own footprint. That is undeniable evidence of a building collapsing. Do you understand now, that is a piece of evidence to add to my collection when trying to see the larger conspiracy.</p>

<p>For the Apollo moon landing conspiracy, I have a video clip of astronauts faking a shot of Earth from inside of the shuttle. You could certainly say they are just &quot;goofing around&quot; but again, that footage is an undeniable piece of evidence.</p>

<p>All I have read about the Trump-Russia &quot;conspiracy&quot; is &quot;here is this person lying about....&quot; but the definition of lying in those cases is being chosen by the people dictating the narrative.</p>

<p>I read &quot;anonymous sources claim to have heard...&quot; and again, that is not hard evidence.</p>

<p>The idea that there is no undeniable <strong>evidence</strong> of &quot;anything posted&quot; in r/conspiracy is complete and utter bullshit and I honestly find it extremely interesting that you would reach the top of a thread stating something that wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in your last post, you suggested that Russia would prefer Trump because they thought Hillary would bring them to war with the US. There&#39;s also the fact that Don Jr didn&#39;t bat an eye when told about the Russian government&#39;s efforts to help his dad&#39;s campaign. And if you spent any time watching Russian state media during the election, you would have seen a huge pro-Trump bias.</p>

<p>India was overwhelmingly pro trump. As was Syria Greece, Hungary, Poland. I&#39;m sure there were more countries that celebrated trump winning. If you want to add Russia, fine. But it doesn&#39;t mean trump is pro Russia, or India, or Greece, etc...</p>

<p>What efforts, and did those efforts lead to anything of substance that would suggest Russia helped trump directly?</p>

<p>No substance = no need to bat an eye </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America is a country run by a cabal of murderous dictators.</p>

<p>I do not disagree that their motives should be questioned. Neither should Israel&#39;s, or China&#39;s. (In case you&#39;re going to ask, both are nations who also have significant influence on America, and who would stand to gain from keeping her down. Same as Russia.)</p>

<p>Vigilance is important. But Vigilance is not the same as blind-stupid, parrot-like Patriotism.  &quot;Russia + Trump = Bad for America&quot; should really be refocused to &quot;Foreign National Interests or Domestic Private Interests + Corrupt Politicians = Bad for America.&quot;  And we should be focusing all this media-manufactured hate at ALL of them.</p>

<p>And all the &quot;deflection&quot; in here is probably a healthy dose of actual deflection, but try thinking refocusing like I suggested. If you want to remove corrupt politicians from their compromised places of influence and power, why would you only focus on one part? The hardest part to deal with, no less?  IF this could be rebranded from Trumpssia Vs. Democrats, to Citizens Vs. Corruption in Politics, entire gangs of criminals could be removed. Or do you think that a thorough investigation of the DNC shenanigans, resulting in arrests and eye-opening revelations about what politicians can get up to when no one is looking, would just stop at the DNC&#39;s involvement in the 2016 election?  Could it galvanize the people to go after more and more corruption, getting more and more outraged as the revelations come pouring in until finally they have enough dirt to take down the king?  </p>

<p>This is where I am coming from when I mention things like &quot;ya, well the Clinton camp has been overly-friendly with the Russians for a long time, let&#39;s go after that too.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a Trump supporter, and I haven&#39;t denied that they&#39;ve pursued a mutually beneficial relationship. But what&#39;s wrong with them doing so? I don&#39;t believe the argument was ever one of whether or not they have made attempts to get along. Putin is on video during the campaign saying that if we elect Clinton then we&#39;re essentially asking for a shit show between the two of us. And I, for one, would prefer to be allies with Russia.</p>

<p>I think the real conspiracy, is how often the media blames everything on Russia, and attempts to make America out to be a perfect flawless country and government. Regardless of how fucked Russia may be, the U.S. isn&#39;t exactly the pinnacle of governments either. And I just wish we would start taking responsibility for the fucked up shit that we&#39;re doing as a country.</p>

<p>This is pretty anecdotal. And grouping all of his supporters into one person making a claim isn&#39;t really fair.</p>

<p>Your memory of it doesn&#39;t really affect whether or not it happened, which it done. It&#39;s definitely happened a lot more since the election. However, as the recent video leaks have proved, this is because MSM knew that it got them ratings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not so much glorifying America, as it is sweeping our problems under the rug and our media using other countries as the scapegoat for our things we&#39;re responsible for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about, or even really related to it.</p>

<p>The point I&#39;m making is that is is related to it. If you take a step back and look at the bigger picture, it would partially explain why the media manipulates information about other nations.</p>

<p>No honest user here(most of which have no political or bi-partisan affiliation,) weren&#39;t saying that Trump wouldn&#39;t consider foreign help in our election.</p>

<p>The true talking point in this sub amongst honest users were that to the effect of bullshit the MSM media was feeding us about the Russian story.</p>

<p>At first Russia &quot;hacked&quot; our elections. They had no evidence. The &quot;sources&quot; were dry.</p>

<p>Then they moved to Russians hacked the DNC servers, and leaked to wikileaks. Which influenced the outcome of the election. Again, entirely false. Podesta leaks were a phishing scam that Podesta fell for like and idiot. The second DNC leaks, most evidence points towards an internal leak. </p>

<p>Now the MSM is pushing a collusion theory. It is just one cabal taking it to another. One government trying to influence another governments election.  </p>

<p>Do you believe that the DNC was not approached by foreign governments/institutions/persons willing to help their cause?</p>

<p>That is an undeniable piece of evidence proving what exactly? </p>

<p>Willingness to collude with a foreign power to influence elections. End. Of. Story.</p>

<p>Same reason you can be charged</p>

<p>Not a lawyer, but you know citizens can be charged for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)">intent</a> to commit a crime, right? Don Jr.&#39;s email with the Russians constitutes one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overt_act">overt act</a>, evidence in which intent can be inferred.</p>

<p>Sorry, you don&#39;t get to say it doesn&#39;t. You want Trump to stay in power so you dismiss his intent to collude as unimportant. That you don&#39;t want to accept their guilt is <strong>your problem</strong>.</p>

<p>The entire rest of your comment is a list of whataboutisms.</p>

<p>But what the trump jr emails provided was evidence that Kushner had left out details about meetings that he should have disclosed. During the time this meeting was being planned Trump Sr promised a crowd he would have evidence outlining Clinton&#39;s crimes by the following week...the emails are undeniable evidence of where he planned to get this information.  </p>

<p>The Russia election hacking collusion narrative may not hold much water, but why did these guys &quot;forget&quot; about meeting with a &quot;Russian government connected lawyer&quot; (even if it turns out she wasn&#39;t, this is how it was sold to trump jr). Why would trump jr lie about the purpose of the meeting (saying it was about adoptions prior to releasing his email chain). </p>

<p>It might not be anything major, but I wouldn&#39;t say it should be ignored. It is worth someone taking the time to look into.</p>

<p>R - The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.</p>

<p>R - This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.</p>

<p>TJ - Seems we have some time and if it&#39;s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.</p>

<p>R - Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.</p>

<p>TJ - Thanks rob appreciate you helping set it up.</p>

<p>TJ - It will likely be Paul Manafort (campaign boss) my brother in law and me, 725 Fifth Ave 25th floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are over the Pacific Ocean, you won&#39;t see any continents either, rabbis primarily water anyway. You just don&#39;t see many images published of just the Pacific Ocean because there is nothing to see, but go on google maps and you can find many views of most of the earth where you can&#39;t see almost any land</p>

<p>You can&#39;t see stars because of the contrast, try pointing your camera at a star lit sky with the moon focused and you won&#39;t see any stars either.</p>

<p>As for the light, I don&#39;t really have an explanation other than possibly glare or a piece of the vehicle out of the window, but having most of the claims debunked really doesn&#39;t make me second guess that one.</p>

<p>The point was to show two polar opposites and to show how one would not be attached to the other in any way, shape or form.  To show how you wouldn&#39;t bother comparing them.  You do understand the point of the comparison, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>The fact you&#39;re here to tell people how they should be and how they should be approaching things strange to me.  Just out of curiosity......wait, having you been drinking?  Is this just you breaking out and showing a little frustration being a mod here?  Sick of the process and need a change?</p>

<p>Seems like you&#39;ve gone to a place where you&#39;re on a warpath of sorts now.  Like, I don&#39;t tell you what you need to do with your time.  I don&#39;t say you should do more to &quot;understand&quot; and mock you when I feel you haven&#39;t hit a point where I feel you&#39;re on the same level as I am.  I don&#39;t, but here we are on r/conspiracy and one of the mods is telling me that I should be &quot;better&quot; or I won&#39;t have a sense of what is going on.</p>

<p>JCP, I remember when you arrived.  You were always a person who posted with respect and this is coming across as the opposite.</p>

<p>Normal user responses: </p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about? All the intelligence agencies confirmed this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course Trump and Russia were working together. Putin is a warmonger/tyrant&quot;</p>

<p>Shill responses:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so you think the government just made all of this evidence up because they don&#39;t like your precious Drumpf? Go back to you safe space!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How much is Putin paying you to say that?&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re just grandstanding with a bunch of moot points. Its no question this subreddit has gone to shit post election when all it focuses on is how Trump is trying to take down the &quot;deep state&quot; 24/7 and how Hilary is to blame for giving Seth Rich secret pizza.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually a lot of these things are highly nuanced, and you&#39;ve been caught up in the MSM narrative. If you listened to Bernie speak last year, he didn&#39;t want Open Borders, he just wanted immigration, the thing this country was founded on, to continue. And not illegal immigration. And yes, a path to citizenship is an important idea on the Left, because these illegals are already paying taxes and are established members of their communities, better for all of us to integrate them into our social fabric like they already are, rather than have jack booted thugs deport 11 million or more people, creating a whole new service branch of government (as Trump alluded to during the campaign). Second amendment rights are also all over the board- I personally own a gun and would never give up that right. How can I entrust the government to run Healthcare if I don&#39;t have the means to enforce that trust? Bernie&#39;s stance was very nuanced, accepting that large cities will want gun control, but stating that states like Vermont couldn&#39;t have the same regulations because of geography and culture. And the statement that the left is anti- 1st amendment is also establishment divisiveness. True leftists, your average American Liberal even, do NOT want that. You are buying into MSM propaganda. We can and must work together to destroy the establishment so we can then have meaningful debates about how government should function. At the moment the Republican and Democratic parties are simply two tools of the Oligarchic ruling class, used to subvert the will of the people and cause infighting so we never question those in true power, like the party bosses, billionaire donors, and corporations. You and I aren&#39;t enemies, you need to snap out of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You replied so fast you either didn&#39;t read my response or didn&#39;t care. Bernie is a Social Democrat- that means Capitalism still exists, but markets that fail citizens the most, like Education and Healthcare, are nationalized.

We are both being oppressed by the establishment and their propaganda and censorship. The anti-establishment Left is on the March, as exemplified by Bernie, and the anti-establishment Right is on the march, as exemplified by Trump. This scares the shit out of the establishment, and is why they are attacking both sides. We must work together to see our way through this. We are NOT each others enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie is a Social Democrat as far as policy goes, his career is consistent with that. And Socialism has never lead to Communism- the two have been conflated, and tried, but neither has ever even been put into actual practice due to technological and human constraints. Bernie isn&#39;t your enemy my friend- just because he wants Healthcare and Education for all citizens. He&#39;s not a Communist, and he doesn&#39;t advocate seizing the means of production overnight- although he does envision a future in which real Democratic Socialism may come about with proper social and technological advances.

<p>Like a Sharblue shill trying to pose as a conservative that is super stupid and a fucking asshole to make independent thinkers not want to side with conservatism/trump because they don&#39;t want to associate with ppl with such low character as yourself</p>

<p>Mods please note:  not calling this guy a shill, just trying to point out to him that he his hurting the team he claimed ma to play for by being so abrasive </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man. Hijacked by communism? You are deep in the establishment kool-aid my friend. There are no true communists in the Democratic Party today lmao- I&#39;m sorry if you believe that. There&#39;s almost no real Socialists either. True Leftists and true Liberals being hard line Communists...I don&#39;t think you know what that term means. No one is advocating a vanguard party to nationalize all production and begin paving the way towards communism. No one is advocating that all industry be democratized overnight- which would be socialism. You need to see past this. We aren&#39;t each others enemies, the establishment wants us fighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;m not advocating for the establishment by having a nuanced view on something that defies easy categorization. People are shills because they aren&#39;t allowed to point out the difference between Communism and Socialism? Did you know Marx even thought there was a difference? He DESPISED Socialists. This isn&#39;t some easy conversation friend, with easy labels. There&#39;s nuance, words MEAN things, ideologies mean things and are very different in practice. I&#39;m not your enemy, you need to see that. Your hatred of the Left as individual people is playing right into the establishments hands, you must see past it. If you really believe I&#39;m a shill, then that&#39;s unfortunate, because I&#39;m just trying to widen your view and show you that as a fellow American I&#39;m not your enemy, we may have different political ideologies but were both being censored and screwed by the establishment. I hope one day you can see that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>until the USSR collapsed in the 1990s, leftist conspiracy theorists were branded as communists working on  behalf of the USSR to overthrow the USA and hand it over to kruschef. it was used to deligitimize the real left, anti-war activists, union organizers, whistleblowers, true investigative journalists, foriegn news sources.</p>

<p>if it wasn&#39;t so sad, that the tables have turned and being a conspiracist now brands you as a facist russian sympathizer bent on handing the USA to putin, would be delicious for those of us on the left that the right stalked, harrassed, blacklisted, imprisoned, ruined etc from WW1 until 1992 (i&#39;m genX, i spent the 1980s being spat on with &quot;love it, or leave it.&quot; my gut tells me the top-kekers would have been among them). but it is sad, and you&#39;ll notice those of us on the real left are not gloating (whether you believe it or not we&#39;re on the front line of being targeted again). </p>

<p>you would think after all this time TPTB would be able to find a new evil empire...russia ought to take pride in our irrational fear of it.</p>

<p>fwiw, one reason some older voices (older than mine) on the real left object to 9/11, sandy hoax, the moon non-landing, and JFK, is because the CIA&#39;s weaponization of &quot;conspiracy,&quot; was used against the left beginning with JFK. during this time the the left was working on exposing COINTELLPRO, mosadeq, allende, iran-contra, guns for coke, tonkin etc, they saw alien and JFK conspiracy theories as attempts by the CIA to completely discredit them. this is why they reject all mass grief conspiracies, like 9/11 and sandy hoax,  they see them merely as honey pots to discredit them.</p>

<p>find the conservative sites that have been disappeared by google. those on real left (not the 3rd way, the DLC, the bernieites, the liberals/progressisives, the democrats), is being objectively documented. </p>

<p>The funny thing is that it was a debate over a piece of health information, for which I had research citations, medical journal support, and so on.  A well-grounded and factual argument.  The response?  &quot;Arguing with you is like arguing with Trump supporter.&quot;</p>

17 AGENCIES became 3 agencies, became a small group of hand-picked (red flag) people at 3 agencies working together in a report where no one claimed certainty. This report was mostly just complaining about RT with the only &quot;evidence&quot; being what was provided by Crowdstrike. Crowdstrike&#39;s evidence was not especially convincing, especially after the issues with their attribution in prior cases involving Russia.</p>

<p>People are rightly concerned that our entire foreign policy is being shaped by poor, unconfirmed and disputed &quot;evidence&quot; that was provided by a party with severe conflicting interests, about an organisation that has been CAUGHT lying to and defrauding their supporters and has every motive to miss-attribute said crime.</p>

I will defend him against the idiots or ignorant fools who use the Trump-Russia allegations, because that&#39;s just made-up by the lying media corporations (msm).

The DNC&#39;s corrupt upper echelons, along with some GOP members, have created this mess. But this &quot;mess&quot; has been festering since the day the Federal Reserve was put into power. Pres.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You did it. You have 100% of all the evidence right in front of you, because you are connected to every agency on the planet. You analyzed all that information with hundreds of other people, and you now know the results. You aren&#39;t just some government employee doing the &quot;Come on guys, I mean come on, come on! I mean, for real, come on! Come on! Emotions! More emotions! There are zero scientists who are able to go &#39;You know what, I have a feeling, and therefore I am right!&#39; and be taken seriously, but I am different, so rather than using critical thinking and getting rid of bias, you should just assume that everything is under control.&quot;</p>

<p>The US government has been making deals with China, Israel, Russia, Great Britain, Germany, Mexico, etc for the last 100 years, and all these deals sell out Americans, but it all magically stopped in 2016. We did it. We got the honest guy in there. I believe everything that was posted here. We should just think with our emotions. I mean, come on, how could there possibly be any other way?  There are thousands of people being paid to manipulate public opinion, but this definitely isn&#39;t one of those posts. A billionaire aristocrat would never do that. That would be crazy. Name one world where that would happen? Oh yeah, there aren&#39;t any. I can just keep saying the same thing over and over, and I am not really saying anything at all, but the more words I use the more credible I will seem. </p>

<p>Look at that! hundreds of people agree with you too! The propaganda is working so well. Make sure you keep using these same emotion based arguments to discourage investigations of certain things. This is such good social engineering. You are going to do very well in the CIA my friend. </p>

<p>Editor’s note: After publication, the Democratic National Committee contacted The Nation with a response, writing, “U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government hacked the DNC in an attempt to interfere in the election. Any suggestion otherwise is false and is just another conspiracy theory like those pushed by Trump and his administration. It’s unfortunate that The Nation has decided to join the conspiracy theorists to push this narrative.”</p>

The Qatar World Cup is being prepared with undeniable human atrocities and literal slaves to build air-conditioned enclosed stadia for 80k people in a virtual wasteland as a proof of concept that man can engineer his way out of the nearly immenent disaster. Antagonizing Russia allows for a total war economy geared toward surviving this event more than it is geared toward surviving &quot;Russia&quot; because Russia is participating in their own doomsday prepping. </p>

So everyone does not have those suspicions must have bad reasons to. Maybe your bad reason isn&#39;t that you support him, so you are blind to his actions, but instead that you dislike Democrats so much, you are blind to it, or maybe you are too obsessed with the &quot;MSM&quot; being wrong or whatever, that you throw out everything they say as wrong. </p>

<p>Regardless, they are all bad reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this sub is supposed to be a refuge for those seeking to explore tooics that get one branded a loon, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy theorist.</p>

<p>trump-russia et al is a congressional and criminal investigation that people can and are talking about ad nauseum in every mainstream forum, be it reddit, WAPO, fb, twitter. this is not a conspiracy for the purposes of this sub. it is news of the day, mainstream news of the day.</p>

<p>that you don&#39;t have your mind made up about has nothing to do with it being a true conspiracy. conspiracies are where those in power perpetrate deceptions on the masses to entrench their power and &quot;train,&quot; demoralize, divide, and diminsh the masses. </p>

<p>this is not a situation of the powerful against the powerless. it is a situation of power against power. if all is true, all that was done was one candidate exposing the corruption of one candidate. no one has ever claimed the information released was false. no one has ever claimed that votes were flipped. poltical bribes and corruption are the way our govt works. this isn&#39;t even news. it is an axiom. </p>

<p>polls show americans do not care about this at all. if it were a true conspiracy, americans would be freaking out--if 9/11 was proved to have been the govt colluding with silverstein, the NY port authority, juliani, and isreal, and SA to commit insurance fraud and establish casus belli for the exhumation of NATO and furtherance of foruegn policy goals antithetical to american values and interests, shit would get real, real fast.</p>
