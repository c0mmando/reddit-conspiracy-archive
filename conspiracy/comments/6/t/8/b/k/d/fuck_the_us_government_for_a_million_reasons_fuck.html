       Hey, I'm just a guy who never saw the Trump-Russia hysteria as anything more than a media circus pandering to the lowest common denominator. I stayed objective, read the articles, and clicked back looking for sources and undeniable evidence*. And I never found any being objectively presented to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am wrong, I will openly admit that. But you know what, I am so fucking tired of being immediately and lazily attacked as a Trump supporter every time I question anything related to it. I am sure a lot of other people feel the same way. And that is the point of this post. So let me put this part in bold for the lazy:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        I did not start this thread to create a comment section full of reasons I should believe Trump-Russia. I started this discussion for the people tired of being attacked and labelled as a Trump supporter or member of "T_D" or a Russian shill. Labels immediately thrown at them because they feel like taking a step back before blindly joining the hysterical crowd.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (Also, I purposely waited until the weekend to post this because it seems to me that hundreds of both anti- and pro- Trump talking points suddenly slow down their attack on this subreddit during weekend hours, almost as if entire teams of people leave work on Friday.)
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: * since this word is being harped on and misrepresented, understand the difference between undeniable
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       and undeniable proof.

       They were just parroting the analysis of Crowdstrike, the private cyber security firm the DNC hired. No law enforcement was ever allowed to investigate, nor did any of those spy agencies actually look at the hardware themselves. This is all because the DNC hired a private company and that private company said it was definitely Russia and everyone agreed to not even actually investigate.

       The funny thing is, if evidence existed, the NSA would of already given it over. Any U.S. based communications are monitered.  So any "hacking" that may have happened could easily be verified with the NSA. Same with any phone calls, text, emails are all monitored.  If anything existed, it would of been produced by now.

       Oh look, it's the guy I busted lying the other day. Remember when you said you have had comments get downvoted 10 times in a few minutes so they can't be seen "lots of times" and then I looked at your history and you had barely 25 comments, and only one comment that had been dowvnoted below -4?

       Because he's wasting his time trying to hang people with extensive, nitpicky grand jury testimony. Any evidence of hacking would have already been found under a FISA warrant, since it's electronic. You don't need, and don't want a grand jury taking testimony under those circumstances.

        Oh look, it's the guy I busted lying the other day. Remember when you said you have had comments get downvoted 10 times in a few minutes so they can't be seen "lots of times" and then I looked at your history and you had barely 25 comments, and only one comment that had been downvoted below -4?
       </p>
       <p>
        Not sure why the mods didn't ban you on the spot for propagandizing, but hopefully they'll take the opportunity now when you get triggered and report me for exposing you.

       Testimony hasn't happened yet. You think grand jury testimony being detailed is a problem?

       Are you trying to pretend that the kinds of people involved in spending millions of dollars to manipulate and control information would not have planned their tactics around convenient truths like that? Do you think this is amateur hour?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a tip, when you can use your brain for less than 30 second and spit out an excuse like "There are no shills working 9-5 office hours because, like, regular people use the internet at work and also leave on Friday! Wow, its so easy to figure out! Shills don't exist!", then congrats, someone clearly already assumed you would make up that excuse to continue denying things that those in charge obviously want the general public to deny.

       this sub is supposed to be a refuge for those seeking to explore tooics that get one branded a loon, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump-russia et al is a congressional and criminal investigation that people can and are talking about ad nauseum in every mainstream forum, be it reddit, WAPO, fb, twitter. this is not a conspiracy for the purposes of this sub. it is news of the day, mainstream news of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       that you don't have your mind made up about has nothing to do with it being a true conspiracy. conspiracies are where those in power perpetrate deceptions on the masses to entrench their power and "train," demoralize, divide, and diminsh the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is not a situation of the powerful against the powerless. it is a situation of power against power. if all is true, all that was done was one candidate exposing the corruption of one candidate. no one has ever claimed the information released was false. no one has ever claimed that votes were flipped. poltical bribes and corruption are the way our govt works. this isn't even news. it is an axiom.
      </p>
      <p>
       polls show americans do not care about this at all. if it were a true conspiracy, americans would be freaking out--if 9/11 was proved to have been the govt colluding with silverstein, the NY port authority, juliani, and isreal, and SA to commit insurance fraud and establish casus belli for the exhumation of NATO and furtherance of foruegn policy goals antithetical to american values and interests, shit would get real, real fast.

       What polls are you talking about specifically? Not saying you're wrong I just don't remember seeing anything on that.

       That being said I think polls about criminal behavior are sort of irrelevant. No one is going to take a poll after you get caught drinking and driving, you're going to jail either way.

       I agree with you. The media doesn't tell the truth ever. And when they do, you better bet they don't have the full story. Personally, I think the ties between Trump and Russia are there, but that's not the issue. The issue is that we have a GovCorp being run by criminals. Legit psychopaths. Trump is a big issue, but he is just another cog. We need to take hammers to this machine, not a single cog.

       how many and who?  so far you have a Turkey and Ukraine connection and Trumps secret meeting with Putin in a room with 20 heads of state --  you been watching too much fake news..  seeped into your brain.. If you can produce some evidence I am willing to listen .. But even the latest reports suggest it was leak not a hack due to the time it took to transfer the emails..

       non issue it seems -  released the email chain and left the meeting after 30 minutes... also no laws were broken and she had links to the DNC.. people speculate it was a cover to unmask Trump so that Obama/Rice could spy on

       Possibly, depending on the context. We have no idea what happened in that meeting, unless you believe the guy who already lied to your face about it. It could be part of a larger felony conspiracy case. If the Russian lawyer actually did agree to provide opposition research to the Trump campaign, it was a potential campaign finance violation. We'll have to see how it shakes out.

       A. We don't know if any laws were broken. The investigation is still ongoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. The scenario of "false pretenses" still brought the Trump team to the table. So lil Donny either attempted to collude, failed, and lied about it until he was pressured into releasing the emails. Or he attempted to collude, succeeded, and lied about it. Those are literally the only two options. Your boy got an email that said, "we have dirt on your opponent that we want to give you as part of the Russian Government's efforts to help your father," and he took the fucking meeting.

      <p>
       I mean this in all sincerity, without deflecting to some Clinton crap, tell me how that isn't, at minimum, attempted collision with the Russian government.

       collusion bro. Learn to read man. You don't need a criminal investigation to see if someone tried to do something. You can literally read the emails for yourself. It's the basic premise of "To Catch a Predator." Whether or not they technically committed a crime is one thing, the conversations and the fact that they showed up to the meeting clearly show their intent to at least attempt collusion with the Russian government, which they vehemently denied (a lie). I'm not speaking to the legality of the actions, because the investigation will do that.

       When did I ever act like it's a bombshell. You're minimizing the actions as if they don't matter. I never said they're illegal (they might be tho), but the entire Trump campaign/staff lying to the American people definitely matters.

       you already have- that's why you are arguing here..  Most of us here have heard what JFK said about secret societies and shadow organizations before he was killed..  Most of us here see that these shadow groups hate Trump and want him out..  we support him only because he is fighting the deep state.. Now it could be a pretend fight but we just don't know yet..  CIA  elements of Hollywood/ Corporations /Media / Clintons / Bushes and many more from both sides fall under the deep state.. Most of us here just want the swamp drained.. If you are a real person and can be open minded enough to realize that the whole MSM can push a false narrative then you at least need to consider that possibility.. otherwise you had better stick to r/politics where your opinion will be upvoated.

       Why won't the DNC let the authorities inspect the hacked server?  Its not a philosophical question like the chicken and egg.. its a simple logic question.. if you cant read between the lines there is little hope for you I am afraid.

       These are baseless defenses rooted in taking the administrations comments on the meeting at face value, after already lying about the meeting and changing their story several times. Even if you do believe them it is far, far to early to declare this a "non-issue." The fact is we don't know yet. It just stinks like hell.

       These people did not declare, even though they had substantial ties and pretty clear cases of influence peddling (money for policy). Most of the Trump people I have seen get over trouble for Russian ties are on the level of not declaring conversations in hall ways while travelling between meeting rooms, or passing Russian people on the streets while getting hamburgers from street vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they find substantial connections, then they absolutely should prosecute, but all I've seen so far has been a media circus.

       you have no evidence afeter 8 months of deepstate investigation including spying/unmasking and the resources of every fake news outlet... Meanwhile there is evidence of Russian collusion to get US uranium and massive payments to Clinton foundation... Bill speeches and podesta lobbying..

       You love this word.. I just think you have been hypnotized by madcows eyebrows..  Lets assume your Don Jr meeting will go somewhere.. (it wont)  but anyway -  this is your first piece of evidence and it wasn't discovered until 9 months into investigation.. so what the heal has the MSM been reporting for the past 9 months! no evidence at all.. Manafort and Ukraine and Flynn and Turkey.. aren't you sick of being wrong and lied too?  and to top it off there is much more concrete evidence tying Clintons to Russia... Of you will call this a deflection but I think the deflection is the more the truth bouncing of your cranium.

       At this point I would have preferred the status quo of the "deep state" being in power over war with North Korea and Venezuela, as well as a president who refuses to criticize Russia, a country with a WELL established history of human rights violations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm pissed at the DNC too. I am a huge Bernie supporter. But Trump is crazy and certainly more of a globalist than Clinton was. And if you can't, at the very least, question what's going on with all of this hiding Russian meetings/connections, you should not call yourself a conspiracy theorist.

       Trump is pandering to the most evil man in the world. He is making America a joke in the world. It's embarrassing. The entire political system needs to be overhauled. Hope it happens in my lifetime.

       I think he is doing OK with the deep state firmly against him.. maybe you are watching fake news..  I'm in china and they actually laugh at the white liberals and respect Trump more.. so not sure where you are getting your news from..  And I am not a great Trump fan.. but so far is OK..

       Why would the DNC hand a server to the FBI, who was clearly hostile to them? The FBI has been less than transparent with the information they have been given. For example, they got Weiner's laptop, and stated it had thousands of HRC's emails on it, but never explained how they got there. Email transit is pretty easy to trace, particularly in this volume. So why are they hiding what they learned?

       Again, you don't seem to understand what evidence is if you think that the FBI "raiding" someone is somehow in-and-of-itself evidence of anything.

      <p>
       And again, did you actually read that article or did you read the headlines written intentionally to sensationalize the event?

      <p>
       Because I
       <em>
        actually did
       </em>
       read it and the "raid" consisted of a man politely opening his front door, allowing the FBI to enter to conduct their investigation, and then all parties cordially going back to their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as you start throwing around "OMG, the FBI raided him" as a talking point. You are intentionally trying to create the illusion of a team of people in SWAT gear knocking in the front door with a ram and then screaming with guns drawn at everyone to lay on the floor while they sack the place.

       Got a lot of it saying the Russian narrative was constructed by the DNC via falsifying a second leak. Don't see liberals defending that. It's like a brain tumor kicks on the minute you threaten their thought bubble.

       That's sort of my point. You don't have more evidence that it was the DNC falsifying a leak. You're just placing a heavier emphasis on that particular evidence.

       You're lying. The metadata shows that it's not possible the Guccifer 2.0 leaks could have been made over the Internet. Because of the data speeds necessary, they had to have been copied locally. Period. You're trying to make it sound like it's one person's word against another, but the people you're defending are claiming things that are physically impossible.

        How often do you get undeniable evidence on anything posted here?

      <p>
       All the time. You seem to believe that when I said "undeniable evidence" I am asking for "undeniable
       <strong>
        proof
       </strong>
       ". These are two separate things entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like for 9/11, I have a video of WTC7 falling into its own footprint. That is undeniable evidence of a building collapsing. Do you understand now, that is a piece of evidence to add to my collection when trying to see the larger conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Apollo moon landing conspiracy, I have a video clip of astronauts faking a shot of Earth from inside of the shuttle. You could certainly say they are just "goofing around" but again, that footage is an undeniable piece of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I have read about the Trump-Russia "conspiracy" is "here is this person lying about...." but the definition of lying in those cases is being chosen by the people dictating the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read "anonymous sources claim to have heard..." and again, that is not hard evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that there is no undeniable
       <strong>
        evidence
       </strong>
       of "anything posted" in r/conspiracy is complete and utter bullshit and I honestly find it extremely interesting that you would reach the top of a thread stating something that wrong.

       So the biggest evidence pushed by MSM is the hacked server-  Yet they refused to give it to the FBI on multiple occasions.. In addition in the last few days it has become apparent that it was more likely a leak and not a hack due to transfer times.

       No, I think that it's bullshit for anyone to call themselves a "free thinker," or "woke," or "red pilled," or any variation of that. It's a psychological defense against cognitive dissonance. Because if someone is a "free thinker," then they

       Well in your last post, you suggested that Russia would prefer Trump because they thought Hillary would bring them to war with the US. There's also the fact that Don Jr didn't bat an eye when told about the Russian government's efforts to help his dad's campaign. And if you spent any time watching Russian state media during the election, you would have seen a huge pro-Trump bias.

       India was overwhelmingly pro trump. As was Syria Greece, Hungary, Poland. I'm sure there were more countries that celebrated trump winning. If you want to add Russia, fine. But it doesn't mean trump is pro Russia, or India, or Greece, etc...

       That's hasn't been my experience of Trump supporters. Not saying that it hasn't happened, or nobodies ever said it. But I haven't personally seen that to be the case. As I mentioned above, Putin is on video saying that he would prefer Trump over Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I can tell, the real cause of frustration has been the deception around how far things have really gone between them, and going as far as to say that the election was rigged using Russia's help. I didn't vote for either of them, but, as OP is suggesting, that's a ridiculous claim.

       I know this is a radical departure from the norm, but have you considered looking between the tiny, fortified black area, and the tiny fortified white area? If you look closely, or even glance for a microsecond with the lights off you will just be able to clearly and definitely make out massive oceans of grey.

       It's just a figure of speech. Russia is a country run by a murderous dictator. They certainly have enough flaws to question their motives.

       America is a country run by a cabal of murderous dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not disagree that their motives should be questioned. Neither should Israel's, or China's. (In case you're going to ask, both are nations who also have significant influence on America, and who would stand to gain from keeping her down. Same as Russia.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Vigilance is important. But Vigilance is not the same as blind-stupid, parrot-like Patriotism.  "Russia + Trump = Bad for America" should really be refocused to "Foreign National Interests or Domestic Private Interests + Corrupt Politicians = Bad for America."  And we should be focusing all this media-manufactured hate at ALL of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all the "deflection" in here is probably a healthy dose of actual deflection, but try thinking refocusing like I suggested. If you want to remove corrupt politicians from their compromised places of influence and power, why would you only focus on one part? The hardest part to deal with, no less?  IF this could be rebranded from Trumpssia Vs. Democrats, to Citizens Vs. Corruption in Politics, entire gangs of criminals could be removed. Or do you think that a thorough investigation of the DNC shenanigans, resulting in arrests and eye-opening revelations about what politicians can get up to when no one is looking, would just stop at the DNC's involvement in the 2016 election?  Could it galvanize the people to go after more and more corruption, getting more and more outraged as the revelations come pouring in until finally they have enough dirt to take down the king?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where I am coming from when I mention things like "ya, well the Clinton camp has been overly-friendly with the Russians for a long time, let's go after that too."

       Not a Trump supporter, and I haven't denied that they've pursued a mutually beneficial relationship. But what's wrong with them doing so? I don't believe the argument was ever one of whether or not they have made attempts to get along. Putin is on video during the campaign saying that if we elect Clinton then we're essentially asking for a shit show between the two of us. And I, for one, would prefer to be allies with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real conspiracy, is how often the media blames everything on Russia, and attempts to make America out to be a perfect flawless country and government. Regardless of how fucked Russia may be, the U.S. isn't exactly the pinnacle of governments either. And I just wish we would start taking responsibility for the fucked up shit that we're doing as a country.

       Your memory of it doesn't really affect whether or not it happened, which it done. It's definitely happened a lot more since the election. However, as the recent video leaks have proved, this is because MSM knew that it got them ratings.

       It's not so much glorifying America, as it is sweeping our problems under the rug and our media using other countries as the scapegoat for our things we're responsible for.

       The point I'm making is that is is related to it. If you take a step back and look at the bigger picture, it would partially explain why the media manipulates information about other nations.

       No honest user here(most of which have no political or bi-partisan affiliation,) weren't saying that Trump wouldn't consider foreign help in our election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true talking point in this sub amongst honest users were that to the effect of bullshit the MSM media was feeding us about the Russian story.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first Russia "hacked" our elections. They had no evidence. The "sources" were dry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they moved to Russians hacked the DNC servers, and leaked to wikileaks. Which influenced the outcome of the election. Again, entirely false. Podesta leaks were a phishing scam that Podesta fell for like and idiot. The second DNC leaks, most evidence points towards an internal leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the MSM is pushing a collusion theory. It is just one cabal taking it to another. One government trying to influence another governments election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that the DNC was not approached by foreign governments/institutions/persons willing to help their cause?

       What do you think monetary donations do to an election?

       I'm not limiting my definition of Trump supporter to this sub. The original narrative from the Trump camp was that they never spoke with Russia about anything. That shifted to the new "well we did, but that's not illegal" narrative when the emails came out. Then they lied about who attended that meeting.

       But what the trump jr emails provided was evidence that Kushner had left out details about meetings that he should have disclosed. During the time this meeting was being planned Trump Sr promised a crowd he would have evidence outlining Clinton's crimes by the following week...the emails are undeniable evidence of where he planned to get this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russia election hacking collusion narrative may not hold much water, but why did these guys "forget" about meeting with a "Russian government connected lawyer" (even if it turns out she wasn't, this is how it was sold to trump jr). Why would trump jr lie about the purpose of the meeting (saying it was about adoptions prior to releasing his email chain).
      </p>
      <p>
       It might not be anything major, but I wouldn't say it should be ignored. It is worth someone taking the time to look into.

       What are you talking about? Read the emails yourself. That's all the context you should need. Trump and Co said they didn't get anything from the meeting. Which may or may not be true. The team has a history of lying, so I don't place much stock in their claims of innocence.

       R - The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
      </p>
      <p>
       R - This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.

      <p>
       TJ - Seems we have some time and if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.

       R - Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and The Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday.

       Because he knew they were coming out anyway. He got exactly what he wanted by releasing them. Now you guys will defend him for it. Either way, his motive doesn't change the fact that they prove exactly what I said they prove.

       <p>
        When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years
        <strong>
         with assistance from Fusion GPS
        </strong>
        , the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spokesman for Trump’s outside counsel, Mark Corallo, emphasized Veselnitskaya’s relationship with Fusion GPS. “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the president and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier"

       If you are over the Pacific Ocean, you won't see any continents either, rabbis primarily water anyway. You just don't see many images published of just the Pacific Ocean because there is nothing to see, but go on google maps and you can find many views of most of the earth where you can't see almost any land
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't see stars because of the contrast, try pointing your camera at a star lit sky with the moon focused and you won't see any stars either.

       As for the light, I don't really have an explanation other than possibly glare or a piece of the vehicle out of the window, but having most of the claims debunked really doesn't make me second guess that one.

       Partly because of the seriousness of the charges. We have Senators on record calling this an act of war. Well... then consider what it means to be at war. Are we talking Nukes? That's what it is eventually. Are we talking one time reprisal in kind? These Senators are the same people advocating the end of encryption but are talking about full cyber warfare - that eventually becomes nuclear untill

       Yeah, its the history of a real person who has posted 100's of times in this subreddit. Everything from Boston bombing, 9/11, to the moon landing, to the various real political conspiracies infecting the US government over the past century.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure that makes it unique when compared with the "totally legit user histories" of the sudden influx of "totally real conspiracy subreddit members" who turn every single political thread into clones of r-politics.

       I'm not saying you're not a real conspiracy theorist, or that you don't belong here, or anything like that. I'm suggesting that this topic (above) is your absolute favourite, and that you may in fact be addicted to the drama of it. I genuinely can't tell whether you're trying to quell it or propagate it.

       I don't event entirely believe one way or another. There's not enough conclusive evidence available to people like us, and a prevelance of contradictory information going both ways. What I'm tired of is people acting like we have any idea what's going on. I'm less Trump/Russia, but I upvote all the Trump articles I see in hopes of actual discus

       This is me too. Why did everyone forget what Clickbait was? Why did anyone think it stopped? The NYT and CNN and WaPo all took in the former top editors of BuzzFeed from 2012 shortly after BF became more valuable than the NYT. As if the tactics that made it valuable would be stopped because of "reputation" or "integrity".

       There's dirty shit everywhere. That's not the conspiracy theory. Trump-Russia originated from DNC leaks. The media has been on a witch hunt to find any evidence to support that theory by finding all Trump-Russia connections which are NOT related to the collusion theory.

       No its not. If anhthing people tend to branch out over time as conspiracies in general are entertaining. It would be thr equivalent of being hyperfocused on 911 after 16 years.

       Sure, but out of all of them, this "conspiracy" is pretty fishy to be obsessed about. You've got to admit that much. It's just so minuscule. I could see maybe, incorporating this into a larger conspiracy that you are investigating. But he's right that if all someone is posting/commenting about constantly on this subreddit is about this, that's suspicious.

       Man, I post when I feel like it about the Pentagon because I think that is a msirepresented topic much of the time.  It's only because I have crafted what I say and my arguments after some time and I understand there is not much room to debate when you are specific in your questions and responses.

       The point was to show two polar opposites and to show how one would not be attached to the other in any way, shape or form.  To show how you wouldn't bother comparing them.  You do understand the point of the comparison, don't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you're here to tell people how they should be and how they should be approaching things strange to me.  Just out of curiosity......wait, having you been drinking?  Is this just you breaking out and showing a little frustration being a mod here?  Sick of the process and need a change?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like you've gone to a place where you're on a warpath of sorts now.  Like, I don't tell you what you need to do with your time.  I don't say you should do more to "understand" and mock you when I feel you haven't hit a point where I feel you're on the same level as I am.  I don't, but here we are on r/conspiracy and one of the mods is telling me that I should be "better" or I won't have a sense of what is going on.

       JCP, I remember when you arrived.  You were always a person who posted with respect and this is coming across as the opposite.

       We acknowledge the brigading. We acknowledge all the brigading. The mods are a bit of a problem here, but at the end of the day it's up to the userbase to pull this sub up. Can we do it? Probably not if we all play whataboutism all the time.

       We as in the proper userbase who didn't get caught in all this BS. I agree, JCP has bothered me at times with how he goes about doing things, a lot mods on Reddit do. But is he wrong about calling out r/all and r/politics? No. And neither are you for calling out the donald. And neither are any of the people who call out shareblue.

       You're just making claims - show me some evidence of you attempting to actually stop brigading as a whole instead of calling out "all" and "politics".

       You're just grandstanding with a bunch of moot points. Its no question this subreddit has gone to shit post election when all it focuses on is how Trump is trying to take down the "deep state" 24/7 and how Hilary is to blame for giving Seth Rich secret pizza.

       The mods have done a quality shit job in removing actual interesting conspiracies and promoting inter right/left politics with a slant. You're a mod - its your fault.

       You can laugh l you want friend. WorldsocialistWebsite, Truth Out, Naked Capitalism, all leftist sites, all censored. Progressive YouTube accounts are being demonetized right with conservative ones. We're all in this together don't you see? You think google and FB are real leftists? You think they like Bernie? Don't be a fool. Both sides are being attacked for going against the establishment- open your eyes.

       You are being ignorant to the information wars raging all about you friend. It's obvious, and much of this censorship of websites like Worldsocialist and Naked Capitalism are recent. Open your eyes man, we're in this together. You aren't my enemy, I'm not your enemy, the establishment wants to destroy both our movements, and you're playing into their divisive rhetoric! Wake up!

       LOL my tactics? You are being a fool. Check my post history, do I look like a shill to you? You are playing right into the hands of the system you think you've woken up from. Left/Right doesn't matter as long as our government is controlled by corrupt oligarchs! We are all citizens, all people! We aren't enemies! You need to take a step back and reevaluate yourself my friend, this partisan idea you have is toxic. We are allies in this fight, both the anti establishment Left and Right are under attack by the D's and R's so that we aren't able to destroy this system.

       Left/Right does matter when the left is acting like Communists.  How would we ever even work together?  The left wants open borders, the right wants the opposite.  The left wants leniency for illegal aliens and black criminals, the right wants the opposite.  The left is anti 1st and anti 2nd amendment, the right is pro both.

       Actually a lot of these things are highly nuanced, and you've been caught up in the MSM narrative. If you listened to Bernie speak last year, he didn't want Open Borders, he just wanted immigration, the thing this country was founded on, to continue. And not illegal immigration. And yes, a path to citizenship is an important idea on the Left, because these illegals are already paying taxes and are established members of their communities, better for all of us to integrate them into our social fabric like they already are, rather than have jack booted thugs deport 11 million or more people, creating a whole new service branch of government (as Trump alluded to during the campaign). Second amendment rights are also all over the board- I personally own a gun and would never give up that right. How can I entrust the government to run Healthcare if I don't have the means to enforce that trust? Bernie's stance was very nuanced, accepting that large cities will want gun control, but stating that states like Vermont couldn't have the same regulations because of geography and culture. And the statement that the left is anti- 1st amendment is also establishment divisiveness. True leftists, your average American Liberal even, do NOT want that. You are buying into MSM propaganda. We can and must work together to destroy the establishment so we can then have meaningful debates about how government should function. At the moment the Republican and Democratic parties are simply two tools of the Oligarchic ruling class, used to subvert the will of the people and cause infighting so we never question those in true power, like the party bosses, billionaire donors, and corporations. You and I aren't enemies, you need to snap out of that.

       You replied so fast you either didn't read my response or didn't care. Bernie is a Social Democrat- that means Capitalism still exists, but markets that fail citizens the most, like Education and Healthcare, are nationalized. It's a successful model that has worked in most developed Western countries. Even being against that, can't you see that you and I are still citizens, still humans? We are both being oppressed by the establishment and their propaganda and censorship. The anti-establishment Left is on the March, as exemplified by Bernie, and the anti-establishment Right is on the march, as exemplified by Trump. This scares the shit out of the establishment, and is why they are attacking both sides. We must work together to see our way through this. We are NOT each others enemy.

       Bernie is a card carrying member of the Socialist party and has described himself as a Socialist on many occasions.  His platform, free healthcare free college and free housing, is pure socialism.  Socialism leads to Communism.  Communists are most certainly my enemies.

       Bernie is a Social Democrat as far as policy goes, his career is consistent with that. And Socialism has never lead to Communism- the two have been conflated, and tried, but neither has ever even been put into actual practice due to technological and human constraints. Bernie isn't your enemy my friend- just because he wants Healthcare and Education for all citizens. He's not a Communist, and he doesn't advocate seizing the means of production overnight- although he does envision a future in which real Democratic Socialism may come about with proper social and technological advances. We must work together to destroy the establishment. We must see past partisan lines. We are NOT enemies!

       Man. Hijacked by communism? You are deep in the establishment kool-aid my friend. There are no true communists in the Democratic Party today lmao- I'm sorry if you believe that. There's almost no real Socialists either. True Leftists and true Liberals being hard line Communists...I don't think you know what that term means. No one is advocating a vanguard party to nationalize all production and begin paving the way towards communism. No one is advocating that all industry be democratized overnight- which would be socialism. You need to see past this. We aren't each others enemies, the establishment wants us fighting.

       Lol I'm not advocating for the establishment by having a nuanced view on something that defies easy categorization. People are shills because they aren't allowed to point out the difference between Communism and Socialism? Did you know Marx even thought there was a difference? He DESPISED Socialists. This isn't some easy conversation friend, with easy labels. There's nuance, words MEAN things, ideologies mean things and are very different in practice. I'm not your enemy, you need to see that. Your hatred of the Left as individual people is playing right into the establishments hands, you must see past it. If you really believe I'm a shill, then that's unfortunate, because I'm just trying to widen your view and show you that as a fellow American I'm not your enemy, we may have different political ideologies but were both being censored and screwed by the establishment. I hope one day you can see that.

       until the USSR collapsed in the 1990s, leftist conspiracy theorists were branded as communists working on  behalf of the USSR to overthrow the USA and hand it over to kruschef. it was used to deligitimize the real left, anti-war activists, union organizers, whistleblowers, true investigative journalists, foriegn news sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       if it wasn't so sad, that the tables have turned and being a conspiracist now brands you as a facist russian sympathizer bent on handing the USA to putin, would be delicious for those of us on the left that the right stalked, harrassed, blacklisted, imprisoned, ruined etc from WW1 until 1992 (i'm genX, i spent the 1980s being spat on with "love it, or leave it." my gut tells me the top-kekers would have been among them). but it is sad, and you'll notice those of us on the real left are not gloating (whether you believe it or not we're on the front line of being targeted again).
      </p>
      <p>
       you would think after all this time TPTB would be able to find a new evil empire...russia ought to take pride in our irrational fear of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw, one reason some older voices (older than mine) on the real left object to 9/11, sandy hoax, the moon non-landing, and JFK, is because the CIA's weaponization of "conspiracy," was used against the left beginning with JFK. during this time the the left was working on exposing COINTELLPRO, mosadeq, allende, iran-contra, guns for coke, tonkin etc, they saw alien and JFK conspiracy theories as attempts by the CIA to completely discredit them. this is why they reject all mass grief conspiracies, like 9/11 and sandy hoax,  they see them merely as honey pots to discredit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       find the conservative sites that have been disappeared by google. those on real left (not the 3rd way, the DLC, the bernieites, the liberals/progressisives, the democrats), is being objectively documented.

       Ironic the person who says this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First we have to purge the muslim's protectors, liberals. After the liberals are gone we'll take care of the muzzies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Went to a gas station in the hood. A didndu was whining about something, hard to understand with all the jigabooing. When he finally left the clerk, some Apu looking motherfucker, was clearly exasperated. I said "niggers right?" he said "the only good thing about India is there was no niggers". We chatted for a while and have been friendly ever since. It's simply universal, everyone hates niggers.

       Thank you for pointing that out. A lot of people like to say they argue or state the facts and people who disagree "loose" their mind. It's so hard to point out when someone is arguing with slanted facts.

       Weird. Happened to me, too.  It happens a lot when I post on this account, which is natural because I comment regularly on T_D.  But I have an alt account for things that relate closer to the real world, and been accused of being a Trump supporter just because of a disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that it was a debate over a piece of health information, for which I had research citations, medical journal support, and so on.  A well-grounded and factual argument.  The response?  "Arguing with you is like arguing with Trump supporter."

       I get accused of being a trump sucker at least 10 times a day. I don't even know the last time I started discussing trump when it wasn't in response to an accusation. Laziest shit ever. I had one the other day scope my history and the cognitive dissonance must have given their brain a cramp. Best they had was "right lite" lol. What does that even mean? It means they couldn't find anything to substantiate theur erroneous conclusion, so they just assumed since I think the DNC is cancer there is only one other thing I could be.

       And let me ask you this? Why is it a bad thing to support your President?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was recently talking to my ex-husband. He is a successful, gay Hispanic guy that is pretty high up in the corporate world. He voted for Trump and he said that he would be better off calling someone a nigger in work conversation than "admitting" that he supports the President. How did that happen?

       What point are you trying to make? When you have a very unpopular president it is no surprise that openly supporting him is seen as odd. Being a conservative certainly shouldn't mean people are ostracized, but the narrative that Trump supporters are now the oppressed ones is just laughable.

       A lot of it stems from people recognising the flimsy base on which the whole thing rests. Huge claims are made in the IC &amp; media but the deeper you look the less there is:
17 AGENCIES became 3 agencies, became a small group of hand-picked (red flag) people at 3 agencies working together in a report where no one claimed certainty. This report was mostly just complaining about RT with the only "evidence" being what was provided by Crowdstrike. Crowdstrike's evidence was not especially convincing, especially after the issues with their attribution in prior cases involving Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are rightly concerned that our entire foreign policy is being shaped by poor, unconfirmed and disputed "evidence" that was provided by a party with severe conflicting interests, about an organisation that has been CAUGHT lying to and defrauding their supporters and has every motive to miss-attribute said crime.

I've visited the T_D subreddit or the politics subreddit, and even there they have a group-think mentality. There's no critical thinking, no objectivity, nothing of substance, just pure attack &amp; smears against their perceived opponents. No one realizes that this sub is one of the last bastions of objectivity &amp; critical thinking. We're all being played, and not enough people are speaking up about this. Thank you.

       I totally agree. I will defend him against the idiots or ignorant fools who use the Trump-Russia allegations, because that's just made-up by the lying media corporations (msm). We all know in our hearts that was made-up so that the military industrial complex could tell the politicians &amp; media to make Russia the scapegoat, for the purposes of selling more weapons to Western nations (NATO nations). The DNC's corrupt upper echelons, along with some GOP members, have created this mess. But this "mess" has been festering since the day the Federal Reserve was put into power. Pres. Andrew Jackson was right to not allow one bank to rule over them. I bet he's been rolling in his grave for a long time now. Burn it all down, and start all over. And arrest all the bankers (fraudsters)!

       Any mention of Hillary that is not comparing her to a goddess or queen will resort to the shills flocking in to brigade and label you a Trump Shill or Russian mouthpiece.  But if you call out the obvious that they are shills then you get banned here.  Why isn't accusations of being a Trump or Russian shill violate Rule#10?

       Very good question.  Why are purple not banned for running the conversation into simply "well you're from T_D so you are only here to support Trump."  That's pretty much saying they can't think for themselves and are shilling for a sub therefore don't matter.

       The thing with trump jr, however, is very fucking real. They would have if they could. They might have. Really though, it's all about $.

       If trump would release his damm super secret audited returns, it would go a long way, along with stopping lying, stopping divisive rhetoric, going back over his past statements and stopping fucking lying.

       Trump has said from the start that he wanted to improve relations with Russia.  Hell, it's one of the reasons I voted for him.  Cold war is ooooverrrrr.

       No, Russia's interests do not align with ours, and often they conflict.  However, the same argument applies to literally every other nation
       <em>

       Conspiracy theory: the deep state is orchestrating this narrative against Trump which will lead to impeachment, and put their stooge Pence into power. There will be millions cheering for Trump's removal without really examining what he is getting replaced by.

       I think there's dirt on Pence as well. I don't know about President Ryan though, if only because it would be such uncharted territory. Can you put the Pres and the VP in the same articles of impeachment? If Trump goes first, and Pence is impeached second, would he be able to appoint a VP, meaning we get just the second completely unelected President in US history?

       I believe in russia gate, Trump has been known to deal with russians for money since early 2000's, hell even the republicans joke about him being in Putins pocket. But you dont have to believe one way or the other. Everyone just needs to let Mueller do his job and the truth will come out.

       The mainstream media, the DNC, and the deep-state are the only ones pushing this "conspiracy".  Conspiracy theories have always been something that pushed back against the mainstream narrative.  When it was Bush, the RNC, and the mainstream media pushing us into believing a "WMD in Iraq conspiracy" I questioned it too and didn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conspiracy I see in all this, is the conspiracy to topple and remove a legitimate president.

       Yeah the whole russia hysteria thing is just flaccid, and I HAAAATE trump.  I believe russia wanted him as president because they saw him as weak (which he is (, and we have proof that they supported him in kushner emails.  Bit they didn't hack shit.  Basically what they did, I think, was start a shareblue type program to help trunp on the internet.  And make a bunch of pro trump memes. But hacking?   Collusion?  These are just fantasies.

       Wow. You did it. You have 100% of all the evidence right in front of you, because you are connected to every agency on the planet. You analyzed all that information with hundreds of other people, and you now know the results. You aren't just some government employee doing the "Come on guys, I mean come on, come on! I mean, for real, come on! Come on! Emotions! More emotions! There are zero scientists who are able to go 'You know what, I have a feeling, and therefore I am right!' and be taken seriously, but I am different, so rather than using critical thinking and getting rid of bias, you should just assume that everything is under control."

       The US government has been making deals with China, Israel, Russia, Great Britain, Germany, Mexico, etc for the last 100 years, and all these deals sell out Americans, but it all magically stopped in 2016. We did it. We got the honest guy in there. I believe everything that was posted here. We should just think with our emotions. I mean, come on, how could there possibly be any other way?  There are thousands of people being paid to manipulate public opinion, but this definitely isn't one of those posts. A billionaire aristocrat would never do that. That would be crazy. Name one world where that would happen? Oh yeah, there aren't any. I can just keep saying the same thing over and over, and I am not really saying anything at all, but the more words I use the more credible I will seem.

      <p>
       Look at that! hundreds of people agree with you too! The propaganda is working so well. Make sure you keep using these same emotion based arguments to discourage investigations of certain things. This is such good social engineering. You are going to do very well in the CIA my friend.

       You are mischaracterizing why some people don't believe the Russia hype, and youre acting like those same people don't see other collision such as with Saudis or Israelis... And you're ignoring the other evidenced reasons people like myself say to go after Trump, such as war crimes his admin has already taken part in. I think the Russia stuff is propaganda but there's already plenty of undeniable things you can grab at if youre looking to get Trump in trouble.

       They all so desperately want us to be painted with the same brush. Anyone who dares question an official narrative is automatically a racist gay-hating Trump supporter.  In 30 years, when we tell our kids/grandkids about our thoughts on 9/11, they'll roll their eyes at us and call us Trumptards beneath their breaths. Their history/civics teachers will brainwash them from their state-approved textbooks. All conspiracy theorists will be the same to them. Notice how not too long ago there weren't any Republican/Democrat connotation to being a conspiracy theorist? And now suddenly 100% of us are fascist alt-righters.

       The fact that the Trump-Russia narrative is entirely backed by the deep state is enough for me to know it's fabricated bullshit.

       Putin isn't our friend - he's no one's friend but his own.  But if you buy the deep state narrative in this subreddit, you are in the wrong place.

       I think what's ironic is that a foreign power colluding and possibly helping get a president elected is something that would normally be a big thing for conspiracy. But because the parties involved were so incredibly inept, it's widely reported on and is then decided to be media propaganda.

       You can feel however you want about it. The right wing media was all over Benghazi. Benghazi cries lasted for several years.

       If this scandal feels louder it might be because 1) there is actually

        evidence

       of intent to collude, released by Don Jr. himself. and 2) It's the president and his entire administration, rather than the Sec. of State.

       Didn't Kushner leave early because they were all disappointed with the information? Why would they continue to meet if there wasn't any valuable information being exchanged? Sounds like abandoning to me. There's nothing more to the story as far as I can tell.

       You should go back to the original source from that article and read it:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Editor’s note: After publication, the Democratic National Committee contacted The Nation with a response, writing, “U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government hacked the DNC in an attempt to interfere in the election. Any suggestion otherwise is false and is just another conspiracy theory like those pushed by Trump and his administration. It’s unfortunate that The Nation has decided to join the conspiracy theorists to push this narrative.”

       But who cares?  "colluding" is just a word uses by the press to make it sound illegal.. I don't care if he met with the Russian's to get dirt on Hillary. I'm sure she did the same (or Obama tapped the heck of of Trump, which he did).

       Probably this actually has real evidence and someone in the Trump administration incriminates themselves every week. Probably because democrats aren't laughing admitting they were doing it for show to ruin Hillary for the election like Republicans . Probably because all our allies agree and it's not a democrats vs Republicans, it's the entire rest of the 1st world vs republicans, and every week less and less reublucans defend it

       Because they know they can't save everyone from the impending extinction level event coming from climate change. Humanities best chance at survival is to cut the global population in half by one way or another. While everyone is looking at SpaceX with optimism for the future, the elites are hedging their bets with the Boring Company and underground bunkers (illustrative example not intended to be taken too literally). The Qatar World Cup is being prepared with undeniable human atrocities and literal slaves to build air-conditioned enclosed stadia for 80k people in a virtual wasteland as a proof of concept that man can engineer his way out of the nearly immenent disaster. Antagonizing Russia allows for a total war economy geared toward surviving this event more than it is geared toward surviving "Russia" because Russia is participating in their own doomsday prepping.

       i'll chime in "im not American as my name states" though, also this is my main account to prove im not a shill, i usually surf here for the paranormal, ufo, black projects, conspiracy theory stuff i find it interesting, but you can't evade political stuff these days.
       <br/>
       anyway i've seen this used also here "Egypt" and other countries according to friends of mine, this is used by parties and simple minded folks that are spoon-fed by the media and sadly they believe it "if you're not X, you're the opposite" and "everyone isn't like me or believes in my shit is literally hitler" i find also what contributes more to the issue is the refusal for debate and just parroting what they hear from their talking heads, however i've encountered folks that were like that and we had discussions and both of us learned and changed our perspective, people need to remember that both parties are infront of the cannon, and the government is on the other side , but they're too busy fighting each other.

       Hillary said 17 agencies confirmed russia hacked the DNC. In reality, 4 agencies who never even examined the servers, said that the method needed to hack are methods russia is capable of. Hillary lied to the country, and her pet media literally called for Trump's head because of it.

       So why does Trump suck up to Putin so much? Man can do no wrong, Trump has yet to say something bad about him, never condemned any of his actions. Trump shits on our allies that have been with us for decades. But Putin is great man. I mean you can go on and on.

       I respect you for being against Trump and still not jumping on the "but Russia" bandwagon. Proof and evidence are important not random "collusion" claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, I don't think it's even against the law to be supported by a foreign power anyways. I mean it's common knowledge Bill Clinton was heavily financed by the Chinese and the media said nothing.

       There is no good reason to not at least have heavy suspicion of ties between Trump and the Russian Government. So everyone does not have those suspicions must have bad reasons to. Maybe your bad reason isn't that you support him, so you are blind to his actions, but instead that you dislike Democrats so much, you are blind to it, or maybe you are too obsessed with the "MSM" being wrong or whatever, that you throw out everything they say as wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, they are all bad reasons.

       To the extent you don't care about the Trump Russia investigation, that's fine. You don't have to. But don't try to actively convince people it isn't important or worth investigating, either. We owe it to this country to investigate corruption at its highest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent you want to encourage people not to care, you are not being vigilant and doing a disservice to your country and countrymen.

       Hey you supported Hillary? No, then you are a racist, homophobic, sexist white male... This is what i got and the common theme of reddit during the elections. Guess the propoganda machine is making people who dont view the trump/russsia bs as what you called it.

       Here on reddit, its easier to lable someone than attack their position with thoughtful replies. Not just reddit but all social media... Fuck the hive mind, these people need to stop listening to opinions and start thinking for themselves.. Or they are paid shills to discredit people who dont follow the anti-trump narrative.. Also fuck trump. But fuck Shared Blue or whatever Pedo Podesta BS is running.

       Its kinda funny though how these threads keep popping up to the front. Lotsa people here get called CTR, shareblue, zionist shills but never have i seen a post like this about it from the People who get accused about being that yet these "its not T_d" "Im not a trump supporter" keep popping up multiple times a week. People are too sensitive.

        Went to a gas station in the hood. A didndu was whining about something, hard to understand with all the jigabooing. When he finally left the clerk, some Apu looking motherfucker, was clearly exasperated. I said "niggers right?" he said "the only good thing about India is there was no niggers". We chatted for a while and have been friendly ever since. It's simply universal, everyone hates niggers.

       this sub is supposed to be a refuge for those seeking to explore tooics that get one branded a loon, tin foil hat wearing, conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump-russia et al is a congressional and criminal investigation that people can and are talking about ad nauseum in every mainstream forum, be it reddit, WAPO, fb, twitter. this is not a conspiracy for the purposes of this sub. it is news of the day, mainstream news of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       that you don't have your mind made up about has nothing to do with it being a true conspiracy. conspiracies are where those in power perpetrate deceptions on the masses to entrench their power and "train," demoralize, divide, and diminsh the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is not a situation of the powerful against the powerless. it is a situation of power against power. if all is true, all that was done was one candidate exposing the corruption of one candidate. no one has ever claimed the information released was false. no one has ever claimed that votes were flipped. poltical bribes and corruption are the way our govt works. this isn't even news. it is an axiom.
      </p>
      <p>
       polls show americans do not care about this at all. if it were a true conspiracy, americans would be freaking out--if 9/11 was proved to have been the govt colluding with silverstein, the NY port authority, juliani, and isreal, and SA to commit insurance fraud and establish casus belli for the exhumation of NATO and furtherance of foruegn policy goals antithetical to american values and interests, shit would get real, real fast.
