    <div class="md"><p>It depends on why you do it. If you utilize differences to try and figure out what&#39;s going on with limited information, heuristics are completely appropriately.

<p>&quot;Did you say &quot;Nazi Fascist&quot; in every comment??&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, not exactly <em>every</em> comment&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then go back and tell them they are Nazis and Fascists some more, but consistently!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, sir! Right away!&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like you&#39;re a short and thin company man/accountant type of guy who wears square rimless glasses and vertically striped pastel button downs from JcPenny that are the same style he&#39;s got since his mom showed him how to pick a dress shirt. And, I&#39;m like the class clown that frustrated everyone with how little he tried and how much he fucked with everything.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re thinking of the words of a group of less than 100, the actions of 1 man, and then pasting the emotional reactions that those actions inspire within you onto an entire group of people. It&#39;s like if there were a video of some BLM protesters who were saying &quot;we&#39;re all felons and that&#39;s what we do!&quot;, and someone said &quot;all black people are felons&quot;, you would be like &quot;hold up&quot;. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s tough when we have so much emotion invested all these different places, but for the sake of society, I ask that you would stop living based on reactions, and start living according to principles. In this case, it would be asking &quot;do the sins of a single member of a group taint the whole, no matter how large?&quot;, then deciding on an answer, and choosing to apply that rationality to everything you encounter, equally, until which time there comes information that you decide warrants changing your mind. For instance, you cannot on the one hand believe that all &quot;Trump supporters&quot; are nazis, while on the other saying that not all Muslims are terrorists, for reasons I hope are clear, if you are a person who stands on principle. We need your higher self in this fight, and those that wish to inspire your hatred are very much not your allies. </p>

When there is Right Wing Violence it&#39;s almost always one or two crazies.

<p>So are the number of terrorist attacks. If more right-wing members are committing terror acts than islamic members, why do you assume islamic members are the ones who are inherently more violent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh God is this conversation retarded. First off me and your Buddy weren&#39;t even talking about Terror Attacks we were talking about the extreme amount of Political Violence coming from the Left. My guess would be because the Left is politically irrelevant so they are lashing out since they know they will be out of power for a long long time. Anyway why the Fuck would it matter? Right Wing Violence is obviously more likely to be classified as terrorism for starters. I mean was the extreme amount of violence that Bernie&#39;s parasites committed at Trump&#39;s rallies classified as an act of terrorism? It should have been. If it wasn&#39;t then you have your answer. But seriously why do you think the number of terror attacks from a certain group would be important?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe terrorism committed by white supremacists is blown out of proportion, does that mean you&#39;re also willing to admit that Radical Islamic terrorism committed by middle-easterners / refugees is also blown out of proportion? <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/06/07/threat-extremists-more/">Some stats</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 12 September 2001 and 31 December 2016, there were 23 fatal “Radical Islamist Violent Extremist-Motivated Attacks,” resulting in a total of 119 deaths in the United States. In the same time period, there were 62 fatal “far-right violent extremist-motivated attacks”, leading to 106 deaths.</p>

<p>Just two events account for more than half of the 119 deaths resulting from Muslim extremist attacks: the December 2015 San Bernardino attack, which killed 14 people, and the June 2016 Pulse night club attack, which killed 49 people.</p>

<p>According to the University of Maryland’s START consortium, between 12 September 2001 and 2016 there were 31 fatal “Islamist extremist” attacks, leading to 119 deaths.  In the same time period, there were 89 “far-right extremist” attacks, resulting in a total of 158 deaths. </p>

<p>According to START, Muslim extremist violence killed seven times more people than far-right extremist violence between 1990 and 2016, despite five times fewer fatal attacks.  However, this period included the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the attacks of 11 September 2001, the two deadliest terrorist incidents in American history. When those outliers are removed from the figures, according to START, far-right extremist violence caused 272 deaths between 1990 and 2016 — more than twice as many as the 130 deaths from Islamic extremism during the same period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was trying to appeal to the working class, not socialists in particular. The Nazi&#39;s knew that the working class was sympathetic to socialist ideals. They thought they could trick them into believing they were on their side by adding one word to their name. </p>

<p>Because they were authoritarian. I never said it was a absolute free market in Nazi Germany, just that it was not a socialist economy. Major German corporations still existed under Nazi rule and were not run by the government. They kept their profits and the owners still got insanely rich. You really need to research what socialism really is. Just because a government is authoritarian does not mean it by default socialist.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain to me how they were socialists then, I&#39;m interested to know. Hitler privatized state industries, I can&#39;t remember reading about any redistributing the wealth other than into Hitler&#39;s coffers and they certainly didn&#39;t have anything against private property. They seemed very unter/übermensch interested which kinda goes against the whole classless society thing too? </p>

<p>Imo, if it&#39;s not capitalism then it is socialism.  You could argue that socialism requires an equal redistribution of resources, but we both know that no real communist/socialist nation actually did that </p>

<p>So what do you do when the message is filled with aggressive/violent rhetoric? Do you still think it&#39;s a just some &quot;lone wolf&quot; that shouldn&#39;t tarnish the rest of the group? Why is it when it&#39;s a single muslim (or non-white/Christian) person who carries out an act like this they are seen as representing their entire group and are labeled terrorists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is it when it&#39;s a single muslim (or non-white/Christian) person who carries out an act like this they are seen as representing their entire group and are labeled terrorists?</p>

<p>Point taken, and I think that that&#39;s a great example for both of our positions: Imagine you tried saying that all muslims are terrorists. How would you treat you? How would the world treat you? That is not how you should be treated for your feelings towards those within Unite the Right, at all, even though I am sure you can see that it is the same thing. I know you can, because you used it as an example in just the same way. I don&#39;t think the way that people are treated for saying that all muslims are terrorists is either fair or right, and it would marginalize your concerns, if the shoe were truly on the other foot, for an army of SJWs to come at you for speaking your mind, and they use words like &quot;hateful&quot;, and &quot;caucaphobic asshole&quot;, etc, anytime you brought attention to the crimes you feel are traceable to the ideology of groups. I hate that same thing when I am talking about the crimes of Israel, or the Jewish control of media. </p>

<p>No, you should not be shamed for your opinions. You should be allowed a platform from which to cogently defend your arguments in a constructive way. They exist, they really do, but we are divided and divided and divided to the point that we just don&#39;t know how to talk to each other any longer. I think that you and everyone else deserve their opinions, and I don&#39;t think any of this needs to come to bloodshed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is makes the message of Unite the Right able to be spoken of as worthless by the media (any time someone brings up anything pro-white, people will say &quot;oh so you think ramming cars into protesters is cool, like your racist nazi fascist friend over there in the mustang did?&quot;), exactly at a time when it&#39;s expression was gaining traction. The issues and the people who consider them worth addressing are not dealt with in any meaningful way, and so this thing will continue to grow in the dark, inspired now by a bit of censorship and a newfound disdain for government as well, whereas they could be talked about openly and honestly, except for, you know, Jewish media, always trying to divide us, only allowing a spectrum of thought at one time, disallowing all others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean to choose your term for you, and I apologize for assuming; it wasn&#39;t my intention in the least. Were you saying, though, that all the protesters there were nazis, or that the protest itself was white nationalist/nazi? I believe you have said that you understand their fringe nature in relation to the Unite the Right movement.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s very disconcerting that you would feel that being pro-white is the same thing as being your idea of a Nazi.. I very much doubt that you carry this belief over onto any other race or group, and I would ask you to consider the parallels between the idea that only one race cannot campaign for the good of their own, and that of the late-war Nazi ideology which you know best. At the very least, ask yourself: &quot;would a Nazi be more likely to agree that only Jews shouldn&#39;t be allowed to have a pro-race, or would they be less likely?&quot;</p>

<p>You will have to forgive me for saying this, but you need to clean up these fissures which you abide in your thinking. They are tearing the world apart, and you could be helping to renew it. </p>

<p>Read it.  It&#39;s outdated as it was written before the election so it is about stopping Trump from being elected or assuming office, but the same strategy can be used now, and has been used in other countries.</p>

<p>Which is why I said it&#39;s outdated in that regard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now we&#39;re nearly 8 months into Trump&#39;s presidency and we&#39;re closer to adding more wars to our scorecard than ever before...closer to policing more of the world than this time last year. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this statement relevant?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think one person running over 20 others is the planned spark to push a DC dismantling protest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not just the event.  Think about what happens now. The guy that did it is almost certainly going to claim that he was afraid and it was unintentional, which means there is going to be a trial, which means this guy will probably get out on bail.  The left is not going to be happy about that.  What do you think they are going to do?  Protest?  Riot?  What happens if he gets acquitted or given a light sentence?   Consider the potential for more violence, real or false flag, in the interim.  The situation could ramp up very easily.</p>

<p>Also consider how the MSM is going to cover this story.  Remember when Republican Congressman Scalise was shot?  It only happened 2 months ago, but that story fucking disappeared as soon as we found out he was a left winger.  It didn&#39;t fit the narrative the MSM wants to push.  This story does.</p>

<p>I hope you are right, though, and this isn&#39;t the spark that leads to what would basically be a civil war.  </p>

<p>That Scalise story didn&#39;t disappear as soon as it was discovered he was a left winger. The news that he was a Sanders supporter was came about within hours of the shooting and was in the news for several days. It disappeared with the next breaking story just like this will, thats how the 24 hour news cycle works. They&#39;ll talk about this at the top of every hour for a day or so, maybe longer if there&#39;s a vigil or something at the site of the act...but then it&#39;s off to the next story which will likely be early morning trump tweets.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve said repeatedly that the linked image is outdated in that regard, But the Arab Spring, Euromaidan in Ukraine, et al, did not take place to prevent a person or government from coming to power, they were done to overthrow an existing government.   So I don&#39;t see why Trump being president would preclude a color revolution.</p>

<p>Also, FYI Trump hasn&#39;t even been President for 7 months yet.  Inauguration was January 20th.</p>

<p>As for your claim that this story will disappear in a few days, I guess we&#39;ll see.  I don&#39;t think it will.</p>

<p>An American died at the hands of an American protest, which is a terrible thing to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, and I only fear it&#39;s going to get worse.</p>

<p>The trouble with modern media/news is that everyone jumps to their conclusion and pinion so fast, even without any verification or facts in yet from police/authorities beyond what we can all see.</p>

<p>It happened with the London runner being pushed under a bus this week; all the news sites pushing a photo and name of a suspect before he&#39;d even been spoken to by police properly. Then turns out he wasn&#39;t even in the country when it occurred, but his name is now associated with it now and people move onto the next thing/person!</p>

<p>He hijacked the car? No way he used his own. He got within the police barricade? Oh, okay...</p>

<p>No one at a nationalist rally (police included) got off a shot?</p>

<p>Right...i wonder what move is being made under the guise of this deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, WW2 Nazis wanted non-native ppl to leave Germany and eventually they started killing non-aryans.  That is truly reprehensible.</p>

<p>But to suggest anyone right wing or who might be right wing is a Nazi and therefore they want all non-whites to die is pretty disgusting imo </p>

<p>I&#39;m not right wing, but I support anyone&#39;s right to protest non-violently.  I didn&#39;t vote for trump, and frankly have never voted.  If I did vote it would&#39;ve been Jill.</p>

<p>But you would probably call me a right wing Nazi who wants all non-whites to die just because I&#39;m not freaking out about a group of ppl trying to peacefully unite or w/e</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, though. Nazism is very specific. Christianity, for example, isn&#39;t - you&#39;ve got Catholics and Protestants, and within them traditional Catholics and Orthodox, Calvinists/Lutherans/Methodists/and all the rest. There might be some fringe Christian who kills someone because he thinks god told him to do it, but Christianity doesn&#39;t have an inherent, unified message of violence. Nazism does: it&#39;s built on driving out or killing non-European whites.</p>

Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t Nazism a political socialist party? </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably a stretch. I&#39;m just trying to make some idea up here. But WHY can&#39;t Nazism have a moderate side like Christianity and Islam do when they originally weren&#39;t? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a very accurate analogy. A better one would be ISIS. Yes, being a member of ISIS you are explicitly supporting a cause that promotes violence. The analogy does not work when you expand it out to Islam, as it is a huge religion with plenty of peaceful worshipers.</p>

<p>So all people who use their gut and logic, which is literally <em>all people</em>, when investigating matters of truth are on par with Nancy Grace? </p>

<p>For 100,000 years before the advent of classism, about 10,000 years ago, humans thrived in egalitarian, anarchic bands. So, most of human history can be characterized as anarchic. </p>

<p>Anyway, just because, in modern history, anarchism hasn&#39;t had any major success doesn&#39;t indicate anything about potential future successes. What happened to waiting for the facts to emerge before &quot;prematurely&quot; jumping to conclusions, hypocrite?</p>

<p>Here are the facts: He was present at an alt-right rally, gunned his car into people protesting the rally, and sped away. </p>

<p>You&#39;re saying it&#39;s unreasonable to conclude, based on that information, that he was aligned with alt-rightists? Really?? Would you also hesitate to conclude that individuals who bomb and/or open fire on mosques are Islamophobic? You are quite dumb, are you not?</p>

<p>Right. That is a crucial fact. This person&#39;s aim was to deliberately maim and murder people belonging to the protesting group. Logic denotes that, since it&#39;s incredibly unlikely for an ingroup member to do this to their own kind and that since this, as an act of war, was not a neutral act, the perpetrator was an enemy of that group. Since tensions were high between the marchers and their protesters, one can reasonably deduce that the perpetrator was with the marching group, which is an enemy of the protesting group.</p>

<p>You are dumb. GTFO and die in a hole somewhere.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. My argument stands on its own, regardless of my insults. Dummy. </p>

<p>And if this man were Muslim the President and everyone in the media would have called it terrorism by now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Therein lays the issue.</strong> People like you say this, yet when there were people driving busses into crowds in Europe, it wasn&#39;t labeled terrorism. They were a &quot;lone wolf&quot; or whatever. It was an &quot;act of aggression&quot;. </p>

<p>The point is - Trump should have immediately said this was terrorism. The president of France should have immediately called it <em>terrorism</em>. EVERYONE SHOULD BE CALLING EVERY ACT OF TERRORISM, TERRORISM. </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly very fucking frustrated. The left and the right are picking and choosing what to call terrorism and what not to. The left and the right pick and choose what to call something because it simply makes them look good and their opposition bad, but we shouldn&#39;t be giving a fuck about what makes us look good and address the issue that whats happening in the world right now is insane. </p>

<p>And then, people like me, who chose not to associate with any political party because I just simply don&#39;t agree with anyone, get ostracized, basterdized and labeled if we don&#39;t belong to one or another. </p>

<p>I commented on the top post on /Starterpacks right now called &quot;The 2017 KKK Starter Pack&quot; and said, &quot;You people upvoting this make me sick&quot;. Why? Because it&#39;s a total generalization of a group of people who, 99% of aren&#39;t Nazi&#39;s. It&#39;s aimed to totally evoke hatred 110%. If it was a post that said was just as horrible and was aimed at the left, <strong>id call the people upvoting that sick too.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s just hit piece after hit piece after hit piece from the left to the right and the right to the left. &quot;You&#39;re a Nazi!&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re a cuck&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re a Nazi!&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re a cuck!&quot;. </p>

<p>Just shut the fuck up. You&#39;re all so wrapped up in your hatred of one another that you&#39;re totally ignoring and forgetting that people are committing atrocities and it shouldn&#39;t matter who they are, we should all be condemning it no matter what. </p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s hatred for one another is breeding such dangerous ideologies. </p>

<p>Democrats, Liberals, Socialists etc. don&#39;t see Republicans, Conservatives and even Libertarians as people with &quot;opposite view points&quot; anymore, they see them as an <em>enemy</em> which is fucking scary. The same is said for Conservatives and Republicans. They don&#39;t see Democrats and Liberals as &quot;people with different viewpoints&quot; but as enemies. </p>

<p>You all see each other as dangerous enemies of each other. As people you want to &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;eliminate&quot;. People you want to &quot;shut the voice up&quot; forever. Its horrifying. </p>

<p>It&#39;s horrifying that if I tell someone I don&#39;t agree with them, they become instantly filled with a hatred of me and im seen as a literal enemy. Someone they can&#39;t trust anymore - NOT AS A PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a rabid sickness that&#39;s infecting this country. A virus that lays dormant and it&#39;s trigger to become active is when someone disagrees with the other person. Their total behavior and emotion changes. </p>

<p>It was never like that. EVER. It used to just be, &quot;yea im a democrat.&quot; or &quot;yea im a republican&quot; and no one gave a fuck. No one cared. </p>

<p>NOW, its &quot;Im a republican&quot; met with the response, &quot;YOU&#39;RE A FUCKING NAZI&quot;, or &quot;Im a democrat&quot; met with &quot;YOU&#39;RE A SOCIALIST THREAT&quot;. </p>

<p>Fuck politics, fuck people who label other people so quickly, fuck people with thin skin and fuck all of this hate you all regurgitate at each other. </p>

<p>Is this a joke? It was resoundingly labelled terrorism. The difference is that people wanted to know the <em>cause</em> of the action instead of kneejerking that clearly Muslims need to get out of Europe. People were claiming that because the terrorists were brown, they were therefore illegals and agents of ISIS, when it turns out to be citizens doing shit and ISIS claiming responsibility for someone they never got in touch with. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, with this car driver, people are doing everything they can to say &quot;well, he panicked&quot; and &quot;well, he didn&#39;t initiate it&quot;, so therefore it&#39;s not fair to call him a terrorist.</p>

<p>The tiki torches are literally about this rally. You&#39;re specifically claiming that 99% of the people at this white supremacist rally aren&#39;t actually nazis or maybe even don&#39;t believe it. But let&#39;s call it what it is: a small occupying force. We have &quot;soldiers&quot; coming in, chanting things like &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnonJournal/status/896203496952868864">blood and soil</a>&quot;, a classic nazi phrase, while <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/896362457341591552">carrying flags and shields</a>. These were people <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/896385942495285248">waving nazi flags</a>, wearing <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/896353431597797377/">shirts with quotes from Hitler</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/letsgomathias/status/896385163818659841">marching down the streets</a>. That last one is a bit long for payoff, but it has a group of people identifying as National Socialists, fighting for a better tomorrow. Just how many people do you think were there if you think that&#39;s only 1% of the crowd?</p>

<p>This was a bad group of people, plain and simple. This isn&#39;t someone just with a different view, this is someone who fundamentally sees me as an enemy because I&#39;m not them.</p>

<p>And if this man were Muslim the President and everyone in the media would have called it terrorism by now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Therein lays the issue.</strong> People like you say this, yet when there were people driving busses into crowds in Europe, it wasn&#39;t labeled terrorism. They were a &quot;lone wolf&quot; or whatever. It was an &quot;act of aggression&quot;. </p>

<p>Would you please shut your face?
When the Truck drove into people in Berlin it took five minutes to be called terrorism.
When Charlie Hebdo got attacked it was called terrorism right away.
You know what it was called when german police found luggage rigged to explode?Terrorism.</p>

<p>You know what country doesn&#39;t call terrorism by white people terrorism? The USA and it&#39;s current president.
You know what they call it when a white dude shoots black people in a church?Mental illness,lone wolf.
Hell,the knee jerk reaction is to scream &quot;Muslim&quot;</p>

<p>Check out 4chan and T_D right now.They are grasping at straws.Dude who ran the protesters over did in self defence, it was an accident,he was a leftist,false flag.And those are the people who feel closest to the president and vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Colloquially, the definition will vary (often from person to person). However, the Patriot Act added a legal definition of &quot;domestic terrorism&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… the term ‘domestic terrorism’ means activities that involve acts
dangerous to human life that are a violation of criminal laws of the
United States or any State” and (B) “appear to be intended (i) to
intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a
government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a
government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C)
occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t terrorism. James Fields&#39;s actions were in self-defense. Antifa and other far left thugs have a well-known history of blocking traffic illegally (which is what they were doing in Charlottesville as they did not even have a permit for their unlawful &quot;counter-protest&quot;, much less for congregating on the street) and then dragging people out of their cars once they politely stop and beating them severely (sometimes to death). By all accounts, on the day in question they were (with the cooperation of the police) attacking members of the UTR rally the entire time with a variety of weapons. </p>

<p>In the case of James Fields, they had already cracked his windshield before the incident even happened and were still throwing projectiles at his car. Meanwhile, the UTR rally he was a part of had peacefully dispersed by this time (by orders of the police, which they followed) and he was simply trying to go home. The people he had a confrontation with <em>chose</em> to gather on the street they were at because they knew that people from the UTR rally were going to be leaving via it and they specifically wanted to block them from doing so in order to attack them. They chose to pick a fight with him. He did not want a confrontation with them.</p>

<p>So given these facts, what should he have done? Wait until he was surrounded? According to him, he panicked, and I believe it. He was surrounded by people who wanted to kill him for expressing his opinion at a rally that was completely peaceful before <em>they</em> chose to escalate things. Anyone would panic and do something regretful in the same situation. His intentions were obviously not malicious. If he had really wanted to hurt people, he could have ran over 50 more of them with how concentrated they were. Cars are dangerous, and it only takes a quick lunge to do a lot of damage, a fact unfortunately made clear in this situation (which is why it&#39;s not a good idea to illegally block traffic). He made a mistake, willingly or due to improper operation of his vehicle we do not yet know, and he will and should see some consequences as a result, but don&#39;t pretend he was entirely at fault.</p>

<p>Like I said before, they picked the fight, not him. He merely ended it. You don&#39;t want to accidentally get run over by a scared kid? Then don&#39;t menacingly surround people with weapons while illegally blocking traffic. It&#39;s that simple. Obviously the death is a tragedy, but don&#39;t pretend the people that got hurt weren&#39;t playing with fire. They were. They just wanted the other side to get burned. And if it had gone down that way (which it was before this incident), you would have never heard a word about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing the links. I was referring to the Fed classification of these events.  For the Fed to classify it as terrorism (from my understanding) it requires the criminals intent or MO to be &quot;insight fear and intimidation.&quot;  I&#39;m sure there is more to the definition than what I shared but you get my point.   I believe the Charlottesville event was definitely terrorism but again I don&#39;t know exactly the method or logic the Fed&#39;s use to know for sure.  Often I feel the media is quick to either distance an event from being labeled terrorism or quick to call it terrorism.  Good example is this one: <a href="http://www.theroot.com/james-hodgkinson-proves-white-men-are-bulletproof-1796137659">http://www.theroot.com/james-hodgkinson-proves-white-men-are-bulletproof-1796137659</a>.  It seems the label assignment comes from the Fed later down the road.  I realized this when reviewing data from the fed in an article about domestic terrorism.  Many of the events like we consider terrorism doesn&#39;t always get assigned that way in their database.  However when you research the web you find articles claiming otherwise.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.  I think there&#39;s two conversations going on.  About the respective ideological camps and their supporters in the media calling acts out as terrorism, and then the feds prosecuting it as such.  </p>

<p>I do agree that Hodgkinson seems like he very much should fit that definition.  But apparently Trump&#39;s justice department disagreed.  Sessions said today that he thinks the Charlottesville attack fits the definition however.  So it&#39;s hard to argue these are political actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree but still find it hypocritical when the official ruling of the classification hasn&#39;t been determined.  The Fed&#39;s just opened the case and until the case is finished we won&#39;t know how it is classified.  The Fed&#39;s will say initially it &quot;seems&quot; to fit or it will be investigated as an act of terrorism but it isn&#39;t official until they conclude and share findings.  Therefore we are all assuming.  Yet when we have other events that involves a Muslim - we hear the right calling it an act of terrorism and the left being cautious not to call it terrorism.   That is why I say it is hypocritical but agree to your points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I won&#39;t disagree.  Both sides want to slow down or speed up the labeling of terrorists depending on how it supports their narrative.  Personally I try to look at it on a case by case basis regardless of how I feel.  </p>

<p>Though I&#39;m also one of those Sam Harris liberals who is not a big fan of Muslims fundamentalists or Christian fundamentalists, so it generally fits my narrative cause the psychos usually come from those wells.  Hodgkinson being fairly exceptional, and I do consider his act terrorism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?</p>

<p>Consider two counter-points if you&#39;re willing.</p>

<p>1) If you are an oppressed minority (ex: go ahead and look up how black people go to jail longer than white people for the same crimes), you generally face an inherent disadvantage in life in the US. Not always, obviously. Generally speaking. Therefore, when you&#39;re proud of being a Muslim, black, or Mexican, or w/e, you&#39;re basically saying you&#39;re proud that you are able to handle dealing with the inherent disadvantage. Now, let&#39;s consider whether whites overall face these same inherent disadvantages....well up until 1865, many, many blacks were slaves. After that many lacked the education or skills that white people got in school and from their more educated relatives to succeed on their own. </p>

<p>So white people took advantage of them ala Jim Crow laws and sharecropping. Shit like this continued for many more decades. If you use your imagination or Google, you can find out how whites oppressed other races through institutionalized and legislatively racist laws. For example, up until 1965, it wasn&#39;t illegal to discriminate based on skin color, etc. It was okay to be racist. I wonder if that could have any effect on minority groups? Like maybe when a black person moved into a neighborhood of white people, those white people decided to move away, causing homes in that neighborhood to lose value, attracting lower income people, which is correlated with crime, which of course causes stress, which makes it difficult to focus on studying or working hard-things that allow for social mobility.</p>

<p>2) &quot;White&quot; is used commonly to refer to people of a lighter, pinker skin color. It refers to a fucking massive group of people-people in dozens of countries across Europe, Jews, people in Russia, people in the US, lighter-skinned people. It doesn&#39;t refer to a single racial group in the same way that &quot;Mexican&quot; or &quot;Black&quot; does. There&#39;s nothing wrong with Irish pride, British pride, French pride, Russian pride, etc. But when you use the term &quot;White pride&quot; you&#39;re basically saying you&#39;re proud of the achievements of all white people-Irish, British, French, Russian, etc, etc. Seems a bit unfair that white people have access to all this backstory, whereas Mexican people and black people don&#39;t. Like, wait a second, say you&#39;re French. Do you know get to take pride in things that Russians and British people did too? Does that mean a Mexican person can take pride in what an Asian person did? Because they&#39;re both &quot;not white&quot; right? If you have white pride, is everyone not white allowed to have &quot;brown (+black) pride&quot;? If so, does the schema for that exist in society? I would argue that it doesn&#39;t. Until it does, there&#39;s an inherent inequality in calling yourself white vs the fractured groups that would comprise a hypothetical &quot;not-white&quot; or &quot;brown&quot;. When people see a white person, they subconsciously associate that person&#39;s backstory to include British, French, Russian, German, Jews, etc, etc. When people see a non-white person, they usually see them only as either Asian, Latino, Black, etc. See how that&#39;s unfair? </p>

<p>Ahhhh this is the part where the racists talk about what was built but ignore that the playing field was never even.  White people have never had to compete in this country with any group without laws giving whites the advantage.  Shit most white people won&#39;t even acknowledge that the only reason there&#39;s a middle class is because of affirmative action from the government in the form of the New Deal, GI Bill and FHA loans. All of the benefits from those programs were legally kept from Black people through racism and discrimination.  </p>

<p>As for glorifying gangs and drug use.  Well I guess TV shows like Sapranos, Sons of Anarchy, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Shield all show wholesome white life and doesn&#39;t glorify any negative behavior.  As for drug use......last I checked heroin and Oxy addiction is a huge problem for WHITE PEOPLE.  Seems to have y&#39;all dropping like flies.</p>

<p>Stupid white bitch not giving anyone a chance in life. Snoop&#39;s gonna have to shoot a couple more people to get ahead.</p>

<p>If only black people had rights in America, maybe Bill Cosby would be in jail. It&#39;s so hard being a person of black skin and not having the right to a lawyer or legal process. Certainly has nothing to do with class and ability to pay for a lawyer, I&#39;m sure it has some legally irrelevant correlation with race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pride of your heritage. Like, maybe you as a white person are a descendant of Russian immigrants, then it&#39;s okay to be proud of it. Or maybe your ancestors have been in America since its inception, and you&#39;re proud that they built the nation it is today. If you, however, are proud of the amount of melanin on your skin, then that&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>Black people can be proud of being black because of the history of black people in the US. They have no way to trace their ancestors back to their countries of origin, and up until about 50 years ago were treated as 2nd class citizens, not to mention slavery. Today, they have it better, but they still have many problems. If you listen to rap, you can often hear how the artists talk about how they came from the bottom of society, and they&#39;re proud of the people that manage to get out of there. 
Just get in their shoes.</p>

<p>I applaud your introspection but I have to say: When you ally yourself with fascists, neo-nazis, and klansmen, violence is inherent to your political program. The only difference thing that stops Nazis from engaging in street violence is the fact that their long-term goal is to gain control over the police and military, and have <em>them</em> do the violence for them.</p>

All it shows is a lady rolling off the hood just like a professional stunt woman and the camera looks <em>away</em> right after the action happens. The narrator was talking about how it was a &quot;diverse group&quot; just before the crash; it couldn&#39;t be more staged looking. </p>

Boston let it happen in a hunt for a teenager. Baltimore fought it a bit, or rather the rioters steered clear of the containment area. In this case, it was simply away from the containment area (the park with the statue). I don&#39;t know the right answer, but I don&#39;t support marshal law.</p>

<p>the only conspiracy i can see out of todays events were that a peaceful permitted rally was attacked by anti free speech zealots, and for some reason, the mayor had the police stand down instead of protecting the organized and permitted rally. some dude (one person kind of rules out a conspiracy) with apparently not a whole lot to lose driving his car into a group of people is news worthy and worth a conversation in the correct sub, but i am not sure this is the correct forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So your perspective is that one protest is OK but the other isn&#39;t? Why don&#39;t you go ahead and explain that.</p>

<p>&quot;Anti white&quot;? Where are you getting that? Why are you so salty that people have a problem with hateful, racist people? I love my freedom of speech because it means I get to explain to people like you how sad and wrong your beliefs are. AMERICA!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are confused and backwards. your logic is not based in any reality. you talk positively about freedom of speech and say AMERICA!, but you side with the side that is anti free speech. maybe you can explain things to your dumb commie friends.</p>

<p>as far as anti white, it is what it is. the left by and large is anti white. that has been the overwhelming sentiment particularly since this last election. i dont know what you guys expect from the white guys. these people go to work, pay taxes, have illegals and bums leeching off of their social system, have criminals predating their neighborhoods, have ideologues screaming anti white rhetoric at every turn, and now recently the left wants to play identity politics. what in the world do you dopes expect the response to be? this is an easy prediction. white people more and more will realize that they are the only potential group that shares an identity and does not act to advance its agenda. not only that but, when they try to unite to asses and forward their agenda, they are attacked. this will lead to more and more white people, just ordinary white people deciding to identify as white and begin to push a more pro white agenda. of course the morons of the world will call them nazis for daring to have a positive identity of white, because thats what they have been trained to do, but the mechanics of what is going on here is not rocket science. a group of people is being bullied into a corner by other groups, and they are going to respond. does a white man saying he is proud to be white make him a bigot, a nazi, or a racist any more than a mexican saying he is proud of his heritage or a black fighting for black rights or a gay dude on gay pride day? if you can explain to me the function that makes white people evil for identifying as white and attempting to forward their agenda, but a black dude identifying as black and pushing a pro black agenda is good, a gay dude having gay pride is good, and a mexican dude being proud of his culture and heritage is good and ok, then i will call you the winner and leave this alone. the problem is that you cant. it is a double standard and a hypocrisy that for whatever reason is prevalent in our society. it would be understandable if whites were actually bad people, but they generally aren&#39;t. they are among if not the most charitable on earth, they commit far less crime than other demographics, they generally are hard workers, and family people. there is no excuse for the hatred against them. so when you talk about racists and bigots, do not leave out your white hating friends.</p>

<p>you want to paint any white person that wants to advocate for white interests as a nazi while you claim not to be a bigot, and you say you are pro-free speech and AMERICA!, but join the side that is actively engaged in shutting down any speech they deem harmful, your entire belief system is a contradiction, you have no arguments based in reality, and you obviously haven&#39;t thought about the counter to your arguments. i feel sorry for your father, he probably had high expectations, spent a ton of money to send you to some uni, just so they could turn your brain to shit. one day you will look back on all of this and know that i was right about everything, and that you just weren&#39;t prepared to grasp it yet. so sad, high hopes.</p>

<p>WTF are white interests? Feel free to explain. I&#39;d imagine they are similar to the interests of any other racial group - have food to feed their kids, have a job, don&#39;t get murdered by domestic terrorists...</p>

<p>My father, who is very proud of me, didn&#39;t spend a dime on my education. I had a full ride scholarship. How about you? What was your education like? Is YOUR father proud of you? Is he proud to have a child who brings personal attacks to the debate table? A child who believes his/her race is superior to that of others? I sure hope not.</p>

<p>Are you that incapable of having an adult conversation that you need to attack my origins? Or are you just too uncomfortable with your beliefs to defend them?</p>

He pretty much ripped apart every news story and decoded the Masonic symbols/numerology, etc. It was an eye-opening channel (to say the least). Realizing just how deep the level of manipulation, fabrication and embedded symbology goes was beyond alarming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just remember all western nations have to watch out for tens of millions of Muslims world wide, who are considered and labeled terrorists. This is an open fact and not debateable. Ill say it again, (tens of millions) world wide are openly in support of terrosim. There are not even a million so called Neo Nazis in the United States.  Most of whom are in Jail or live out in the boonies to be left alone. 
And every white person who has a shaved head isnt a nazi. And every batshit crazy white trash person isnt a Nazi. You can also be a racist SOB ,but still not be a Nazi. If there was a shit ton of Neo Nazi making peoples lives shitty then trust me it would be known and made public daily like Muslim bombing are. And yes , they exist but on a world wide scale?. Not even close to a national threat as Islam produces.  So shitty events like this one are way harder to find because it falls in the range of crazy and NOT DOCTRINE BASED.  Which the Qur&#39;an openly states that terrorism is Jihad amd Jihad is the destruction of amyone not Fully Muslim including peaceful muslims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it black supremacy if no diversity is forced upon countries with mostly black people living there?
White supremacy is just as stupid as black supremacy [BLM/Black only universities etc].</p>

<p>To me islam and white supremacy are equally shite. One oppresses all freedoms and women and practices laws that only fit into the middle ages. 
Such as marrying your rapist, getting stoned to death for being raped, genital mutilation, paedophilia and anti gay to the extent of killing them [not just isis but here in Europe too, just because]. So called &#39;honour&#39; killings of your own children etc, etc, etc...</p>

<p>The other one wants to be segregated [but haven&#39;t actually killed anyone in their name in recent times].
And as you said, one is a religion with millions of member and spreading constantly, the other consists of a few crackpots, easily outnumbered.</p>

<p>Oh and if you want to leave islam, death is the going penalty for it.
So yeah, I think we have a definitive answer to which one is more dangerous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we sure it really is terrorism? Or would &#39;&#39;Hate Crime&#39;&#39; fit the bill more correctly in this situation?</p>

<p>I personally dont care what its called--it was attempted murder, or attempt to cause bodily harm at the very least.  My only problem with every act of aggression like this being labelled as a &#39;&#39;terrorist&#39;&#39; attack, is that once our own citizens are being put on watch for terrorist activity, the rights of our own people, in our own country will very quickly begin to diminish.  You guys do know what the &#39;Patriot Act&#39; is, right?</p>

<p>Eventually, anything will be called an act of terror, and if the term starts getting used loosely, the sentencing/punishment and all other things associated with handling terrorist activity will begin to be used loosely.</p>

<p>I dont think people should be upset about this (the terminology)--i think people should think about the implications of beginning to use the word terrorism more freely, and the impact it could have on our country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situations are not comparable.  The Muslim terrorists rammed into innocent shoppers or people celebrating a holiday.  The Antifa/BLM were deliberately confronting the alt-right group.  This is not to say the violence should be condoned, but it is not too surprising that it happened.  I believe the leftists were pelting his car with rocks and he panicked. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if it can be classified as a terrorist attack, these people aren&#39;t just civilians going about their business, which I think would be a requirement.</p>

The media would shut up about it in 2 days if this was a Muslim attack, but this is going to blow up the media for weeks. It was awful but not like 50 people dead awful. What is so bad about it is the psych warfare that this is going to allow for. They will try and get people to identify whites as Nazis. There may even become talk of dangerous political speech, and the need to stop it and monitor it. </p>

<p>Exactly, and I only fear it&#39;s going to get worse.</p>

<p>The trouble with modern media/news is that everyone jumps to their conclusion and pinion so fast, even without any verification or facts in yet from police/authorities beyond what we can all see.</p>

<p>It happened with the London runner being pushed under a bus this week; all the news sites pushing a photo and name of a suspect before he&#39;d even been spoken to by police properly. Then turns out he wasn&#39;t even in the country when it occurred, but his name is now associated with it now and people move onto the next thing/person!</p>

The guy that did it is almost certainly going to claim that he was afraid and it was unintentional, which means there is going to be a trial, which means this guy will probably get out on bail.  The left is not going to be happy about that.  What do you think they are going to do?  Protest?  Riot?  What happens if he gets acquitted or given a light sentence?   Consider the potential for more violence, real or false flag, in the interim.  The situation could ramp up very easily.</p>

<p>Also consider how the MSM is going to cover this story.  Remember when Republican Congressman Scalise was shot?  It only happened 2 months ago, but that story fucking disappeared as soon as we found out he was a left winger.  It didn&#39;t fit the narrative the MSM wants to push.  This story does.</p>

<p>I hope you are right, though, and this isn&#39;t the spark that leads to what would basically be a civil war.  </p>
