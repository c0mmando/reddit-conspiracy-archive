       The people you're responding to are the most divisive and obvious shills i've seen in a long time.

       I mean...when someone blows up an airplane it's a safe assumption it's some Muslim dude. Just like it's a safe assumption the white side that drove through the crowd protesting against Nazis is a white supremacist. Do we know for sure? No, but it's an obvious working theory.

       Redneck pontiac? I have fair skin and a red beard. I also come from a very  racially and culturally diverse family and harbor ZERO ethnocentric or racial hatred of any kind. I ask you, because of my appearance,  would you profile me as a white nationalist or supremacist if I happened to pull into the parking space next to you while driving a pontiac?

       I would suspect a black man is driving it. And so would you. Glad we are both being honest now instead of just me.

       Perhaps you shouldn't be such an ass when I suggested that a white guy driving a white person car that just killed anti-Nazi protesters just might, maybe, just a wee little chance be on the side of the Nazis.

       You didn't show a flaw in anything. You asked a question that showed how consistent I am in my beliefs. You, on the other hand, would assume that someone driving in a typical, black persons car would be black but somehow its illogical to think that the white male in the white male car that just murdered people shouldn't be believed to be one of the Nazis.

       Honest question: So you see nothing wrong with personalizing a cold, souless material object as a white persons car or to use your own words a "redneck Pontiac" ? I am a firm believer that these are precisely the symptoms of our conditioning that we need to break free from. 
I am not attacking you. I was abrasive earlier and I am sorry.

       It depends on why you do it. If you utilize differences to try and figure out what's going on with limited information, heuristics are completely appropriately. If I take statistics that say more black folks  commit crimes and use that to discriminate against them, I'm being an asshole racist. One is a problem. One isn't.

       There's a video of he car up the road not going very fast. When it's at the camera man he starts to speed up. From the video you can see there weren't very many people around him for hi to be scared and plow into others.

       I feel like you're a short and thin company man/accountant type of guy who wears square rimless glasses and vertically striped pastel button downs from JcPenny that are the same style he's got since his mom showed him how to pick a dress shirt. And, I'm like the class clown that frustrated everyone with how little he tried and how much he fucked with everything. I bet it still gets to you that people like me win the talent shows, but if it's any consolation, I thought your Prelude in Cmin was lovely, and I could tell you spent a lot of time on it.

       as Nazis. They chant Nazi slogans, wear swastikas, and wear shirts with quotes from Hitler on them. What exactly is your objection to identifying them as such?

       I'm sorry, but you're thinking of the words of a group of less than 100, the actions of 1 man, and then pasting the emotional reactions that those actions inspire within you onto an entire group of people. It's like if there were a video of some BLM protesters who were saying "we're all felons and that's what we do!", and someone said "all black people are felons", you would be like "hold up".
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's tough when we have so much emotion invested all these different places, but for the sake of society, I ask that you would stop living based on reactions, and start living according to principles. In this case, it would be asking "do the sins of a single member of a group taint the whole, no matter how large?", then deciding on an answer, and choosing to apply that rationality to everything you encounter, equally, until which time there comes information that you decide warrants changing your mind. For instance, you cannot on the one hand believe that all "Trump supporters" are nazis, while on the other saying that not all Muslims are terrorists, for reasons I hope are clear, if you are a person who stands on principle. We need your higher self in this fight, and those that wish to inspire your hatred are very much not your allies.

       You are defending people who enjoy doing Nazi salutes and chanting "fuck you faggots", "Jews will not replace me", and other, sometimes worse, Nazi slogans.

       I did not say all Trump supporters are Nazis. But the people protesting today were at a Nazi protest. Educate yourself.

       No, they weren't at a Nazi protest. They were at a protest against taking down a statue of Robert E. Lee, and they were chanting "you will not replace us".

       Retarded. The guy in Charleston just hated Blacks he wasn't Conservative that I'm aware of, I'm not sure what Violence your think Right Wingers committed at Bundy Ranch, No Clue what Colorado PP is, That Jewish Community Center was back in 2014. I said the last couple years. Everything I listed happened in the last 1 to 2 years. If they were allegedly planning an attack it doesn't count and the Portland Stabber was Left Wing Bernie Supporter so that counts for me. LMAO! You just Blew Yourself The Fuck Out Snowflake!!!

       I was talking about the Left Wing Violence at the Trump Rally in Chicago. That was 2016. Ok so I will give you the Colorado PP Violence one. And I will grudgingly give you the Bundy one but I doubt anyone actually shot at police. But still way more Left Wing Acts of Violence then right Wing Violence. When there is Right Wing Violence it's almost always one or two crazies. When it's Left Wing Violence it's huge groups of organized people who think it's OK to commit violence against those that think differently then them. Just look at all the Leftist Violence in Berkeley.

       Those are still weak examples compared to the right wing. Since you only wanna talk about things recently and you use words like retarded to describe things you don't like I'm gonna assume your pretty young. If you want a more complete view of domestic terrorism you should be more willing to take on information.

       OH God this assinine Fake News article gets brought out every single time someone on Reddit wants to excuse Islamic Terrorism or Left Wing Violence. Only people with their heads up their ass take it seriously. It's so stupid. Who the fuck cares about numbers of Terrorists attacks? Plus we aren't even talking about Terrorism we are taking about violence.

       One it is completely irrelevant to what we are talking about and two who the fuck cares about "number of Terrorists attacks"? Casualties/and or injuries is what is important. Only Liberal Fem-Boys take this article seriously

       So are the number of terrorist attacks. If more right-wing members are committing terror acts than islamic members, why do you assume islamic members are the ones who are inherently more violent?

       Oh God is this conversation retarded. First off me and your Buddy weren't even talking about Terror Attacks we were talking about the extreme amount of Political Violence coming from the Left. My guess would be because the Left is politically irrelevant so they are lashing out since they know they will be out of power for a long long time. Anyway why the Fuck would it matter? Right Wing Violence is obviously more likely to be classified as terrorism for starters. I mean was the extreme amount of violence that Bernie's parasites committed at Trump's rallies classified as an act of terrorism? It should have been. If it wasn't then you have your answer. But seriously why do you think the number of terror attacks from a certain group would be important?

       These guys were literally chanting Nazi slogans and giving Nazi salutes.  And this isn't isolated.  Any time Spencer shows up you'll see people giving the Nazi salute.  I don't know how much more clear it can be.  The nationalists haven't done enough to separate themselves from the white supremacist nationalists.   Not by a long shot.

       How would anybody predict a rando deciding to drive his car into someone?
I do hear right wingers talk about how great it would be to drive into protesters on every single comment thread discussing a left-wing protest. Every single time. Even though it's usually just one or two guys in those threads, it's disturbing.

       It's not about it not being a big deal. It's blowing things, marginally infrequent things, as I said before, out of proportion. It's irresponsible. Don't you people get that?

       If the truth is controversial, that isn't a good enough reason to stop speaking it. I detest the evil actions of men and women despite their labels and their political or religious identities. I'm sure we agree on that more than you're willing to admit. Don't misconstrue what I'm saying.

       If you believe terrorism committed by white supremacists is blown out of proportion, does that mean you're also willing to admit that Radical Islamic terrorism committed by middle-easterners / refugees is also blown out of proportion?
       <a href="http://www.snopes.com/2017/06/07/threat-extremists-more/">
        Some stats
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Between 12 September 2001 and 31 December 2016, there were 23 fatal “Radical Islamist Violent Extremist-Motivated Attacks,” resulting in a total of 119 deaths in the United States. In the same time period, there were 62 fatal “far-right violent extremist-motivated attacks”, leading to 106 deaths.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just two events account for more than half of the 119 deaths resulting from Muslim extremist attacks: the December 2015 San Bernardino attack, which killed 14 people, and the June 2016 Pulse night club attack, which killed 49 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the University of Maryland’s START consortium, between 12 September 2001 and 2016 there were 31 fatal “Islamist extremist” attacks, leading to 119 deaths.  In the same time period, there were 89 “far-right extremist” attacks, resulting in a total of 158 deaths.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to START, Muslim extremist violence killed seven times more people than far-right extremist violence between 1990 and 2016, despite five times fewer fatal attacks.  However, this period included the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the attacks of 11 September 2001, the two deadliest terrorist incidents in American history. When those outliers are removed from the figures, according to START, far-right extremist violence caused 272 deaths between 1990 and 2016 — more than twice as many as the 130 deaths from Islamic extremism during the same period.

       Not at all. Thank you for the stats. These are the other attacks that make shot supremacy marginal. Again, sorry people are butthurt over the facts. Because that sucks for them in so many aspects.

       <em>
        amount

       of attacks by white nationalists, which I also detest, is marginal in comparison to other terrorist attacks by other groups. This is a fact. Look it up. Please, for the rest of us, and yourself, do yourself a favor. Understand what you're talking about before you become all holier-than-thou.

       They're desperate for acceptance and attention. This last election cycle put them on the grand stage. They're loving it. People usually just downvoted them and they had no one to talk to. Now everyone downvotes them and goes off on them and they love it. They love feeling attacked because they think they're right when they get so much attention.

       A man was beaten unconscious by Antifa, that's not serious enough for you? For all we know, that man can very well be a vegetable or in another bad state that makes life miserable right now since the media covered it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not defending that asshole who drove into a crowd, killing one (that number can increase) and injuring 19 I believe, but you should really take a closer look on what left-extremists are doing before you call people hypocrites. Antifa has been declared a terrorist group for a reason. This growing problem is a two-sided coin where both sides are covered in sh*t and both sides needs a good cleaning.

       I'm not going to dispute your point or even downvote you, but I feel your argument is a false equivalency. Neo-nazism is a philosophy of violence, and anyone supporting it supports the annihilation of anyone they perceive as an enemy.

       Step 2. use agitators to start violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3. take away the first amendment rights of the racist rally who had permits to organize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 4. Give free reign to the Soros groups that have no permits.

       Step 5. Wait for someone on the oppressed side to flip out over the injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 6. Watch the engineered violence happen and use it to fuel and justify your agendas.

2: there was private property
3: they hated socialists and communists (and put them in concentration camps) and there was no distribution of wealth

       No they didn't. Major German corporations worked hand in hand with the Nazi's. IG Farben was one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Europe and the Nazi's contracted them to create Zyklon B to kill Jews in the concentration camps. They also used Jewish labour in those camps.

       They did not just contract out. IG Farban for example, worked with the Nazis to determine what chemical plants they could seize and which one's they should build. IG Farban also got access to free Jewish labour for their plants. That is the antithesis of socialism. However, the merging of the state and corporations is one of the defining characteristics of fascism.

       The more we keep arguing the more I feel like fascism and socialism might just be Hegelian dialectic.  I.e. What is a fascist state if everyone is employed by the same corporation?  A socialist state.
      </p>

       What is a socialist state that operates with other capitalists countries and global corps as if the socialist state itself was just a corp?  See what I'm getting at?

       No, they really were not. Hitler added socialist to the party's title to appeal to the German working class. The first people the Nazis went after were socialists and communists.

       He was trying to appeal to the working class, not socialists in particular. The Nazi's knew that the working class was sympathetic to socialist ideals. They thought they could trick them into believing they were on their side by adding one word to their name.

       Because they were authoritarian. I never said it was a absolute free market in Nazi Germany, just that it was not a socialist economy. Major German corporations still existed under Nazi rule and were not run by the government. They kept their profits and the owners still got insanely rich. You really need to research what socialism really is. Just because a government is authoritarian does not mean it by default socialist.

       Nice fresh flags, straight out of the packaging. That's how you can tell they're real Nazis. Because they left their good flags at home in their Nazi shrines. It's weird how their clothes scream "I work for a living", but all of the people themselves look like college trombone players.. I will say that. Either way, 1 Nazi flag=everybody around it for 2 miles is a Nazi, of course. I'm not disagreeing with you. I mean we all know basic SJMath.

       It's weird how sometimes people that we think of as evil say good things. Like there are some quotes of Hitler's, not this one, that I straight up agree with. It's weird, right? Almost makes me think that.... But no, nevermind, that's crazy..

       Ah yes, I have plenty of shirts with quotes from Mussolini and Idi Amin. Fuck right off. Not to mention the fact that the shirt's quote is about evolutionary Darwinism and the fight to survive. The shirt's message is about how the white race needs to survive, a clear Nazi message.

       Explain to me how they were socialists then, I'm interested to know. Hitler privatized state industries, I can't remember reading about any redistributing the wealth other than into Hitler's coffers and they certainly didn't have anything against private property. They seemed very unter/übermensch interested which kinda goes against the whole classless society thing too?

       Define socialism for me.  There's a lot of wiggle room if we both go off the other's definition of what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo, if it's not capitalism then it is socialism.  You could argue that socialism requires an equal redistribution of resources, but we both know that no real communist/socialist nation actually did that

       The speech you want to protect is promoting the removal of other people's rights based on their race (blood) and where they came from (soil). I am not responsible for protecting that speech, and will not be response for protecting that speech. So fuck off with your first amendment bullshit attempt to back up this hatred.

       We have protections, that go so far, but the only "right" that anyone has is responsibility. I hate it when any protesters have their message be subverted by a single person who resorts to violence, I really do, but, you know, this isn't some corporation's lobby that we go sit in, this is confrontation.

       So what do you do when the message is filled with aggressive/violent rhetoric? Do you still think it's a just some "lone wolf" that shouldn't tarnish the rest of the group? Why is it when it's a single muslim (or non-white/Christian) person who carries out an act like this they are seen as representing their entire group and are labeled terrorists?

      <p>
       Point taken, and I think that that's a great example for both of our positions: Imagine you tried saying that all muslims are terrorists. How would you treat you? How would the world treat you? That is not how you should be treated for your feelings towards those within Unite the Right, at all, even though I am sure you can see that it is the same thing. I know you can, because you used it as an example in just the same way. I don't think the way that people are treated for saying that all muslims are terrorists is either fair or right, and it would marginalize your concerns, if the shoe were truly on the other foot, for an army of SJWs to come at you for speaking your mind, and they use words like "hateful", and "caucaphobic asshole", etc, anytime you brought attention to the crimes you feel are traceable to the ideology of groups. I hate that same thing when I am talking about the crimes of Israel, or the Jewish control of media.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, you should not be shamed for your opinions. You should be allowed a platform from which to cogently defend your arguments in a constructive way. They exist, they really do, but we are divided and divided and divided to the point that we just don't know how to talk to each other any longer. I think that you and everyone else deserve their opinions, and I don't think any of this needs to come to bloodshed.

       Even if it is, this shit is fucked up. Seems you're saying that because it's a false flag there's no need to discuss this. Plus, I hope you're meaning it in the sense that it was done in an attempt to push an agenda, not that those are crisis actors. I've seen lots of other footage of false flag events with crisis actors, and this seems way more genuine (from what footage we currently have).

       Luckily they were getting their camera gear together on the sidewalk. They were barely missed from the way it looks. I dunno, I just figured I put my 2 cents in. Maybe there were crisis actors, but there were definitely real people, students, etc inches away.

       Could be but it's still notable how quickly pol, foxnew, etc came to such conclusions. I am open to finding out info about the suspect as it comes, but for now people are talking out of their assess,  including ones labeling him a nazi.

       That is makes the message of Unite the Right able to be spoken of as worthless by the media (any time someone brings up anything pro-white, people will say "oh so you think ramming cars into protesters is cool, like your racist nazi fascist friend over there in the mustang did?"), exactly at a time when it's expression was gaining traction. The issues and the people who consider them worth addressing are not dealt with in any meaningful way, and so this thing will continue to grow in the dark, inspired now by a bit of censorship and a newfound disdain for government as well, whereas they could be talked about openly and honestly, except for, you know, Jewish media, always trying to divide us, only allowing a spectrum of thought at one time, disallowing all others.

       I'd say the white nationalists do a damn good job of trying to divide people on their own. The only thing more divisive than D vs R is white vs not white. I don't even want to bring in the idea that trump courted this group with his rhetoric because this group will grab on to anyone preaching about illegal immigration and I honestly don't perceive trump as a racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is already enough ammunition against "pro-white" ideas, one person running down a group of (mostly white) counter protestors is a drop in the bucket compared to segregation, slavery, lynching, and many other atrocities which are attributed to "white supremacy".

       I don't think that playing race politics in a world where everyone else plays race politics makes them into a "white vs not white" group. I think it means you're playing by the rules we have to play by, even if I agree that they're stupid and unnecessary.

       I also think that you should consider very well whether or not you agree with the idea of punishing sons for the sins of their fathers, then see how your conclusion applies to your view of the world.

       Promoting equality among races is not punishing sons for the sins of their fathers. And my comments should in no way be construed as promoting any race over another because I haven't addressed anything other than the white nationalist group that marched today. Do you see my hatred for this group as something other than just that?

       Ah, but remember, you have just listed slavery, lynching, and "other atrocities" as a reason to hate the "alt-right", which, if you are careful, you will see are each very fitting examples of punishing a son for the sin of a father.

       I didn't mean to choose your term for you, and I apologize for assuming; it wasn't my intention in the least. Were you saying, though, that all the protesters there were nazis, or that the protest itself was white nationalist/nazi? I believe you have said that you understand their fringe nature in relation to the Unite the Right movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's very disconcerting that you would feel that being pro-white is the same thing as being your idea of a Nazi.. I very much doubt that you carry this belief over onto any other race or group, and I would ask you to consider the parallels between the idea that only one race cannot campaign for the good of their own, and that of the late-war Nazi ideology which you know best. At the very least, ask yourself: "would a Nazi be more likely to agree that only Jews shouldn't be allowed to have a pro-race, or would they be less likely?"

       Disdain and mistrust of the government is one thing, chanting a well known German Nazi ideological slogan (Blut und Boden/ Blood and Soil) while marching to protect a statue of  Robert E. Lee is different thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racist and Nazi ideologies are not something worth addressing, these people and their lust to push race superiority need to be driven back to their basements because their minds are made up and they aren't going to change.

       So are you saying that some of the people marching toward the Robert E Lee statue chanting blood and soil were just swept up in the fun of it? Im using the actions of this group to decide on the character of those in the group and the people who are supporting what they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I agree that the statue of Robert E Lee should remain in the park, we shouldn't forget that he led a group of traitors to the United States of America. We shouldn't be erasing our history, as dark as it may be.

       I agree that they were likely not the core of the group. But the same type of wooden shields being carried by the group chanting "blood and soil" can also be seen in the videos showing fighting with counter protesters. They were a large part of the "face" of this protest group.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said it in another comment, I believe the status of Confederate leaders should remain in place. We should never forget our history. I'm sure there were some people at this protest who aren't racists, and have the same viewpoint I do on the issue.

       I grew up in the punk and ska music scene in the 90, we still had skinheads trying to take over most aspects of the scene. Seeing someone with a Hitler quote on his shirt, or a group chanting a Nazi slogan being included in this protest group leaves me unsettled. There's no way around believing them to be neo-nazis or Nazi sympathisers. Does that mean everyone there is also? Not at all, and I didn't intend to make that my point.

       No one other then a sociopath would deny that this is tragic and terrible incident, what one should wonder is WHY it happened. Is it so simplistic a notion that someone from the "right" did something terrible to people on the "left" and thus we (the left) should HATE everyone on the "right" and never look to see why we are so angry and who is causing us this anger?

       You are being too rational, be careful. I am appalled by this violence today, but I am also appalled at the frequency in which mobs upon mobs of people blindly take hold of a certain rhetoric without any proof. They haven't released the guys name or his motives yet everyone seems to be judge, jury, and executioner today on the subject. Look the police got him, isn't that worthy enough?

       Yeah, because their message is actually pretty solid, so you gotta make them all seem like monsters, or even more people might listen to their arguments. It's what you do when you can't outmaneuver someone or some group politically.

       Probably that white people get a shit deal around the world these days, then they use lots of evidence to prove that feeling in various ways? I dunno, does it matter? We're talking about principles here. Do you want to be the kind of person who denounces entire groups for the actions of a single person? If so, you then must abide those who say that all muslims are terrorists. If not, then you have to remain open minded. You don't have to choose between those two option, but to eliminate any internal contradictions - to be honest - you will.

       I don't need to choose, I have never came across a rational minded white supremacist, or a rational minded Nazi sympathiser. I have met well rounded rational Muslims however.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to worry about contradictions I would equate the white supremacists within the Caucasian race with the Muslim extremists within the entirety of Muslim believers. It is a sub group within a larger group.

       I know, but to be honest, you most certainly do have to choose. I can lay out the internal contradictions once again; how you choose to believe one thing in one instance and another in another, thereby rendering your world view as one of reactions, rather than understandings, but you most certainly do have to choose to be honest.

       Read it.  It's outdated as it was written before the election so it is about stopping Trump from being elected or assuming office, but the same strategy can be used now, and has been used in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR  False flag to start a color revolution, like the Arab Spring,  Rose Revolution in Georgia(country not state), Ukraine, et al.

Now we're nearly 8 months into Trump's presidency and we're closer to adding more wars to our scorecard than ever before...closer to policing more of the world than this time last year.

       It's not just the event.  Think about what happens now. The guy that did it is almost certainly going to claim that he was afraid and it was unintentional, which means there is going to be a trial, which means this guy will probably get out on bail.  The left is not going to be happy about that.  What do you think they are going to do?  Protest?  Riot?  What happens if he gets acquitted or given a light sentence?   Consider the potential for more violence, real or false flag, in the interim.  The situation could ramp up very easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider how the MSM is going to cover this story.  Remember when Republican Congressman Scalise was shot?  It only happened 2 months ago, but that story fucking disappeared as soon as we found out he was a left winger.  It didn't fit the narrative the MSM wants to push.  This story does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you are right, though, and this isn't the spark that leads to what would basically be a civil war.

       My trump statement is relevant because the whole basis of the "democracy spring" was to prevent trump from ever holding office. Now that he is president, and has been for nearly 8 months it's obvious that the theories did not become reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Scalise story didn't disappear as soon as it was discovered he was a left winger. The news that he was a Sanders supporter was came about within hours of the shooting and was in the news for several days. It disappeared with the next breaking story just like this will, thats how the 24 hour news cycle works. They'll talk about this at the top of every hour for a day or so, maybe longer if there's a vigil or something at the site of the act...but then it's off to the next story which will likely be early morning trump tweets.

       I've said repeatedly that the linked image is outdated in that regard, But the Arab Spring, Euromaidan in Ukraine, et al, did not take place to prevent a person or government from coming to power, they were done to overthrow an existing government.   So I don't see why Trump being president would preclude a color revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, FYI Trump hasn't even been President for 7 months yet.  Inauguration was January 20th.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your claim that this story will disappear in a few days, I guess we'll see.  I don't think it will.

       Seems like this doesn't fit the narrative. No wonder the media isn't releasing info on the driver. CNN was praying for it to be a skinhead with a MAGA hat. Who the heck can they spin this?

       Exactly, and I only fear it's going to get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trouble with modern media/news is that everyone jumps to their conclusion and pinion so fast, even without any verification or facts in yet from police/authorities beyond what we can all see.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happened with the London runner being pushed under a bus this week; all the news sites pushing a photo and name of a suspect before he'd even been spoken to by police properly. Then turns out he wasn't even in the country when it occurred, but his name is now associated with it now and people move onto the next thing/person!

       It looks like a smartphone picture taken while zoomed all the way in, digital zoom is terrible. On top that it's Snapchat, which doesn't use the full capabilities of your smartphones image sensor, it essentially takes a screenshot of what is on the screen.

       Have the police even confirmed that that person was being arrested, and that it was because he was the driver? Or his motives? Anything? This post is literally partisan politics 101.

       There was a ton of violence going on all over the place. People fighting. BLM and Antifa throwing tear gas into crowds. Whose to say he wasn't someone fighting or some other dumb shit. A twitter pic from some random dude isn't a solid source. If it's him it's him, but as of now it's unsourced. It also doesn't at all confirm his motives.

       Yes, WW2 Nazis wanted non-native ppl to leave Germany and eventually they started killing non-aryans.  That is truly reprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to suggest anyone right wing or who might be right wing is a Nazi and therefore they want all non-whites to die is pretty disgusting imo
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not right wing, but I support anyone's right to protest non-violently.  I didn't vote for trump, and frankly have never voted.  If I did vote it would've been Jill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you would probably call me a right wing Nazi who wants all non-whites to die just because I'm not freaking out about a group of ppl trying to peacefully unite or w/e

       No... because there are tons of different sects of Islam. Nazism is a specific movement modelled on Hitler's Germany.

       I feel like you could make the same argument to both sides. Not that I think either one of them is morally good, but I feel like lines are blurred when you're trying to make that argument for any ideology.

       Not really, though. Nazism is very specific. Christianity, for example, isn't - you've got Catholics and Protestants, and within them traditional Catholics and Orthodox, Calvinists/Lutherans/Methodists/and all the rest. There might be some fringe Christian who kills someone because he thinks god told him to do it, but Christianity doesn't have an inherent, unified message of violence. Nazism does: it's built on driving out or killing non-European whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       but tbh I think you're just putting me on, aren't you? You don't actually think that there are good Nazis and bad Nazis

       I'm not saying anything, I'm just trying to pull on some ideas. Who's to say that there can't be Nazi's that aren't mega crazy (not going to use "good" as an adjective). Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Nazism a political socialist party?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably a stretch. I'm just trying to make some idea up here. But WHY can't Nazism have a moderate side like Christianity and Islam do when they originally weren't?

       It's not a very accurate analogy. A better one would be ISIS. Yes, being a member of ISIS you are explicitly supporting a cause that promotes violence. The analogy does not work when you expand it out to Islam, as it is a huge religion with plenty of peaceful worshipers.

       No problem. Overall, I understand where you are coming from as Islam on the whole needs a lot of reform. I just don't think they quite compare to white supremacists.

       False. I know modern National Socialists who have denounced the actions of the neo-Nazis in Virginia and have no issues with non-whites.

      <p>
       Are there peaceful and violent Muslims? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there peaceful and violent people on the Left? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there peaceful and violent people on the Right? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say that the actions of some Muslims don't represent all Muslims, the same is applied to my argument. People interpret Hitler's National Socialist ideology very differently in modern times.

       T_D isn't a white nationalist forum - there are people of all races that post on there, not to mention how many of other races get praised on the front page of T_D. But while we're on the subject, whenever there is an actual "white nationalist" sub, it always gets shut down (such as r/altright). Yes, Reddit is left wing. The vast majority of subs are, and those who work for Reddit definitely are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even T_D has been threatened to get shut down... to imply Reddit isn't left wing just because it allows that sub is unbelievably idiotic.

       That's not a jewish conspiracy at all. Seems you're looking at this through your own lens or are unaware of how T_D (or /conspiracy for that matter) sees Soros.

      <p>
       A search for the word jew in that post of 583 comments has 9 results, 8 of which are unrelated or in defense of jews. One of which is borderline bigot as he calls the mayor a jew.

       One of these days, people will realize that 'white nationalism' is an oxymoron. Nationalism alone is evil! You don't need to say 'white nationalism' when 'nationalism' alone should suffice. Also: nationalism and fascism are the same fucking thing. Patriotism and fascism are the same fucking thing. Patriotism and Religion are the same fucking thing.

       I can't make any sense of this comment. Nationalism has historically been the root of all evil, intolerance, ignorance, and sheepism in general. If you can't understand why that is, I see no reason in having an argument with you. It would be like debating a fucking goat.

       That's true, but in those 300 years all the evil people have rallied behind nationalism. May be a germ that goes by the same name. For want of a better word, you could call it, anti-individualism/ sheepism, which is been around since the dawn of history.

       Nah. Because a coalition inherently implies a hostility: an other people to give shape to the 'we'. The 'we' in this case is the nation, the religion, the political party, and all the similar week minded bullshit.

       No, but I believe that Reddit's admins' only goal is to make it look like their company is worth something, and the best way to do that is to allow as wide an audience as possible, from the fascists in physical removal to the ironic tankies in fullcommunism.

       Sure, but giving white nationalists and other right-wing identitarians a place to gather and converse doesn't seem to be hurting business. White nationalism seems to be pretty popular in the USA right now, and there are presumably white nationalists who aren't Nazis anyway.

       There is no internationally agreed upon definition.  But the simplest version "the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims."  Would almost definitely fit this situation.  And if this man were Muslim the President and everyone in the media would have called it terrorism by now.

       Are you really this retarded, or just pretending to be? He was an alt-rightist who drove his car into a crowd of anti-fascists, anti-racists, and anarchists protesting the Unite the Right march. What do you think his political aims were?

      <p>
       For 100,000 years before the advent of classism, about 10,000 years ago, humans thrived in egalitarian, anarchic bands. So, most of human history can be characterized as anarchic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, just because, in modern history, anarchism hasn't had any major success doesn't indicate anything about potential future successes. What happened to waiting for the facts to emerge before "prematurely" jumping to conclusions, hypocrite?

       You're saying good detectives wait for the facts to reveal themselves instead of investigating and employing intellect and common sense? Do you know what a detective is? Detectives ask questions and think critically in order to develop viable theories. They don't just sit on their asses and do nothing.

       Because you literally know fucking nothing about the driver. That's why it's a leap to a conclusion. Wait on the facts. Then sure, if he's a fucking asshole, then crucify him. Why is that so hard to follow?

       You're the one characterizing this as a "jump." I'm wondering why you believe this, when all the facts point to the conclusion that the driver was an alt-rightist.

      <blockquote>

        Because you literally know fucking nothing about the driver. . . . Wait on the facts.

      <p>
       Here are the facts: He was present at an alt-right rally, gunned his car into people protesting the rally, and sped away.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying it's unreasonable to conclude, based on that information, that he was aligned with alt-rightists? Really?? Would you also hesitate to conclude that individuals who bomb and/or open fire on mosques are Islamophobic? You are quite dumb, are you not?

      <p>
       Right. That is a crucial fact. This person's aim was to deliberately maim and murder people belonging to the protesting group. Logic denotes that, since it's incredibly unlikely for an ingroup member to do this to their own kind and that since this, as an act of war, was not a neutral act, the perpetrator was an enemy of that group. Since tensions were high between the marchers and their protesters, one can reasonably deduce that the perpetrator was with the marching group, which is an enemy of the protesting group.

       I don't believe so, no. The police chased the car down and took him into custody, and his name and image were released a few hours later. There's not a ton of information available yet. I'm trying to stay as updated as possible but it's difficult with all of the speculation happening from both sides

       <strong>
        Therein lays the issue.
       </strong>
       People like you say this, yet when there were people driving busses into crowds in Europe, it wasn't labeled terrorism. They were a "lone wolf" or whatever. It was an "act of aggression".
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is - Trump should have immediately said this was terrorism. The president of France should have immediately called it
       <em>
        terrorism
       </em>
       . EVERYONE SHOULD BE CALLING EVERY ACT OF TERRORISM, TERRORISM.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly very fucking frustrated. The left and the right are picking and choosing what to call terrorism and what not to. The left and the right pick and choose what to call something because it simply makes them look good and their opposition bad, but we shouldn't be giving a fuck about what makes us look good and address the issue that whats happening in the world right now is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, people like me, who chose not to associate with any political party because I just simply don't agree with anyone, get ostracized, basterdized and labeled if we don't belong to one or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I commented on the top post on /Starterpacks right now called "The 2017 KKK Starter Pack" and said, "You people upvoting this make me sick". Why? Because it's a total generalization of a group of people who, 99% of aren't Nazi's. It's aimed to totally evoke hatred 110%. If it was a post that said was just as horrible and was aimed at the left,
       <strong>
        id call the people upvoting that sick too.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just hit piece after hit piece after hit piece from the left to the right and the right to the left. "You're a Nazi!", "You're a cuck", "You're a Nazi!", "You're a cuck!".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just shut the fuck up. You're all so wrapped up in your hatred of one another that you're totally ignoring and forgetting that people are committing atrocities and it shouldn't matter who they are, we should all be condemning it no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone's hatred for one another is breeding such dangerous ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats, Liberals, Socialists etc. don't see Republicans, Conservatives and even Libertarians as people with "opposite view points" anymore, they see them as an
       <em>
        enemy
       </em>
       which is fucking scary. The same is said for Conservatives and Republicans. They don't see Democrats and Liberals as "people with different viewpoints" but as enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You all see each other as dangerous enemies of each other. As people you want to "destroy" and "eliminate". People you want to "shut the voice up" forever. Its horrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's horrifying that if I tell someone I don't agree with them, they become instantly filled with a hatred of me and im seen as a literal enemy. Someone they can't trust anymore - NOT AS A PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a rabid sickness that's infecting this country. A virus that lays dormant and it's trigger to become active is when someone disagrees with the other person. Their total behavior and emotion changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was never like that. EVER. It used to just be, "yea im a democrat." or "yea im a republican" and no one gave a fuck. No one cared.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW, its "Im a republican" met with the response, "YOU'RE A FUCKING NAZI", or "Im a democrat" met with "YOU'RE A SOCIALIST THREAT".
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck politics, fuck people who label other people so quickly, fuck people with thin skin and fuck all of this hate you all regurgitate at each other.

       Is this a joke? It was resoundingly labelled terrorism. The difference is that people wanted to know the
       <em>
        cause
       </em>
       of the action instead of kneejerking that clearly Muslims need to get out of Europe. People were claiming that because the terrorists were brown, they were therefore illegals and agents of ISIS, when it turns out to be citizens doing shit and ISIS claiming responsibility for someone they never got in touch with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, with this car driver, people are doing everything they can to say "well, he panicked" and "well, he didn't initiate it", so therefore it's not fair to call him a terrorist.

       The tiki torches are literally about this rally. You're specifically claiming that 99% of the people at this white supremacist rally aren't actually nazis or maybe even don't believe it. But let's call it what it is: a small occupying force. We have "soldiers" coming in, chanting things like "

       ", a classic nazi phrase, while
       <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBCampbell/status/896362457341591552">
        carrying flags and shields
       </a>

        waving nazi flags
       </a>

        shirts with quotes from Hitler

        marching down the streets
       </a>
       . That last one is a bit long for payoff, but it has a group of people identifying as National Socialists, fighting for a better tomorrow. Just how many people do you think were there if you think that's only 1% of the crowd?
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a bad group of people, plain and simple. This isn't someone just with a different view, this is someone who fundamentally sees me as an enemy because I'm not them.

       So every single person who voted trump is a white supremacist, is that what you're saying? The old guy who fought in ww2 against the Nazis, hes a white supremacist? The blue collar family who voted trump, they are all supremacists? My 83 year old grandma, who I KNOW for a fact voted trump, shes a white supremacist?

        Therein lays the issue.
       </strong>
       People like you say this, yet when there were people driving busses into crowds in Europe, it wasn't labeled terrorism. They were a "lone wolf" or whatever. It was an "act of aggression".
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you please shut your face?
When the Truck drove into people in Berlin it took five minutes to be called terrorism.
When Charlie Hebdo got attacked it was called terrorism right away.
You know what it was called when german police found luggage rigged to explode?Terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what country doesn't call terrorism by white people terrorism? The USA and it's current president.
You know what they call it when a white dude shoots black people in a church?Mental illness,lone wolf.
Hell,the knee jerk reaction is to scream "Muslim"
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out 4chan and T_D right now.They are grasping at straws.Dude who ran the protesters over did in self defence, it was an accident,he was a leftist,false flag.And those are the people who feel closest to the president and vice versa.

        It's horrifying that if I tell someone I don't agree with them, they become instantly filled with a hatred of me and im seen as a literal enemy. Someone they can't trust anymore - NOT AS A PERSON WITH A DIFFERENT VIEW.

       This is an incredibly important question. Without a set definition, more and more people can be swept up as "terrorists" and therefore forfeit their rights to the typical process of American justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought a terrorist was someone who targeted a government by targeting innocent people. Lately, I get the feeling the needle is moving to include people who kill a lot of others or leak classified information to the public or protest government actions they don't agree with.

       Colloquially, the definition will vary (often from person to person). However, the Patriot Act added a legal definition of "domestic terrorism":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        … the term ‘domestic terrorism’ means activities that involve acts
dangerous to human life that are a violation of criminal laws of the
United States or any State” and (B) “appear to be intended (i) to
intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a
government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a
government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C)
occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

       It's a terrorist attack. Why would anhthing you said happen because they call this event what it is. A terrorist attack. An attack on a select group of people with the intent to inflict maximum harm, death and above all fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is raiding my house. No one is stealing your guns. Listen to Ronny all day if you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
       This terrorist attack isn't any differnet from San Bernardino, the bat man movie massacre etc. Why would it effect you or I differently?

       As far as I'm concerned a "terrorist attack" needs to be not only
       <em>
        proven
       </em>
       premeditated, but needs to kill a whole hell of a lot more people than fucking one. Look, were not an endangered species. We don't need to get our panties in a bunch because one man drove a car into a crowd of people and killed one person- shit like this has been happening EVER SINCE CARS WERE INVENTED.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know the context under which this happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       "My" guns? I'm a convicted felon, brah.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you people screaming "terrorist attack" are a bunch of patsies.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask me why would it effect me differently?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does calling it a terrorist attack effect you differently? Obvious it sort of turns you on.

       You don't have to kill anyone for it to be a terrorist attack, it would just be called "attempted". The conversation is about if this event needs to be labeled and considered a terrorist attack. It does. The driver should be tried as a terrorist.

       If the logic that any public attack that terrorizes people is a terrorist attack, then yes sure
      </p>
      <p>
       But terrorist attacks  imply plotted attacks conducted by a group or network of people.

       People called the Dallas cop killer a terrorist.  Though he had no connection to BLM.  And prominent BLM members condemned his actions.

      <p>
       The kidnappers we also not related to BLM.  That was a hate crime, not terrorism.

       The Baltimore riots were riots, not terrorism.

       Ferguson was once again rioting, looting, vandalism and arson, not terrorism.  The arson is probably the closest to terrorism and I might agree with you on that one.

       Cops were murdered due to systemic racism, racial profiling, police brutality and the killing of black suspects.  People feel as they have no options as the situation never improves and they strike out in desperation.  Just as Palestinians in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       However BLM did not call for murders, unlike Hamas, so they are not a terrorist organization.  They called for equality under the law and justice reform through peaceful forms of civil disobedience.

       It wasn't terrorism. James Fields's actions were in self-defense. Antifa and other far left thugs have a well-known history of blocking traffic illegally (which is what they were doing in Charlottesville as they did not even have a permit for their unlawful "counter-protest", much less for congregating on the street) and then dragging people out of their cars once they politely stop and beating them severely (sometimes to death). By all accounts, on the day in question they were (with the cooperation of the police) attacking members of the UTR rally the entire time with a variety of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of James Fields, they had already cracked his windshield before the incident even happened and were still throwing projectiles at his car. Meanwhile, the UTR rally he was a part of had peacefully dispersed by this time (by orders of the police, which they followed) and he was simply trying to go home. The people he had a confrontation with
       <em>
        chose
       </em>
       to gather on the street they were at because they knew that people from the UTR rally were going to be leaving via it and they specifically wanted to block them from doing so in order to attack them. They chose to pick a fight with him. He did not want a confrontation with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So given these facts, what should he have done? Wait until he was surrounded? According to him, he panicked, and I believe it. He was surrounded by people who wanted to kill him for expressing his opinion at a rally that was completely peaceful before
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       chose to escalate things. Anyone would panic and do something regretful in the same situation. His intentions were obviously not malicious. If he had really wanted to hurt people, he could have ran over 50 more of them with how concentrated they were. Cars are dangerous, and it only takes a quick lunge to do a lot of damage, a fact unfortunately made clear in this situation (which is why it's not a good idea to illegally block traffic). He made a mistake, willingly or due to improper operation of his vehicle we do not yet know, and he will and should see some consequences as a result, but don't pretend he was entirely at fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, they picked the fight, not him. He merely ended it. You don't want to accidentally get run over by a scared kid? Then don't menacingly surround people with weapons while illegally blocking traffic. It's that simple. Obviously the death is a tragedy, but don't pretend the people that got hurt weren't playing with fire. They were. They just wanted the other side to get burned. And if it had gone down that way (which it was before this incident), you would have never heard a word about it.

       How is it terrorism? Micah Johnson was not labeled a terrorist and neither was James Hodgkinson. Both affiliated to extreme progressive groups.  How is this different? Because it associates to the right? If so that is extremely hypocritical.

       Thanks for sharing the links. I was referring to the Fed classification of these events.  For the Fed to classify it as terrorism (from my understanding) it requires the criminals intent or MO to be "insight fear and intimidation."  I'm sure there is more to the definition than what I shared but you get my point.   I believe the Charlottesville event was definitely terrorism but again I don't know exactly the method or logic the Fed's use to know for sure.  Often I feel the media is quick to either distance an event from being labeled terrorism or quick to call it terrorism.  Good example is this one:

        http://www.theroot.com/james-hodgkinson-proves-white-men-are-bulletproof-1796137659
       </a>
       .  It seems the label assignment comes from the Fed later down the road.  I realized this when reviewing data from the fed in an article about domestic terrorism.  Many of the events like we consider terrorism doesn't always get assigned that way in their database.  However when you research the web you find articles claiming otherwise.

       Fair enough.  I think there's two conversations going on.  About the respective ideological camps and their supporters in the media calling acts out as terrorism, and then the feds prosecuting it as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that Hodgkinson seems like he very much should fit that definition.  But apparently Trump's justice department disagreed.  Sessions said today that he thinks the Charlottesville attack fits the definition however.  So it's hard to argue these are political actions.

       Agree but still find it hypocritical when the official ruling of the classification hasn't been determined.  The Fed's just opened the case and until the case is finished we won't know how it is classified.  The Fed's will say initially it "seems" to fit or it will be investigated as an act of terrorism but it isn't official until they conclude and share findings.  Therefore we are all assuming.  Yet when we have other events that involves a Muslim - we hear the right calling it an act of terrorism and the left being cautious not to call it terrorism.   That is why I say it is hypocritical but agree to your points.

       Yeah, I won't disagree.  Both sides want to slow down or speed up the labeling of terrorists depending on how it supports their narrative.  Personally I try to look at it on a case by case basis regardless of how I feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I'm also one of those Sam Harris liberals who is not a big fan of Muslims fundamentalists or Christian fundamentalists, so it generally fits my narrative cause the psychos usually come from those wells.  Hodgkinson being fairly exceptional, and I do consider his act terrorism.

       Because in this case there is no other explanation? I have yet to see any convincing "evidence" that this is a "false-flag op," and that kind of rhetoric usually comes out to distract people from the root cause of violence and shift the blame onto shadowy conspiracy people.

       The Antifa communists were the ones starting the violence. as always. If you watch the video, they were throwing things at the guy's car before he ran into the crowd. What likely happened was that the Antifas were breaking his windows (eg, by throwing bricks, etc), and the driver panicked (not wanting to get a brick/rock thrown into his face, etc) and accelerated to get away and accidentally hit those people. Not intentionally.

       Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider two counter-points if you're willing.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) If you are an oppressed minority (ex: go ahead and look up how black people go to jail longer than white people for the same crimes), you generally face an inherent disadvantage in life in the US. Not always, obviously. Generally speaking. Therefore, when you're proud of being a Muslim, black, or Mexican, or w/e, you're basically saying you're proud that you are able to handle dealing with the inherent disadvantage. Now, let's consider whether whites overall face these same inherent disadvantages....well up until 1865, many, many blacks were slaves. After that many lacked the education or skills that white people got in school and from their more educated relatives to succeed on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So white people took advantage of them ala Jim Crow laws and sharecropping. Shit like this continued for many more decades. If you use your imagination or Google, you can find out how whites oppressed other races through institutionalized and legislatively racist laws. For example, up until 1965, it wasn't illegal to discriminate based on skin color, etc. It was okay to be racist. I wonder if that could have any effect on minority groups? Like maybe when a black person moved into a neighborhood of white people, those white people decided to move away, causing homes in that neighborhood to lose value, attracting lower income people, which is correlated with crime, which of course causes stress, which makes it difficult to focus on studying or working hard-things that allow for social mobility.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) "White" is used commonly to refer to people of a lighter, pinker skin color. It refers to a fucking massive group of people-people in dozens of countries across Europe, Jews, people in Russia, people in the US, lighter-skinned people. It doesn't refer to a single racial group in the same way that "Mexican" or "Black" does. There's nothing wrong with Irish pride, British pride, French pride, Russian pride, etc. But when you use the term "White pride" you're basically saying you're proud of the achievements of all white people-Irish, British, French, Russian, etc, etc. Seems a bit unfair that white people have access to all this backstory, whereas Mexican people and black people don't. Like, wait a second, say you're French. Do you know get to take pride in things that Russians and British people did too? Does that mean a Mexican person can take pride in what an Asian person did? Because they're both "not white" right? If you have white pride, is everyone not white allowed to have "brown (+black) pride"? If so, does the schema for that exist in society? I would argue that it doesn't. Until it does, there's an inherent inequality in calling yourself white vs the fractured groups that would comprise a hypothetical "not-white" or "brown". When people see a white person, they subconsciously associate that person's backstory to include British, French, Russian, German, Jews, etc, etc. When people see a non-white person, they usually see them only as either Asian, Latino, Black, etc. See how that's unfair?

       1) the first slave owner of america was black man. arabs enslaved white people for over 500 years, don't hear them bitching.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) punishing people for flourishing, innovating, creating democracy, advancing society is counterproductive, especially when coming from people who use a victim mentality and refuse to clean up their own communities, glorify gang members and drug use, etc.

       Like I stated on this post already Hillary Clinton used Pusha T to push voter registration in Virginia (known cocaine dealer) and YG's popular song "Fuck Donald Trump" was of course written by YG, a popular and widely known blood gang member.

       You got a source on that first claim? And you just inherently misunderstand the issue about why black communities are the way they are, the system is built against them.  Richard fucking nixon started the war on drugs to target african americans and put them in jail, reagan era continued that even heavier especially with the cia flooding ghettos with crack.  How you can honestly think people choose to live like that is bewildering.

       Ahhhh this is the part where the racists talk about what was built but ignore that the playing field was never even.  White people have never had to compete in this country with any group without laws giving whites the advantage.  Shit most white people won't even acknowledge that the only reason there's a middle class is because of affirmative action from the government in the form of the New Deal, GI Bill and FHA loans. All of the benefits from those programs were legally kept from Black people through racism and discrimination.
      </p>

       As for glorifying gangs and drug use.  Well I guess TV shows like Sapranos, Sons of Anarchy, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Shield all show wholesome white life and doesn't glorify any negative behavior.  As for drug use......last I checked heroin and Oxy addiction is a huge problem for WHITE PEOPLE.  Seems to have y'all dropping like flies.

       If only black people had rights in America, maybe Bill Cosby would be in jail. It's so hard being a person of black skin and not having the right to a lawyer or legal process. Certainly has nothing to do with class and ability to pay for a lawyer, I'm sure it has some legally irrelevant correlation with race.

       Good counterargument. Call the other person racist because the USA objectively glorifies crip members and gives them millions of dollars while they claim they have no rights.

       It's pride of your heritage. Like, maybe you as a white person are a descendant of Russian immigrants, then it's okay to be proud of it. Or maybe your ancestors have been in America since its inception, and you're proud that they built the nation it is today. If you, however, are proud of the amount of melanin on your skin, then that's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people can be proud of being black because of the history of black people in the US. They have no way to trace their ancestors back to their countries of origin, and up until about 50 years ago were treated as 2nd class citizens, not to mention slavery. Today, they have it better, but they still have many problems. If you listen to rap, you can often hear how the artists talk about how they came from the bottom of society, and they're proud of the people that manage to get out of there. 
Just get in their shoes.

       Hey here's a thought.  When here is a group of scum taking over a city for no other reason then to spread hate do not "counter-protest".  Do not add to the chaos unless you want to cause more chaos.  We shouldn't give these hate filled people one second of attention in the media.  But not now.

       you responded to me? and applied a quote that was never stated nor implied in my previous reply. either to make a point or i dunno what, but it made no sense and was out of context, and my point still stands.

       dont feed it, and it has no life. allow the police to handle the situation if the mob becomes violent or disrupts usual business.

       forming a counter mob is exactly the wrong thing to do, unless of course, they are actually trying to destroy property and conquer a city!!! fuck!

       T_D advertised for it? Jesus, I followed them about a year ago before they exploded, and there were some pretty rational people at the time and that shit would not have been accepted.

       Early days T_D was a remarkably different place.  I'm not going to call it a bastion of intelligence, but when he was still an unrealistic outlier candidate (by
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       sources, arguably including his) there were some discussions that were definitely "fringe" but included rational thought.  That did not last long, even though T_D now tries to market themselves as such.  Now it's "whatever can get the most momentum regardless of facts, and ignore this happened as soon as its more convenient to"

       It very quickly devolved into memes and larping, so the point where people think that's how it's always been and is "real".  It's a sad statement on how short of a memory the internet actually has, but it doesn't help that the mods there directly manipulated it.

       They also renamed the park from "Lee Park" to "Emancipation Park." It started from a petition to remove the statue because it offended a couple of people, and they made a grand, historical case for it.

      <p>
       This local issue was latched-onto by people who could fan-up this kind of shit, bring all the racist/nationalist/commie groups together for a single dichotomous brawl. I'm sure the travel expenses of many will be reimbursed by Soros groups or the Feds, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       The locals didn't help things, because they're well-meaning counter-protesting to the protesting made it more chaotic. I don't even know how they knew who was protesting what and who was on what side once the violence happened.

       Lol you're such a fucking hypocrite. I guarantee if I go look at your post history there won't be a single iota of a fuck given about any of the left wing terrorism that has happened in the last year, and here you are sitting on your high horse calling people "fucking disgusting" for not caring about this specific instance of terrorism to your standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, it's more like when a Muslim rams his car into a crowd of people, or live streams a gang rape, or gets caught being involved in a massive child rape gang every fucking week, it's a big deal.

       I don't buy that at all and think it has more to do with the biased way in which politically motivated attacks are labeled depending on who they're committed by, but even if that were true, what does it have to do with my comment about OP being a fucking hypocrite?

       And here you are. Justifying it. At least places like T_D disavow their violent terrorists. The left never fucking does. They always justify it or even praise it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wail about "Oh my God, I can't believe we live in this kind of society, where people are attacked for exercising their rights and speaking their minds, this is so horrible," but justify why it's okay that your political opponents get attacked for exercising their rights and speaking their minds. What a fucking joke. If you guys didn't have double standards, you'd have none at all.

       Let's hear the leaders of the alt right movement condemn the violence, to stress non violence is the way forward, and that those who committed acts of violence are criminals who should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

       IMHO both sides are wrong, but up until this moment, I actually empathized with the alt right, becasue largely they had not resorted to violence.  That is no longer the case.

       So, we have two violent extremist organizations active in America...one is all white, and one is representative of the population.  How do you think that looks to those of us in the middle?

       I applaud your introspection but I have to say: When you ally yourself with fascists, neo-nazis, and klansmen, violence is inherent to your political program. The only difference thing that stops Nazis from engaging in street violence is the fact that their long-term goal is to gain control over the police and military, and have
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       do the violence for them.

       Fucking bullshit. I've been to multiple BLM rallies. They openly invite all colors to be a part of it. These people were wearing actual Nazi memorabilia and doing sieg heils. Get your head out of your ass!

       Their ideology is the same. They simply don't have the numbers or power. While they may not be literal Nazi's, their white-nationalism is the same breed of hatred that gave rise to the Nazi's and that's whats important.

       Maybe it's not. Maybe it is. I really don't know. Just thought I would toss that shit out there. At this point I would like to hear a direct statement from the guy and what's on his mind. To me, the whole situation seems contrived. It looks like the first false flag attack since Trump took office.

       Sure. If he is the one who did it. If he is, then isn't it amazing he hasn't been arrested yet. BTW, notice how after Trump took the White House we have not had any more strange shootings that looked like false flags and or a hoax? And the one attack of this nature turns out maybe to be a Trump hater? Hmmm?

       Ok finally watched it, and it is fake as fuck. I'm sorry if you think the recent spat of car attacks has been real but this is no different. One huge giveaway is that he's already blaming "some racist dick" for the attack. One other subtle clue is..... the complete lack of any graphic content and overall air of inauthenticity.

       That's the second video I saw of this. All it shows is a lady rolling off the hood just like a professional stunt woman and the camera looks
       <em>
        away
       </em>
       right after the action happens. The narrator was talking about how it was a "diverse group" just before the crash; it couldn't be more staged looking.

       This is correct. The guy /pol leaked was apparently the previous owner of the car.

       Okay. This is all concerning:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency "to
       <strong>
        aid state response to violence
       </strong>
       ," according to a post on his Twitter account.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         "It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded
         <strong>
          without additional powers
         </strong>
         , and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property," McAuliffe said.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Members of the Virginia National Guard also were there.

       This is one of the concerning things about this event. Just like with the Boston Marathon bombing and the Baltimore riots, marshal law was effectively being imposed. Boston let it happen in a hunt for a teenager. Baltimore fought it a bit, or rather the rioters steered clear of the containment area. In this case, it was simply away from the containment area (the park with the statue). I don't know the right answer, but I don't support marshal law.

       What real story? They had national guard on standby because a notoriously violent group was coming into their relatively small city and to top it off a group was planning to counter protest increasing the odds of violence breaking out in some fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So things started going south and they declared a state of emergency and it was proven to be a good decision as fights broke out and a guy who considers himself a white nationalist and nazi symbolizer ran his car into the counter protest.

      <p>
       the only conspiracy i can see out of todays events were that a peaceful permitted rally was attacked by anti free speech zealots, and for some reason, the mayor had the police stand down instead of protecting the organized and permitted rally. some dude (one person kind of rules out a conspiracy) with apparently not a whole lot to lose driving his car into a group of people is news worthy and worth a conversation in the correct sub, but i am not sure this is the correct forum.

       why is it bullshit? what does freedom of speech mean if you filter what can be expressed. you cannot have it both ways. one way is american, one way is not. if you do not agree with freedom of speech, as in if you dont like it go away or change the channel, then maybe some place in europe where speech is openly filtered should be more your style. just saying, cant have it both ways. freedom of speech or not.

       i do not think i am the one having a hard time understanding the concept in this conversation buddy. if anyone doesnt understand anything its you. freedom of expression does not come with qualifiers that you get to arbitrarily decide. and anyways, the anti white morons showed up to a permitted rally and started a bunch of unnecessary shit to attempt to shut down free speech. that sure seems to be the side you have taken, the anti free speech side. deal with it scum. you cant have it both ways commie. explain to me how nazism is worse than communism. go ahead.

       you are confused and backwards. your logic is not based in any reality. you talk positively about freedom of speech and say AMERICA!, but you side with the side that is anti free speech. maybe you can explain things to your dumb commie friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as anti white, it is what it is. the left by and large is anti white. that has been the overwhelming sentiment particularly since this last election. i dont know what you guys expect from the white guys. these people go to work, pay taxes, have illegals and bums leeching off of their social system, have criminals predating their neighborhoods, have ideologues screaming anti white rhetoric at every turn, and now recently the left wants to play identity politics. what in the world do you dopes expect the response to be? this is an easy prediction. white people more and more will realize that they are the only potential group that shares an identity and does not act to advance its agenda. not only that but, when they try to unite to asses and forward their agenda, they are attacked. this will lead to more and more white people, just ordinary white people deciding to identify as white and begin to push a more pro white agenda. of course the morons of the world will call them nazis for daring to have a positive identity of white, because thats what they have been trained to do, but the mechanics of what is going on here is not rocket science. a group of people is being bullied into a corner by other groups, and they are going to respond. does a white man saying he is proud to be white make him a bigot, a nazi, or a racist any more than a mexican saying he is proud of his heritage or a black fighting for black rights or a gay dude on gay pride day? if you can explain to me the function that makes white people evil for identifying as white and attempting to forward their agenda, but a black dude identifying as black and pushing a pro black agenda is good, a gay dude having gay pride is good, and a mexican dude being proud of his culture and heritage is good and ok, then i will call you the winner and leave this alone. the problem is that you cant. it is a double standard and a hypocrisy that for whatever reason is prevalent in our society. it would be understandable if whites were actually bad people, but they generally aren't. they are among if not the most charitable on earth, they commit far less crime than other demographics, they generally are hard workers, and family people. there is no excuse for the hatred against them. so when you talk about racists and bigots, do not leave out your white hating friends.

       you want to paint any white person that wants to advocate for white interests as a nazi while you claim not to be a bigot, and you say you are pro-free speech and AMERICA!, but join the side that is actively engaged in shutting down any speech they deem harmful, your entire belief system is a contradiction, you have no arguments based in reality, and you obviously haven't thought about the counter to your arguments. i feel sorry for your father, he probably had high expectations, spent a ton of money to send you to some uni, just so they could turn your brain to shit. one day you will look back on all of this and know that i was right about everything, and that you just weren't prepared to grasp it yet. so sad, high hopes.

       You know nothing about me or my beliefs, other than the fact that I am opposed to people waving nazi flags. Is that so objectionable to you? If so, then I am more than happy to have agitated you.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF are white interests? Feel free to explain. I'd imagine they are similar to the interests of any other racial group - have food to feed their kids, have a job, don't get murdered by domestic terrorists...
      </p>
      <p>
       My father, who is very proud of me, didn't spend a dime on my education. I had a full ride scholarship. How about you? What was your education like? Is YOUR father proud of you? Is he proud to have a child who brings personal attacks to the debate table? A child who believes his/her race is superior to that of others? I sure hope not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you that incapable of having an adult conversation that you need to attack my origins? Or are you just too uncomfortable with your beliefs to defend them?

       and nobody got hit, huh?  go look at any of the other clips from different angles, you can clearly see him fly into atleast 4 ppl. of course he hit a parked car, something had to stop all that momentum.

       this is either cognitive dissonance or intentional narrative control. a person died from the impact he caused and there is a plethora of photographic and video evidence that shows his car coming into contact with civilians.

       The witnesses who saw said cars and trucks plough into people, is the argument that they were actors? This conspiracy of them being faked is new to me so I'm just trying to learn what the arguments actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your second question, it depends on what the event you wish to fake is. When it comes to a truck ploughing into people, I would say the crowd and onlookers need to be in on it,or what am I missing?

       Trump made sure to mention just how great the stock market was doing and how unemployment was at a record high. Everything is in a state of chaos right now, which is exactly what the Powerade that be want. A number of YouTube channels exposing the mass manipulation of the populace have magically been erased. All of this while the media is continues to drill the fear of a nuclear holocaust into our minds. It's a truly disgusting time to be alive.

       There are a number of channels that have been erased, it's even been posted about on this sub. The big one for me was "Russianvids". He pretty much ripped apart every news story and decoded the Masonic symbols/numerology, etc. It was an eye-opening channel (to say the least). Realizing just how deep the level of manipulation, fabrication and embedded symbology goes was beyond alarming.

       This reeks of a false flag w/ paid protesters on both sides.  Also today is Soros' birthday.  The person arrested does not look like the person driving behind the wheel.

       I'm gonna be honest, I don't really care that obscenities are hurting you so bad. Someone fucking died today trying to protest people white supremecists. A woman who wanted to speak out for the rights of all people. So, fuck you for downplaying the evil of these white nationalists. You're no better than them.

       I'm not ruling out that it could be a false flag. But to say the picture of the driver doesn't match the mugshot of who they arrested is asinine. Definitely see a resemblance.

       its been non-stop coverage I'd say fox news and cnn are making a big deal out of this horse shit that reeks of George Soros. And a market and dipshits purposely standing in the middle of a city street counter protesting are entirely different things.

       Just remember all western nations have to watch out for tens of millions of Muslims world wide, who are considered and labeled terrorists. This is an open fact and not debateable. Ill say it again, (tens of millions) world wide are openly in support of terrosim. There are not even a million so called Neo Nazis in the United States.  Most of whom are in Jail or live out in the boonies to be left alone. 
And every white person who has a shaved head isnt a nazi. And every batshit crazy white trash person isnt a Nazi. You can also be a racist SOB ,but still not be a Nazi. If there was a shit ton of Neo Nazi making peoples lives shitty then trust me it would be known and made public daily like Muslim bombing are. And yes , they exist but on a world wide scale?. Not even close to a national threat as Islam produces.  So shitty events like this one are way harder to find because it falls in the range of crazy and NOT DOCTRINE BASED.  Which the Qur'an openly states that terrorism is Jihad amd Jihad is the destruction of amyone not Fully Muslim including peaceful muslims.

       Not sure if a good video exists, but someone from the Hill said that POs said the car was being swarmed, and the driver was probably scared. Also, they add that he was apparently hit in the head earlier. It is too early to judge, and seems like it 's possible that it wasn't intentional. Also, this is much more harder to figure out considering there was a huge riot and fight, not just average day in Paris.

       Yeah, gonna need more evidence that he is a Nazi. Let's be subjective. I saw that police officers apparently thought the driver was not malicious in his intent and was scared. Hopefully they were right.

White supremacy - an organized effort to marginalize people on the basis of race by any means possible.

       Well, I was referring to the organized group of nazis in my last post, but it's already been confirmed that the guy was a member of the alt right. Given that he drove his car into a group of counter protesters I think we can draw some conclusions from that.

       I'm going to go to bed now. Why don't you reflect on why you feel the need to defend people who support the white nationalist movement? At the end of the day, I am not the one who divides people based on race. Are you, or do you just spend time defending those who do?

       Is it black supremacy if no diversity is forced upon countries with mostly black people living there?
White supremacy is just as stupid as black supremacy [BLM/Black only universities etc].
      </p>
      <p>
       To me islam and white supremacy are equally shite. One oppresses all freedoms and women and practices laws that only fit into the middle ages. 
Such as marrying your rapist, getting stoned to death for being raped, genital mutilation, paedophilia and anti gay to the extent of killing them [not just isis but here in Europe too, just because]. So called 'honour' killings of your own children etc, etc, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The other one wants to be segregated [but haven't actually killed anyone in their name in recent times].
And as you said, one is a religion with millions of member and spreading constantly, the other consists of a few crackpots, easily outnumbered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and if you want to leave islam, death is the going penalty for it.
So yeah, I think we have a definitive answer to which one is more dangerous.

       Are we sure it really is terrorism? Or would ''Hate Crime'' fit the bill more correctly in this situation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally dont care what its called--it was attempted murder, or attempt to cause bodily harm at the very least.  My only problem with every act of aggression like this being labelled as a ''terrorist'' attack, is that once our own citizens are being put on watch for terrorist activity, the rights of our own people, in our own country will very quickly begin to diminish.  You guys do know what the 'Patriot Act' is, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, anything will be called an act of terror, and if the term starts getting used loosely, the sentencing/punishment and all other things associated with handling terrorist activity will begin to be used loosely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think people should be upset about this (the terminology)--i think people should think about the implications of beginning to use the word terrorism more freely, and the impact it could have on our country.

       Yeah, i mean like i said, attempted murder/attempted bodily harm--whatever...I guess since the guys affiliation lie with white supremacists, and the views of the protesters he attacked were what they were, was the reason i asked if maybe it was as simple as being classified as a hate crime (to the highest magnitude).

       Terrorism is terrorism.  How do you even end up ''charged'' with that?  How will it be decided if it was truly terrorism?  Does the media decide?  The courts?  The people?

       Oh, it is not.  It is a violent outburst erupting in a confrontational situation.  Terrorism typically is an attack on innocent  people.  Also, I doubt the guy was planning to run his car into people.  I had heard they were pelting his car with rocks.  This is more akin to gang warfare then to terrorism.

       It's not a slow response it's a typical response.

      <p>
       It seems slow to you because you actually heard about it before it became mainstream news.
      </p>
      <p>
       You heard about it early because it's a white guy and reddit has been blueballing for a white terrorist for ages, so it hit the top of r/news within minutes, whereas if it had been yet another muslim it would have been suppressed and/or ignored because... Muslims being Muslims is not shocking anymore.

       The situations are not comparable.  The Muslim terrorists rammed into innocent shoppers or people celebrating a holiday.  The Antifa/BLM were deliberately confronting the alt-right group.  This is not to say the violence should be condoned, but it is not too surprising that it happened.  I believe the leftists were pelting his car with rocks and he panicked.

       There's a lot of video on Youtube. What I have seen includes one car smashing into another, getting smashed with poles and bats and then reversing the hell out of there. What happened to cause the car to crash into the one in front of it?

       I'm not sure if it can be classified as a terrorist attack, these people aren't just civilians going about their business, which I think would be a requirement.

       So your saying this is being ignored because it's one of the biggest news stories of the year? The media would shut up about it in 2 days if this was a Muslim attack, but this is going to blow up the media for weeks. It was awful but not like 50 people dead awful. What is so bad about it is the psych warfare that this is going to allow for. They will try and get people to identify whites as Nazis. There may even become talk of dangerous political speech, and the need to stop it and monitor it.

       What's more disgusting is how the police stood by, allowed the riots to get worse, and worse, and worse.  The death and blood is on their hands as much as anyone else's.  They stood by on "stand down" orders while people were assaulted.

       We have protections, that go so far, but the only "right" that anyone has is responsibility. I hate it when any protesters have their message be subverted by a single person who resorts to violence, I really do, but, you know, this isn't some corporation's lobby that we go sit in, this is confrontation.

       Even if it is, this shit is fucked up. Seems you're saying that because it's a false flag there's no need to discuss this. Plus, I hope you're meaning it in the sense that it was done in an attempt to push an agenda, not that those are crisis actors. I've seen lots of other footage of false flag events with crisis actors, and this seems way more genuine (from what footage we currently have).

       It's not about it not being a big deal. It's blowing things, marginally infrequent things, as I said before, out of proportion. It's irresponsible. Don't you people get that?

       If the truth is controversial, that isn't a good enough reason to stop speaking it. I detest the evil actions of men and women despite their labels and their political or religious identities. I'm sure we agree on that more than you're willing to admit. Don't misconstrue what I'm saying.

       The trouble with modern media/news is that everyone jumps to their conclusion and pinion so fast, even without any verification or facts in yet from police/authorities beyond what we can all see.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happened with the London runner being pushed under a bus this week; all the news sites pushing a photo and name of a suspect before he'd even been spoken to by police properly. Then turns out he wasn't even in the country when it occurred, but his name is now associated with it now and people move onto the next thing/person!

       So are you saying that some of the people marching toward the Robert E Lee statue chanting blood and soil were just swept up in the fun of it? Im using the actions of this group to decide on the character of those in the group and the people who are supporting what they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I agree that the statue of Robert E Lee should remain in the park, we shouldn't forget that he led a group of traitors to the United States of America. We shouldn't be erasing our history, as dark as it may be.

       <p>
        I don't think one person running over 20 others is the planned spark to push a DC dismantling protest.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's not just the event.  Think about what happens now. The guy that did it is almost certainly going to claim that he was afraid and it was unintentional, which means there is going to be a trial, which means this guy will probably get out on bail.  The left is not going to be happy about that.  What do you think they are going to do?  Protest?  Riot?  What happens if he gets acquitted or given a light sentence?   Consider the potential for more violence, real or false flag, in the interim.  The situation could ramp up very easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider how the MSM is going to cover this story.  Remember when Republican Congressman Scalise was shot?  It only happened 2 months ago, but that story fucking disappeared as soon as we found out he was a left winger.  It didn't fit the narrative the MSM wants to push.  This story does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you are right, though, and this isn't the spark that leads to what would basically be a civil war.

       why is it bullshit? what does freedom of speech mean if you filter what can be expressed. you cannot have it both ways. one way is american, one way is not. if you do not agree with freedom of speech, as in if you dont like it go away or change the channel, then maybe some place in europe where speech is openly filtered should be more your style. just saying, cant have it both ways. freedom of speech or not.

       They also renamed the park from "Lee Park" to "Emancipation Park." It started from a petition to remove the statue because it offended a couple of people, and they made a grand, historical case for it.

       This local issue was latched-onto by people who could fan-up this kind of shit, bring all the racist/nationalist/commie groups together for a single dichotomous brawl. I'm sure the travel expenses of many will be reimbursed by Soros groups or the Feds, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       The locals didn't help things, because they're well-meaning counter-protesting to the protesting made it more chaotic. I don't even know how they knew who was protesting what and who was on what side once the violence happened.

       I can't make any sense of this comment. Nationalism has historically been the root of all evil, intolerance, ignorance, and sheepism in general. If you can't understand why that is, I see no reason in having an argument with you. It would be like debating a fucking goat.

       Retarded. The guy in Charleston just hated Blacks he wasn't Conservative that I'm aware of, I'm not sure what Violence your think Right Wingers committed at Bundy Ranch, No Clue what Colorado PP is, That Jewish Community Center was back in 2014. I said the last couple years. Everything I listed happened in the last 1 to 2 years. If they were allegedly planning an attack it doesn't count and the Portland Stabber was Left Wing Bernie Supporter so that counts for me. LMAO! You just Blew Yourself The Fuck Out Snowflake!!!
