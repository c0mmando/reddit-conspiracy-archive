<p>Step 1. Send George Soros groups Antifa and BLM to protest against racist rally</p>

<p>Step 2. use agitators to start violence.</p>

<p>Step 3. take away the first amendment rights of the racist rally who had permits to organize.</p>

<p>Step 4. Give free reign to the Soros groups that have no permits.</p>

<p>Step 5. Wait for someone on the oppressed side to flip out over the injustice.</p>

<p>Step 6. Watch the engineered violence happen and use it to fuel and justify your agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never implied anyone was in favor of the 1st amendment, only that the rally&#39;s 1st amendment was illegally taken away. Maybe you don&#39;t understand the point of having freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is especially for unpopular speech.

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;m finding is that the city wanted to move the rally to another park for safety reasons.  The organizer of the march reportedly said that “We are going to Lee Park no matter what the outcome of the court case,” Jason Kessler said. (so if the court ruled against him he would hold the march anyway.)</p>

<p>The liberal  American Civil Liberties Union and the Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization in Charlottesville, filed suit against the city on behalf of Kessler</p>

<p>&quot;I do not admit for instance, that a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the black people of Australia. I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place.&quot;  Winston Churchill 1937 Palestine Royal Commission</p>

<p>What are you even talking about? My grandaddy immigrated from Poland to America for the freedoms it has. The freedom of speech is key to a real democratic society. That especially includes unpopular speech. Nazis didn&#39;t allow freedom of speech, so the side that was against the rally&#39;s rights were more Nazi than the people of the racist rally.

<p>I get it, you are a victim. Powerless, helpless. All you want to do is just say a few things in peace. But other people don&#39;t let you. More powerful people, more violent people. Better people.</p>

<p>This is why you became a neo-nazi. Because you are weak. How does your kind say? &quot;They are suppressing the white race&quot; etc etc. But you guys can&#39;t, because your right are suppressed. Because you are weak.</p>

<p>I hope Trump brings you strength, so that you don&#39;t have to rely on terrorism to fight for your right to display Nazi propaganda. </p>

<p>You are of polish descend, a very weak race that got massacred by the Nazi, and then the Soviets. One of the most iconic victims of the second world war. I am sorry for that, for their weakness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think you are a big boy, because of your anonymous insults on the web along with other anonymous creeps.</p>

<p>You are not. You don&#39;t like the neo-nazis because you are strong. You participate and spread it because you are weak, and scared. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t start like that, usually people like you either had no political beliefs  or  simple teenage things like libertarianism or communism. </p>

<p>But life is hard. School is hard and there is always someone better of you at  a something that you care of. The world around didn&#39;t look better either: families are a mess, work opportunities are shit and nothing, nothing tells you life is ever gonna get better for you.</p>

<p>It is for people like you that Neo-Nazis look for, they prowl for new recruits. They hide the ideology behind edgy memes. They do it on the internet and IRL, they offer a way to hit the world back. The fucking world that has nothing for you, nothing to offer. </p>

<p>I get it, it is your group, probably your only group. The feeling of purpose, of belonging to something greater is a basic human need. It&#39;s what get those in solitary confinement, it drives them crazy and scars them forever.</p>

<p>But when your group, not matter how much you think is right, cherishes an unjustifiable murder and you accept it and defend it like you are doing now. Then you had become just another puppet, in absolutely no way different than those ISIS pedo rapists. You sank to their level, you are ready to kill. Soon they will put you a gun in your hand and tell you to go an kill some niggers. And you will go, maybe you will survive. Then you do it again, your leaders will talk about how victory is close and all that jazz. </p>

<p>It will not, violent extremism NEVER wins on the long run, especially now that for our economies you need to consume, you need to spend to keep it up. You will end up hunted down like a dog ans, if you are lucky, spend your life in prison and see from behind the bars how wrong you were all along. </p>

<p>Maybe you don&#39;t realize that Nazis are socialists. Nazi literally is short for  National Socialist German Workers&#39; Party. It is to bad that the true definition of Fascism has been scewed so much in an attempt to hide history. The true definition if you look at old dictionaries is basically an all powerful state. Socialism pushes for ever more consolidation and control of your life to the state. </p>

<p>Funny. The Nazis sent actual socialists and communists to the gas chambers alongside the Jews. A big part of the Nazi Party&#39;s early support was basically, &quot;We don&#39;t really like the Nazis but at least they&#39;ll keep the socialists out of power&quot;.</p>

<p>North Korea&#39;s official name is the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea. Are you also going to argue that the NK ruling dynasty is democratic?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, like one which regulates private sexual activity, bans gay marriage, bans interracial marriage, makes it illegal for blacks to learn how to read, tries to enforce Christian religious law upon the population, and passes laws barring atheists from office.</p>

<p>Hmm, is it even worth debating? Nobody outside sections of the extreme right - annoyed by how toxic the Nazi brand has become - claim the Nazis were socialist. They were extremely socially conservative and worshipped the state above all else...which is why the Nazis are recognised as the most famous fascist movement of the 20th century, even more so than Mussolini.</p>

<p>Fuck racists nobody has time for their isolationist bullshit, If you cant handle the reality your race is only a small part of the total population of earth than you can kindly crawl into a whole and stay there while the world progresses around you.</p>
