       Back when I followed Bitcoin closely (in 2013 and early 2014), there were discussions about the orgins of Bitcoin, and the NSA was frequently mentioned. Gavin Andresen (the "head" of Bitcoin after Satoshi's disappearance) attended a public CIA event where he held a talk about the potential of cryptocurrencies. This was controversial, and made many bitcoiners question his allegiances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take a look at mainstream movies and tv shows now (e.g. Westworld, Mr. Robot), many of them are about the people waking up, banding together and taking down the Evil Establishment. We see this same theme reflected in the real world as well, the "anti establishment" President Trump being the most notable example. In the newest season of Silicon Valley (great show, made by Mike Judge) the main character even invents "A New Internet", which is based on the real technology Ethereum (derivative of Bitcoin), and which "can't be hacked or controlled by the evil establishment". Vitalik Buterin, the inventor of Ethereum, recently met with Vladimir Putin to discuss the technology. J.P. Morgan Chase has also shown a keen interest in this specific type of crypto currency, and it's no secret that they're involved in the development of Ethereum. Other banks and large financial institutions are also jumping aboard the crypto train.
      </p>
      <p>
       In
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7pMggPnug">
        "Chained to the rhythm"
       </a>
       , Katy Perry sings about how fake our lives are, and that we're all like mindless drones just blindly consuming pop culture, thinking we're free, while we're really walking in chains. But then there's a guest appearance by Skip Marley, Bob Marley's son, and he's essentially singing about how the Evil Establishment has unwittingly awakened a slumbering giant (the sleeping, mindless drone masses), and that this mass of people is now about to riot.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at the current Bitcoin price (and the long term logarithmic chart), I get the sense that some huge events are about to happen on this Earth. Is it a coincidence that artists like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLhGq0060w">
        The Weeknd
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN4ooNx77u0">
        Harry Styles
       </a>
       (from One Direction) appear to be warning us, in their hit songs, about impending disaster -- while things seemingly are heating up in world politics as well? Judging by the headlines of the MSM and the controlled "alt media", a huge war might break out any minute now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will the "riots" look like? People scrambling to empty their bank accounts, hoping to put all their fiat into Bitcoin, but the banks shut down, thus making it impossible for the Average Joe's to empty their accounts?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Economist magazine (partly owned by Rothschilds, supposedly) "warned" us of a global currency by 2018.

       Hey OP, don't mind the people that respond with a single bullshit sentence.  I know you were trying to start a conversation, but you're mostly dealing with assholes and shills.  If these people don't believe in conspiracies, how come they surf this sub and try to make people look weird for an idea or some connection other people might have not noticed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I think there are many people who would like to see riots, civil war, or world war 3.  I believe part of the strategy was for the elite to intermingle with their slaves and then start an uprising to bring about their new world order.  Having chains of command already in place to overthrow the "elite," they could win the "revolution" and finally come out of hiding as heroes and saviors.  Just an idea.  Who knows? At least my random hypothesis is better than the bullshit non-comments from the rest of the replies.  Maybe it will start a conversation?

       Thanks. Unfortunately, this sub was compromised a long time ago. It's now overrun with the same people and bots that frequent The_Donald, so anything not fitting into the partisan bullshit narrative is immediately downvoted into oblivion. That's just the way it is.
      </p>

       Perhaps I should make a post where I claim to be a "high level insider" from the FBI, confirming that Trump is about to lock up Hillary any minute now. That's the sort of thing that's upvoted in here these days, along with memes and bullshit posts about Antarctica or something.

       Haha, yeah, I feel you.  This is kind of my new video game, so I force myself to respond to the shills/assholes when I see them putting in more than a two-bit response.  When they contribute more than an insult they sometimes create the foundation for a great conversation.

       Was going to reply intelligently because you really jogged my neurons on this one. But then you posted this. The shills are from every shithole on reddit, not just the_donald and there is no political bias on conspiracy, just two sides of shills. I am a the_donald member, but the shit that is posted in conspiracy and the shit posted in the_donald is not much the same and likely botted (its often 20 posts of the same article) the same from
       <a href="/r/politics">

       Personal anecdote: I was a longtime lurker here for years, never posted. I didn't start posting til The_Donald. Now I'm comfortable posting in general, so I now post here, as well. I assume I'm pretty average, so I'm sure this is true for many others.

       I suspect Bitcoin won't be dominant very long, but I don't expect it to go anywhere soon. I've follow several altcoins for many years and it is just amazing how many different crypto currencies are out there and the diverse innovations many of them are attempting. I think a better design will outpace Bitcoin sometime pretty soon.

       That sounds contradictory, but okay.   I just meant that there is no guarantee that it will become some sort of world currency.  You said it was too big to stop.

        I've follow several altcoins for many years and it is just amazing how many different crypto currencies are out there and the diverse innovations many of them are attempting. I think a better design will outpace Bitcoin eventually.

       I agree, but I think it could even happen quickly because it is so fluid, and it is digital.  There's not that much physical investment in it other than miners.

       It's not really changing the concept of ownership other than digitizing everything in the blockchain.  I thought you meant something more radical.

       No, in Silicon Valley they didn't use Ethereum, decentalized/distibuted networks existed long before bitcoin. You are creating connections that are simply wrong. Yes, such a network is harder to control, though not impossible and to say it isn't hackable is wishful thinking at best.
Apart from that. Yes we live in interesting times, let's hope it will end good.

       Tell that to the redditors in the Etherum sub. They claim "A New Internet" (from SV) is essentially identical to Ethereum. Albeit obviously with another name.

       Hear what you're saying, binauralbeatz! I have noticed similar programing using post apocalyptic  entertainment.

       I've always thought the goal with the post Apocalyptic narrative was to make the meek, meeker and the angry, envious. Its Mass Mind Fuckery or World Order Porn. Take your pick. Just don't try to make acronyms out of them. You'll be disappointed. I'm Italian. 
Of course Katy Perry, The Weekend and Harry Stiles are all on the dole.  Junior members, for now. Full members after a positive review at the end of the mandatory probationary period(SPOILER- Heath's was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       so positive). We are definitely affected by their images and songs. Their twisted thoughts corkscrewing their way into our collective brains. That being typed, I must add that...it's effective. Their Energy is beating our Energy. We could try to engage them by making songs and videos and endless posts on sadly controlled, once awesome, community websites in a Quixotic tit for tat scrum that leaves us tired and the tips of our fingers tender from typing, or..... we could meditate! Who's with me? C'mon! What have we got to lose?

       I'm certain that some of you are rolling your eyes and I get it, really, I get it. I'm not saying "Grab your Crystal underwear, polish your favorite chakras we're going astral surfing!" Just sit down and thi..... wait a minute, we might be playing right into their hands... I'll be right back. I'm back. I had to check the occult calendar. Looks like nothing really happens in occult circles in the month of August, except for some light human sacrifice on the 1st so we are good...hold on, what if they scrubbed the month of August, except of course for the light human sacrifice on the 1st, in order to throw 
the wool over our eyes... of course, we ARE sheep! It all makes perfect sense...I'LL BE RIGHT BACK! I'm back. I went to the way back machine and they didn't scrubb the month of August. Light human sacrifice is still listed as August 1st on the way back March 12, 2013 listing. Now that that has all been sorted out, I think it would still be a splendid idea if the WHOLE world could, for 15 minutes, think loving and compassionate thoughts for all. I just think it could be cool. Mostly because we haven't tried that yet and they haven't yet been able to stop me from thinking. Let's kick them in their brain balls! Let's fight their negative energy with some global positive energy! Let's do this! Tell everyone! EEEEVRYYYYONE!

       Haha, yeah, I feel you.  This is kind of my new video game, so I force myself to respond to the shills/assholes when I see them putting in more than a two-bit response.  When they contribute more than an insult they sometimes create the foundation for a great conversation.

       Was going to reply intelligently because you really jogged my neurons on this one. But then you posted this. The shills are from every shithole on reddit, not just the_donald and there is no political bias on conspiracy, just two sides of shills. I am a the_donald member, but the shit that is posted in conspiracy and the shit posted in the_donald is not much the same and likely botted (its often 20 posts of the same article) the same from
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       bots here. You posted something that was a conspiracy idea, which was interesting, then out of no where you made me cringe like fuck for no real reason.
