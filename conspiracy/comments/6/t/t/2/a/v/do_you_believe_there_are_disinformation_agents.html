       Don't see why there wouldn't be
       <em>
        some

       kind of presence on one of the biggest social platforms on the internet. Especially on r/UFO I get the feeling there are more nonbelievers and naysayers of the phenomena than there are those who believe, even agnostically. I'm not saying I'm jumping to any conclusions, and it's probably just me but it feels like there's a general negativity and condescendence there compared to other relative subs.

       What I find scariest is that while I'm sure there are paid shills, plenty have bought into whatever is vs them propaganda their side had pushed and shill for free

       This. I've seen plenty of actual humans here on this sub, maybe average or not far below average intelligence, just peddling absolute chronic bullshit, all day every day. It doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny, and they are usually challenged on it, but the next day: more of the same. Again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully there are also some very sharp people here who are genuinely curious and incisive, much moreso than me. I pay close attention to what these guys have to say about a given subject.

       You might be underestimating how many shills there are.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have some code for downvoting any real comments and putting lame comments at the top no matter whether the posts below actually have more upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen many good comments get buried quickly.

       It is not just shills, there are moderators involved in this.  Reddit is censoring and it really freaking sucks.

       You know what's even worse? we know about dis info agents now in 2016-2017 at least most of us. Imagine what they were able to do on 911. What about green energy machines that have been created by people that go missing or suddenly die after eating at a restaurant and screaming' i've been poisoned' (stan meyer)

       I used to believe in 'paid shills' until I began asking people for actual evidence that they exist. Then I began to realise that 'paid shills' are just the conspiracy community's version of the devil. Boogeymen to blame for any and everything, including petty disagreements over trivial matters.

       No of course it doesn't.  If you read it you wouldn't have to ask unless you're just being smarmy with a rhetorical question.

       You're also arguing semantics.  Bots are going to be overwhelmingly less expensive and more efficient than writing paychecks to human users.

       they absolutely exist. multiple govts, major corps, lobbyists, everyone is doing it. the thing is there is probably 1/5 as many as people on this sub claim there is.

      <pre><code> We are everywhere in the sub. We work 24/7 basically and some of us pretend to be anti trump while others pretend to be pro Trump, thus creating an illusion of strong division and influencing those who lean towards one side or the other to be more strongly against the opposition.

 PS. A couple mods are also working for us.

       that was a few months back, he accidentily let it slip that he was paid, and got his account banned (first in this sub, now suspended for all reddit). could have been a troll or disinfo, but it seemed plausible at that time.

       I thought it couldn't hurt asking via PM... and I assume now enough time has passed to put his quote here.

       the story was:
       <br/>
       minimum wage, low-tier work. no insights on higher tier big pictures. basically some bored/drunk/stoned guy in his mom's basement.
       <br/>
       accidentily put text into post instead of message...

       if you ever have been bored/drunk/stoned you know that can happen.

       my exchange happened after the account was banned, and thus "out of the game". since it was very vague and no names or details were given, you may as well consider it a short-lived LARP.

       why not? its not like knowing this will change anything, i honestly think most of the chatter in here is scripts between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       now the quote COULD be bullshit, but honestly it perfectly describes the oddness of what has been going on here for months and makes a lot of sense. their tactics are driving people out of the sub, burying things we should be talking about, and derailing anything that goes outside of this narrative they've cooked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact its been allowed to go on for this long leads me to believe that some mods MAY be in on it as well because its being allowed to happen.

       I believe something has been hidden from us since ancient history, and the only way to really even know what it would be would be to follow napoleon, attempt to disestablish all world governance, and attack religion directly, annexing Rome and breaking into the vaults to allow objective scientists and historians to see the

       So many possibilites...
       <br/>
       I once got a PM with the simple question "Are you a shill?"...
       <br/>
       Without any reply to my replies.
       <br/>
       I later learned, that someone used that as testing method, to study the difference between bot behaviour and user behaviour. I am somewhat proud to have been part of the control group ;-)

       Of course there is. As far as r/UFO's goes, keep in mind there are a ton of trolls in that sub too. A lot of the comments are meant to be sarcastic. Like calling a ufo that clearly can't be explained swamp gas or a balloon. That type of thing.

       Depends what you mean by shills. Government paid agents, not very much. Some Russians but mostly in bot form. This sub is not nearly as important as the people here think it is, like they see shills everywhere. I see a bunch of nutcases TPB would have very little interest in.
      </p>

       There are groups of neckbearded basement dwelling 4 channers who love Trump and plan together in chat rooms though. You see them all the time, it's pretty obvious they all agreed to talk about Seth Rich that day as there 20 posts on it all with insane numbers of upvotes. I assume one day they will learn less is more and not massively overdue it like that, but maybe they just aren't very smart. The attitude seems to be that 50 posts gives the illusion of widespread support and that's all they want. A thinking intelligent person would see right thru that, but they aren't trying to convince intelligent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did just skim by the Facebook Pizzagate is real group and was shocked it had like 25 thousand people. I guess the retard brigade works on stupid people, that's the target group: really stupid Trump voters. It seems to me though like they put in a ton of work and have not had any real success, no way do more people believe pizzagate now than 6 months ago.

       Some will say this is exaggerated, and it is --
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       -- the disinformation activists will be the most vocal ones. They're here specifically to comment, whereas a lot of the reddit community are passive viewers. So they do significantly overrepresent as a proportion of the apparent reddit user base.

       It's a fact. When I'm not on mobile I will link a study that confirmed 90% of comments in mainstream articles are from shills. I also know this because years ago I was solicited to develop persona management software. For every 1000 accounts there is 1 human operating them. This is a conservative estimate.

       Great post! There is indeed plenty of evidence out there about astroturfing organizations. I have compiled a few links as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       I've been trying to be aware of it, because they ARE on this subreddit, trying to slowly make us pass these things off as fake. I saw a commenter trying to debunk alien footage with a much more 'normal' reasoning behind the footage, I wasn't really buying it

       Clearly.  However, I believe that paranoia over this also causes deep, painful divisions that are ultimately more harmful to discussion.  If someone disagrees with you and you write them off because you believe they are a shill, you are closing your mind.

       And moderators who are controlling what we post.

      <p>
       First  I was kicked off of Ask_the_Donald for suggesting that there are many liberals that don't believe the Russian hacking bullshit and that we should all work together to get the truth out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I was forbidden from posting stories on world news because I was posting  the recent mainstream stories that the russian hacking was all bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had already been blocking me from posting about the EU being pissed off about the sanctions and how it seemed like a business deal for the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I could still post comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       After writing about Big Pharma's control over congress, I am now forbidden from posting comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pretty shocked they actually let me post on this subreddit.

       Wouldn't it be odd if there were astroturfers on this site with the sole purpose of fanning the flames? Like rather than derailing a conversation with scripted  talking points, they are just there to antagonize the userbase and then move on to the next user? In other words, the astroturfers use their hands to anger users and like dominos, they fustrations spread among the userbase confirming biases (irrational resentment and generalizations like all libs are sjws and republicans are racist) and spreading people even further apart.

       You can all fuck right off.You're against right-wing positions? "ShariaBlue shill yaddayaddayadda."

       You oppose left ideas? "Russian shill,nazi yaddayaddayadda."

There are people who just disagree with you.That does not make them shills or disinfo agents.

       There are tons of paid trolls on reddit, OP, of course. I've personally dealt with a vicious one who haunts reddit's drug boards for about a year and a half now. (since I figured him out- he's been here much longer) He constantly pushed an anti-spiritual agenda, saying psychedelic experiences are random, rather than meaningful. He could be at
       <a href="/r/ufo">
        /r/ufo
       </a>
       too, telling people not to look closely, we all know UFO's are 100% military, no aliens ever. Trust him.

       Fuck yes. It just makes sense. If I was a politician I would absolutely have people create disinformation campaigns on reddit and 4chan. Some of the biggest highways on the internet, used by the youth of the United States largely that can easily influence 100,000s of people with one good post.

       I believe something has been hidden from us since ancient history, and the only way to really even know what it would be would be to follow napoleon, attempt to disestablish all world governance, and attack religion directly, annexing Rome and breaking into the vaults to allow objective scientists and historians to see the
