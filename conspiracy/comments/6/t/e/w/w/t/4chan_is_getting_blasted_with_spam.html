       Does anyone else feel like it's mostly just white noise right now? A whole lot of saying nothing but really loud? 4chan is usually filled with hate but there's a lot of discussion about that anger. It's like there are people just screaming at each other

       4chan has been blasted with spam for awhile now. And if you are talking about /pol/, then why do you expect much from that board? That board was compromised years ago. Generally 4chan was one of the earliest places that was used to experiment social engineering techniques before put on a larger scale towards the rest of the Web. I remember /n/ (news), long ago, such a different place then... 
but I will admit there are still moments of clarity, not often. This place isn't that much better, just less memes.

       I'm still trying to find that one out myself. I think voat isn't bad, but I haven't been on there long enough to truly say. I mainly went to voat's pizzagate area which had a great wealth of information.

       I'm worried it's not the usual pol crowd, people not interested in discussion have began to move in bigger numbers. Trying to turn everything into a shouting match because that's all they know. My gut says people will get tired of it who aren't interested in the content and are only motivated by getting to tell off 'nazis'. Usually in waves of shilling people develop a different perspective just by being exposed to the information talked about there, but I worry the shills fucked up the ratios of quality posts to see and have to think about

       Totally, had to re type the address several times after seeing the threads on /pol to make sure. Not that they are credible,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/J_L7cciuB1Y">
        the footage speaks for it'self though
       </a>
       what i would like to see is the footage of the police officer claimed to have said the order to 'stand down' from the Mayor. The whole thing stinks of the kind of shit that's been going on here in Northern Ireland for decades, the state playing the people against themselves.

       There is so much misinformation I mean a fucking police helicopter just crashes while this is going on? Who knows what the fuck a 'sjw' is making of this scenario I can't fucking imagine. The Internet will balance itself out and this will turn into some huge metaphor as we've seen time and time again but wow . Change seems to be coming though , the truth is just getting more exhausting to hide while it takes no extra effort to produce it

       I hear ya dude! But one thing i've come to accept based on experience of growing up in N.Ire and working as an engineer for the BBC (supporting technical equipment reporters and producers use) i am left tainted about the truth ever being revealed. Newsrooms are echo chambers of political parties/financial backers/friends in big business. It really is down to the people to unite, which requires truth...

       Absolutely. I've been working on ways to convey new ideas effectively and music is a big outlet for me. If something just sounds good the sound of the words themselves can get stuck in your head. Like you don't think of the meaning behind the words or even that you're hearing a word, it's just such a good tune that the singers vocal cords are an instrument and you just think of the tones. I smile thinking of a sentiment with the power to awaken someone stuck in the heads of the people for no other reason at first than its sound making people happy

       I once heard somebody explain that people do not care about what you know, they care about how you make them
       <em>
        feel

       . If you keep this in mind at all times when dealing with regular, TV-believing people, you will get infinitely further than if you neglect this simple reality.

       I am going to educate myself more on this, I like finding them parallels, Thanks for the direction. It's a distinct feeling to see something play out the way you expected, especially when you are a single individual sizing up a pattern that causes so much widespread suffering while forwarding the agenda of some terribly misguided souls willing to inflict this on their people. Not like the governed body , but the human race which includes themselves. Living with the knowledge and acting out that theyre pitting people against one another, I am very happy I can't properly conceive of that outlook

       I know most people don't like his music, but B.O.B. Has been producing album after album, all of which are centered around conspiracies and truth spreading. I don't know if he is a big name (fake rabbit hole generator) but it's interesting to listen to. If you produce any music and don't mind sharing I would gladly give it a listen and let you know what I think about it. Between tom delonge, and BoB, we might actually have a chance to produce music that informs the public.

       I'm about to sleep honestly so I want to expand on this later but I have a lot of lyrics I've written with corresponding beats some I've recorded but never posted online. I actually just recorded a skeleton (people sleeping so low voice level) last night so once I get the opportunity to record it full throttle I might just send it your way

       That's the thing I don't know anymore. I know it definitely started as rap , I don't want to say more as I would like to hear what you make of it without my full introduction

       Yesterday I saw loads of posts getting removed which where investigating the car attack. The spam there and here was upped to the next level, we see why now.

       Yes and yes they were passing around dox info but from what I saw it was mainly for debunking that it wasnt him. I saw a bunch of pics that an OP took of that attack car parked at the end of his street, people swapping around before they arrested the driver

       I am going to educate myself more on this, I like finding them parallels, Thanks for the direction. It's a distinct feeling to see something play out the way you expected, especially when you are a single individual sizing up a pattern that causes so much widespread suffering while forwarding the agenda of some terribly misguided souls willing to inflict this on their people. Not like the governed body , but the human race which includes themselves. Living with the knowledge and acting out that theyre pitting people against one another, I am very happy I can't properly conceive of that outlook
