       They're other places on reddit where you can circle jerk in peace but you're going to get people that disagree with you here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of throwing a fit because you feel like you "lost" get over it and continue to push and defend your narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say the only shills in here over the past 24 hours seem to be bleed overs from conservative subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while you're throwing a fit remember that many of those people actively doxxed and innocent man for hours last night.

       Hey check this out , if Antifas ideas are that good they should sell themselves  it doesn't need to show up with weapons like they always do to force ideas that just means the ideas are already awful, obviously,  otherwise everyone would agree. Inciting riots that get people killed everywhere it goes means they are not convincing anyone of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa is a violent group on outdated ideas that failed and they cause riots and deaths.

        That's great and all, but this thread ain't about antifa. A racist white nationalist and TRUMP SUPPORTER killed people with his car yesterday. Stay on topic.

       Seriously though, Antifas violence needs to be addressed! They showed up to the rally with weapons in hand and violence in mind, this is not what the United States is about!

       This isn't the place to address it.  Make a new thread of youbwany, but this is about a white supremacist killing innocent people.  People died and many were hurt.  That's what we are talking about here.

       America was built on that premise though? A bunch of people showed up, bows/swords/rifles in hand and decided to start violently liberating 'your' country from Native Americans, did they not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazis/KKK members ALSO showed up weapons in open carry holster or rifle across back, with the threat to use them. Both sides were legally allowed to have the weapons they had on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it always the other side that needs to address their problems? Why can't both sides look at themselves with a little self awareness and go "you know what, we're all being pretty fucking stupid here"?

       It's 2017 no one is alive from 1492. No one alive owes anyone for things they did not do, except basic human respect which has LONG been paid, ironically it is the left who wants to erase even history so it is rather a hypocritical double standard argument.

       I ain't defending Richard Spencer, clear as that. If they literally say black people are lesser, they won't be defended by me. I'd hope most of the right leaning users will completely agree with that.

       You can try and make it so they represent the entirety of people who aren't the left, and Facebook and Reddit are already doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I hate above all else, this ability to spread fake news and memes. You know Facebook had one showing a sign up in Charlottesville saying something positive, the meme said that they were posted on all the store fronts. How do I know that, do I take some memers advice? Do I just like it an move on because it's positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this is everywhere online and I can't figure out what is truly going on, especially since the numbers for these events are memeified half the time instead of actually displaying the real numbers.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       No you're wrong, the shells want us to leave so they can run their narratives with no opposition. It would mean clear funding for as long as until the next people show up and start throwing sticks in their spokes. The only people fighting this are people doing it on their own time, and I think we need as many people shining truth onto situations as we can.

       Or maybe we just disagree with your worldview and that's okay? Check my post history, I am clearly not a "shill" (exactly what a shill would say....). Everything I post and comment I also receive a lot of backlash, almost entirely from T_D theorists. Brigading is a thing, shills are a thing, reddit is not neutral. Ok. But don't use it as an excuse to just dismiss everyone who doesnt agree with you. This is r/conspiracy, not your safe space at T_D where you instaban anyone with an opinion (r/politics operates the same way just with more up votes instead of banning).

       I'm sorry if I confused you with a Donald supporter but your post sounds exactly like the 100 other T_D posts today in response to the VA protests. Even the rhetoric you use while describing your opponents characterization of you (nazi) makes it sound like it. What's the point of this post then? Inviting the obvious? Pointing out the obvious?

       may be your problem here. What is the "us" you are referring to? It really, really sounds like you are referencing T_D in context to the "nazi" and "shill" rhetoric. Like, to a "T" (_D) &lt;---pun intended. Honestly tho it's not like I'm gonna check everyone's posy history before I comment. If I see rhetoric like libtard, cuck, shill etc... it's 99% gonna be a trumper. I get where you're coming from but don't be offended or surprised when your post turns into a war between T_D users and T_D haters.

       I'll go ahead and say I'm still a supporter of Trump until he gives me a reason to change my mind. This doesn't mean that I'm close minded or "shilling for him". I'd love to have a dialogue where ideas are challenged and if I'm proven wrong or shown supporting facts then I'm willing to change my view accordingly. But don't revert to the typical ad hominem attacks and name calling. That doesn't get us anywhere.

       I never claimed that Trump supporters were shills or that being a trump supporter invalidated your opinion in this sub. I merely stated what is true for me as someone who doesn't support trump. I primarily receive backlash from trump supporters. Difference in opinions. I didn't revert to any name calling or ad hominen attacks. Merely pointing out the obvious.

       Maybe not you individually but the dominating voice of the left seems to follow that suit. Just watch any late night tv show. Why does discourse prod such hostility these days? I thought we were smarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course you'll receive backlash but it's become a sort of self defense response. They feel the need to backlash because of the unprecedented attacks from media and other public figures while ignoring blatant achievements.

       Have you checked the stock market recently? The unemployment rates? Major victories over isis? Or maybe you just listen to the intentionally weighted polls the media always covers. My point is that his performance isn't nearly  as horrible as it's portrayed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not to be "that guy" but evidence of forgery was found on his birth certificate you know. Now I'm not saying all the Manchurian candidate stuff, but I can't exactly ignore facts.

       no, if they drive regular users away, to whom would they then speak to?

       No because the brigadiers have been calling regular users on this sub nazis for asking questions and being skeptical. I'm also willing to admit that their are shills from both sides.

       I'll go ahead and say I'm still a supporter of Trump until he gives me a reason to change my mind. This doesn't mean that I'm close minded or "shilling for him". I'd love to have a dialogue where ideas are challenged and if I'm proven wrong or shown supporting facts then I'm willing to change my view accordingly. But don't revert to the typical ad hominem attacks and name calling. That doesn't get us anywhere.

       This is exactly what I have people tell me every once in awhile as well..."by your rhetoric and blahblahblah you sound like a T_D supporter".  Just because someone has a strong viewpoint doesn't mean they are a the_donald supporter, lul.
