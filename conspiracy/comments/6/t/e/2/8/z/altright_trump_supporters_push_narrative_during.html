       while people speak of the horrors brought to us today by the hatred surrounding the white supremacy movement in america
      </p>
      <p>
       the discussion the alt-right would rather have (and russian bots push are)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        George Soros False Flag! (easiest copout but most ridiculous)
       </li>
       <li>
        Why is the media attacking trump for his response? (you know why....his response was tame....no fire and fury for nazis ...pussy)
       </li>
       <li>
        They Want to Divide Us! (we were never joined with nazis dumbass...we've been divided, stop deflecting)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Basically the response someone has to this event and the discussion they want to have says alot about who they are and their affiliations
      </p>
      <p>
       if this was a muslim running over a southern white christian family none of the bulletpoints above would even be considered BY REPUBLICANS/CONSERVATIVES
      </p>
      <p>
       the alt-right and nazi sympathizers are going to be hard at work this week muddying the story and doing everything they can to deflect and kill the conversation about the murder that happened this week
      </p>
      <p>
       especially here in r/conspiracy....because as you know....they are among us
      </p>
      <p>
       ps.  dont let the right distance themselves from the alt-right this week....r/the_donald did sticky and promote the alt-right march all week...these are their people!

       my blinders must be on- i see more people questioning whether this was real than apologizing for extremists actually doing this. personally, I don't care who apologizes (left right or neither) any murder and hate should be condemned and prosecuted not let go.

       What's the deal with asking people to apologize for others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole idea of an apology is to feel sympathy and remorse for wrong-doing...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the case when someone else apologizes for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't ask non-terrorist Muslims to apologize for the terrorists? Why should we ask the non-terrorist whites to apologize for this incident?

       Historically, we have seen much more violence from leftist protesters than from the "alt-right". The rally organizers had a legal permit to hold a rally to protest the removal of a statue from the park. The rally protesters did not. The "alt-right" was doing it the legal way, and the right way; even if you don't agree with their message.

       As for the driver, well, we will have to find out over the coming days/weeks what his motive was. (That's what they always say when a Muslim runs a vehicle into a crowd right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note; it's funny that everyone wants to call everyone Nazis now-a-days. Especially those on the left. I wonder if they realize that the Nazis were socialists? The Nazi's views line up more closely with those of the Dems than the Reps.

       The Nazis were only socialist after they purged all of the undesirables mooching off their welfare. Kinda like the Cadillac driving welfare queen rhetoric you hear from Republicans. They try to convince black Americans that by providing a social safety net, Democrats are doing harm to them, because the one thing Republicans want the most is minorities not benefitting from the tax dollars they pay into the system.

       It's not minorities that we don't want benefiting from the welfare system, it's lazy fucks who won't go out and try to find work. Perfectly able bodied people who are incentivized to not work and sit at home collecting welfare. It has nothing to do with minorities, and everything to do with laziness and work ethic.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I started to ask Ehrlichman a series of earnest, wonky questions that he impatiently waved away. “You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”

       You referring to Hitler as dear leader again is disturbing.
Yea Trumps a Nazi? His daughters Jewish, grandkids Jewish, best friends with Jews and blacks but he's a Nazi....
You are so dumb. You believed all the fake hit pieces on him too I'm sure? Still believe he pissed on prostitutes too? Whatever justifies your hate. And that is why you are a radicalized scum bag

       Trump may or may not have pissed on prostitutes, but definitely paid them to defile the bed Obama slept in. You know that's something the sick fuck would do. You know Hitler dated a Jew? And trump dated his daughter. Coincidence? Hmm

       I don't believe I called you a Nazi directly. I haven't looked at your post history yet. Yeah fusion GPS? Some Infowars bullshit? What was debunked exactly? A lot of the things from the dossier have been proven true, but that's not really relevant. It's all about Mueller's investigation into trump and the GOPs finances, potential money laundering schemes with Russian oligarchs, real estate fraud, and an American right wing party benefiting from a Russian cyber attack.

       Do you even know about the RICO fraud suit trump had to settle just last year for $25 million. He scammed a bunch of people with trump university just like he scammed people with his campaign.

       We have to wait and see what Mueller says to priebus. If there's no connection then why did Donny junior post his emails about trying to collude with Russia?

       You're linking to the post. The trashiest paper in this city. And even they're just speculating:
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it was all on the up and up — though “honorary” jobs rarely pay $4 million a year, and Bill did quit just before Hillary began her latest presidential run.

       The "Neo-Nazi" that did this didn't kill as many as he could of. He was driving slow.. I love the designer photography of the incident, it's pretty wild the pictures and videos people just so happen to be ready to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's wild his airbag didn't go off and the fact that the rig didn't take more damage and how calm the guy looked while driving. Didn't look like a hate filled maniac but more of someone who was fulfilling a specific task or a job.

       Dude, just fucking say it: "The guy in the car was a white nationalist Trump supporter, he lost his shit and did something terrible."

       His mother already said he was an avid Trump supporter, he literally crashed his car into a group of protestors at a politically charged rally. Why do you have to tip toe around it? We all know what happened; it's like if a Muslim dude crashes his car into a group of civilians, we all know what happened.

       Yes, he is almost undoubtedly a white nationalist Trump supporter. Just one rotten apple to spoil the bunch. (all conspiracy speculation aside)
      </p>
      <p>
       But being a Trump supporter, and crashing your car into a group of protesters are not directly correlated. I am a borderline Trump supporter, but I don't go running my car into crowds. Now mentally ill, that I could believe.

       My point is this: Muslim runs car into crowd while yelling "Alah Akbar", media says motive unclear...  White guy runs car into crowd, media says, White supremacist, nationalist, Trump supporter mows down crowd of peaceful protesters in act of domestic terrorism!...

        But being a Trump supporter, and crashing your car into a group of protesters are not directly correlated
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course not, I never said it was, but there's a lot of folks that want to tip toe around what happened or say it was something totally different than what actually happened, and I'm fucking calling bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a Trump supporter, I was a Bernie-or-Buster; when some Bernie supporter punched a Trump supporter a while back, soooo many people on Bernie's side said it was a secret Clinton operative or that the Trump supporter threatened him or this or that. And I can't find that video, but... that was a Bernie supporter slugging a Trump supporter totally unprovoked. Both sides want to tip toe around the truth when things like this happen, and they happen on both sides. Bullshit. Fuck covering up somebody else's dirty deeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem like a smart guy, and going through your post history you seem like a good guy, but you're tip toe-ing around the truth of the matter, and sometimes the truth sucks. But it's the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Muslim dude who crashed his car into a group of people was a Muslim extremist.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Bernie supporter who punched a Trump supporter was a liberal extremist.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Trump supporter who crashed his car into a group of protestors was an alt-right extremist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks, but that is what it is, and you can't and shouldn't tip toe around that.

       Your entire argument rests upon the fact that you inherently believe what the mainstream media is telling you about what happened. Like others are saying, there are no solid facts right now, it's too early to fully understand what has happened, and multitudes of people are jumping the gun of
       <em>
        muh supremecy!!11
       </em>
       without taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reserving an opinion until you have more information or solid facts
       <em>
        that don't come from biased sources
       </em>
       is not an excuse. If anyone here is a lapdog, it's those like you who have already formed an opinion before you even have a full understanding of what has happened. That isn't being an apologist; that's being a non-partisan, logical human being.

       A) The mainstream media would have to do a hell of a job to fake a massive white nationalist rally
      </p>
      <p>
       B) There's actual footage of the car crashing into a group of people
      </p>

       C) There's actual footage and mugshots from the suspects arrest

       D) His mother has already come out and said he's an avid supporter of the alt-right
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are all solid facts; I've done my homework on this, and many news outlets and first hand accounts are reporting the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't me being partisan, this IS me using my head. There is plenty of undeniable proof of what happened in Virginia, and I use that proof and my own logic and common sense to put the pieces together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please tell me which part of the story I should be waiting for before I formulate my pinion. I don't inherently believe what the mainstream media says, in fact I am very skeptical of what the mainstream media says. I also have half a brain, though, and am able to put pieces together when they're all right in front of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And notice I haven't said anything about white supremacy, although there were white supremacists present at the rally, as well as neo-Nazis. I've talked about white nationalists and the alt-right.

       I've looked through some of your post history, and you seem to be a real user. Taking that into account, I'll ask you a couple of questions and play devil's advocate here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your points A-D all seem to be saying the same thing to me. You've underestimated the power of the media corporation as a whole; you don't understand the collusion of media, government, and business or rather, you underestimate; you've taken
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       and learned
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       from 9/11, Sandy Hook, Pulse shooting and other false flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a white woman living in the South.  I have never met a white supremacist. That is not to say they don't exist; but it's hard for me to believe the spin that is being put on this story. I can understand the cause of the "rally" (it wasn't a rally; there has been a push in the past few years to remove all sentiments of history from the Civil War-era - look into what happened in New Orleans when the government tried to scrub history there too). What I mean is that this "protest" happened because some residents were upset that their local history is being rewritten by PC culture. They acquired a permit to allow them to say their piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point A: This "protest" was taken over by those who have political agenda on both sides: T_D users and Antifa. These actual protesters brought their narratives with them and used this PEACEFUL demonstration as a means to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point B: How can you believe this story, without a shadow of doubt, when pictures
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Y0ttv">
        like this
       </a>
       exist? Why did that car stop in the middle of a residential neighborhood, open its doors, and passengers exit? Why do eyewitness reports not corroborate? One witness says there was a license plate; some do not.
       <strong>
        In Ohio, where the apprehended suspect lives, a front AND back license plate is required on all vehicles.
       </strong>
       If we can't even get a reliable report of ONE license plate, there is no a way a consensus wil be reached on the required two license plates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point C: "Actual footage" like the Twin Towers falling, right? Because as you should know in 2017 there is no such thing as "actual footage" unless you have EXIF data or similar to back your files up.
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/7qckavv4zffz.jpg">
        This
       </a>
       is James Fields, the man clearly driving this car.
       <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2017/08/james-alex-fields-jr-charlottesville-suspect-arrested-driver-crashed-rally-republican-age-bio-video/">
        This
       </a>
       is James Fields, the man who was
       <strong>
        actually arrested.
       </strong>
       Why is this NOT the same person? OP, unless you can explain this discrepancy, your entire argument is bullshit to me. And I mean no offense personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point D:
       <a href="http://archive.is/Ul8TV">
        Crisis actors
       </a>
       are bought and paid for every single day. This woman honestly seems emotionally disturbed and mentally unstable, which is normal for a situation like this. But when you take those two characteristics and pair them with the facts that A) she had little to no knowledge of what her "son" had done yet and B) she hasn't even been interviewed by police yet......... Why does she seem so unstable? How did a news outlet reach this woman before authorities? Yes, THAT is the media collusion that you apparently don't believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I'm not yet convinced of ANY argument on this subject, but I have a biiiiiiiiig distrust of any media sources and I also know that most "events" like these turn out to be total bullshit. So, where is your undeniable proof? I don't see any links in your comment above.

       A) The protest was full of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and KKK members. Plenty of folks were there to push their own agendas, but this was hardly hijacked to make people look bad, this was just people looking bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) You're using a 4chan post to discredit news reports. If you can't see the irony there, I really don't know what to say. And there are plenty of reasons that you don't see a front license plate; one reason is that it could have been ripped off with the front bumper when he rammed his car into a crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       C) The guy in the mugshot and the guy in the car are the same guy. Different camera lenses will have different depth perceptions, making one person look skinny while the same person looks wide in a different camera. The military photo is clearly not the guy in the car; look at the proportions of the width of his eyes to the tip of his nose. It's so obviously not the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Yes, crisis actors are a real thing, that doesn't mean everyone on TV is a crisis actor. Why does she seem so unstable? Her fucking son just rammed a car into a crowd of people and killed someone. How did the press get there first? The press are more mobile and have more money than the police, and probably paid her money for an interview, which is not uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between being skeptical and being paranoid. If you're honestly saying the twin towers didn't fall, or that the pulse nightclub shooting was a false flag, then I really can't even take you seriously.

       Where is the huge threatening white supremacy movement?  As a black dude who spent a long time looking for it, I can't find it.  Even Richard Spencer, one of the most hated white nationalists, talks about co-existing.  But you go on with your views if that makes you happy.  The only rampant violent racism in America is from black people.  The only real crime problem in America comes from brothers.  Sounds racist, but look at black on black murders, number of public race related attacks, and even the fact that Richard Spencer is actually more law abiding than leader of BLM. But keep playing the victim, Vicki, and let's see how that works out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care who someone voted for when they kill someone.  I do care how they were allowed to do it. And if they were allowed to do it because of piss poor policies, like say open borders, I think we can do better. So yeah, when a Muslim runs down someone, we immediately trace it to the immigration policy that let them in.  If it doesn't trace to the immigration policy, we trace it to the ideology of Shariah Law--which is a good reason to not want open borders (also immigration gumballs on YouTube is good reason).
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, Trump didn't say exactly what you wanted?  so that means he is totally cool with people running down innocents? Jesus that is a level of retardation that makes my retarded child say "wow that's REALLY retarded!" I guess CNN deserves congrats for that?

       I 100% agree with this comment. Thank you for chiming in and affirming my own thoughts on this.

       I see a lot of users who are coming to r/conspiracy because they want to "be in the know." Or because they want to refute what
       <em>
        they already know we are going to say.
       </em>
       A typical person who regularly comes here isn't going to immediately accept the MSM/CNN/etc story of what happened and then sympathize with one side of the story. That is exactly what they want you to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       BLM/Antifa and the "white supremacists"/"Nazis"/people who want to preserve the history of their state and forefathers are two sides of the same coin in this version of history. Anyone who is pushing this story and attempting to control the narrative simply wants you to choose a side and fight for it wholeheartedly. Any person who is supporting either side has already played into their hand.

       I watched early footage of the rally and counter-protests and some skirmishes that looked like Berkeley-lite. Seemed like everyone was dispersing. Turn it on half hour later and it's turning into swirls of people and punches and mace and the like, gradual escalation, but still doesn't seem too crazy considering.
      </p>

       I go and do my Saturday shit and turn it on again and I'm looking at a fucking murder scene that was intended to be a mass murder, people who've been blindly struck and dragged around and it's horrific and I feel like I'm looking at Nice in broad daylight, in America. And the guy's on the loose. Eventually he gets nabbed, and he's fucking 20 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a depressing, devastating day for the people of this country. We all need to take some deep breaths and figure this shit out, because this will happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all occurs after what came off as dystopian film footage at the U of Virginia. I'm truly at a loss. And I think "Trump supporters" are just as sickened and horrified by this as I am.

       A liberal shot up a baseball field of GOP Congressmen.  No cries of terrorism and the narrative was he was a lone wolf not representative of the left at all, even though he was a typical Bernie bro.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to today.  TERRORISM IN VA!  Shout all the headlines, from CNN to FOX to Drudge.  Politicians speaking out.  Reddit flooded with "Trump supporters are Nazis!" posts.  Twitter blowing up about the evils of white nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody even knew the guys name or his motivation, yet it's definitely terrorism and it's definitely indicative of every single Trump supporting Nazi.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narrative spinning is just pathetic at this point.  MSM refuses to call muslim attacks terrorism, refuses to call BLM shootings terrorism, refuses to call antifa attacks terrorism, refuses to call a Bernie Bro who shot at GOP Congressmen with intent to kill them solely for their political affiliation terrorism.  Nothing the left does or supports is ever called terrorism.

       You're the only pushing a narrative.  A lawful assembly was interrupted--once again--by Antifa led violence.  That violence ended in defensive measures being taken by an unfortunate driver-by to flea from attackers (mostly black, go figure) swinging bats and threatening violence.

       Yeah no sorry. we have eyes and can see the multiple videos. The guy drove straight into a crowd without breaking, and reversed like two blocks. it destroys the whole he was scared of antifa narrative. I don't know how to link in mobile to video.

       A crowd that was attacking him with baseball bats and attempting to box him in.  He was well within his rights.  While you're pretending to use your eyes, how about you take a peek over at the sidewalk next time.

       Please point to that on video. I see a car on a fiarly empty street, no bats or any one attacking him, drive directly into a crowd of people. After he injures and kills some one his car is then hit( i would do the sane after some asshole tried to take my life) then he reversed like two blocks. He obviosly did it intentionally if you have eyes.

       Yes. At this event in particular. I am referring to a more general use of the phrase Nazi though. Which has been way over-used in the past few months, year.

       I've been popping off longer than that. I care very much that fascists are killing my fellow citizens, and I'm disgusted to the core that the traitor in Chief is too pussy to condemn the attacks of white nationalists. He knows he'll lose his base if he does.

       Shouldn't you be spreading misinformation about how this was a Soros false flag to deflect from your Nazi brethren?
