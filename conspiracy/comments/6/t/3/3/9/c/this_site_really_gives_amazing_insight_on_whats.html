        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-08-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LightBringerFlex.html">LightBringerFlex</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I ran into this site from a post the other day and read some of the articles about the cabal and the insight seems deep. The reporter/writer essentially claims to have access to elite white hats in various white hat blood lines that give him the inside scoop of what&#39;s going on and that the black hats have done all they can to shut him down and failed. (IE make it impossible to take donations, drop bloody tampons and a severed teddy bear head on his front porch, ect.). </p>

<p>So, what he is saying, more or less is this (if I understand this correctly): There is something called the gnostic Illuminati which consists of white hat bloodlines that have been fighting the black hats for a very long time now (thousands of years). This group was responsible for getting Trump into office since the black hats wanted Hillary in there. The site claims Hillary is Rockafellars daughter and Bill Clinton is his nephew (I have personally heard rumors that they were cousins). They also claim that Rockafellar was at the top of the black hat elite with George Bush Senior as a close second in command although Bush Senior out-shined Rockafellar when he orchestrated 9-11. These 2 formed many enemies due to their evil agendas. Rockafellar finally died. Bush Senior is at least partially senile so he is dysfunctional. This has left a power vacuum in the #1 and #2 spot but nobody has really filled it yet. The Vatacan, some European bloodlines, and others have been trying to take the spot but there is so much chaos happening at the moment that there&#39;s simply no time to make these decisions. </p>

<p>The white hat elite were the ones that got Trump into office. America, like most other countries, is now divided between white hat and black hat rulers. Trump taking the top position as a white hat ruler really gave the white hats a leg up on the competition. Also, all the ass kissing Trump has been doing with Israel, the Saudis, and the bankers has been nothing but theatrics. Trump also has 11 different agencies with incredible technology keeping him alive while the secret service is the least effective of these agencies. </p>

<p>The war happening now is not between countries but between white hats and black hats of these countries. Trump ended ISIS thanks to Russian intervention and the fact that Trump no longer funds them so they are pretty much through. They were nothing but mercenaries all along. Now that ISIS has ended, the Syrian, Iranian, and Russian troops on Syria&#39;s border with Israel which has put the fear of God in both Israel and the Saudis who are mostly ruled by the black hat elites within. Netanyahu is also currently under fire legally for some sort of fraud which he blames the political left for. </p>

<p>Now that all this is in place, there is a bit of a Mexican standoff between 2 teams which are Trump/Putin/Assad/Iran VS Saudi, Europe, Israel, North Korea. NK and Israel are somehow very good friends and it seems the black hats are using NK to their advantage. Japan is on the brink of being overrun by white hats so they are almost going to be on our side. All countries have white hats in them that want to be on the right side. Its only a matter of getting rid of the black hats. The goal is to somehow hit North Korea military because by doing so, the black hats within will scatter like cockroaches and once they scatter, they will expose themselves so that they can be sniped or pickup up. </p>

<p>The site goes onto say that people like Lynch have been cooperating with Trump and giving up a lot of intel. There were rumors on POL that Hillary was arrested last month and given 2 options: Death or permanent house arrest if she gives good intel. </p>

<p>Finally, there were mentions of the US being on the brink of bankruptcy and that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy and that something about September 30 being an important day to pay the bills or something. If the US is unable to pay the bills, hostilities can erupt and if it claims bankruptcy, then all the bases around the world have to shut down and come home. </p>

<p>There was also a mention that some religion is the real ruling class of Russia and they are black hats but Putin and Trump are white hats secretly working together. </p>

<p>Basically, the way this site makes it sound is that the hit on NK is a good thing and this kind of makes sense because the black hats in the US are against the war with NK although it would be profitable for the weapons companies that work with them. Also, some mention of Trump selling weapons to SA to help cover the emergency bills while things are sorted out. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is all true but its an interesting take on things and it could be true. I think we will find out this year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just substitute black / white hats for globalists-progressives / nationalists-traditionalists ideologies and apply Hanlon Razer. </p>

<p>I believe a problem we have here is that for <em>us</em>, we cannot accept the level of stupidity of those in power, as such we default to blaming some rational entity (Annunaki, Illuminati, Reptilians, God) acting maliciously. </p>

<p>This can be seen in every ancient religion I. Stupidity reigns supreme, but we need to bring sense to the chaos / unknown, and the only way we can achieve such is by defining the unknown, embodying it into something human-like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does.  The retardation level is over 9000.  The way it manifests is via this simplistic &quot;good vs. evil&quot; narrative.  And that leads to all these pretend &quot;wars&quot;.  There&#39;s more to it, of course.  There are separations of powers to consider.  But, at its base, it is a human disease of anthropomorhpizing organizations of individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time will tell. I think that exposing the elite pedophilia used as government extortion and ritualistic luciferian child abuse will be the kicker. When that gets public, bye bye Hollywood, bye bye old media, bye bye 50%+ of the federal, state, and local governments and corporations tied to them. And not just in the US, but all over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because all the insiders that are currently in communication with us are all saying the same thing about Trump. All these different sources happen to have the same exact story. </p>

<p>Sure, it can be an elaborate setup but then I noticed Susan Rice (and others) attacking Trump for going after North Korea. Now, why would war mongerors attack Trump for going after North Korea when weapons companies and their associates profit from war unless there was something harmful to the deep state? The article says hitting NK will expose certain key black hats for easy pickings. </p>

<p>It sounds legit. People I trust are saying the same thing basically. It helps explain Trumps erratic behavior. </p>

<p>Idk, it&#39;s lining up pretty good. All these sources are essentially predicting that a lot will happen between now and November (possible disclosure, possible banker takedowns, cabal arrests, etc..). I hope so. I really, really hope so but time will tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, sorry. Most of this isn&#39;t true. Trump WAS a good guy. I believe he really thought he could change things. But after that internet history selling bill he signed, after blaming assad for gassing his own people, and specifically selling the Saudi&#39;s arms I believe he&#39;s been taken over by the deep state. Trump has NO power at all, he&#39;s a puppet now. Like expected. </p>
