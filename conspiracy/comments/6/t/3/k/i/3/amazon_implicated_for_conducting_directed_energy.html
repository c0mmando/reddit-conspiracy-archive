<blockquote>
<p>Security Industry Specialist Tells All. I worked as a Security Specialist For Security Industry Specialists in Seattle, Washington. We had a contract with Amazon and the US government to test Total Individual Control Technology on our own employees. These employees were tortured and experimented on in Amazon owned buildings on the Amazon Campus located in Seattle Washington.</p>

<p>I am making this information available to the public under the protection of whistleblower laws that protect individuals who have knowledge of crimes committed by government contractors.</p>

<p>I am also starting a podcast to expose these crimes and raising money to start an awareness campaign designed to bring criminal charges against those responsible for these crimes. We are also hoping that these efforts will lead to a national campaign against electronic harassment, voice to skull, and gangstalking.</p>

<p>Please support us in our efforts to end these crimes against the American people by donating to our organization: “Stop Social Engineering.” Thank You</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m a security industry specialist who worked for a private security company in Seattle, Washington. I am no longer employed by this company. I chose to leave because I can no longer in good conscience work for a corrupt company that is involved in a highly illegal federal program that is blatantly violating the constitutional rights of American citizens on a daily basis. My company had a contract with one of the largest most powerful corporations in America that is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. During my time as a security specialist I became aware of a massive social engineering program taking place in America today…”</p>

<p>“This social engineering program involves the federal government of the Unites States of America, the intelligence agencies of the Unites States of America, private security contractors, some of the largest corporations in America, local and state police, and social programs within the inner cities of America. This social engineering program experiments on the homeless, and experiments on the financially struggling, and experiments on individuals that do not have a lot of family and friends or money so that they have no means to defend themselves from this parasitic disgusting program. This program utilizes a technology that most know as voice to skull technology, it is a electromagnetic frequency machine, an electromagnetic frequency technology that utilizes radio frequency signals microwave auditory effect to induce sound within the cranial cavity of the target.”</p>

<p>“This technology is also used to manipulate the emotions of the individual.”</p>

<p>“This technology manipulates the electrical signals in the brain, thus controlling thoughts and feelings and emotions and sensations throughout the body. It works by rewiring the brain by creating new neural pathways and destroying existing neural pathways, thus this literally changes the way a person thinks and thus behaves.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also be used to control the muscle movement of the target. It can take over one’s hands or feet while driving and make you press on the accelerator or press on the brake or turn. This can be used to cause accidents it can also be used to prevent accidents from happening.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also tap into the optical nerve of the target, and the auditory system of the target, so that those monitoring the target can see what the target is seeing and hear what target is hearing. This information is then downloaded and stored on a computer, in a highly secure classified site on servers that are guarded by some of the tightest security in the world. This results in the individual&#39;s entire day, everything they see, everything they hear, everything they experiment, everything they experience, and everything they feel being recorded till the end of time.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also be used to manipulate the emotions of the target. It can induce fear, love, hate.”</p>

<p>“This technology can be used to beam images and even motion pictures into one’s brain. Images and motion pictures that are so realistic that you think you are actually watching a movie or seeing something in reality. It’s like a virtual reality 3D rendering that takes place within the target’s mind. The images and motion pictures manifest themselves in such a way that the target if they are not aware that this technology is being used on them will believe that they are natural thoughts and natural images.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also be used to induce and control dreams. It can be used to control dream cycles and sleep patterns. To cause one to sleep very deeply or to cause one to not sleep at all. REM cycles, alpha beta and delta brainwaves can be induced immediately by this technology. And this technology can also be used to mimic spiritual experiences. Joy, love, peace that passes understanding can all be induced artificially by this technology to make the target believe that they are having a genuine spiritual experience when they’re not.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also be used to sexually manipulate the target. Make them feel sexual arousal or turn off their sexuality altogether, it can stimulate them and it can shut them down at a moments notice. It can also be used to manipulate the hormones of the target, thus lowering and raising estrogen and testosterone levels in women and men respectively.”</p>

<p>“This technology can also be used to read the thoughts of the target in real time.”</p>

<p>“… they can read your thoughts verbatim as they occur within your own mind.”</p>

<p>“One of the reasons I’m speaking out is because this technology, as horrible as it is, can also be used for truly miraculous purposes. It can be used to help humanity instead of harming humanity, it can be used to save people instead of destroying them. It can be used to literally make the blind see, the deaf hear, and the lame get up and walk. It can be used to solve many of the problems facing our country and the world today.”</p>

<p>“It can also be used to cure diseases, by healing cells manipulating genes and indeed manipulating the DNA of the target in real time. I’ve seen this technology used to repair ACL strains, MCL strains, sprained knees in a period of hours, as if someone laid hands on the individual and healed them instantly.”</p>

<p>“As an educated man and a man who has spent my life serving others in the security industry, and before that pursuing an education that was geared towards helping people I am extremely frustrated that this technology has fallen into the hands of people that are using it in the manner that they currently are. These people are juvenile and sophomoric in attitude, they’re irresponsible in disposition, and they are completely out of control in terms of the way that they are using it against the American people.”</p>

<p>“As a security specialist I saw them use this technology to experiment on their own workers. My fellow security specialists were experimented on in the workplace and outside of the workplace.”</p>

<p>“… they’re also monitored 24/7 by a system of surveillance that many on the internet would probably recognize as gangstalking. These are security specialists employed by private security companies, they’re also highly trained intelligence agents. These personnel are used to monitor the test subject 24 hours a day, both inside and outside of the workplace…”</p>

<p>“They’re evil in a way that I cannot understand, and I do not want to understand.”</p>

<p>&quot;As many of the test subjects … have already learned, one of the key means of covering up this program is to use the psychological profession to do so. Those who speak out about this issue are funneled to psychiatrist for evaluation. The psychiatrists are working with those who are running this program, many cases they are directly paid by them to render a diagnosis of schizophrenic, multiple personality disorder, delusional, paranoid, depressed upon the test subjects, the targets, so that they will be discredited. So that if they talk out any further, or they ever start making any progress against this program, they are inherently discredited because those who run this program will simply release the psychological files and claim that the person is mentally ill. </p>

<p>This is a perfect way to cover up such a technology whose main feature and most popular feature, most well known feature, is voice to skull. Which induces sound within the cranial cavity of the test subject, of the target themselves, so that when that person goes to speak out about it,… obviously if members of the general public are not aware of the existence of this technology, which many of them are not, most of them are not, they will interpret that as concerning,… and they will conclude that this person must be crazy. And as a result they will recommend psychological evaluation for that person.&quot;</p>

<p>“As good people, helpless people, that are being abused and tortured and enslaved and experimented upon in America today, American citizens cry out for help from their fellow Americans, and their fellow Americans say ‘why don’t you take some prozac, because we think you’re schizophrenic’ when this is a highly technical program, all of the symptoms are induced by a technology that is so fucking sophisticated it is horrifying beyond description.”</p>

<p>“… these people will actually intercept your sample. And they do this by contracting with labs… [labs who] provide lab services for employers who are doing massive amounts of drug tests and blood tests, and also the involvement of sperm banks was mentioned in some of the information I saw working for my company. These are perfect ways to acquire an individual’s DNA, build a DNA profile on them. And then this information, the DNA of the individual is used to determine the resonant frequency of the DNA itself, the resonant frequency is then used to fine tune the technology…to tune it perfectly to the resonant frequency of the targeted individual’s DNA.”</p>

<p>“It is out of control, and it is only getting worse.”</p>

<p>“I know for a fact, having been an insider and actually been a part of this program, and seen it operate on a day to day basis I am aware that there are now entire cities in America that are nothing more than a massive social engineering experiment. Because instead of using this, you know as most people think just against the individual the targeted individual, there are applications of this technology I am now aware of that utilize it against entire populations. Anywhere from small groups of people 10-20 to 100, to medium size groups of people several thousand to tens of thousands. </p>

<p>This is done by creating a field effect, where an entire field of electromagnetic energy is created in a geographical location and any human being within that geographical location within that electromagnetic field affecting that geographical location will be effected by the technology. This can be used to induce a general mood in a population or a crowd of people. It can be used to make them passive, it can be used to make them agitated. And this can be used to cause or stop, induce riots. Stop crime, start crime. Stop thoughts, start thoughts. Massive mind control on a citywide level.”</p>

<p>“In addition to the technology, that is commonly referred to as voice to skull, there is also another element a human element to this program that is commonly known as gangstalking. This program involves personnel of the federal government: America’s armed forces the military, the intelligence agencies of America, military intelligence, private security contractors, private corporations, local and state police, and social programs in cities all over America. The personnel in these agencies and companies are contracted and paid very well to follow, and monitor, and surveil American citizens. This is the phenomenon that is now being talked about online as gangstalking. This gangstalking aspect of this program is now becoming an open secret, as the companies that are involved with it do not fear detection.”</p>

<p>“When I lived in Seattle, Washington there was a competing security company that was running an ad online for employment saying ‘help wanted’, the position that was available was a security specialist. The requirements for the position were a cell phone that works with good reception, they must be on call 24 hours a day and they must be ready to respond at a moments notice. The ad detailed that both static and mobile positions were available. Being a security specialist myself I recognized this ad immediately as one that was hiring gangstalkers. My company was involved in the exact same activity and I was aware of other private security companies that were hiring gangstalkers as well.”</p>

<p>“Targeted individuals everywhere are being terrorized by voice to skull technology and the associated gangstalking program, that is used to isolate the individual from family / friends, interfere with their ability to work, and in short destroy their lives. This leaves the individual hopeless and destitute, depressed and many of them struggle to find a reason to keep on living.”</p>

<p>“This is a booming industry. It’s one of the most fasting growing industries in America today, the private security industry. And it has gone almost completely unnoticed and under the radar to the average American. Even on the internet, in the realm of alternative research and conspiracy theories private security companies are very rarely mentioned. And yet they in my opinion play maybe the most prominent role. Especially in the gangstalking aspect of the social engineering program that I described but also in the implementation, the experimentation, and the fine tuning of the technology that most know as voice to skull. These private security companies have basically done nothing but hire ex-military and ex-intelligence agents and operatives from the armed forces of the United States of America and put them to work here at home.”</p>

<p>“In fact many of these private security companies on their website will advertise that they are a veteran friendly employer. This is code within the industry to let them know that ex-military and ex-intelligence agents are needed within the private security company for carrying out the exact type of operations that I’m detailing in this podcast.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds good...</p>

<p>I&#39;m having trouble finding it, but the Laughing Horse Headquarters consisted of a bizarre looking site where a variety of data dumps were hidden behind MK Ultra themed visuals.</p>

<p>I traced back a lot of the info to leaks that were already known. SOme of them housed at cryptome, some of them on weird dox sites... like every single CNN employee... and one that was really weird... a set of coordinates.</p>

<p>I&#39;m having a hell of a time finding the set of coordinates, at the moment, but, when people started finding information relevant to pizzagate on the Laughing Horse site, a massive movement started to discredit the information.</p>

<p>It worked, I guess, except that a lot of the information was already confirmed from other sources.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/">http://www.lhohq.info/</a></p>

<p>It is quite a rabbit hole, but the sourcing is impecable.</p>

<p>For example...</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/1558363">https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/1558363</a></p>

<p>Links to a document that came from lhohq that is incontrovertible evidence of CIA drug running.</p>

<p>It is an interesting piece of evidence because it is enough for any reasonable population to dismantle the CIA. But we don&#39;t. Why? It&#39;s an important question.</p>

<p>Either way... I have something in my notes that will make a good post for that sub, with actual evidence. When I get a moment, I&#39;ll make one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the idea im getting as well. It&#39;s laid out in such detail that it almost makes me think it&#39;s dis-info by the government to try to get us to ignore spiritual awakening signs. Seeing how much attention they put towards the dreams, and spiritual experiences makes me think they are trying to turn people away from awakening.</p>

<p>Funny times we live in. The cabal tried so hard to rule over us and keep us under control and in the dark that they inadvertently caused a mass awakening of humanity.  </p>

I&#39;m trying to be VERY careful not to allow myself to dismiss any direct energy/gangstalking claims out of hand (I have no doubt they&#39;ve both been used, in some time and some place) but we already know disinformation comes out of the woodwork in the spiritual community...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey this may sound crazy what I&#39;m about to say. Everything is energy. Energy can&#39;t be destroyed. It can only be moved. So when we focus our &quot;energy&quot; on things, that becomes real for us. While I do believe  the dark aspects of government have the means for gangstalking and electromagnetic targeted weapons, I think it is far from the impact we are imagining.</p>

<p>There is also the universal law of free will. If someone knowingly is hurting someone else, that violates the law of free will and will result in karmic energy to balance out that effect of &quot;negativity&quot; because that&#39;s how energy/consciousness works.</p>

<p>So I kind of think that many people are getting sucked into this gangstalking targeted electronics frequency of thinking and thus every little thing can be tied to that because that&#39;s what they are focusing their energy on. Suddenly everyone that looks at you makes you paranoid because you&#39;re allowing your focus, your energy, your consciousness, to choose that experience.</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense. Like I said, I do believe the cabal has the means to do it but I think they also rely on the power of our own creative abilities to trap ourselves in our own trap without them even needing to do anything.</p>

<p>It sounds like an easy cover for dis info. Make people think their spiritual awakening is the result of directed energy weapons and then you get a negative spiritual awakening and a more fearful opening to the truth.</p>

<p>It makes sense but all we can do is conjecture until there&#39;s &quot;proof&quot; but this makes total sense</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed! The idea of the cabal as some kind of omnipotent, all knowing, unstoppable power with all manner of superweapons that theyre using daily is pure bullshit fear mongering. If they had half the capabilities that the internet-at-large would have us believe, then there&#39;s no reason we wouldn&#39;t all be living in kennels by now.</p>

<p>I had a spiritual awakening experience of my own back in March so I&#39;ve been sifting through a lot of garbage since then trying to, ya know, Know. One thing I&#39;ve learned since then is that - absolutely - most of <strong>the troubles</strong> come from people willfully engaging in the game. They/we largely got tricked and manipulated into it (people seem love getting tricked, as long as they don&#39;t realize it), but it&#39;s a willing engagement either way...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a person who is a victim and survivor of gangstalking, I have to say, I need to tell you, b/c I sense you mean well, these devices have been around and improved upon since the 80&#39;s and have been disclosed and investigated upon in the 90&#39;s -- </p>

<p>you just have to do a bit of digging. 
You will find, what this comment post does not mention, is that another, deadly device exists, and this one is simply an electroshock device and it can be dialed from a mere fritzing (feels like an animal shock-fence) all the way to a heart attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welp, I can&#39;t add anything in the way of evidence, but I&#39;m involved with next-generation VR technology and although some of his terminology is pretty lame, just about everything he said is technologically possible and I&#39;ve had personal demonstrations of most of these effects.</p>

<p>Short version: walls aren&#39;t an issue for environment/positional mapping with microwaves, and once you have high-precision motion tracking of a subject you really can do some crazy advanced stuff on the brain at long range. It certainly is possible to interpret the visual cortex of a subject (look up those japanese &quot;dream machine&quot; videos from like <strong>10 years ago</strong> for a super primitive version of the tech via fMRI) at range, and even to map computer-generated graphics over the subject&#39;s vision and re-project them into the brain. This applies to the other senses as well, including subvocalisation and tactile/kinesthetic sensation. Even proprioception. I&#39;ve even experienced a virtual orgasm.</p>

<p>Bullshit about &quot;energy fields&quot; kind of undermine&#39;s the guy&#39;s language, although that isn&#39;t technically wrong, it makes it sounds like some obscure occult technology. Really it&#39;s just advanced wifi. The real magic is in the machine learning that makes it possible. If you&#39;ve seen output from the google dream AI, you&#39;ve seen a silly crippled version (loaded up with dogs and pagodas for comedy value) of a machine that can hallucinate the way the brain does to and from a standard digital representation of sensory input.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t have any evidence to provide, but if you happen to know any engineers at Magic Leap or Disney, or know someone who&#39;s had the super secret Valve tour, try asking them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For credibility, you need to be specific. Identify the scientist. Quote the statement. Could you transcribe what Robert Duncan said? </p>

<p>There is no survey analysis of symptoms of TIs. There are no written testimonies. TIs have not submitted medical records. Robert Duncan cannot possibly having any source that forced behavior is common in TIs.</p>

<p>Robert Duncan was the first to write about forced behavior. His text was very brief and didn&#39;t cite evidence. TIs read Robert Duncan books and include forced behavior as a symptom. Other TIs read TI blogs, don&#39;t know where the symptoms originated from and parrot the TIs. No TI has written a testimony on forced behavior or forced speech.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t blindly believe whatever TIs parrot. If EMF can induce forced behavior or forced speech, TIs need to take meter measurements and submit a meter report. They need to submit their biomarker lab tests for Tourette to rule out Tourette.</p>

<p>Worldwide there are probably hundreds of thousands are &quot;targeted individuals.&quot;</p>

<p>Targeted individuals are subject to the Full Stasi Zersetzung - it appears that worldwide, governments are decomposing, taking down, ruining people&#39;s lives via 24x7 harassment, spying, ghosting, vandalism, lies, slander and other inivisible social destruction methods.</p>

<p>Whistleblowers -- Robert Duncan, Barrie Trower, John Hall -- say this is government run gang stalking/cause stalking/organized stalking as part of an isolation program aimed at non-consensual human experiment subjects.</p>

<p>Secret services have always gone after the easiest targets, the powerless, those who can&#39;t fight back. </p>

<p>These victims are WEAPONS TESTING experimental subjects.</p>

<p>The gang stalking marginalizes them. It isolates them. It ruins their financial, emotional, social and family lives. </p>

<p>Support systems being ruined, the victims find it that much harder to fight back.</p>

<p>They get actually paranoid in addition to being made to look paranoid.</p>

<p>The weapons produce radiation which heats the victims&#39; bodies. The weapons track, instill thoughts, read thoughts, produce voices only the victims can hear, all while LITERALLY COOKING THE VICTIMS WITH MICROWAVES.</p>

<p>The planet is in full Stasi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep seems to be possible. They also seem to be able to get an accurate image of the world around a target. Some examples of how they use this technology: While scanning a room a target might lock on to several keywords, items and/or colors that they have been conditioned to associate with feelings or ideologies. Then these items are put up against whatever the target is thinking about as a means to attempt hypnosis or further conditioning. Another example I might bring something to my car on accident, put in a specific place. Later on, I might find some kind of messed up use for whatever it was I brought to the car. They definitely do this to mess with the individual. It&#39;s done intelligently so you can see that something (ai, more likely than someone but who knows) else knew you would need that item in the car ahead of time. That is key, the fact they knew what you would do/need ahead of time along with the frequency at which this occurs over time. They definitely love this sort of shock torture technique to continually reassert that they have complete control over the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can confirm that this indeed still occurring from the viewpoint of a victim. </p>

<p>It is strange, because everything you describe hear has happened to me in the last year and then some. I have not found that anywhere else and I have researched quite a bit. </p>

<p>My background is software. I was an iOS developer professionally for almost 5 years. 
My last job in the industry I worked for about a year with Amazon Web Services, nodejs, etc at a startup. </p>

<p>My startup went under and I lost employment. I am still relatively new to the cloud so it was difficult to find new employment in that realm.</p>

<p>After about a month on the market strange things began to happen. My iPhone was visibly hacked in front of me. Uber drivers started to behave strangely. I suddenly got a strong urge to go on walks. A lot of them. My neighbors upstairs and on either side of the apartment began tapping on the walls and constantly clicking a clicker. My Amazon orders began to become irregular or not ship and I would have to follow up. Certain family members began to respond in strange ways they had not before.</p>

<p>This was the first phase before most of the stuff mentioned here above began to occur. I believe the intent of this phase was to shock me and put me in a state of disbelief for the next phase.</p>

<p>Then the completely unbelievable began to happen. While on walks I would see signs that either referenced or were word for word things I had been thinking about. The gangstalking began and I was sensitized to various colors. I began to attend AA meetings (despite not being an alcoholic) at the suggestion of a family member. In these meetings I was conditioned and hypnotized (although at the time I had no idea what was going on). These meetings were the beginning of the 
 what I call the &quot;thought synchronization&quot; phenoma because I have no idea how this works technically. The experience is that you are thinking of something (or not) and then someone who is speaking says something that either:
- Exactly references what you are thinking (rare, but enough to confirm)
- Begins and ends at the same time of your next train of thought (extremely common)
- Uses keywords (probably inadvertently) that you have been conditioned to associate with certain things that mess with your train of thought (extremely common)</p>

<p>This is always done in a way where it is logical to assume that someone, somewhere, definitely has a real time flow of your thoughts.</p>

<p>The premonitions also began here as I briefly mention above. These are one of the worst aspects of this whole nightmare and sadly one of the favorite methods of torture. It started slowly. I might wake up in bed one day and think of something and then that exact thing would happen latter that day. 
It has evolved into a 24/7 thing. I might think of a topic and I log onto facebook right away and some has posted about it. On break at work I think of something and it occurs when I get back. This seems to be done as means to reassert/reenforce complete control over you.</p>

<p>Next, they laid an entire framework out.. As a form of economic control (I wouldnt find this out until later) they led me to believe that somehow I had untreated scabies (I had scabies several years ago that was treated) and that I was a threat to the community to go out in public. Of course this was bs, and I carried on, but they would send people at me (again, the people probably didnt know) a lot of the time in red shirts who would either touch a door handle in front of me or bump into me or a personal favorite of theirs, accidentally kick my leg while I was at a club or bar. (This stuff never happened to me with this sort of insane frequency, before. Not even close.)  They also liked to use people who had visibly crusted skin. (This is a favorite of theirs because if these people had scabies it would be the crusted kind which would almost guarantee transmission). These people would usually scratch themselves near me, and I was made to believe the mites had gone airborne somehow. As a result, I got treated, and then again and again, with amazon product naturally (this would reveal itself to only be economical and a method of poisoning in nature). At this point it was upsetting to carry on as usual but I did. The next phase was the &quot;physically challenged phase&quot;. (People who are immunocompromised, e.g. down syndrome, hiv, are also likely to carry a large mite load). I have never in my life seen so many people with physical disabilities. Again they would bump into me or be so near to me so I thought they would which would alter my plans of where I would go eat, etc.. Then they brought out the HIV brigade.. Or at least made me think that. I would over here someone say they got out of prison, I would hear prostitution/solicitation while in a hotel for a job interview. I would see people that looked like maybe they could potentially be a carrier often. Again the frequency here is key.</p>

<p>Finally things got physical. I was assaulted by a bouncer outside a bar without cause. I called the police who said &quot;the video showed nothing&quot;. That was not accurate. I began to have involuntary movements. This might be the worst part as they still occur. Now, while out in public or various places I inadvertently bump into things I never would have, to make me believe I may have contracted something. Even simple tasks like putting on shoes I mights scratch the floor with my hand, etc.. On public staircases, I might scrape my ankle several times along the back of them. I pick up objects at work that other people have touched more often. Stuff like that. It is always done with cause I find, not random. That is also key. My posture is messed with or I am made to make postures that I have been conditioned to associate with certain things. This is constant.
Finally, the deep dark things came in. Whoever is responsible, nothing is off limits. Topics that flowed into my mind are things I never have given the time of day and I resist them constantly. Racism, Eugenics are there most favorite. They led me to believe that being around the disabled was &quot;bad for my genetic makeup&quot; and that because of this I was &quot;bad for others genetic makeup&quot;. You can find data on the transference of certain genetic components (although, nothing as urgent as they would have you believe) so this would fuel the fire. 
The racist metaphors. They would have me believe certain things were associated with certain races 100%. Pretty cliche I wont get into it but they really like to. Pop culture references. I saw the movie &quot;it&quot;. This is a theme that is still used on me. They love to send images of pennywise right before something bad happens like an involuntary movement.</p>

<p>Finally, now I have a better understanding of what all of this is. It was designed to prevent me from continuing my work in software. It seems to be designed specifically for work at a warehouse (my current position). These tactics are now either used to increase or decrease my productivity on demand. If there is a shipment for lets say, Amazon, or UPS, then I am filled with pleasant thoughts and everything goes great. If the shipment is for a small company, or other circumstances I will get hit with a rf wave feeling (burning heat) a racism agenda, an involuntary movement to touch something that throws me off, a sudden pain somewhere and/or a fear of &quot;bugs&quot; (their favorite, I think because of the software metaphor who knows) or infection. This might cause a processing error that causes me to redo the shipment or perhaps use an extra package. Maybe I will have to track someone or something down that wastes a bunch of time. Amazon is a constant recurring theme in the shipping for good and bad. Essentially whatever this is is telling me that Amazon and others are employing this technology to control/corner the e-commerce and logistics market or are planning/testing to or already have. (btw I have history with amazon as I used aws and I had an interview with them for software development and a flight to Seattle scheduled which was canceled right around the time this started to happen.)
I will also touch on is the hypnosis. I can&#39;t explain it well, but it is certainly a technique that is attempted on me. I just laugh it off but it is annoying. 
The last thing I will touch on is the iPhone/Macbook. When they are on, the symptoms are strong. When they are off, the symptoms are not.</p>

<p>There is a whole lot more but this is already a bit winded. 
Thanks for the post, I can indeed verify this is happening.</p>
