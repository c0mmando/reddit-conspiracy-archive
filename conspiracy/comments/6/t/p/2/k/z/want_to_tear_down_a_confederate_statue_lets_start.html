        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Albert Pike was an attorney, soldier, writer, and Freemason. Albert Pike is the only Confederate military officer with an outdoor statue in Washington.
Pike died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 81, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery. Burial was against his wishes; he had left instructions for his body to be cremated. In 1944, his remains were moved to the House of the Temple, headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite. A memorial to Pike is located in the Judiciary Square neighborhood of Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>This is so accurate. I think part of it is everyone has to be right all the time, because that&#39;s how school teaches you to act. In school there is no &quot;agree to disagree&quot; hardly ever. So people don&#39;t value it, and they bring that attitude in to work and the rest of their life. Always put on the defensive, they get a big ego they need to defend by always appearing correct and certain </p>

<p>Much, much deeper. It was an active infiltration of Freemasonry to make it appear that this was an &quot;approved&quot; revolution. That&#39;s why the Revolutionary War was a slow-moving joke that the Americans won.</p>

<p>That was the purpose of the Bavarian Illuminati. Infiltrate masonry, make it seem like the American Revolution was part of a big masonic plot, then pull the rug out on the oligarchs when they won the war.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Mostly the <a href="http://eurofolkradio.com/2017/05/19/rothschilds-judah-benjamin-knights-golden-circle/">Confederacy</a> was a masonic plot, although they infiltrated the North heavily as well.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been a back-and-forth since the founding. Jefferson was pretty bad, Monroe and Quincy Adams pretty good, Andrew Jackson bad, Lincoln good, Garfield and McKinley pretty good, Teddy Roosevelt was manipulated by the British, Woodrow Wilson was outright in the bag (Federal Reserve), FDR was mixed but better as time went on, JFK absolutely one of the good guys, and everyone since powerless to stop them (Carter), or in on the scam (Bushes, Clinton, Obama)</p>

<p>The bad guys have had control over the government since they shot Kennedy, but that&#39;s about to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to live by the Lenin statue when it was installed. There is nothing nefarious going on there. It&#39;s a cultural oddity that was brought here after it was going to be scraped after the end of Cold War 1.0. Some dude paid for it to be brought here for pennies on the dollar and had it reconstructed. I don&#39;t know if he gave it to the city or what but it is still there just hanging out next fun antique shops, bookstores and other little food places. </p>

<p>I remember them coming up with all sorts of odd uses for it in a write-in contest like putting an ATM in Lenin&#39;s ass. It&#39;s really kind of just a fun little thing to look at in the Fremont neighborhood which is already known for have a quirky and fun sense of humor. It&#39;ll probably still be there in 50 years. </p>

<p>Really guys and gals, there is nothing to see here. </p>

<p>It&#39;s actually not. Go there and see. It&#39;s about a half block away (and I think the Lodge might not even be active anymore, but I&#39;m not sure). There are Lodges all over the place, and you can take a picture that makes it look like a statue is close to just about anything.

<p>To start with, you need to read the link I posted, because it will completely demolish everything you said. You don&#39;t know the facts of what led to the American Revolution, because most of what you were talk in school is narrative unconnected to historical fact.</p>

<p>There were two factions: the real revolutionaries, led by Washington and Franklin. And the aristocrats, led by Jefferson, Burr, and others.  Washington wanted abolition, and the aristocrats opposed it.</p>

<p>Right after the Declaration, northern states began to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States#Abolition_in_the_North">abolish</a> slavery. The real patriots tried to abolish slavery again at the Constitutional convention, but were opposed again.</p>

<p>But if you read the Constitution, slavery could have been indirectly abolished by 1808 through a tax on slaves. $10,000 per year excise tax on the owning of slaves, abolition accomplished.</p>

<p>Simply: the kind of people who see Satanism everywhere are already under the effects of a conspiracy to draw them away from the real causes, in favour of chasing a spiritual boogeyman they can&#39;t ever possible find. It&#39;s a fantastic trick, getting people to run the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s back up a bit. First of all, you cannot prove a negative. So, this statement is incapable of being true at its outset, in the sense of &quot;I am 100% confident Satan does not exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m assuming you meant Satan very probably does not exist, which is a different question. But keep in mind this isn&#39;t outsiders pointing fingers, it&#39;s based on our reading their own works and relaying what they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large amount of pop-culture Christian knowledge is sourced from either Paradise Lost or Dante&#39;s Inferno, neither of which are canon. But some people aren&#39;t careful about where they get their information.</p>

<p>Interesting side note: Paradise Lost is also where the suggestion that Satan was the serpent comes from. Otherwise, Satan&#39;s only real appearance in the Bible is in Job, where there&#39;s really no mention of his role other than as an angel in God&#39;s court -- even then, it&#39;s not clear if it&#39;s a given name, it means &quot;adversary&quot;. There are even suggestions the word might have roots in the Israelite legal system, something like a prosecutor.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just why I take Satan worship in conspiracies with a spoonful of salt. It feels a play to emotions or religious belief, and they just don&#39;t hit me the way they are intended.</p>

<p>&quot;The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.&quot; (Revelation 12:9).</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t know is if Satan is the same serpent as the Garden of Eden. And this gets REALLY interesting if you study alternative history and secrets societies. </p>

<p>Many of the mystery religions trace their lineage back to a Pre-Flood <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73J4VSOFn-c">Brotherhood of the Snake</a>. And there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_Mound">serpent-shaped mounds</a> all over North America, and snake temples in South America.

<p>There&#39;s only one passage in the whole Bible that may refer to a demon as something like Lucifer, in Isaiah 14. But the majority of scholars, including actually don&#39;t believe this is referring to Satan or any fallen angel.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer#Christianity">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Calvin said: &quot;The exposition of this passage, which some have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance: for the context plainly shows these statements must be understood in reference to the king of the Babylonians.&quot; Luther also considered it a gross error to refer this verse to the devil&quot;</p>

<p>Satan pretends to be a light bringer, and he often deceives his followers on this point. That&#39;s the meaning of Isaiah 14; this king is calling himself the son of the Dawn, but God is mocking him because he&#39;s just a man.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why evil Luciferians like Albert Pike say they&#39;re worshiping the good guy. (not to say all Luciferians are necessarily evil, but just look at Albert Pike&#39;s life and you can see he is evil).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t get a lot of people to join up if you say &quot;hey, let&#39;s worship an entirely evil, destructive entity with no redeeming characteristics that constantly deceives people into thinking he&#39;s good!&quot; So Satan tells people God is the concealer of knowledge, and pretends he and his followers are the revealers of truth.</p>

<p>Even a cursory reading of history reveals this is not true. From Tubal Cain and on, the dark occultists hide knowledge from humanity and seek to control them with it. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Honestly, I try to avoid using the term &quot;Lucifer&quot; entirely. It&#39;s intentionally unclear language.</p>

<p>Satan and the Serpent are connected in Revelation 12:9</p>

<p>&quot;The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.&quot;</p>

<p>And, of course, Jesus calls himself the Morning Star. So using the term &quot;Lucifer&quot; just muddies the waters on everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pike writes about Lucifer, but then so do you in your comment. Does that make you a Satanist? </p>

<p>What Pike actually says about Lucifer could appear positive upon first reading, but that&#39;s part of the point he&#39;s making. He starts by saying it is strange that the &#39;Spirit of Darkness&#39; would also bear light. He then goes on to say that the light of Lucifer &#39;blinds feeble, sensual or selfish Souls&#39; - hardly an endorsement and appears more of a warning that the light of Lucifer causes great harm (blindness).</p>

<p>&#39;Splendors intolerable&#39; is strange/bad/poetic grammar from a 2017 point-of-view. It would be more easily understood as &#39;intolerable splendours&#39;.</p>

<p>This talk of Lucifer, and understanding or fighting him, reminds me of this famous Neitzsche quote: &quot;He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comments about Satan are only in relation to him talking about Satan being the Light bearer. HE was the one who subscribes to the H.P. Blavatsky doctrine of the God of the Bible being the bad guy and Lucifer/Satan being good for man. I don&#39;t bastardize what he said he just does that to God, so I&#39;m not a Satanist, I point them out so others can figure it out, or not, your choice. So if you really want to know what is up with good old Albert Pike, look at the history of  Blavatsky <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky#Socio-political_beliefs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky#Socio-political_beliefs</a> and here is her main work <a href="http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Secret-Doctrine-by-H.P.-Blavatsky.pdf">http://www.holybooks.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Secret-Doctrine-by-H.P.-Blavatsky.pdf</a> also check the history of Sabbatai Zevi and his teaching of the inversion of the Tora <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi</a> which then relates to Jacob Frank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank</a> teaching the same inversion but meeting up with two other men to start the infiltration of secret society for power and the subversion of governments for money and power to bring you to where we are today. Adam Weishaupt  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt</a> worked with Jacob Frank and William I, Mayer Rothschild to create the Illuminati here in America in 1776 and have been working behind the scenes since then to push the Luciferian inversion of the Bible to infiltrated and take over ALL secret societies, and that is why it&#39;s so hard  to see and figure out as the way they do it there are TONS of loops of BS and dead ends and plausible deniability. I&#39;ll give one example the broken Pentagram star in the streets of D.C. they say as a cover, if we were so powerful why couldn&#39;t we connect that star.....answer they didn&#39;t want to, a broken pentagram star is the symbol for Venus/Lucifer/Satan so it&#39;s there exactly as they indented. But they built in their BS cover ideas. You can believe what you want I&#39;ve just been looking into this crap for about 3 years when I really thought about what it meant that my Grandfather that I had no relationship with was a 33rd degree Mason and I now KNOW they are bad, not all of them of course most have no idea what is going on, but a percentage are Luciferian for sure. </p>

<p>You&#39;re quoting Gnostic Christian theology, and Pike was far from a Gnostic in that sense (though he definitely was a subscriber to the idea of gnosis, which should not be confused with the former).</p>

<p>So you had a Grandfather who was a Mason (probably not a 33rd in the Scottish Rite, but who knows, could be he was) who you didn&#39;t have a relationship with, but somehow you know more about the Freemasons than he did or than the vast majority of Masons do.... That&#39;s hard to believe.</p>

<p>Well, since Pike doesn&#39;t and I&#39;m not familiar with Blavatsky&#39;s take on the Christian scriptures, I&#39;m going to say that you&#39;re at least half wrong.</p>

<p>Pike NEVER makes this claim. Quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Understand that my skepticism isn&#39;t about you. It&#39;s just that the conspiracy community has a habit of calling every Mason a 33rd degree. The reality is that the 33rd degree is an honorary degree in one of many optional bodies that many Masons don&#39;t even join.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I read most of that page. There&#39;s nothing new in there, really, and I&#39;ve read all of this sort of conspiracy nonsense before. Let me explain how it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>First, you have to start with an absolute conviction that the target group (Freemasonry, in this case) is evil. You need to have this conviction because you have to ignore every shred of evidence that contradicts what you&#39;re saying and only focus on the parts that confirm your thesis, no matter how thin or how far you have to reach to find them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a great example from that page: Pike is quoted as saying that &quot;the Prince of Darkness ... created Adam&quot;. Well, that&#39;s pretty damning, isn&#39;t it?! Now, the somewhat astute reader will say, &quot;maybe Pike didn&#39;t say that,&quot; and will go look, and immediately they will find that Pike wrote pretty much exactly that, &quot;To retain the rays of Light still remaining among his Eons, and ever tending to escape and return by concentrating them, the Prince of Darkness with their consent made Adam whose soul was of the Divine Light contributed by the Eons.&quot;</p>

<p>First off, this appears to be a teaching of religious dogma, something Freemasons say they don&#39;t do! It also radically contradicts mainstream Christian, Jewish and Muslim teachings about Genesis!</p>

<p>That somewhat astute reader is now convinced!</p>

<p>But... they failed to read the context. Indeed, <strong><em>Pike clearly states that he&#39;s not talking about his beliefs nor any teaching of Freemasonry</em></strong>! Instead, he&#39;s giving a history lesson on the teachings of ancient Arabic/Christian sects of the early middle ages, specifically the teachings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_(prophet)">Mani</a>. He also discusses many other early Christian and Jewish thinkers, philosophers, poets, scientists and authors.</p>

<p>The real problem with the page you linked to, though, is that it does something that Pike warned against strongly, quoting Plutarch on the idea that the most immediate path to idolatry is to confuse the symbol with the thing symbolized. Unfortunately, this document spends the vast majority of its time doing exactly that; pointing out a Masonic symbol and then ignoring the thing it symbolizes and instead focusing only on the nature of the symbol itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get it you are all in on it...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes we are. We&#39;re all in on the most important secret ever told. It&#39;s been told for thousands of years, in dozens if not hundreds of initiatory societies. It&#39;s a secret, not because we jealously guard it, but because it cannot be communicated in any way other than through initiation. It&#39;s that moment in the degrees when all the ideas of charity and virtue and the bonds of brotherly love become more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>I hope that one day you can experience that secret, whether in Freemasonry or some other initiatic institution, and come to understand why simply trying to read the symbolism of Freemasonry like a book is laughably absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh... okay first off props for at least citing part of a real out-of-context quote rather than one of the many fabrications and hoaxes out there. It&#39;s a low bar, but I feel I should nod to those who manage to clear it.</p>

<p>That being said, the quote is often misunderstood, but in its essence here is what it is saying:</p>

<p>Knowledge is power, power corrupts the unwary. If you&#39;re going to pursue knowledge, then you have to be prepared to take on the responsibility that comes with it.</p>

<p>Or, to put it in the comic book jingoism of our era: with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That statue needs to come down!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>It&#39;s not your statue to put up or take down.</li>
<li>It&#39;s celebrating one of the most important Scottish Rite Freemasons in the history of the order <strong><em>on their front lawn</em></strong>, so it&#39;s not going anywhere.</li>
<li>Your absurd claim that he was a founder of the KKK ignores a) that we have no real evidence that he was even involved and b) the KKC (not a K) that he is suspected of being involved with wasn&#39;t anything like the modern KKK, despite being its progenitor.</li>
<li>Even if he personally founded the KKC, it&#39;s clear that his teachings with respect to the dangers of fanaticism were entirely ignored by the later iterations of the group, so saying that he had any influence over it would be silly at best.</li>

<p>True, I was mistaken about this. Still, it&#39;s a statue to one of the most important figures in the history of one of the most important organizations to the early history of the US. I don&#39;t see why we shouldn&#39;t have a statue to him. He&#39;s not dressed as a Confederate soldier, and in fact resigned his post in protest during the War!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sorry to tell you that Freemasons aren&#39;t unified on anything. I&#39;m sure there are those who would agree that the statue should be moved to the new location of the House of the Temple (which used to be where the statue is now).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there are MANY who say he is the grandfather of the Klan</p>

<p>Yeah, and there are many who say that he was a lot of things. But if you&#39;re going to claim they&#39;re right, you&#39;re going to need some evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your argument that he wasn&#39;t influential</p>

<p>I did not make such an argument. He was quite influential, and continues to be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why you are defending him?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I&#39;m defending truth, not him. I don&#39;t really care much about Pike. I think he was a very intelligent and very prolific author, but not someone I hold on a pedestal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you a Mason?</p>

<p>Yep. I&#39;ve done an AMA here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before. I was a conspiracy theorist long before I joined the Fraternity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, your document is rather damning, but not in the direction you want it to be...</p>

<p>First off, he cites Fleming, a rather biased and unsound source that modern historians tend to reject. But even if we accept his rather sketchy evidence, he only demonstrates that Pike may have been involved in the first Kuklux Clan, a social society focused on opposition to the post-war Reconstructionist effort on the part of northern politicians called &quot;carpetbaggers.&quot; That Pike would have been involved in such an organization isn&#39;t terribly shocking. It sounds like something he&#39;d be attracted to.</p>

<p>But we know he wasn&#39;t a founder. We know this, because we know the names of the six founders: John C. Lester, John B. Kennedy, James R. Crowe, Frank O. McCord, Richard R. Reed, and J. Calvin Jones. (Horn 1939)</p>

<p>The claim that he was a &quot;chief judicial officer&quot; is of questionable authenticity, but again, not shocking if true.</p>

<p>But the late first wave and early second wave of the Klan started to move away from the political goals of the original movement and quickly became a focus of post-war anger on the black community. THAT kind of fanaticism and xenophobia is something that the Albert Pike I&#39;m aware of would have been horrified by. It&#39;s exactly the kind of thing he spent his life writing against, and frankly, if he was an early member of the Clan, I would not be surprised if that fueled his later anti-fanaticism writings, and I&#39;d be rather shocked if he remained a member after that period.</p>

<p>Without Pike&#39;s calls to reason, I&#39;m sure that post-Civil-War America would have continued on, but it would not have been as tolerant or unified. As a newspaper publisher, legal scholar, philosopher and public figure, Pike helped to keep the kettle of the south from boiling over once again. If for that reason alone, he earned his place in our nation&#39;s memory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just sad that there were not more Southerners like Pike to help drag the region out of its xenophobic rut.</p>

<p>Albert Pike created the KKK</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t. This is a great example of the way Internet conspiracy theory distorts half-truths. There is some evidence to suggest that Pike <em>may</em> have been involved in the first wave of the Clan (not with a K at the time, and a VERY different organization, which attracted many people who would be ashamed of what it ultimately turned into). However, it wasn&#39;t until a completely unsourced claim arose that he had been their first treasurer that the idea started to develop that he was somehow involved in its founding.</p>

<p>I must stress that there is no evidence that he was a member, much less a treasurer, and CERTAINLY not a founder, and it&#39;s pretty clear that he would never have been involved in the second or third waves of the Klan, as they ran contrary to everything he believed in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he was a major force behind the Civil War</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was heavily involved in the effort to turn Native American tribes into a fighting force, but he resigned early in the war due to his disagreement with the way the war was being prosecuted. He also worked tirelessly in the post-War era to bring the nation together, a fact many detractors like to ignore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Statue of Satanist Albert Pike</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a completely absurd claim. Pike was many things, but outside of the Taxil Hoax and the Three World Wars Hoax, there is ample evidence to suggest that he was absolutely not a Satanist.</p>

<p>This is a common misreading of Pike, and often results from those who only read his works via excerpt.</p>

<p>Pike speaks at length about confusing the symbol with the thing symbolized, but we don&#39;t expect new initiates to be able to grasp that. We teach them things that they are clearly not yet at a point where they can grasp their meaning, just as undergraduates really can&#39;t grasp higher dimensional geometries, but we give them tools for roughly interacting with them so that they can begin to learn more. It&#39;s the only way one <em>can</em> teach these ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He resigned to flee from accusations of atrocities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s really twisting the facts to suit your narrative! The article you link to is <em>far</em> too short on details, but even it does not say this. Indeed, that&#39;s because it&#39;s not true. Here&#39;s a different account that&#39;s much more complete:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In January 1862 Indian Territory had been placed within the Trans-Mississippi District. When District Commander Gen. Thomas C. Hindman ordered Pike to send troops to Arkansas in May 1862, Pike resigned in protest. He argued that his command should be separate from Hindman&#39;s and that his troops should not serve outside Indian Territory. Pike exacerbated the situation by publishing his views about Hindman&#39;s military shortcomings and by proclaiming his grievances against Hindman&#39;s predecessor, Gen. Earl Van Dorn, for taking provisions, equipment, and monies from Pike&#39;s command for use elsewhere.
Pike&#39;s conduct led to his arrest in November 1862, but charges against him were dropped.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>- <a href="http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=PI006">Oklahoma Historical Society</a></p>

<p>Yes, the men under his command were accused of what Europeans considered unreasonable behavior in war. They, being Native Americans were, of course, not interested in how Europeans viewed their behavior, since their view of European behavior was already quite low!</p>

<p>You skipped over the fact that Pike resigned after being asked to deploy his Native American troops outside of their territories. This was a crucial element of his opposition to the way the Confederacy operated, and stands in stark contrast to the image of the Confederate general that people want to paint Pike with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve read all of it, but I&#39;d love to hear your explanation for this:</p>

<p>&quot;The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them. Their true explication is reserved for the Adepts, the Princes of Masonry.&quot;</p>

<p>I said Albert Pike is a known liar, and in his own book he says that they &quot;intentionally mislead&quot; people. How is he anything other than a known liar? How does &quot;intentionally mislead&quot; not mean &quot;intentionally mislead&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We teach them things that they are clearly not yet at a point where they can grasp their meaning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meaning you tell them explanations that are false. Also known as &quot;lying.&quot;</p>

<p>See, at my church, we might tell someone &quot;I wouldn&#39;t start with the Book of Revelation, because it&#39;s hard to understand.&quot; But we wouldn&#39;t make up fake interpretations and later tell them that was all a lie.</p>

<p>Of course, as you know, all of Freemasonry is a lie, in a sense. The original meanings of the symbols were long lost (as Pike admitted), and a century of work at the Research Lodges has recovered very little.</p>

<p>You use this word a lot, but you don&#39;t mean &quot;lying&quot; in the traditional sense, here. No one is telling anyone, &quot;this is the complete picture, congratulations, you know everything we have to teach.&quot;</p>

<p>Are the symbols misleading? Yes! They can&#39;t NOT be. But they get you thinking about key ideas; treating yourself and others with respect and empathy... then you start making progress on the harder concepts. The so-called &quot;higher degrees&quot; help, but ultimately, it&#39;s a matter of internalizing the language that those symbols construct and learning to interpret that language on its own, without the simplistic absorption that goes on when you&#39;re first exposed to them.</p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t think &quot;lying&quot; is the right term, here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a bit of a student of anti-Masonic conspiracy theory, so yes, I know of it quite well.</p>

<p>One of the best articles written about it is actually by folks who would, I&#39;m sure, have preferred it be true:</p>

<p><a href="http://wideshut.co.uk/albert-pikes-3-world-wars-letter-hoax-wideshut-webcast/">http://wideshut.co.uk/albert-pikes-3-world-wars-letter-hoax-wideshut-webcast/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s also the Masonic perspective:</p>

<p><a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/pike_mazzini.html">http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/pike_mazzini.html</a></p>

<p>To summarize, a 20th century priest who wrote against Freemasonry wanted to discredit the fraternity, and wasn&#39;t too worried about the truth. He &quot;discovered&quot; a letter from Pike which miraculously predicted events after Pike&#39;s death. Before WWII, he claimed to have found the letter, but its content was only revealed after WWII, at which time its prediction of that war was added. There are many reasons the document is an obvious forgery:</p>

<ul>
<li>He didn&#39;t mention that it predicted a second World War before the war happened</li>
<li>The text of the letter is not written in the style of Albert Pike, and we have many samples of his public and private writing.</li>
<li>It incorporates elements of two other known hoaxes: the Taxil hoax and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. When it comes to Masonic conspiracy theory, the rule of thumb to use is: if it sounds like the perfect smoking gun, it was probably false. The scandals that don&#39;t fit that mold are very few and far between (e.g. the Morgan Affair in the early 19th century in which some upstate New York Masons took it upon themselves to kidnap and possibly kill an alleged Mason who wrote and expose).</p>

<p>The Fraternity has had millions of members over hundreds of years, so it&#39;s not shocking that there are some scandals to be had, even some pretty awful ones like the Morgan Affair, but when compared to just about any other organization of a similar size, Freemasonry manages to keep its members within due bounds of morality and the public good far better than just about any other.</p>

<p>How that is the case and why that&#39;s the case are probably worthy of investigation on their own. IMHO, it all comes down to the sincerity with which the three degrees exhort the candidates to improve themselves through morality and virtue. Not everyone response to those ideas, but those who remain within the Fraternity and even become active in its leadership are more likely than not to be those who do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the sort of broad &quot;uber-conspiracy&quot; that has become symbolized by the word &quot;Illuminati,&quot; I think that this is a monster of our own id&#39;s creation. In short, Western society has been inventing many reasons to explain the seeming powerlessness of the individual since the 1950s. There&#39;s an obvious and simple reason for that lack of power, but it&#39;s an uncomfortable truth:</p>

<p>Around 1955, especially in the United States, adults started to drop out of major social institutions that had been the core of the sense of community at the lowest levels: the community groups, social societies, religious groups, etc. You see symptoms of this all over today. Why are there &quot;megachurches&quot;? Because the individual community churches mostly fell apart or at least shrunk to levels that were trivial compared to their size in the 1950s. Why has involvement in the political process reached all-time lows? Because those community-level groups that got people engaged are mostly gone.</p>

<p>Freemasonry too was a part of this decline, but every other social society suffered in the same way (many of the so-called &quot;animal lodges&quot; such as the Eagles, Elk, Moose, Lions, etc. are now gone or teetering on the brink).</p>

<p>So, to the individual who didn&#39;t see the core of the community erode away and merely saw that in previous generations the &quot;powers that be&quot; seemed to be more constrained, what was the cause? Some shadowy presence must have taken over.</p>

<p>Into this vacuum stepped three unrelated narratives:</p>

<li>The anti-Israeli political narrative was always a murky combination of sincere political arguments and extreme anti-semitic bile. It became a melting pot of everything from arguments over sovereignty to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and so some of those fringe stories started to gain the quasi-legitimacy of the non-fringe arguments.</li>
<li>Robert Anton Wilson, a comedy and science fiction author, produced a work which managed to capture the egregore of a generation&#39;s frustration and vague sense of existential dread: The Illuminatus! Trilogy. This work was not meant to be serious, but hit such a chord that, today, it is impossible to disentangle its absurdist humor from sincere conspiracy theory and elements of it crop up in this sub all the time.</li>
<li>The United States and its allies began to systematically attack privacy on a scale never before possible. The USA/UK program expanded to include every nation whose intelligence services were willing to work with the US. This <strong><em>real conspiracy</em></strong>, fueled by previously impossible technological advantages, made many of the other conspiracy theories seem less fantastic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately, the narrative which evolved from this disparate sources became the &quot;Rothschild/Illuminati/CIA&quot; chimera that you ask about. The reality is, unfortunately, much darker. The conspiracy theorist who accepts these uber-conspiracies is actually the optimist because, even though they fear the power they&#39;re constructing in their narrative, it&#39;s still a locus of control. The horrific notion that there is no such locus of control and that we&#39;re just the victims of a decaying Western social edifice... that&#39;s where it gets really scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, I see...hmm. That&#39;s more satisfying...I guess haha. So then how much power do these groups actually have then do you figure? Are there any of the conspiracy theories with regards to freemasons / rothschild that are true? Or are they just innocentish business folk doing what people do? Is there no puppet master at all and everything is kinda just free falling? Or are these groups still attempting the NWO but it really isn&#39;t that bad?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, Freemasonry has no power of its own, but it can be quite influential. Teaching a system of moral philosophy in a way that the average person can understand and apply in their lives is the kind of power that can shape entire nations, and has.</p>

<p>There have been powerful people who have been Freemasons, but I don&#39;t think that the two are related. Freemasonry treats a multi billionaire as an equal to a humble street cleaner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are there any of the conspiracy theories with regards to freemasons / rothschild that are true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rothschilds are a wealthy and powerful family. I expect that they have their share of family drama, and because of that power, some of that drama has implications to others, but I&#39;ve never seen any evidence for the claims conspiracy theorists make about them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or are these groups still attempting the NWO but it really isn&#39;t that bad?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny enough, New World Order is a bad translation of a phrase that Freemasonry has actually used, but in a Masonic context, this refers to the bond of brotherhood that Masons share, not some global domination plot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OH! What about the Bush family?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never met any of them, but their family has had real power for a VERY long time. Like any wealthy family, I&#39;m sure that their drama spills over.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think about JFK? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>His murder was clearly orchestrated by powerful people. I wrote a paper about that in high school. I had a professional psychologist review Ruby&#39;s psychological profile and she concluded that it would have been difficult for him to plan and carry out shopping for groceries, much less assassination of Oswald. I think that we will never know all the details, but this has nothing to do with Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Durham police later said they monitored the protests to make sure they were “safe” but did not interfere with the statue toppling because it happened on county property.</p>

<p>“Because this incident occurred on county property, where county law enforcement officials were staffed, no arrests were made by DPD officers,” Durham Police spokesman Wil Glenn said in a statement.</p>

<p>WTF! this mob rule BS! is not a path with legal process nor is it civil or orderly behavior. Anarchy is being allowed by the police &amp; politicians. </p>

<p>The slippery slope of this pattern leads to the well documented white supremacist Abe Lincolns memorial being destroyed by hivemind lord of the flies mobs or ignorant corrupt politicians. </p>

<p>I doubt any of the people who are seen clearly on tape that destroyed that statue in a criminal act will suffer any strong consequences &amp; the chip on their shoulder is a fascism chip forged in the ass of anarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I read most of that page. There&#39;s nothing new in there, really, and I&#39;ve read all of this sort of conspiracy nonsense before. Let me explain how it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>First, you have to start with an absolute conviction that the target group (Freemasonry, in this case) is evil. You need to have this conviction because you have to ignore every shred of evidence that contradicts what you&#39;re saying and only focus on the parts that confirm your thesis, no matter how thin or how far you have to reach to find them.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a great example from that page: Pike is quoted as saying that &quot;the Prince of Darkness ... created Adam&quot;. Well, that&#39;s pretty damning, isn&#39;t it?! Now, the somewhat astute reader will say, &quot;maybe Pike didn&#39;t say that,&quot; and will go look, and immediately they will find that Pike wrote pretty much exactly that, &quot;To retain the rays of Light still remaining among his Eons, and ever tending to escape and return by concentrating them, the Prince of Darkness with their consent made Adam whose soul was of the Divine Light contributed by the Eons.&quot;</p>

<p>First off, this appears to be a teaching of religious dogma, something Freemasons say they don&#39;t do! It also radically contradicts mainstream Christian, Jewish and Muslim teachings about Genesis!</p>

<p>That somewhat astute reader is now convinced!</p>

<p>But... they failed to read the context. Indeed, <strong><em>Pike clearly states that he&#39;s not talking about his beliefs nor any teaching of Freemasonry</em></strong>! Instead, he&#39;s giving a history lesson on the teachings of ancient Arabic/Christian sects of the early middle ages, specifically the teachings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mani_(prophet)">Mani</a>. He also discusses many other early Christian and Jewish thinkers, philosophers, poets, scientists and authors.</p>

<p>The real problem with the page you linked to, though, is that it does something that Pike warned against strongly, quoting Plutarch on the idea that the most immediate path to idolatry is to confuse the symbol with the thing symbolized. Unfortunately, this document spends the vast majority of its time doing exactly that; pointing out a Masonic symbol and then ignoring the thing it symbolizes and instead focusing only on the nature of the symbol itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I get it you are all in on it...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes we are. We&#39;re all in on the most important secret ever told. It&#39;s been told for thousands of years, in dozens if not hundreds of initiatory societies. It&#39;s a secret, not because we jealously guard it, but because it cannot be communicated in any way other than through initiation. It&#39;s that moment in the degrees when all the ideas of charity and virtue and the bonds of brotherly love become more than the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>I hope that one day you can experience that secret, whether in Freemasonry or some other initiatic institution, and come to understand why simply trying to read the symbolism of Freemasonry like a book is laughably absurd.</p>
