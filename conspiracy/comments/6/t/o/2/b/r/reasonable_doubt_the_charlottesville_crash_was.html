       Not terrorist act.
The original story is horseshit.
Video from all angles shows the truth. 
Turns out this was just a panic move after his car has hit with a pole from behind. Then after he gets hit by a protestor on the rear diver side with a pole, he accelerates into a seemingly parked car which was being swarmed with protesters, then people attack his car from all sides with weapons. The "victim" was running up to the back of the charger while it was being attacked from all sides AND has its reverse lights on. The driver punches it in reverse trying to save his own skin and the girl (now on the passenger side of the trunk) is caught in between a pickup truck and the charger where she sustains her fatal injuries. 
The kid does seem to actually be a white supremacist doucebag, but this is on the cops for letting antifa attack cars and swarm the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just goes to show you not to believe everything you hear right away.

       He is clearly driving slowly until the car is hit by protesters, then sudden acceleration. This will be the reasonable doubt his lawyer will use. They should not have been in the streets in the first place. The city will be sued big time for this.

       White Supremacists are low IQ tribal morons.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really believe that dudes white supremacist views won't condemn him your mistaken.  If you want to question why the police were told to stand down go ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The narrative you need to question is the awhole antifa no trump no kkk no racist USA bullshit.  White power supporters are fringe looney people and are not wanted by Trump or any other politician.  Look at who controlled the State and Town where all this transpired.
      </p>

       I will say that racism abounds on the other side of aisle masquerading as anti racism, wrap your head around that one.

       The clip is in slow motion.

       His lawyer would be an idiot to use a clip like this in court, especially since the prosecutors could simply show the entire clip in rebuttal.

       Virginia has actual laws, you know. The excusable self defense standard in VA requires him to announce a desire for peace and retreat safely

I'm going to bat for truth. 
I think KKK and white supremacists are morons.
Just cause I don't agree with someone's beliefs and politics doesn't mean I want them to go to prison forever for a possibly accidental action. If it WAS intentional then he should rot in prison. If my theory is correct, it's the fault of the city/cops for allowing the chaos.
We at T_D find white supremacists to generally be dumbfucks. All colors are welcome to MAGA

       THIS.
Now that's what I'm talking about! Evidence. Thank you. (Seriously, no sarcasm, thank you)
I would still like to see what happened a few seconds before (like what's with the tire chirp?)but this makes it look a lot more intentional. If it was, I hope he goes down for a long time. This makes my reasonable doubt less reasonable. I appreciate you linking some evidence instead of just bashing and downvoting. This is how we all learn and make the world better.

       When I google your phrase "excusable self defense virginia", the very first summarized result even says:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a general rule, Virginia does not require a person to retreat before using deadly force

      <p>
       So I'm not sure how you got that mistaken impression.   The only time you'd ever have a duty to retreat is if you were the initial aggressor and things escalated.

       That was a case of police shooting someone based off a mistaken belief created by a conversation over CB radio.  I don't see how that's very relevant to "duty to retreat".
      </p>

      <p>
       This one is more relevant.  Here you had mutual aggressors both fighting roughly equally.   Even in states with a codified "stand your ground" law, there has to be some way to resolve those sorts of cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I think everyone can agree that Florida is "stand your ground", with no "duty to retreat", yet their law is similar to Virginia:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The justifications for use of force
        <em>
         (in Florida)
        </em>
        will also not apply where the evidence establishes that the defendant initially provoked violence against him- or herself.

       I can show the case to you, but I can't read it for you. Here's an excerpt if it helps:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Excusable homicide in self-defense occurs where the accused, although in some fault in the first instance in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, when attacked retreats as far as possible, announces his desire for peace, and kills his adversary from a reasonably apparent necessity to preserve his own life or save himself from great bodily harm."

      <p>
       In any case, so what?  The normal standard is "justifiable homicide", when the victim isn't also an aggressor, which has no duty to retreat.  Virginia's laws are similar to every other "stand your ground" state.

       There is no evidence of an attack that would have put the driver in a justifiable fear for his safety or life. See, i.e., the video at the top of the thread, which had to be put into slow-mo and edited to create the false impression of an attack on the driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if justifiable homicide were the appropriate standard here, it does not entitle a driver to slam into a crowd of people at high speed, nor to back up over them.

       I believe that the video clearly shows the car being hit with something by a protester before the crash. No goalpost moving here. This action will most likely (IMHO) lead to his acquittal. I still think he's a shitty person for being a white supremacist. Thankfully we can have different views about the same thing and discuss them. If his actions were intentional, he should rot, but I don't want to get caught up in the hysteria.

       You have shown no footage of his car being attacked prior to the driver accelerating into the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no point was his only option to drive into the crowd. His actions do not fall under any legal umbrella of self-defense.

       Neither one of us know what happened before the video started. I don't pretend to. All I know is that his car is hit BEFORE the crash at the :02 second mark of the shorter video. I'm sure more video will continue to emerge and I shall adjust my theories only on evidence not emotion. Maybe he IS guilty(and a douchebag). But if he isn't, do you still want will in prison? I am merely presenting a theory that seems to trigger many.

       He may be driving toward the crowd but at that point he hadn't actually hit anyone. I don't know his speed or intentions at that point. I will not claim to. If a video shows clear intentions I will amend my theory, but to me, the jury is still out. I thought it was clear cut terrorism at first then I saw a couple of videos and I started to have doubts. I in no way defend the beliefs of white supremacists but I will wait until all evidence is in before I form a posse. I think everyone else should too. Sorry this attitude offends you.

       People are diving out of the way. His intent is clear. He had the option of stopping, parking, reversing, warning the crowd (a prerequisite for a self-defense claim). Instead he accelerated into the crowd. Signs of pre-meditation.

       Nice use of slow motion on the video, to disguise his speed at the point he's "attacked." By that point he was already almost into the crowd of people he brutally mowed down.

       Yeah. I already have reasonable doubts. Story was fishy from the get go. Assuming someone's intentions is not concrete evidence. The video shows that the protesters weren't just innocent bystanders. Just wait for more video and evidence to get out and see what happens I suppose. But people gonna downvote cause they don't want to see the possibility that they may be wrong.

       When you say that this is a false narrative, does this indicate that you know the "true narrative"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does it require a narrative at all? It is what it is. It's in law enforcement's hands. There are people and processes to handle it, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why such investment to ensure a correct interpretation of events and supposed facts? Genuinely curious here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, what would you regard as a reasonable place to hear / read more than one simple-minded perspective on the events that have unfolded here?
      </p>
      <p>
       My perspective is that it seems that a great many voices at the moment are more concerned about propping up their own version of reality than they are in getting to the truth of what is really happening. I don't propose to know the truth, but what I am seeing on the surface of things is very concerning and not for the reasons that I am being told to be concerned.

       Many.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is that it seems like a strange thing that so many people assume (a) that they can assess the guilt or innocence of person when they themselves weren't present and haven't heard evidence in a court of law, and (b) that their assessment of guilt or innocence matters. This seems to fuel mob mentality and mob violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another concern is in how this seems to come at a convenient time when there has been such a concerted effort to censor websites and youtube videos. Now all of a sudden, everything is being cast in the light of nazism, right when I was just getting used to the whole fake news scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am personally not afraid of what anyone thinks. Most people's thought processes are distorted in some way - some more than others. Personally, I'd rather hear what people think, and steer clear of shutting people down for their thoughts - but hey, that seems rather out of fashion these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm concerned that many of the people getting worked up may not actually know what fascism is or how it works. I'm concerned people are using historical lessons out of context without understanding that they may be propping up the very thing they purport to be against.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm concerned that our educational system has been weaekened beyond repair such that the general population has difficulty with critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm concerned anytime anyone gives their power away to the mainstream media rather than stand and think on their own. Whether you're right, left, somewhere in between or altogether someplace different - seems to me that the corporate media / agenda in this country has clearly demonstrated they cannot be trusted and do not have our collective best interests at heart, or even in mind when it comes to the bottom line.
      </p>

       Probably enough to get the idea.

       It doesn't. Which is why I think it's important to stand up to bald-faced attempts to create one, as OP is doing.

       Let the facts speak for themselves, rather than posting carefully-edited videos and trying to inject false facts into the discussion.

       What facts support the mainstream media assertion that this was a terrorist attack?

       Interesting. So the narrative that is clearly being pumped out by mainstream media is one which you are OK with? Or are you also standing up to that one? Or are all the facts known by the all mighty media so their narrative is OK?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who possesses the facts? Where are they? Does this video contain no facts?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's fed to the cattle is also a bald faced attempt to create a narrative, in my opinion. Perhaps this video is no different in that regard. Perhaps also it helps some evaluate from a different perspective and question the cattle feed?

       The poster here had to use a slowed-down and edited clip to support his story. The full video speaks for itself.

       No matter what happened it's clear the MSM loves manufacturing outrage.

       I'm not saying we shouldn't mourn the tragedy of the victims and lament the stupid mob frenzy that people get sucked into...

       ...but more Americans die everyday from other tragedies no one cares about at all.

       The clip is in slow motion.

       His lawyer would be an idiot to use a clip like this in court, especially since the prosecutors could simply show the entire clip in rebuttal.

       Virginia has actual laws, you know. The excusable self defense standard in VA requires him to announce a desire for peace and retreat safely
       <em>

       Just watch the full-speed, full-length clip. Which I'm sure you've already done.

       he had intentionally drove into the crowd, the street further up looks pretty empty and he could have turned at the intersection.

       THIS.
Now that's what I'm talking about! Evidence. Thank you. (Seriously, no sarcasm, thank you)
I would still like to see what happened a few seconds before (like what's with the tire chirp?)but this makes it look a lot more intentional. If it was, I hope he goes down for a long time. This makes my reasonable doubt less reasonable. I appreciate you linking some evidence instead of just bashing and downvoting. This is how we all learn and make the world better.
