The original story is horseshit.
Video from all angles shows the truth. 
Turns out this was just a panic move after his car has hit with a pole from behind. Then after he gets hit by a protestor on the rear diver side with a pole, he accelerates into a seemingly parked car which was being swarmed with protesters, then people attack his car from all sides with weapons. The &quot;victim&quot; was running up to the back of the charger while it was being attacked from all sides AND has its reverse lights on. The driver punches it in reverse trying to save his own skin and the girl (now on the passenger side of the trunk) is caught in between a pickup truck and the charger where she sustains her fatal injuries. 
The kid does seem to actually be a white supremacist doucebag, but this is on the cops for letting antifa attack cars and swarm the streets.</p>

<p>It just goes to show you not to believe everything you hear right away. 
Video of the initial attack on the car that started the unfortunate chain reaction and the actual accident

<p>Virginia has actual laws, you know. The excusable self defense standard in VA requires him to announce a desire for peace and retreat safely <em>before</em> exercising force. Not slam into a crowd of people and then back over them again.</p>

I think KKK and white supremacists are morons.
Just cause I don&#39;t agree with someone&#39;s beliefs and politics doesn&#39;t mean I want them to go to prison forever for a possibly accidental action. If it WAS intentional then he should rot in prison. If my theory is correct, it&#39;s the fault of the city/cops for allowing the chaos.

<p>Virginia is a &quot;stand-your-ground&quot; state. </p>

<p>When I google your phrase &quot;excusable self defense virginia&quot;, the very first summarized result even says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a general rule, Virginia does not require a person to retreat before using deadly force </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure how you got that mistaken impression.   The only time you&#39;d ever have a duty to retreat is if you were the initial aggressor and things escalated.</p>

<p>The controlling case seems to be <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth,</em> 200 Va. 92, 96, 104 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1958). <em>See also Lynn v. Com.,</em> 499 S.E.2d 1, 9, 27 Va.App. 336 (Va. App., 1998). </p>

<p>Bailey v. Commonwealth</p>

<p>That was a case of police shooting someone based off a mistaken belief created by a conversation over CB radio.  I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s very relevant to &quot;duty to retreat&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lynn v. Commonwealth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is more relevant.  Here you had mutual aggressors both fighting roughly equally.   Even in states with a codified &quot;stand your ground&quot; law, there has to be some way to resolve those sorts of cases.</p>

<p>For example, I think everyone can agree that Florida is &quot;stand your ground&quot;, with no &quot;duty to retreat&quot;, yet their law is similar to Virginia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The justifications for use of force <em>(in Florida)</em> will also not apply where the evidence establishes that the defendant initially provoked violence against him- or herself. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s very relevant to &quot;duty to retreat&quot;.</p>

<p>I can show the case to you, but I can&#39;t read it for you. Here&#39;s an excerpt if it helps:</p>

<p>&quot;Excusable homicide in self-defense occurs where the accused, although in some fault in the first instance in provoking or bringing on the difficulty, when attacked retreats as far as possible, announces his desire for peace, and kills his adversary from a reasonably apparent necessity to preserve his own life or save himself from great bodily harm.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking at the wrong case, I was looking at Bailey 1985, not 58.</p>

<p>In any case, so what?  The normal standard is &quot;justifiable homicide&quot;, when the victim isn&#39;t also an aggressor, which has no duty to retreat.  Virginia&#39;s laws are similar to every other &quot;stand your ground&quot; state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence of an attack that would have put the driver in a justifiable fear for his safety or life. See, i.e., the video at the top of the thread, which had to be put into slow-mo and edited to create the false impression of an attack on the driver.</p>

<p>Even if justifiable homicide were the appropriate standard here, it does not entitle a driver to slam into a crowd of people at high speed, nor to back up over them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that the video clearly shows the car being hit with something by a protester before the crash. No goalpost moving here. This action will most likely (IMHO) lead to his acquittal. I still think he&#39;s a shitty person for being a white supremacist.

<p>You&#39;re the one making the claim that he was attacked first. Yet you have no evidence.</p>

<p>He is already driving into the crowd at this point. It&#39;s obvious in the video, people are diving out of the way.</p>

If a video shows clear intentions I will amend my theory, but to me, the jury is still out. I thought it was clear cut terrorism at first then I saw a couple of videos and I started to have doubts. I in no way defend the beliefs of white supremacists but I will wait until all evidence is in before I form a posse. I think everyone else should too. Sorry this attitude offends you. </p>

<p>People are diving out of the way. His intent is clear. He had the option of stopping, parking, reversing, warning the crowd (a prerequisite for a self-defense claim). Instead he accelerated into the crowd. Signs of pre-meditation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many. </p>

<p>One is that it seems like a strange thing that so many people assume (a) that they can assess the guilt or innocence of person when they themselves weren&#39;t present and haven&#39;t heard evidence in a court of law, and (b) that their assessment of guilt or innocence matters. This seems to fuel mob mentality and mob violence.</p>

<p>Another concern is in how this seems to come at a convenient time when there has been such a concerted effort to censor websites and youtube videos. Now all of a sudden, everything is being cast in the light of nazism, right when I was just getting used to the whole fake news scam.</p>

<p>I am personally not afraid of what anyone thinks. Most people&#39;s thought processes are distorted in some way - some more than others. Personally, I&#39;d rather hear what people think, and steer clear of shutting people down for their thoughts - but hey, that seems rather out of fashion these days.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned that many of the people getting worked up may not actually know what fascism is or how it works. I&#39;m concerned people are using historical lessons out of context without understanding that they may be propping up the very thing they purport to be against.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned that our educational system has been weaekened beyond repair such that the general population has difficulty with critical thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m concerned anytime anyone gives their power away to the mainstream media rather than stand and think on their own. Whether you&#39;re right, left, somewhere in between or altogether someplace different - seems to me that the corporate media / agenda in this country has clearly demonstrated they cannot be trusted and do not have our collective best interests at heart, or even in mind when it comes to the bottom line.</p>

<p>Probably enough to get the idea.</p>

<p>His lawyer would be an idiot to use a clip like this in court, especially since the prosecutors could simply show the entire clip in rebuttal.</p>

<p>Virginia has actual laws, you know. The excusable self defense standard in VA requires him to announce a desire for peace and retreat safely <em>before</em> exercising force. Not slam into a crowd of people and then back over them again.</p>

<p>T_D guy, huh? Way to confirm the stereotype, going to bat for the white supremacist.</p>

<p>he had intentionally drove into the crowd, the street further up looks pretty empty and he could have turned at the intersection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS.
Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! Evidence. Thank you. (Seriously, no sarcasm, thank you)
I would still like to see what happened a few seconds before (like what&#39;s with the tire chirp?)but this makes it look a lot more intentional. If it was, I hope he goes down for a long time. This makes my reasonable doubt less reasonable. I appreciate you linking some evidence instead of just bashing and downvoting. This is how we all learn and make the world better. </p>
