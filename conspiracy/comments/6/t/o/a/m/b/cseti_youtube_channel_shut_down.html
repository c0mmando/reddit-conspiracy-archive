<p>The channel featured videos of witness testimonies, whistleblowers and the sort. What do you all make of this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But astral projection is real though. And telepathy is literally how they communicate. Why would you send messages through the medium of spacetime, which has an ultimate speed limit, when you can bypass that and jump right to the source code - consciousness - and communicate instantaneously?<br/>
The reason it&#39;s so suppressed is because if the population knew about the energy and propulsion systems they use and how they communicate it would destroy the current structure held up by oil and material obsession. Mainstream science, currently at least, seems to dismiss that consciousness is a quantum phenomena/universal property and writes it off as a product of chemicals in the brain. If we studied consciousness further we could learn to readjust our computer-brains to tune into the extended mind and further field of consciousness and open up so many new avenues for energy, information, and communication. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what Greer says, and it&#39;s nonsense. There are far more users of energy than producers. Drilling for oil is expensive; oil companies would be more than happy to exploit some new cheaper alternative. Whatever the new energy source is, it can be exploited as an industry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he says that, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s true. But if zero point energy was publicly disclosed then oil companies wouldn&#39;t make a profit. It would be essentially free for anyone. There&#39;s no way to monetise zero point energy, so there&#39;s no way to hold significant power over anyone since you can&#39;t restrict their access to it. At least if zero point technology was public knowledge, that is. Furthermore, if everyone has access to all the energy they need to do everything for themselves indefinitely then all hierarchical power structures collapse. It&#39;s that significant. Not to mention how the lack of any emissions would practically reverse the climate change happening and then there wouldn&#39;t be any &quot;imminent global crisis&quot; to keep fear mongering the public about. Free energy is the key to equal and sustainable distribution of power. </p>

<p>He gave us much hope with his original 2001 Disclosure Project. He gathered credible people in the government and military and put them on the record.</p>

<p>He got a lot of fame and notoriety and I think it went to his head, bigly. He quit his job as a ER doctor. He spoke of &quot;briefing&quot; politicians who deny ever meeting him. He always seems to be name-dropping. He began selling expensive trips to use &quot;protocols&quot; to summon UFOs and orbs that some debunked as moths. </p>

<p>He really seems to have lost his grip.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a 4chan graphic going through some weird shit, too.

<p>It&#39;s also 33 days (another popular occult number) before another astrological event that fulfills verses of revelations. Basically chaos is supposed to erupt after the eclipse, and 33 days after we are going to get the big reveal. </p>

<p>As it is right now, if it hasn&#39;t happened to someone they support, then it&#39;s no big; thing is, it&#39;s happening so quickly and with such a broad stroke, it won&#39;t be long until it does reach a person they support.

    <div class="md"><p>To me it&#39;s more surprising that anyone is surprised. We&#39;ve been seeing similar happening for more than a decade now. Most of us have been online and wandering through different communities since the proliferation of the internet, we got to see it through it&#39;s infancy where everything was still being created.  It was fresh, it was new. </p>

<p>As all the different subsets of internet culture aged, they usually ended up becoming stifled, abandoned for the next flashy thing, or, eventually, turned in to a sustainable and marketable product.</p>

<p>A few people here have probably noticed different communities are on the forefront of what people are talking about. Certain subjects get discussed ad nauseum, they move on, then in three to five years everyone seems to be talking about what people on the forefront moved on from years ago.</p>

<p>As different parts of the internet became more profitable in the mainstream it slowly stopped being as interesting to the types of people that pushed pure information content during the Internets more innovative stages. They&#39;re still &#39;here&#39;, but it&#39;s not as simple as it was during those &#39;wild west&#39; days of the internet.</p>

<p>Youtube and google became too mainstream and bloated to really support the pure information at the forefront of discourse.  It&#39;s flooded with every tom dick and harrys attempt to make a quick click buck.</p>

<p>People concerned about this will catch up eventually.</p>

Greer’s business practices through his non-profit CSETI have also been questioned. In 2013, CSETI relinquished their non-profit status. In the years prior, large amounts of the organization’s funds were paid as consultation fees to Crossing Point, Inc., a business also owned by Greer. Over $830k was paid to Crossing Point in three years, accounting for 70 percent of the organization’s funds (7)(8).</p>

<p>Even the Orion Project for free energy seemed to be nothing more than a shill for Greer’s real estate investments.</p>

<p>Exopolitic’s sources claim that Greer was skimming funds from this project, as well as the Sirius documentary, and individuals working around Greer feared for their lives. One had their brakes cut and another discovered unaccounted for streaks of blood in their home.</p>

<p>The evidence against Greer and his scamming practices continue to mount against any hint of credibility he may have had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was OK for the platform when the free expression meant LGBT activists and SJWs and <em>edgy</em> scene girl &amp; boys. Game streamers and unboxers. Cute, quirky comedians and expert vloggers with great drone footage and promoted content now and then, skillfully inserted there. </p>

<p>But then right wing gained volume, and went from Alex Jones and the usual cukoos to myriad young, semi-articulate, videogenic vloggers spouting conservative and then outright extremist opinions. Some seemingly actually informed, genuine interested perosnalities, others clearly just riding the wave of alt this, alt that, profiting from the Pepe crowd via their Patreons. Some even changing tracks from the SJW camp.</p>

<p>Guess the agenda calls for some culling of opinion. Maybe a new service will appear and cater to the exiled content creators.</p>

<p>You do know, though.  Google is wrong to censor.  Of course, they have the right to - it&#39;s their platform.  But we equally have the right to call them out for it, drown them in bad publicity, and even seek to break them apart as a search monopoly (not saying this should happen - just saying we have the right to call for it).</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to agree with people to recognize their right to speak.  I don&#39;t want the Nzis edgelords taken off Youtube any more than I want the &quot;Die CIS scum&quot; SJWs removed.  And I don&#39;t want UFO material removed.  </p>

<p>Google is trying to define wrongthink and that needs to be fought.  Because I guarantee you their definition of wrongthink will adhere only to the leftist narrative.  It will be entirely one sided.</p>

<p>the truth is out there, as they say.  it moves around.  it disguises itself.  it&#39;s not obvious, often.  it&#39;s extremely obvious, often.  it&#39;s up to us personally to sharpen our razors of discernment.  the common not-explicitly-stated-but-felt desire for official providers of answers to come in and tell us all what to think is an enormous obstacle for personal growth.  </p>

<p>there&#39;s no lack of information out there.  as much as people want to hide it - it just moves around.  we should be happy for that as the ways this happen tells us things about what&#39;s going on.  the censorship whine is a whine.  there are efforts to censor, sure.  but censorship as a general thing is not happening - the information still remains there for people who know and who have learned by their own effort how to see it.</p>

<p>They frequently manipulate mankind that way. Channeled material is an example. Good information can come through that way, but how does a young ignorant receptive mind detect the insidious poison well wrapped in actual truth? The innocent mind often misses the poison, then takes it into its belief system, feels fear, acts poorly and the desired result is achieved. It&#39;s no joke, these poison pills can be wrapped in 95%+ actual truth. </p>

<p>I could write a lot about how these trickster beings operate. I am averse to mentioning that they attack my mind, because they have cultivated our culture in many subtle ways to facilitate their enslavement agenda. So, anyone who knows that they receive harassment and/or manipulation from outside forces is prevented from openly discussing their experiences without being dismissed as crazy. It&#39;s like a tragic comedy. Pretty much everyone who suffers this situation knows what will happen when they speak their minds. There are always people that feel inclined to tell them to get help, ultimately by getting prescription drugs of course. Diagnosis is merely alignment of symptoms with a contrived syndrome, nothing more. They can&#39;t think outside the box laid for them by the orthodox thought of our culture. </p>

<p>These trickster beings find a lot of utility in deceptions that allow them to exert influence right in front of us. It&#39;s close to wilful ignorance on our part, but more an unwillingness to think independently and question what we were told by authority. Think of how many schizophrenic or otherwise crazy people you&#39;ve heard about that speak of the theme of demons attacking them. It&#39;s probably the most common theme. They are just beings that want to dominate and control others and get high off of causing others to enter negative emotions, much like internet <em>trolls</em>. </p>

<p>They use a similar strategy for their other operations. They again create memes that would have us attach the perception of insanity to those who seriously consider certain topics. This includes UFOs, an agenda of foreign beings trying to control us, fiat currency being a scam to consolidate control, the media being secretly owned by a group of interconnected people that are semi-unknowingly serving this outside force, science being limited to prevent certain kinds of knowing from taking hold, etc. </p>

<p>They basically infiltrate, survey, corrupt the integrity of a structure, so that they can then insert deceptive signals in order to dominate and control others by controlling the systems they use to govern themselves. They are hackers, users and abusers of others and their philosophies and behaviors are based on the manipulation of others rather than mutual respect for others. </p>

<p>Stephen Greer is blind to these unwholy beings and as such can be a tool for them, all whole being an honest, loving, honorable man. Dogma makes us tools of evil. Steven Greer is unwilling to question his belief that negative ET beings don&#39;t exist in any significant, advanced state in the cosmos. They do and it resembles our myths of Satan and demons. Religion is there to skew our understanding of these beings. It makes these predictable self-serving, technology and knowledge obsessed domination and control oriented machine minds into mysterious, fearsome supernatural creatures. They are just ancient spoiled manchildren that don&#39;t want to contribute their fair share with too many toys and too much freedom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shocking thing is how accepting people are about YouTube going down this route. They&#39;d probably just accept slavery if the Rothschilds could just prove that they owned the USA, with documentation. </p>

<p>Their argument is that since YouTube is private, it can do what it wants. That&#39;s true, but misses the point. We can&#39;t really go after YouTube with current laws, fucking duh. It&#39;s as if these people think we want to prosecute YouTube in court.</p>

<p>No, this is about losing our ability to communicate without censorship. YouTube gave us a platform for it. Maybe you just watched the entertainment videos, but some of us value the political ones. We see them being demonetized and removed. This alarms us. We tend to be the ones to look at what&#39;s going on and also care about the future.</p>

<p>So, while your amusing videos are going to remain, those of us carrying you around, by being democratic citizens while you slack, are going to be even worse at our unpaid jobs. That means you&#39;ll be getting even crappier government in the future. Of course, you won&#39;t care now, probably call others and I alarmist, but you&#39;ll still be affected and probably forget you read anything like this. Then you&#39;ll probably just blame your problems on the scapegoat plastered on TV. </p>

<p>&quot;Many of you have written in to let us know that the youtube.csetiweb site has been blocked by youtube. Thank you.</p>

<p>That site was our original youtube site. It has exclusively had our own material on it and our mission is to promote Universal Peace. How anything that was posted violated youtube terms of service we do not know.   Finding someone to speak with at google/youtube is difficult to say the least. We have no paid staff and certainly no one versed in the fine points of youtube take downs.</p>

<p>If anyone reading this has personal experience successfully reversing a youtube take down and can help us navigate their bureaucracy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:AnnaKramer@SiriusDisclosure.com">AnnaKramer@SiriusDisclosure.com</a></p>

<p>Around the time of the &quot;Sirius&quot; film in 2014 we started the youtube.com/SDisclosure site which is our official site and the one we have used the most since that time.</p>

<p>All the information that was on the cseti.web is also at youtube.com/SDisclosure.
Please share youtube.com/SDisclosure with your friends. It has a wealth of valuable information.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, please express to youtube your concern about this censorship and suppression of information!</p>

<p>Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but wonder a little bit though, because in essence, Youtube has allowed itself  to be, and even packaged itself as as a forum for public expression. They were even monetizing many of these videos not so long ago.</p>

<p>You do know, though.  Google is wrong to censor.  Of course, they have the right to - it&#39;s their platform.  But we equally have the right to call them out for it, drown them in bad publicity, and even seek to break them apart as a search monopoly (not saying this should happen - just saying we have the right to call for it).</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to agree with people to recognize their right to speak.  I don&#39;t want the Nzis edgelords taken off Youtube any more than I want the &quot;Die CIS scum&quot; SJWs removed.  And I don&#39;t want UFO material removed.  </p>

<p>Google is trying to define wrongthink and that needs to be fought.  Because I guarantee you their definition of wrongthink will adhere only to the leftist narrative.  It will be entirely one sided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But astral projection is real though. And telepathy is literally how they communicate. Why would you send messages through the medium of spacetime, which has an ultimate speed limit, when you can bypass that and jump right to the source code - consciousness - and communicate instantaneously?<br/>
The reason it&#39;s so suppressed is because if the population knew about the energy and propulsion systems they use and how they communicate it would destroy the current structure held up by oil and material obsession. Mainstream science, currently at least, seems to dismiss that consciousness is a quantum phenomena/universal property and writes it off as a product of chemicals in the brain. If we studied consciousness further we could learn to readjust our computer-brains to tune into the extended mind and further field of consciousness and open up so many new avenues for energy, information, and communication. </p>
