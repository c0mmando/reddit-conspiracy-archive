Was traced and found that he works for State Dept. in C.A.R. as Chief Deputy. Some allegations concerning him responsible or connected. The wordpress URL in the photo talks about the theory. Seems plausible, at least worth noting. Little far fetched, but this guy, at the least is an interesting person to be at the right place to video tape the incident. <a href="http://archive.is/dx2dU">Here is a archived version of the FIRST URL in the above photo. I archived it in case it is edited, as it is the only thing left saying Brennan works for the State Dept.</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at enhanced photos. Not sure if I see a mustache. </p>

<p>Well that&#39;s the point, isn&#39;t it?  I&#39;d say that no, no we haven&#39;t. </p>

<p>You&#39;re happy to call pretty much anything a false flag on the flimsiest of evidence. Once you get that idea in your head no amount of reporting will change it.</p>

<p>It will only reinforce your notion.</p>

<p>So here we have 1) T_D and literal Nazis showing up with something that contradicts what most people think (including the loathsome &#39;MSM&#39;), 2) they&#39;re saying it&#39;s some sort of Jewish-deep-state-Soros false-flag so it&#39;s part of the fantasy, and 3) everyone who says otherwise is a shill trying to manipulate our hero.</p>

<p>Now speculation time: I think that seeing white people mobilize against racism of their own kind scared those that are seeking to do things like take down statues of old dead white guys, and so, they sent in marchers with fresh new nazi flags to march among the real protesters, they only took pics of them, they bused in idiot college kids and told them they were gonna be fighting real life Nazis, they went retarded, cops ordered to stand down, protesters marched through agitators, agitation happened, attacks happened, girl gets killed, alt-right are all labeled as Nazis, and the degradations and perversions hopefully get back on schedule while the white people will be too ashamed, too reminded of their own perceived dirtiness, to rise up for themselves and say &quot;yeah nice try how about no&quot;. </p>

<p>There&#39;s racists everywhere, but its pretty much common knowledge that the South has the most of them. After all, racism is passed down by generations (its not something you&#39;re born with), and like I said there was, ya know, SLAVERY in the South 150 years ago. Its gonna take more than a couple centuries for racist ideologies to stopped being passed down from when people&#39;s ancestors fucking (literally) owned black people.</p>

The first step in becoming a conspiracy theorist is the suspension of disbelief because a lot of this shit is too crazy to believe at first glance.

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck are you talking about? 99% of people reject most conspiracies. That might as well be a fucking fact. What am I supposed to give them  credit for? We all know people dont believe these things when we tell them. Go around telling people about pizzagate in real life and they will all call you crazy for the most part. There&#39;s nothing to give them credit for, they&#39;ve already proven they don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t believe most of these things are true. I&#39;d go as far as to say they are at least in part conditioned to believe these things are impossible.</p>

<p>Did you seriously not know.most people outright reject most conspiracies from the get go? You give people too much credit or have spent to much time in the conspiracy bubble and think most people are like conspiracy theorist. They aren&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe don&#39;t lead with pizzagate.  Lead with Epstein and Savile and Sandusky.  Short jump from there to Podesta and PG and whatever.  In my experience, people are very open to conjecture if you ask them what they think of the bullshit around them instead of telling them what you think of it.  Also, the whole reason I engaged you was because you were begging the thread to please just condemn something so that we&#39;re all in it together.  You have to learn that it is ok to think differently from others (and for others to think differently from you).  In fact, by nature, everyone does it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s ok to think differntly from others, but its also an extremely wonderful thing when we can agree on something. And I didn&#39;t want anything condemned, more the opposite. To for once just all agree there&#39;s nothing fishy about something, it&#39;d be nice no? Just a little peace in a crazy world.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s a case with a precedent, by telling them about Epstein you are breaking their disbelief. You are showing them that it is in fact possible for that to happen. There are however a lot of conspiracies that don&#39;t have a confirmed case that shows that it is actually possible. Take reptilians for example, there&#39;s nothing like that in the world that you could point to and say &quot;see it is possible&quot; like you can with pg. So it will require a certain suspension of disbelief before you can entertain the arguments put forth in support of such an impossible idea. Pizza gate was a bad example of what i mean.</p>

<p>Like, when I see someone make an argument ad hominem, for example, instead of being like &quot;you sir are a fallacious and vexatious instigator and your baseless claims as to the nature of this man&#39;s character have no place in the confines of this debate!&quot;, I&#39;ll say something like &quot;hey man, let&#39;s be fair: he wasn&#39;t talking about you as a person, he was talking about (whatever the idea was).

<p>What I don&#39;t quite understand though is that given he&#39;s a motor head and his car looked as if it was the pride and joy of his life (notice how polished it was), why would he risk writing his car off by crashing it into a crowd of people and other cars? </p>

The car that rammed the crowd has a chrome backing in the headlight housing, while the car in his original pic has the body color backing.  Different windshield.

<p>I would guess it has both so if the motor dies it can still be closed. I do not know for sure &amp; that sample was a random hit from a probing search I made. the VIN from pol shows no sunroof &amp; is a less reliable secondary state registration form subject to more error than manufacturers VIN #s.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I just showed examples of how the VIN shows sunroof or no sunroof.</p>

<p>For a long long time sunroofs are part of most if not all U.S. car makers VIN #s likely for many many reasons. Additionally shoddy aftermarket sunroof installations can cause confusion then leading to used car sales lawsuits where many if not most new car dealers also sell used cars. </p>

<p>No. You showed how the VIN shows what <em>optional</em> equipment can come with a car. You haven&#39;t shown how a VIN will specify whether a car has said optional equipment on it or not because you can&#39;t. Showing all the optional equipment available for a VIN doesn&#39;t prove anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I provided 2 VIN#. One the VIN from the 4 chan thread registration &amp; another I found on the web. Both were placed into the VIN search tool @ <a href="http://en.vindecoder.pl">http://en.vindecoder.pl</a>. The 4 chan VIN comes back with no sunroof &amp; the other does have a sunroof installed as an option. One is a challenger &amp; one is a charger, but the fact is options are very often if not always known from VIN #. This is partially due to prevent used car sales confusion of after market installations being passed off as original equipment @ the time of the original dealer sales. </p>

<p>The options section is not listing all available options, it is showing installed options. Notice how on <a href="http://www.finishlinewheels.com/DODGE/CHARGER/2010/">this page</a> OEM rims include more than chrome listed as an option. The 4 chan VIN# returns &quot;Chrome wheels&quot; &amp; the driver had blacked out non OEM wheels possibly the ones commonly sold as <a href="https://www.carid.com/2010-dodge-charger-factory-wheels/">Remanufactured Replace® rims</a> that are not OEM. This allows resellers &amp; buyers of used cars to know the black rims are not original. </p>

<p>The VIN # search from 4 chan returns only chrome wheels even though many OEM options existed. It only lists the options that was on the car from the factory this is how VINs work.</p>

<p>Now you claim that by searching dealer database records with a VIN you can find dealer records that will show whether or not the car had the sunroof.

<p>I can eaily &amp; logically guess both are listed to show a sunroof of either type is installed. This helps a used car dealer or buyer know if an aftermarket hole was cut into the car by non manufacturers that often results in more leaks.

<p>I already explained how many options exist for wheels/rims. They are they not all listed because nothing in the options box shows standard non option wheels/rims were original equipment. The other VIN search shows only &quot;chrome wheels&quot;, but not all the other many optional choices to choose from.</p>

<p>I am speaking specifically of the Ohio location, since at the time (and still today) there was talk of flight path analyses, bird spotting, figuring out the location based off the sun and stars. None of that came into play-- that tweet &quot;cracked the case.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe some aspects of the whole ordeal were impressive, but not at impressive as it&#39;s hyped up to be.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re implying that I downvoted you, I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t care about karma enough to be that petty, and you shouldn&#39;t either, haha. But I hadn&#39;t upvoted you and I just did, so there.</p>

<p>&quot;The search began on March 8 and was immediately narrowed when Labeouf was spotted on social media at a diner in Greenville, Tennessee,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One of the trolls quickly found a clue: a photo of LaBeouf, taken days earlier, at a diner in Greeneville, Tennessee.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean, nearly every video and article about it mentions the tweet as being the single discovery the lead to finding the flag. The video you linked to doesn&#39;t go into detail, it just mentions all the things 4chan attempted before discovering the tweet.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/vw9zyxm860Q">This Internet Historian video is much more detailed</a> (and it has 1.7m views). <a href="https://youtu.be/vw9zyxm860Q?t=1m55s">1:55</a> for the mention of the tweet.</p>

<p>I think you might be mistaken.</p>

This is the same Reddit that stirred up so much shit over an unrelated college student in their Boston marathon bombing &quot;investigation&quot; that the dude they thought did it was a) cleared of all wrong doing by the people who are actually trained to be investigators and b) was driven to the point of suicide. Sorry if I don&#39;t trust basically anonymous people jerking themselves fucking raw over the same set of blurry, shitty images that prove nothing unless you&#39;ve already made up your mind that he&#39;s not the one who did it. </p>

<p>I mean really. Which is more likely. The mysterious shadow government is so powerful that they can pull the wool over everyone&#39;s eyes on this, but somehow manage to fuck things up like not getting the right model of car, or doing something as stupid as fucking up the registration? Or that some wankers on the internet that had their minds made up before they even started &quot;investigating&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at pretty much most of them and I don&#39;t get what you are trying to say with this. Most video&#39;s are somewhat the same and barely any of the videos provide extra insight.</p>

<p>What, according to you, is the importance of not &quot;blatantly ignoring&quot; the other video&#39;s? What kind of extra insight would they give? Could you care to elaborate?</p>

<p>You made a very empty statement.</p>

<p>This picture says no leak in radiator and implies a reinforced vehicle, but on newer Dodge vehicles like the challenger, the radiator is further back behind the bumper.  There is a large empty space in the front fascia before the bumper just for looks, and the condenser for the AC would likely act as a buffer before the radiator took any damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the pics from FB are from a different car he owned. Some people get cars with minor options and realize they want a similar one with better options afterwards. So they trade it in or sell it and pay a difference. </p>

<p>A friend of mine has a popular model of a car and it&#39;s only two years old. However the dealer she financed from is always trying to get her to trade it in and get a newer version of the car. It&#39;s the same body type and everything. For some reason the model car she has is popular with Uber/Lyft drivers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m saying it&#39;s possible he might have wanted better options for the same car and dealers genuinely are always looking for ways to make money off of people. Even if it means convincing you to upgrade the same model you have already of the same car. </p>
