One thing that concerns me, is seeing the word terrorist applied so quickly. It seems the result of the post-911 war on terror.  The more loosely &quot;terrorist&quot; is applied to American citizens, the easier it will be for citizens to accept fellow Americans to be detained or prosecuted under already established laws for dealing with &quot;terrorists&quot;. Slippery slope in my view, as well as an example of successful programming.</p>

<p>If it fits the definition, it is legitimate to use the word.  If not, then you&#39;re correct in saying the word shouldnt be used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quality comment, thanks. I have been asking myself if people would have jumped to the word &quot;terrorist&quot; so quickly 18 years ago. It&#39;s possible the drivers motives we&#39;re political but entirely possible something personal was at play. &quot;Terrorist&quot; is such an extreme kneejerk reaction to me. I guess times have changed.</p>

<p>You say &quot;it&#39;s possible&quot; like it&#39;s only a remote possibility that his decision to drive several hours to participate in a political rally and then drive his car into a group of people protesting said rally was political.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t deny his apparent ties to white supremacists. Can we say for sure he didn&#39;t have an interaction at the event that inspired him to do what he did? I have not seen any evidence it was premeditated, such as a manifesto or whatnot. On any case, I&#39;m not so much interested in debating whether or not the driver is a &quot;terrorist&quot;, so much as examining how trendy &quot;terrorist&quot; has become  and the potential implications of such . I am for peace and I do not have a political stance in this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you consider this disaster has the effect of potentially keeping protesters away from white nationalist rallies lest they get mowed down by a loose cannon, it fits the definition of terrorism very well. While it&#39;s hard to know whether or not this guy drove to Charlottesville with the intention of killing &quot;commies&quot; (and I find it hard to easily accept this was the case-- hence the 2nd degree murder charge/vehicular manslaughter), intent is somewhat secondary to the effect produced. </p>

Beyond this death driver bullshit it didn&#39;t look like anyone was going to actually die from Saturday, but I&#39;m thinking if cops rolled in full force that would definitely happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Ha, that&#39;s a tough one! My point is not to debate whether he is a terrorist but to examine how quickly we use that. How about lone psycho? I guess the issue comes down to motive. I have not heard a statement of his intent or motive. It&#39;s mostly speculation so far, but people are conditioned for &quot;terrorist&quot; as a go to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What makes you think that?</p>

<p>Who has been called a terrorist just for disagreeing with the official narrative? Just a couple of examples will suffice.</p>

<p>Regarding your second point: if you&#39;re saying that more laws dealing with terrorism are unnecessary, I agree. Murder, violence, and threats are already handled by the law pretty well. But I don&#39;t see many people clamoring for &quot;much stricter&quot; types of security, so I also wonder what makes you think that we are on the verge of laws with &quot;outrageous&quot; punishments for terrorism.</p>

Once we are conditioned for loose definitions (they are already pretty loose) watch how people disappear.
