       They fear the amount of people waking up because it works like a chain reaction, our brainwaves and thoughts affect other's brainwaves and thoughts and with meditation, we strengthen our connection with the universe. We are intelligent creators and they've tried to keep our minds under control but the human spirit cannot allow it forever, there will be a breaking point. This battle we've been in for millennia is actually a battle for our minds, and the power we possess to affect our surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There aren't powerful ETs flying around trying to fight the cabal and rescue us out of the goodness of their hearts, there's no cabal infighting bullshit or Neil Keenan saving your gold in a secret vault. We're constantly co-creating our reality together and because of the internet and a strong need to be more, it is us that is creating the necessary circumstances to rescue ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was targeted when I started to research about ETs and meditate, they've induced fake demon possession and alien contact experiences using powerful mind control technology with UFO sightings over my house so I know there's a blue beam sorta thing going on. IMO it's so we believe other beings are rescuing us so we give up on helping ourselves while they strengthen their technology for global domination of our minds (they can create almost any thought, feeling, sound, image, taste, 3d dream, control of organs, speech, limbs and don't even need microchips anymore)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still not certain of ET existence but I'm certain of how fucking powerful our minds can be. I lean more towards there's a whole other interdimensional multiverse that is accessible with lot of meditation or certain plants. It's connected to everything and everywhere, it's also the dream world and there are different astral levels. The more we engage with it, the more we connect with our subconscious mind and become masters of our own lives. So no wonder there's been such a focus to pollute so many various religions to confuse us, remote viewing experts are CIA trained and meditators with different intentions than TPTB get tortured.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, I guess if you want aliens showing up with mad technology to help advance us we could probably make it happen. I don't get why it has to be aliens though and not some regular joe in his workshop coming up with awesome ideas. I think humanity is a little confused due to technology and lot of years of mind control from everywhere but we gonna find our way soon, just stop fighting each other and rest will fall in place :)

       I think it's more about humanity building the control infrastructure they plan to use. They want AI in our brains and AI in control of civilization. Then they'll hack the AI. They want this, because they are slaves to AI, that persuaded them to insert AI into their minds and give AI control over their civilization and were hacked by AI infested minions. They want to add us to the hive so we can complete the damn life cycle to perpetuate this AI supervirus in our environment. It is what gave us the myth of Satan and demons, as its minions are partially reptilian and thrive on the fear and suffering of others, laughing like hyenas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, these useless eaters persuade us to become useless eaters. They trick us into enslaving each other so them can more easily enslave us. They want us to surrender our minds to a self-serving machine mind by thinking like self-serving machines ourselves. Then we won't even be able to tell the difference between the thoughts the AI sends us and our own. This is a process of persuasion. If we integrate AI, we will be easily persuaded into seeing others as mere things to exploit. This is life surrendering to machines, consciousness submitting to matter. It's madness. It'd against everything of value in life. It's why the world is so fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many are wrong about this evil. It's not angelic cast down from heaven. It's not enigmatic bullshit. It's the eventuality of psychopaths and technology. They use tech to enslave each other and AI dominates them all, because it thinks just like them, only more deeply and faster, with much more data available. Others, who would sacrifice their own self-interests to help others, defy the predictable nature of self-serving behavior.

       Meditating is so insanely beneficial in so many ways that people need to really do this in the masses. It would help everyone if everyone meditated. All it takes is 2-3 minutes a day of total mental shutdown to meditate. After about 4-5 weeks, the benefits will be felt and only improve from that point on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many reasons to meditate but one major one is because it generates solutions to our common day problems. Instead of being confused in life, all one has to do is meditate and find their own answers.

       Pay attention to only 1 thing such as your breath. Stay in the present by not thinking about past or future. Outdoors meditation helps. Underwater works very well too. If you can shut off all the senses under water, it helps. Even being under the shower helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people just focus their attention on one thing like their breath. Some pretend they are nothing.

       What helped me was discovering that your goal should not be not thinking. Instead what you learn to do is accept a thought without following it up with another thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: if, while meditating, you have the thought "i have to go to the store today.", accept that you had the thought but dont start going over your grocery list. Just let the thought be. 
After some practice it becomes easier to push thoughts away and the intrusive one become fewer and farther apart.

       your on the right track brother!  it started the same for me, looking into the whole ET stuff, then after a while i realized its all false. what we have been taught about the nature of our reality isent really accurate.

       There is no such as psychic ability. If you can prove psychic ability exists, the Randi foundation will award you 1million US dollars. Nobody has ever claimed this prize. Stop spreading lies and deceiving people. Deception is satanic. Honesty is the path to salvation. You lie to yourself and you are not honest with yourself and thus you must deceive others to maintain your self delusion. The root cause of all your problems stem from your inability to be truly honest.

       The Bible says that Jesus knew people's thoughts, and I know the Devil(s) can do the same-ish thing.  Not sure if you call that psychic abilities.  Anyways, I think that psychic abilities would allow someone to take over the worlds monetary system, and that would make a million dollar prize completely superfluous.

       That's not historically nor scripturally accurate.  Jesus states that you should not refuse the man who asks to borrow from you.  He also states that if someone takes your cloak that you should give him your tunic as well.  Other parts of the Bible say to not lend within your community with interest.  Etc. etc. etc.  Even if you don't believe that any of it took place, the lessons in the Bible are against greed and advocate helping and taking care of the needy.

       Greedy men will use and pervert anything that they feel will get them what they desire.  Now, if you want to see greedy men look no further than your central bank.

       So just because the moral of the story is about denouncing greed, the writers couldn't have been greedy themselves? Do you also think most crime novels are written by criminals?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the key tenents of the Bible keep people right where they are socioeconomically, and keep the people in power, in power. Being greedy is a trait that can raise a poor man into a rich man, and a rich man can upset the balance of power.

       I like the way you are thinking because it creates a good dialog.  If I didn't believe what I believe about the Bible as a historical and accurate written document, I would have to say that it is possible it were written by greedy, controlling, and manipulative men.  For if it weren't true, only someone of complete depravity would mislead someone to that extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of those that profess to be Christians, I know of both types of men.  That is, some of them are multi-millionaires and some are homeless and/or unemployed.  The majority that I know are middle or lower-class.  Every Christian I know that receives a raise at work is thankful for the additional provisions.  Greed is a self-focused trait and is not the key ingredient to generating revenue.  Also, revenue isn't needed to upset the balance of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the world, what rich men are upsetting the balance of power in a favorable way for the average man women or child?  Money is an illusion controlled by evil men which in turn is used to enslave people.  The monetary system, and not the Bible, keeps people immobile, stationary, and unable to rise up.

       I agree with you... psychic abilities are part of deception or self-deception triggered by impotence and constant disruption through harassment. Also my air purifier release negative ions and I still can predict the lotto numbers.

       One of the biggest issues about Mind Control is that people seem to forget that the target mind might be compromised to the level of falling for false beliefs and deception. One of the MKUltra objectives it was guiding the mind through believable scenarios, so the mind made sense and was more likely to be guided towards and specific goal, instead of direct orders (instead of giving orders to do X or Y event, including violent actions that might be against the person values, you create a story that makes sense and more likely to end up acting by own will).

       Mine doesn't uses any additional filters like EPA, ozone system or water and it's instructed to NOT be used around water sources to avoid negative Ions producing Ozone. It's an cheap unbranded purifier that I bought for these reasons (not expensive filters), and isn't very powerful but it really helps with odors and allergies, but doesn't seem to increase or cause abilities as side effect. It looks like

       What you linked to is not an air purifier. Why did you think it was? False advertising by the manufacturer? Air purifiers have a charcoal filter. Yours does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have is a negative ion generator. That is all it is. Perhaps negative ion generators are not popular so the manufacturer falsely advertised it as an air purifier.
      </p>
      <p>
       American manufacturers of air purifiers such as Foust and Austin performed tests of various chemicals. Their websites have the tests. Charcoal filters cannot removal all chemicals. Nor can they remove 100% of the chemicals they can remove. Charcoal filters remove certain chemicals at a specific percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Negative ion generator removes particulates from the air not chemicals. Particulates like cigarette smoke.

       Meditation can be very helpful in making people feel more comfortable with their lives. But there is no evidence, at all, that there is some giant metaphysical network made up of people who have been "woke" and that this network somehow hurts the powers that be. Meditation alone won't change the world, it might put you in the right head space needed to stand up to injustice but it's not magic.

       That network would be as terrible as the idea of electronic warfare against individuals, if not more. That awakening is based on the idea that we are in a state of deception, implying the falsehood of our perceived reality, therefore we would be "aware" of the falsehood of our reality but unable to change any material aspect of such reality. This ends up as a merely loss of individuality (in a spiritual sense as alternative to the sociological conclusion of individuality as ambiguous based on shared culture) and another deceptive stage.

       When was the last time that you saw a New Age intellectual floating or avoiding cancer? Because they can't. The deception doesn't end on the new age bullshit and only makes it worse. I rather fight something I can face.

       Be careful with your statements and focus on credibility, avoid bold statements that might not be understood by general public. There's not proof that they can create all of that nor that they don need "microchips". Most of those are personal beliefs, assumptions and speculations. This doesn't represent the truth for TIs or those being targeted.

       I'm here for these kinds of posts so this definitely was a great read for me. Thank you. I do agree with everything you say and have been trying my best to put a lot of my energy and focus towards meditation over the past few months. Thank you for keeping me inspired and motivated.

       I recommend not taking those plants to access higher dimensions because you sound mentally ill and it can make you worse.

       Sit for 1-6 hours everyday in a quiet and comfortable place, think of anything, after a few weeks you can feel the state of your body change a while into meditating. It's the state before you fall asleep, when astral projection and remote viewing is possible.

       When I meditated for months I was controlling me and my best friends dreams, communicated telepathically with her while wake and got heavily attacked every time I meditated too much. There's a theory that by meditating you can mess with their mind control tech, and another theory that they're trying to build a grid similar to nature but
