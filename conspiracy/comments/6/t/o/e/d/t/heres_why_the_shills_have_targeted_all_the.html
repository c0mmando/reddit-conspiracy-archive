        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Thanks to the lack of real news on TV and a lack of real investigative work in agencies like the FBI, the people were forced to reform themselves into a collective intelligence agency and news media network. </p>

<p>Investigations: Everyone from r/conspiracy to 4chan is constantly running group investigation to get to the bottom of the truth. Thanks to these subs, we finally have investigative agencies investigating even the biggest criminals of the cabal. All this dirt we found on them has essentially buried their reputation among all people except for the sleepers.</p>

<p>News Media: The only place one can find real news nowadays are in forums like r/conspiracy or other major conspiracy forums. Many people put in a little bit of journalism work and all those bits of work have turned these subs into endless real news stations that anyone can tune into at any time of day. </p>

<p>Since the people are running both of these collectively, we are able to pump new information from current investigations right into the real media network we control giving people real news in real time. </p>

<p>This is some serious power. We have been able to unmask the &quot;wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing&quot; rulers such as Soros, Rothschild, Clinton, Bush, Kissinger, and many other psychopaths in power and expose them to the masses. Essentially, we collectively put a foot up the cabal&#39;s ass and it all happened suddenly. </p>

<p>This is why they are pumping all that money into hiring shills to go spread disinformation all over the place because they know what we are doing to them is working. They can&#39;t even run a proper false flag anymore because we will simply use all existing forensic evidence to recreate the story of what really happened and expose it to the masses. That false flag in Virginia was essentially Soros digging his own grave by underestimating the people&#39;s abilities. </p>

<p>We can even name this something like the &quot;People&#39;s Intelligence Agency&quot; and the &quot;People&#39;s News Network&quot; to create some kind of buzz word across social media and generate new recruits to join the cause. </p>

<p>We should all really be grateful to Al Gore for releasing the internet technology to us so that we could organize ourselves like this against the cabal. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This question is almost ridiculously broad, so far to be useless. This is what I mean by nuance.</p>

<p>But yes, in general I believe the outlets that <em>you would describe</em> as the single entity named &quot;MSM&quot; tend to broadly report the truth as they see it, mostly disinforming by omitting information.</p>

<p>The incentives towards lying are more closely visible in what you might call conspiracy media, where assumptions take the place of facts, and <em>generally</em> speaking negative views of media reports are coloured by bias and inherent hostility.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend reading a wide variety of sources and staying away from TV entirely.</p>

<p>CSM, WSJ, WaPo, NYT for US news.</p>

<p>Le Monde, BBC, and the Economist for more broad global perspectives.</p>

<p>This is only what works for me.</p>

<p>The world is <em>not as simple as you pretend it is in this thread</em></p>

<p>You know this already.</p>

<p>Let me ask - when you ask if news is &quot;real&quot;, what do you mean?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question is the root of the problem. Blanketing a large segment aims to attribute negative aspects from one outlet to another through the transitive property. For instance I doubt many would defend CNN from exaggerating, sensationalizing, and twisting facts. Same could be said of Fox News. However, I would rank WaPo as rigorous in telling the truth and reliable for anonymous sources while pushing a narrative in their opinion pieces that one needs to be aware off.</p>

<p>I do not equate WaPo to CNN. Your question personifies this by not allowing individual outlet opinion. I also think its a tool by those in executive power to blunt WaPo revelations by using discredits of CNN for instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I submit something to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or post something to it, I invariably get Zionists responding to me with the racist Zionist Narrative, and when this happens I quite naturally don&#39;t want to waste my time pretending that they are interested in having any kind of dialog, so I simply block them, saving myself the harassment they would throw my way.  This has proven to be an invaluable aid to me in keeping the shit out of my mailbox.  I heartily recommend this strategy to anyone who does not want racist Zionist crap in their mailbox.</p>
