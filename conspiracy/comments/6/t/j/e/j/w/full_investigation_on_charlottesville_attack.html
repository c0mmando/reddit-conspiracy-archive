        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay after the last thread was almost instantly brigaded we made the decision to wait before posting the sum of all the evidence gathered.</p>

<p>So here it is.</p>

<p>We start with the actual location of the attack.</p>

<p>Here is the view that the driver would have had while driving down the street:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/myLHVgp.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/myLHVgp.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the points that people are making is asking why he did not turn left or right at this &quot;intersection&quot; and chose to continue forward where the crowd was.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the view to the right:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XePEith.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/XePEith.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the view to the left:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vV3stzv.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/vV3stzv.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Street view of location:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As you can see these were not streets and were full of shops. This would make a prime target for an individual who meant to run over pedestrians. But not someone who was actually trying to drive on city streets and get where he was going.</p>

<p>He had no choice once at this point to continue forward.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, as to why this individual had reason to believe he would safely be able to drive down this street while the street was occupied by the crowd.</p>

<p>This drone video clearly shows two other occupied vehicles on the same street, who have just been overtaken by the crowd. One maroon van and one light colored convertible. The light colored convertible being the car he rear ended.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is a view from the ground of inside the maroon van after it is hit showing the occupants exiting the van.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0h5xNLY.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0h5xNLY.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Oddly... at the point of impact there is nobody in the drivers seat. But the van is occupied:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9r5mNSo.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/9r5mNSo.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is something that I have no explanation for...</p>

<p>So Mr Fields vehicle was not the only vehicle being driven down that street.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, the question is. What made Mr Fields decide to accelerate and hit the crowd. </p>

<p>The Hill reporter Taylor Lorenz claimed to have spoken to police.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz">https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz</a></p>

<p>First claims that the driver is claiming not to have acted maliciously but was attacked and acted out of fear.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Second claims that the car was attacked by people with bats.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now... in the many videos on the scene there is clear evidence of not only people with bats present. But approaching and attacking his vehicle PRIOR to him striking the crowd.</p>

<p>In the video from up the street we see a momentary flash of the brake lights as it crosses the speed table:</p>

<p>Real time:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UKTejKC.gif">http://i.imgur.com/UKTejKC.gif</a></p>

<p>Slowed down:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/nPbFJn3.gif">http://i.imgur.com/nPbFJn3.gif</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the car passes this point the brake lights are off again. This means the car is either accelerating or idling down hill toward the crowd.</p>

<p>Here is an image of an armed man approaching the vehicle. Notice the car is clear of the crowd and the individual is using the bat in a cane like fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TUSuFl2.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TUSuFl2.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the same individual stepping out behind the car and striking the vehicle with said bat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jRps8Y9.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/jRps8Y9.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not that the car is traveling at a slow enough rate of speed for the individual to approach the car, and swing at the back of it making contact as the individual drives by. Also notice that the individual in the green hat is acting extremely casual up until this point. His hands are even in his pockets. It is only once the vehicle makes contact does he raise his hands in horror realizing what has occurred. </p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>The image below is incorrect saying that there is evidence that the dent in back was caused by a protester striking the vehicle.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence of this dent being caused by a protester.</p>

<p>The first strike of a club by the protester is shown in front of the vehicle initially while vehicle is braking:</p>

<p><strong>Here is the correct time line for the image of the initial striker:</strong></p>

<p>Before initial strike on video initial striker pointed by red arrow:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RFiZOUW.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/RFiZOUW.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initial strike on video here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pKUmzYY.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/pKUmzYY.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There is no evidence to show the initial dent circled was caused by a protester on the scene</strong></p>

<p>Now, there is even more evidence showing that multiple people were on the scene armed with bats, clubs and sticks and attacked the vehicle.</p>

<p>Here is the vehicle being set upon after rear ending the light colored convertible from earlier.</p>

<p>Clearly showing two individuals attacking the car:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hLHOJuy.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/hLHOJuy.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a third individual approaching with a bat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/otKAO7e.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/otKAO7e.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a fourth individual shown with a stick as he backs away:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/usrhWum.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/usrhWum.jpg</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These images lend credence to the reporter&#39;s statements to say that the individual acted out of fear after his vehicle was set upon by a large crowd armed with bats.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now. These events from the point in which he crossed the intersection and struck the first pedestrian occurred in a total of six seconds. While we have the luxury of multiple days to judge the decisions made here this young man had a very short window of time. From realizing he was unable to turn away from the crowd to his vehicle being approached by the first armed individual. </p>

<p>Notice he does not target anyone on the sidewalk and he does not target anyone before the first strike of the bat and after he gets clear of the crowd. Note he even slightly swerves to the right to avoid the first individual approaching the vehicle with the weapon.</p>

<p>There are no reports that the individual attempted to flee the police or even resist arrest. These do not seem to be the actions of a malicious terrorist or someone attempting to maximize death and damage.</p>

<p>These seem like the actions of someone unfamiliar with the area and a panicked flee from a large group of individuals with multiple of them being armed.</p>

<p>This is not all the evidence gathered in the past 24 hours. Just the results of what we&#39;ve done on a small and isolated image board away from people who tend to derail conversations.</p>

<p>We are now attempting to get this investigation out to the general public though we fully expect to be brigaded and shilled into oblivion. If you see or read this please share or spread the information.</p>

<p>Please share any further information.</p>

<p><strong>If you only watch a single thing, please watch the bolded video below showing highlights and a break down. But please read the entirety of the post and evidence before jumping to conclusions or passing judgement.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of jumping through hoops you&#39;ve done to try and alleviate the guilt from this murdered is nothing short of disgusting.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why you&#39;re disgusting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surely if he wanted to hit people he would&#39;ve turned into this street</p>

<p>A Twitter account claiming &quot;some officers&quot; think something is now irrefutable evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You took a screenshot of the car in motion with someone with a bat nearby and claim it&#39;s evidence he was being attacked prior as if that makes it OK to fucking run down people you fucking piece of shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are not the actions of a murdering terrorist. But a person placed between an armed crowd and an individual attacking his vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re a disgusting person and I sincerely hope you voice your concerns verbally so someone can kick your ass.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the conclusion you&#39;ve reached from the evidence I&#39;ve posted those are your own.</p>

<p>I made no such conclusion. Only to say that the vehicle was struck by approached and struck by a bat prior to him hitting anyone.</p>

<p>If you believe that alleviates this individual from guilt don&#39;t project that on me. My post makes no reference to his guilt or innocence. It only takes reports from a journalist and checks that up against evidence from the scene,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you are being wilfully ignorant.</p>

<p>It is easy to go with the majority - but where is the harm in looking into the issue? </p>

<p>We should expect all investigations to be fair and unbiased - nobody should bow down just because they feel like they are drowning in the sea of screams - &quot;FASCIST WHITE NATIONALIST NAZI SCUM!&quot;</p>

<p>Just because there is hysteria around the issue doesn&#39;t mean we should stick our heads in the sand like the rest of America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.</p>

<p>You can clearly see the guy hit the back of his car with a baseball bat - just saying. That is enough in itself for someone to panic.</p>

<p>Yes i agree it was most likely intentional, but i expect the same level of scrutiny for all investigations. Lets not jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>Why the fuck are you being willfully ignorant? That person takes a swing at the back of his car AS HE IS SPEEDING INTO PEOPLE. That guy isn&#39;t swinging the pole at the car 10, 15, 20&#39;seconds before impact. It&#39;s literally as impact with people is about to happen. </p>

<p>Suspend your MUH FASCIST rage for a moment. How fucking stupid would this guy have to be to drive head-first into a crowd / car, what did he think the end-game would be?</p>

<p>At best he would be beaten and his car would be smashed up. At worst he could be killed by the protesters / thrown in jail for life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just exploring all avenues, you are not. End of conversation, i am not convinced you are even genuinely invested in finding out the truth here. Go back to your circlejerk subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re at best/at worst scenario doesn&#39;t hold up. He wanted to hit people with his car. His &quot;best&quot; is exactly what happened. He got what he wanted. </p>

<p>And again, you are being disingenuous about him panicking. The contact from the pole swing and the contact with the first body are within a second of each other. If the pole swing had taken place in the beginning of the video when his tires screech your thought process would be more believable. But the pole swing came as he was driving into the crowd and people were already screaming and dodging. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry that your racist reasoning and logic is being absolutely clobbered right now, but there are no &quot;circlejerk&quot; subreddits for me cupcake. My home is here. I roll with evidence and sound logic. You roll with &quot;well what about this&quot; and bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will not waste my time with a racist troll. You can find all of that stuff very easily. The links to the direct images are all from online news articles that have been written in the last day about Charlottesville. I simply just included the image because I figured looking at the article would be too complicated for you. If you want to educate yourself and stop being a racist troll you can right click and search the image to verify that they all came from Charlottesville in the last 48 hours. I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t, but that&#39;s fine. If you want to deny that those things are all from Charlottesville (hint, they are), there&#39;s nothing else I can do. This won&#39;t be productive. Karma will come around my friend.</p>

<p>Full investigation? That is a load of bullshit and nonsense. You did not bother to do any follow-up research on the tweets from Taylor Lorenz, The Hill reporter. I will save you the trouble because she ruins your silly, false narrative.</p>

<p>Are you dense? You continue to offer up her tweets as evidence that &quot;the driver is claiming not to have acted maliciously but was attacked and acted out of fear.&quot;</p>

<p>No where did Taylor Lorenz make that claim. She specifically stated in regard to her deleted tweet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>As I said before, these two officers who I spoke to did not witness the scene and had not yet watched any videos of what happened.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/896817229999857667">https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/896817229999857667</a></p>

<p>In other words, her claim that the driver was attacked was based on statements from two officers who were not at the scene and had not seen the video. What part do you not understand?</p>

<p>The reason she deleted the tweets was due to low information people like you who did not read her follow-up tweets.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: You cite deleted tweets that the original reporter clearly stated were erroneous, but I guess bogus evidence is good enough for your bogus logic.</strong> </p>

<p>No, you fail to link to the follow-up tweet because it destroys your bogus narrative.</p>

<p>Thanks for conceding that you are reporting erroneous information as fact (even though you knew better). Of course the purpose of your post is to prey on other low-information people who will not actually review your half truth research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the threads there are people who disagreed with me at first but once I corrected what they thought they upvoted me as well.</p>

<p>This for example:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tjejw/full_investigation_on_charlottesville_attack/dllcvxs/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tjejw/full_investigation_on_charlottesville_attack/dllcvxs/?context=3</a></p>

<p>It was a very small group of people and the majority don&#39;t use reddit. There&#39;s no vote manipulation here.</p>

<p>The thread has about 80 points at 50% upvoted. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something suspicious given the nature of the thread.</p>

<p>If you have something to add to the thread or something that you disagree with I&#39;d be happy to address it or add it. I&#39;m not here trying to prove or disprove anything. Just present the evidence and the more people involved the better.</p>

<p>People have done everything from call me a Nazi to thank me for doing this. I&#39;m not really gaining anything from it other than an attempt at getting to the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a tragedy.  I read whole thread &amp; all comments. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand Mr. Fields plan.  Surely if he was wanting to kill alot of people he would back up then try to run over more people? Wouldn&#39;t there be a more dense section of protestors? Mr. Fields knows what his intent was &amp; probably the police that arrested him.  If he wanted to kill a bunch of people firearms are readily available.  I forgot my guns so I&#39;ll use my charger?</p>

<p>It does almost feel like he got scared/freaked out.  Probably watched too many zombie movies.  Played Grand Theft Auto too much.  Scene reminded me of GTA.</p>

<p>Hate groups are evil.  I don&#39;t think he premeditated this.  If he did premeditate this he is pretty stupid.  Although, Being part of a hate group is pretty stupid.</p>

<p>I feel bad for the dead &amp; injured.  What a tragedy.  I feel bad for Mr. Fields.  He is either a murderer or a 20 year old white supremacist that freaked out in a mob.  Either way this incident will most likely define the rest of his life.  To me 20 is still a kid.  He could have had a full life &amp; learned to love &amp; accept people. </p>

<p>Watching the videos &amp; our court systems.  Depending on what happened when he got arrested.....I think people are emotional &amp; angry &amp; want to believe it was premeditated murder.  But what if it was a freaked out 20 year old? </p>

<p>&amp; the injured &amp; deceased such a sad tragic incident.  I hope the injured heal.  &amp; the families &amp; friends of deceased find solace. </p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid to go to events with crowds these days.  Too much violence.  More dangerous world than it was 20 years ago.</p>

<p>So please present evidence of this claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, why not.  Look at the one video you posted:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn5f5qyf7io">here</a>.   </p>

<p>Two things to note.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the first second (0:00 to 0:01) you get a good picture of the street and sideward before the crowd, completely empty.    </p></li>
<li><p>If you listen to the sound during that one second the car <strong>bottoms outs and tires screech</strong>  because he is hitting the speed bump (or drainage bump) at already a VERY fast speed.  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/myLHVgp.jpg">speed bump seen here where the car is braking</a>.   </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So we know he is already going WAY too fast 100-200 feet before the crowd.  This shit was intentional. </p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>No he braked after the vehicle was struck and before striking the crowd. You don&#39;t hear those same screams in the other video from people on the scene.</p>

<p>Also notice in the first video no one on the road side is alerted to anything.</p>

<p>One man is so casual he even has his hands in his pockets up until the baseball bat strike.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jRps8Y9.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/jRps8Y9.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here is an armed man approaching the vehicle while he is still yards away from the crowd. So casual that he is walking with the bat as a cane.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TUSuFl2.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TUSuFl2.jpg</a></p>

<p>So you seem to be pointing out something that no one on the scene feels alarmed about. A bike casually drives by. A man with his hands in his pockets. Also the sound you here is a drum beat or music playing of some sort. There is no tire screech and nobody on the scene panics until the man is hit with the bat.</p>

<p>So the point in which you claim he accelerates is BEFORE he is seen hitting the brakes and AFTER he is struck with the bat.</p>

<p>Evidenced here.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>So no one on the street is a target. No one is alert. A man is casually walking up to the car holding the bat in the style of a cane before swinging.</p>

<p>The car is traveling slow enough for the man to step out behind the car and hit it with enough force to cause a large dent in the bumper. The man then attempts to swerve slightly right and hit his brakes. Then the crowd begins to encircle his vehicle in which he hits the gas.</p>

<p>You can hear the engine rev after the car is struck and well after he saw the armed man approach his car.</p>

<p>So you seem to be privy to information that the actual camera man and people feet away from the car are not.</p>

<p>The car was being approached by an armed man and I can count 5 different individuals with bats in the images I&#39;ve posted. </p>

<p>Also that is not a speed bump it would be referenced as a speed table. Which expects people to travel between 25-45 miles an hours. There is nothing to show he bottomed out or the tires screeching. Which is evident by the unpanicked reaction of the bystanders.</p>

<p>Things that I have proven:   </p>

<li><p>The street behind him was empty.   </p></li>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>So yes he was braking. The delay could have been the camera frame or a simple delay in the circuit between light sets. But those are not running lights. They are still images which shows the lights come on AFTER the strike.</p>

<p>Dude please look at the images before you post stuff like this. It&#39;s a waste of time for both of us.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Challenger (in an empty street) begins to accelerate in (or before) the square.   </p></li>

<p>These screams are not heard in the other video and can&#39;t tell the source of these screams are because of the vehicle or the people who are stepping out to strike it.</p>

<p>Two to three protesters try to hit the car. </p>

<p>I only see one attempting to strike the vehicle before he hits people. But I count four more after.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The car does a final acceleration into the protesters. </p>

<p>Yes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Protesters attack the man who literally tried to murder them. </p>

<p>Attempted to hit them. I can&#39;t tell you his intention was to kill or to flee.</p>

<p>The only innocents here were the driver and the people on the far left and far right of the car hugging the sidewalk and staying out of its way.</p>

<p>They were never in any danger because the car did not swerve to the sides to injure people, Fields was approaching the intersection to avoid violence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the only motivation I had to even take a second look. Sure enough, people attacked with bats.</p>

<p>What he&#39;s guilty of is not what I&#39;ve insinuated. But it wouldn&#39;t seem he randomly drove his car into a group of nonviolent people. </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But doesn&#39;t scream domestic terrorist Nazi white supremacist looking to attack people. But may be a case of freaked out mentally ill dumbass making stupid decisions when faced with an armed group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I don&#39;t see the brake lights on at any time in fact. The only time I see the brake lights on are in the higher quality images.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already considered this and other users have pointed this out. I don&#39;t even see the brake lights on when he attempted to reverse in which he had to have had on to change gears right?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t switch to reverse without hitting the brakes. So my conclusion there is the camera in that case is not high enough quality to catch the lights on.</p>

<p>The video you link isn&#39;t loading for me. But if you can see the brake lights in it post a screen shot. </p>

<p>But because I can&#39;t see the brake lights on as he changes gear suggests that the camera is not of high enough definition to catch it while it&#39;s further away.</p>

<p>Even when it&#39;s 10 feet away you can barely see the lights on as your screen shot suggests.</p>

<p>Would you like me to include that screen shot in the post?</p>

<p>Showing he hit the brakes as he passed through the speed table?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes exactly!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned this a few times in previous comments. Once someone does this calculation I&#39;d be happy to post it. I do have the video on the original post.</p>

<p>But once the car is too far I can&#39;t see the brake lights even when he begins to reverse which the brake lights must be on.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t see it from the video. If your screen is higher definition than mine at the moment please take a screen shot and I&#39;ll post it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not trying to be dense here just really want accurate information. I&#39;ve made a bunch of edits already thanks to the work of many users and my only interest is the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I see in the first few seconds definitely just as it passes over the speed table.</p>

<p>I can post the screen shot of that. It&#39;s further down the street that I&#39;m concerned about. Just before he hits the crowd. I know he hit the brakes at least twice once further down but it just isn&#39;t visible while in the distance. So I can&#39;t tell how long they hit the brakes or when.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The braking happening in the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RFiZOUW.jpg">photo</a> is the same that is seen on the <a href="https://streamable.com/fe25r">video</a>. I&#39;m assuming it is because of the bump at the begginning of the street. The perspective on the photo is misleading. The driver has already stopped braking after the first &quot;no parking&quot;-sign next to the motorcycles as seen on the video. Look at the street view how far away that is from the second &quot;no parking&quot;-sign(where the car is hit with a stick)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The image I&#39;ve pointed out with the red arrow is the same person in both, If you watch the video you can see him on the side of the road taking the swing.</p>

<p>But once the car is far enough down the road in the video we cannot see the brake lights clearly at all.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="/u/voatsuckz">/u/voatsuckz</a></p>

<p>We have this image showing him brake in the video passing the speed table but the video is not clear enough to show the second brake down the street:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/nPbFJn3.gif">http://i.imgur.com/nPbFJn3.gif</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately once the car travels too far we are unable to get a clear picture of the brake lights when they are on and off. Though by the image posted we know he hit the brakes at least twice after that.</p>

<p>One if the image and of course again to change gears to reverse. Neither of these can be seen on the video unfortunately.</p>

<p>In a larger sense this is literally six seconds of video that we&#39;re analyzing from multiple angles so just the amount of footage and images we have is quite a blessing to those trying to piece together what happened in that short window.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like you&#39;re trying to say that the driver was acting in self defence when he accelerated into a crowded street full of people. I have watched footage from numerous angles, and that car is traveling at a high rate of speed down that street and in the seconds immediately before impact there is nobody attacking that car. </p>

<p>I guess it is possible that someone far out of the camera lens hit his car with something prior to him plowing his car into the crowd. But it&#39;s not as if he was being attacked by an angry mob and accelerated to get away immediately prior to impact, he very clearly was trying to hit a large group of people then even had the presence of mind to put the car in reverse and exit the situation he created.</p>

<p>Notice the individual pointed out is in front as it brakes. Also the lack of alarm of people further back. The people in front are moving out of the way as it brakes. The striker has time to step to the side and even holds the stick as a cane as he walks up. Steps off the curb and swings making contact.</p>

<p>You can hear the contact being made, then acceleration occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about facts but supposing a lot about what&#39;s going on in the guy&#39;s head. In both photos I see people shocked at how fast the guy is going, trying to get out of the way. Earlier where the crowd is less dense, they&#39;re successful because they can make it onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>In one of the videos you linked, you can see that he&#39;s hitting the brakes right after the speed bump (that he possibly didn&#39;t see) bottoms out his suspension. I think hitting the brakes is a pretty standard gut reaction to going over a speed bump too fast, still not convinced he pressed the brakes because there were people in his way.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t make out very well when he finally hits the gas but consider a few options (which support the case that this was intentional)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He presses the gas fully after releasing the brake, but the car is low in some gear and it takes 30-40 feet before the engine revs high enough that we finally hear the noise you&#39;d associate with a car at full throttle (full throttle high revs vs full throttle low revs).</p></li>
<li><p>He intended to stay at a relatively slow speed until he got close to the crowd so that fewer people noticed his intent. Fewer people noticing means more people in the street for him to hit if that&#39;s his goal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is speculation.... How do you know his intent???</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way you could know this man... That&#39;s not what this is about here. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t say that for sure and neither can you.</p>

<p>Is the guy that is almost hit in the first one The guy that is all way on the back of the second one with the camera in hand. </p>

<p>Also if the car is moving at that rate of speed how does the guy with the selfie stick get from the middle of the road to the side walk pretty much against the wall in the second.</p>

<p>I have no intention of defending a murderer or sympathizing with Nazis. I just want to know what really happened.</p>

<p>And all we have is literally about 15 seconds of video from multiple angles to get to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a Nazi of course. Also it looks like the kid comes from a Jewish mother. Didn&#39;t post that in the main post because it&#39;s not proven. But maiden name of Meyer and possible synagogue attendance. If I can find total evidence or a picture I could get that. Just not going to make the claim, only state that part.</p>

<p>But I have no reason to believe he&#39;s a Nazi or a Nazi sympathizer. Unless you have that evidence.</p>

<p>You could always present that.</p>

<p>I have some screen shots from the rally which shows he was possibly there. But I can&#39;t confirm it&#39;s him so I&#39;m not posting it. I&#39;m not making claims until I get evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, first, nice work on the research. </p>

<p>I want to point out that the damage to the back of the car was there before that boy with the club struck it so either someone else hit it or the damage was old.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s a split just under the white light of the vehicle, not sure if it&#39;s supposed to be there or if it&#39;s more damage.</p>

<p>Your pic pointing out the damage:-</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/G5VdEDJ.jpg</a></p>

<p>Your pic of the boy/man about to strike the car with his club/stick - you can see the damage is already there:-</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/E3NoqnU.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/E3NoqnU.jpg</a></p>

<p>I think you could be right about this guy being panicked and this work should be reported to the DoJ who are now investigating it. It could be the difference between premeditated murder and manslaughter. </p>

<p>Also to others here who are angry (which is very understandable considering a girl is now dead) and have their virtual pitchforks out ready to condemn this boy to murder one and execution, just remember, he&#39;s only 20 and at that age they&#39;re still a bit dumb. This doesn&#39;t excuse his actions but jumping to conclusions and calling for the noose doesn&#39;t help anyone. </p>

<p>My personal conclusions from what I&#39;ve seen and read so far is this event was bound to happen, if not here then elsewhere and people have been warning about it nearly this whole year. Different groups actually being funded and individuals being paid to agitate rallies, along with the MSM on a ramped up hysterical 24/7 propaganda loop for at least 12months are the real people to be blamed. This is where the focus for anger and protest should be. I believe it is solely due to these entities that the growth of hate and violence from both sides is fully to blame and not the individuals caught up in it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem, the armed man is approaching the vehicle AFTER he started accelerating to the crowd, the screenshot you posted is someone recording the car as it was approaching them so surely he already started his intentional act of harming others long before any armed man approached him.

<p>You already did, the picture and the videos are of the car which has already started going into the crowd, why do you think people had open mouths and recording this as if they knew what the guy was going to in the future?</p>

<p>Look at your BEFORE STRIKE PIC - look at the guy on the extreme right with his mouth WIDE OPEN - he is in awe of what already happened, the strike came AFTER just as you say, so how is it possible that the strike was the reason for the ram through? It&#39;s impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...okay so if you took a still shot from any video you could make almost anyone make any expression. Come on... if your evidence is based on the fact that you can read faces from a still shot than that&#39;s not good enough.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not going to say &quot;oh hey look at this picture he looks shocked&quot; it&#39;s not enough.</p>

<p>But we are not talking about the video screenshot, we are talking about the pic you posted saying it was the BEFORE STRIKE pic - the guy is looking at the car has a WTF expression, most people are looking at the car because it has ALREADY ramming into people. This proves that the STRIKE had NOTHING to do with why the guy decided to ram through, he was already ramming through and the STRIKE was a reaction, not an initiation.</p>

<p>Even with the video, you can see that people who are taking the video saying WTF expressions, you can see surprised people staring at the car including the person who took the video. Clearly, the Nazi  planned this, it was not a reactive murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was out of town when this happened so this is literally the first concise explanation I&#39;ve seen, and I have two major issues:</p>

<p>First, you explain in great deal why the driver didn&#39;t seem to have acted maliciously until being set upon by the crowd. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzpQEQZNLng">This video</a> however seems to show the car barreling towards the crowd, without slowing down, long after the few frames of break lights you showed.</p>

<p>Secondly, you posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Weg3fP0lZmE">this video</a>. If I want to give the dirver the benefit of the doubt, I have two questions: why was he driving so fast into the crowd, and why did he reverse so damn quickly. He coudl have gotten away by backing up at 10 mph, but he fucking floored it.</p>

<p>I read everything you wrote, but when faced with the full videos at the bottom of your post I realized your description is a far, far stretch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heyer’s cause of death was blunt force injury to the chest, according to the Central District Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond.</p>

<p>The manner of Heyer’s death is still pending, a representative with the office said Monday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this means they are waiting to say it was the car which caused the blunt force injury. I suppose other candidates might be...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>she tripped and fell forward and smacked her chest on the pavement</p>

<p>she collapsed and her patellas smacked her sternum (although with a gut like hers I&#39;m not sure how feasible this is)</p>

<p>paramedics crushed her chest trying to revive her from the heart attack, ultimately killing her</p>

<p>she fell and was trampled by the crowd</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before going down these roads, I am really interested in knowing who specifically in the CDO of the CME said &quot;blunt force injury to the chest&quot; was CoD and what the exact evidence of this was.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve no doubt she has blunt force injuries to her chest, the efforts of the paramedics trying to revive her would have caused this. I want to know if there were injuries that could not have been caused by the paramedics, or could not have been caused by falling/collapsing, and how exactly they established such injuries to be the CoD and not simply being an obese smoker out on a hot day in a crowd of active people frightened because someone fought back against her violent gang.</p>

<p>But we are not talking about the video screenshot, we are talking about the pic you posted saying it was the BEFORE STRIKE pic - the guy is looking at the car has a WTF expression, most people are looking at the car because it has ALREADY ramming into people. This proves that the STRIKE had NOTHING to do with why the guy decided to ram through, he was already ramming through and the STRIKE was a reaction, not an initiation.</p>

<p>Even with the video, you can see that people who are taking the video saying WTF expressions, you can see surprised people staring at the car including the person who took the video. Clearly, the Nazi  planned this, it was not a reactive murder.</p>
