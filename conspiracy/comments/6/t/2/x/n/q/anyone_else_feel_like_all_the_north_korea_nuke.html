       Well trump has been saying 'fire and fury' if north korea makes a move. So it's saying self defence. Also there's no real difference between fire and fury and shock and awe in terms of the idea behind it

       This all started from a Washington post article at the beginning of the week that said North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on a missile and launch it to the United States. It isn't like trump just, out of the blue, started threatening North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been able to put a nuke on a missile since Obama was in office but they didn't say shit about it then because Obama is "competent"

       no dude, Trump has had a hard on for NORK since he took office
      </p>

       And, even if you're story is literal.....you mean to tell me that the President of the United States is being manipulated into a warmongering furor by a WaPo article?

      <p>
       Partly true.  They have not been able to put a warhead on an ICBM until very recently.  There's a difference between the warheads they would put on a mid-range missle vs what they would have to use for an ICBM
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all beside the point......no one is forcing Trump to run his mouth.  In fact, his threats would carry a lot more weight if he wasn't constantly talking shit

       It's not a "hard on"... every president for the last 50 years has had to deal with North Korea threatening the United States. Trump just wanted make it clear he's not gonna put up with shit right off the bat... which is reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, then CNN picks it up because they have nothing left on the Russia investigation and have to make trump look bad somehow... then that makes national headlines then trump has to say something cause he's trump. There's clearly a pattern here.
      </p>
      <p>
       They still could kill millions of people with a mid range missile Japan and South Korea are both easily in range. Hell, they could even put one on a submarine and launch one at the US from out in the pacific. I'm sure we have defenses in place to prevent that though. But nobody was really concerned about that before because the media did nothing but make Obama look good.

       Again, hias threats would actually matter if he wasn't always talking shit.  No one takes anything he says seriously anymore.  He's cried wolf too many times.  All NORK has to do is keep on saber rattling.  What's Trump going to do about it?

       News came out that Manafort's house was raided by the FBI.  I think that's pretty big news.  You might think it's a nothingburger.  I guess we'll see if Manafort flips or is charged with money laundering

       Trump says something dumb and then people complain that the MSM shows the clips of him saying that dumb thing.  The non-stop Trump apologism is ridiculous.

       What does CNN have to do with the public statements that Trump is sending out to North Korea? North Korea isn't responding to whatever garbage is on CNN, they're responding directly to Trump's threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox News and the conservative media isn't talking about North Korea? Everybody is talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody was concerned before? Dude, Obama fucking told Trump when they met in the White House that North Korea was going to be the biggest challenge facing the United States in the next four years....... North Korea has been a concern for the last 70 years, George Bush labeled them as part of his "axis of evil" speech 15 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue here is that war could potentially kill millions...... This isn't going to be like the second Iraq war. Meanwhile, North Korea has been building nukes and now has the ICBMs to deliver them to far away places....... So how are you going to deal with this? You go to war, millions die...... You do nothing, North Korea gets stronger........ There is no easy solution.

       North Korea isn't responding to trump's threats, North Korea made the threat first like they have been for years, and trump responded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox News is just as hungry for ratings as CNN, and what better way to get attention than fear mongering. All media are in cahoots with each other at the highest level.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can blame trump or Obama or bush or even Clinton, (in fact, Clinton basically screwed us in the 90s with his North Korea nuke deal) but that's for a different time. Bottom line is: people's lives are in danger because of a crazy ass dictator and that sucks. And shit who even knows if we are getting the truth about North Korea the American propaganda machine is strong.

       again, who's force Trump to open his mouth?  Who's forcing him to tweet?

       No one.

       Know what didn't happen?  No one bombed Austin.  Know what else didn't happen?  Obama didn't feel the need to try to convince everyone he was some sort of tough guy.

       No, I think the NK war mongering is parallel to the WMD talk in the leading up to 2003 Iraq invasion. If we go to war, it will be a false flag operation to save a failing presidency.

       You guys wanted the big tough guy who says what he thinks and doesn't give a fuck. What's more chilling than the verbal back and forth (which we've been doing with the Kims since forever) is all the "anti war/anti intervention" people who are frothing themselves over a potential preemptive strike.

       It's a confluence of two things: (1) Trump's rhetoric towards NK
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       objectively more bellicose and less measured/vetted than any other modern president; (2) given his past behavior, Trump isn't being given the benefit of the doubt; (3) the media always has a bias towards forcing stories into existing narratives (Gore the exaggerator, Bush the idiot, Clinton the corrupt) and the narrative on Trump is that he's stupid, belligerent and irresponsible.
