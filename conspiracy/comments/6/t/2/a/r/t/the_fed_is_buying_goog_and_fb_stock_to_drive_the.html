    <div class="md"><p>I would argue that there is no &quot;strong left&quot; bias in either company, but rather &quot;Neoliberal&quot; bias. Google is censoring the far left, including WorldSocialistWebsite and TruthOut, and Naked Capitalism as well. They&#39;re demonetizing progressive YouTube channels as well as conservative ones. It&#39;s an attack on the anti-establishment left and right, not just the right. Google and FB are NOT the Left, the true left are their enemies as well, and are fighting them and the corrupt Corporate Democrats in the DNC. </p>

<p>I&#39;m referring to the versions of leftism that don&#39;t endorse, what may as well be, laissez-faire economic policy that allows the elite class to completely subjugate the rest of the planet. That&#39;s not to say that certain forms of libertarianism don&#39;t support those ideals as well, but the tenets of mainstream libertarianism and the politicians who carry its banner do not, however. </p>

<p>So you no longer support the Democratic Party.  That&#39;s good.  Many Libertarians actually want to limit corporate charters because why should everyone get limited liability by default?  That should be reserved for the public good, as it was in the past.  This way, when a company screws up, the shareholders are on the hook.</p>

<p>That is the best way to reduce corporate power, smash the oligarchy, and restore the republic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bay Area native here. Most my friends I grew up with are gone. Only ones left are the ones who were born into money or who now work for the tech companies. Girlfriends from the east bay and it&#39;s mostly the same for her. A few of her friends are still scrapping by but most have left recently. </p>

<p>The few friends I grew up with now in tech have sadly drunken the SJW cool-aid to fit in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile most of the newer people I&#39;ve befriended in the past 4-5 years I don&#39;t really consider friends anymore. Their corporate loving ideology is beyond insane to the point where they can&#39;t even take care of themselves yet are convinced everyone else are the crazy ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose when I use the terms of &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; I&#39;m referring to the role that people believe government can/should play in our lives as citizens. Corruption crosses ideological lines, and I agree, good and evil are the defining factors of our government at this time. I don&#39;t hate anyone who is a conservative, because they are fellow citizens and human beings. I want a government that works for the people, by the people, so that we can spend our time having debates about how our government should run and function rather than how to destroy the oligarchal class which as currently taken power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of. </p>

<p>I&#39;m from the Bay Area and grew up here. You have to understand that Silicon Valley was founded during and after WW2 with defense contractor money in the first place. The computer industry has always been funded by the Deep State which is why Apple was such a rebel company to startup and disrupt the computing industry without them initially in the 70&#39;s. </p>

<p>Fast forward to modern Silicon Valley and it&#39;s actually the VC firms using Deep State money to control and prop up the industry. </p>

<p>After the economy crashed in 2008, when Obama came into power he printed a bunch of money with the Fed and handed it to his donors the Silicon Valley VC firms. They then invested it to create the modern startup bubble we have now. They needed to create artificial value in the finance markets so they propped up the values of tech companies to fill the gap in the economy. </p>

<p>Thing is these companies have no assets. Their assets are all mostly digital, and it&#39;s mostly our data. Meanwhile many of the companies are money laundering schemes with shady business practices who resell your data regularly. They&#39;re also the surveillance arm of the Deep State and control the majority of the worlds computing power and data centers. </p>

<p>The actual value and revenue of these companies is nothing compared to their valuations. They&#39;re all made up numbers, meanwhile what they&#39;ve done to the housing market and cost of living here is insane. All the small businesses are gone or dying and if you aren&#39;t in the industry you either had to be born into money or struggle and suffer. There&#39;s no middle class anymore, and the transplants who have all moved here in the past 8 years are all indoctrinated and part of the system and depend on it survive so they don&#39;t question it. </p>

<p>Things are pretty fucked up here, it&#39;s still a beautiful place to live but it&#39;s also some kind of Orwellian nightmare. </p>
