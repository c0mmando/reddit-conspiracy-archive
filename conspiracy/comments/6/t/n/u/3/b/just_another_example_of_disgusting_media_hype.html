Thats 0.00000123839% of the US population.  While yes it is a shame that there are people that are that ignorant out there, this isn&#39;t an epidemic.  This isn&#39;t some new uprising we have to combat.  This is a bunch of stupid rednecks making a spectacle of themselves and the media is helping their bullshit cause gain traction.

<p>So 102% of all attendees identify in one of 5 groups? How many people identified as &quot;none&quot;?</p>

<p>Math checks out. I would like to know how the self-identification was determined as well. I am 99% convinced this was more or less composed of these groups though. I am just quibbling.</p>

<p>I wish there was some group that observed things that happened, and then wrote those stories down for other people to read and know what is going on in the world.. Could you imagine such an insane thing?</p>

<p>Jeez, what a world that would be!</p>

<p>There was a couple livestreams, Millie from infowars was there notably</p>

<p>The general gist of the rally is the same as usual. The right on the defense (helmets, shields, etc) and the left on offense (balloons of piss and shit, tear gas, etc) with scuffles when they met.</p>

<p>Police had orders to stand down and you know the rest</p>
