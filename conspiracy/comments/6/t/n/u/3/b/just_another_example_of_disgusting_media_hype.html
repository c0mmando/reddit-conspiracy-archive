       Regardless of false flag accusations or whatever other explanation people have of what happened in Charlottesville, from the sources I could find, an estimated 400 people showed up to the "white Supremacy" rally in VA.  400.  Thats 0.00000123839% of the US population.  While yes it is a shame that there are people that are that ignorant out there, this isn't an epidemic.  This isn't some new uprising we have to combat.  This is a bunch of stupid rednecks making a spectacle of themselves and the media is helping their bullshit cause gain traction.  Stop listening to the MSM and start thinking for yourself.

       I took a day off media, the day this happened as luck would have it. And I have been hesitant to jump into the news stories flying around because of the obvious manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But was this for sure a wholly white supremacist based gathering? This wasn't like a nationalist group that attracted some fringy dregs that always exist on the edge of society, that is being misconstrued as something racist by the media?

       I'm in the same boat. In tempted to think the media tacked 'white supremacist' onto an otherwise regular conservative crowd.

       But OP has a point, its not new and its a wildly small percentage of people.

       And we should remember antifa is also a vanishingly small percentage of the population. Why does it seem like the well meaning people always get dragged into bullshit by these ridiculous minority ideologies? I mean minority as in small numbers here, just to be clear haha.

      <blockquote>

        So 102% of all attendees identify in one of 5 groups? How many people identified as "none"?

      <p>
       Math checks out. I would like to know how the self-identification was determined as well. I am 99% convinced this was more or less composed of these groups though. I am just quibbling.

       I wish there was some group that observed things that happened, and then wrote those stories down for other people to read and know what is going on in the world.. Could you imagine such an insane thing?

       The general gist of the rally is the same as usual. The right on the defense (helmets, shields, etc) and the left on offense (balloons of piss and shit, tear gas, etc) with scuffles when they met.

       I was driving all day Saturday (on the way to the Beach for vacation). Wasn't listening to the radio either (listening to cds). So I was in the same boat as you! Late Saturday night, after getting settled after arriving, I checked the internet and saw that all hell had broken loose!

       I am actually kind of glad. I came into it after all the waves of bullshit had rolled over, and wasn't committed to any part of the story. I think I am going to remember this in the future when something crazy happens, just tune the fuck out for a day and let the dust settle.

       At no point is this rally described or identified as a Nazi or Supremacist rally except for by the media and users here. No one identifies as either one of those in real life. They are epithets that quite literally mean "white people who, like other ethnic groups, express group interests."

       That's been one of the weirdest talking points of the last few days. It's insanely tortured. (The guy you're responding to in particular has been pushing it a lot.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, because they didn't specifically advertise it as White Nationalist Gathering 2017, that magically means that isn't what it was? Hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, no. If you organized an event and a bunch of Nazis showed up, and you didn't tell them to leave or make it clear they are not welcome and don't represent your gathering - if in fact they are a big, loud, prominent,
       <em>
        welcome
       </em>
       part of your gathering, guess what?
      </p>
      <p>
       IT'S A WHITE NATIONALIST EVENT!
      </p>
      <p>
       If these people actually thought their views and beliefs were pure and good and defensible, they wouldn't engage in these mental gymnastics trying to pretend they aren't what they are.

       I didn't say it wasn't a white nationalist event. I said it wasn't a white supremacist event, which it wasn't. Do Vanguard America or whoever organized this identify as white supremacists? No, this is just the epithet placed on them by the media talking heads.

       First:

        Eligibility
       </strong>
       : Any White person (a non-Jewish person of wholly European ancestry) of good character and at least 18 years of age who accepts as his own the goals of the National Alliance and who is willing to support the program described in What is the National Alliance? may apply for membersh

        This is all on their "what we believe page"

       Now I know you'll do some mental gymnastics and be like "they don't specifically say it" so we might as well accept I won't change your mind and that I think you're obviously wrong still.

       It seemed like a lot of idiots on both sides there. Did you notice that after the car ran over people it was immediately attacked by people wielding bats? Why did people have bats? With or without the idiot driver this thing was going to get violent. Violent idiots.

       OP, do you have a link to your source that says there were 400 in attendance? I've heard there were up to 2000 just for the Unite people, but I haven't seen sources for that, either.

       I know, VOX. I looked for a while and no one had any numbers.  Now I went back to that link and it has been edited.  It does mention on a few sites that that picture of the men with the torches that is going every where, there were 100 men at that one.

       Don't discount Vox. They are invested in pushing the leftist narrative and have everything to gain to inflate the number. If they're reporting 400, it's probably close to accurate.

       this is another trying to down play the event and it's fucking gross. pretend, and rationalize all you want this was a nothingburger event. that, oh 400 people is nothing.

       I know 400 people that think their neighborhood is better than other peoples neighborhoods. They shoot and kill each other all the time. There is no media outlet saying that gang is taking over America. It is fear mongering. Mass media causing mass panic. I'm not saying there aren't disgusting people out there that think that way. I'm just saying it doesn't need to be turned into a change of opinions in all Americans. It is a story contorted to fit an already existing agenda.

       and what i'm saying, is that by pushing your narrative, you're disingenuously denying that it means anything. which i do not believe. would you apply this same logic to other groups? blm? muslims? antifa?

       You're missing my whole point. I'm not saying there isn't an issue with white supremacy. I'm saying there is huge issue with the media creating sensational headlines and spinning something like a small protest in a small town into a national epidemic that is going to bring the world to its knees.

       I'm in the same boat. In tempted to think the media tacked 'white supremacist' onto an otherwise regular conservative crowd.

       Am I, as an Italian, white enough to join? My grandparents remember growing up as a hated minority. Are we pure enough to be considered white these days? Or are only Jewish people hated by the group? I imagine Polish folks, Italians, Romas and a few more may have a hard time being accepted.
