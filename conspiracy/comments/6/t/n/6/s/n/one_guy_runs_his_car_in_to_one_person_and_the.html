       It's so clear to me that the media is stirring up as much divide and conquer as they possibly can. They want everyone pissed off and emotional, and taking a side. They want you to think this matters, far far more than the thousands of other people who died this month.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it only matters because it's being given so much attention. The shock value of this story is off the charts, and the media are stirring the pot as much as possible. The military-industrial complex wants us on the edge of war so they can sell more arms, and lead us more easily in to profitable large-scale wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give in. The world hasn't changed. Just the media's portrayal of it.

       I noticed that too.  The only crime that occurred was committed by the man driving the car.  Prosecute him under the rules of the law and move on.  It's sad, but this hyper over-sensationalizing that you describe is propaganda.

       Exactly. If they break the law, they go to jail like anyone else. Other than that, they should be ignored like the morons they are. End of story.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sensationalizing is definitely propaganda to divide and conquer, and bring us closer to war to put the ball in the MIC's court. Probably helps the news' ratings too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is lost is balance and perspective, and instead we have a populace being riled up and being made more hateful and divided than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think the shills on all the internet forums make this look more organic than it is (people look divided much more than they actually are). A lot of people are being swept in to pre-made opinion-boxes right now because they're too emotional to think clearly

       One good thing is I think their tactics aren't working.  People aren't responding to the black lives matter campaigns, Kony 2012, etc like they want them too, so they have to go in more and more absurd directions and methods.

       I think we're going to start seeing a cycle here. A week of domestic nazi shit, followed by a week of NK nuke shit, then a week of Syria/Iran shit. Those 3 will be hit over and over and over, until one of them turns in to an actual war. I think that's the MIC media strategy now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think people have just about had enough of the media's BS. The only problem is most people now use the internet, and a lot of people don't realize how inorganic the votes and comments are on sites like reddit. If people can recognize this propaganda as well, then I'd say we'll do alright. But it's hard to tell how quickly people are waking up to this particular fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       At what point though does this end? If this is all just some Soros vs Koch pissing match, then can't they just keep making it more and more and more absurd? I hope someday soon there is justice, and humanity can control itself rather than billionaires pulling so many of the media strings that shape our culture.

       All the while, both political parties are doing absolutely nothing to help remedy the situation. They don't care about the peasants, so long as the peasants fight eachother, they can keep being in power. They can virtue signal their way, pretend they are concerned for votes. The blame should be on the MSM. They twist the perception of reality for what reason? It's defiantly not for profit, they will always exist and never go bankrupt.

       Good observation. It's really a virtue signal fest, I heard people agreeing with Ted Cruz who said they can't believe they're doing so.

       Like vultures pick apart a dead carcass for the meat, politicians pick apart an important event for things to virtue signal over. While not actually proposing and legislation that might change anything, of course.

       Neo Nazis have been irrelevant for years now, the only power they had was in the prison system and yet suddenly everyone is treating them like they are this force to be reckoned with.

       Sorry but they are still just mostly ignorant hill billys like the driver these blue collar groups are nothing to be afraid of. The worst thing we can do is keep giving them attention and feeding into their hate because that will be what results in them getting bigger and stronger.

       Of course not. I'm going by the evidence so far presented.

       I cannot see another interpretation that is supported by logic and video evidence.

       Those who are pushing such ab alternative seem to be bringing a lot of bias to the issue, which is suspect.

       (1) His break lights were on before he hit any protestors
(2) His car had damage on the back before he hit any protesetors
(3) Video shows a protestor hitting the car with a flag before he hit any protestors
      </p>
      <p>
       A plausible explanation is that he turned down the wrong street, saw all the protestors and hit the brakes. As we continued, he was attacked by the protestors with bats and flags. He tries to escape by going forward through the crowd, only to run into vehicles stopped in front of him. Once he stops, several protestors rush up with baseball bats and begin breaking his windows; he clearly should have feared for his life at that point. He reverses to get out of there before he was dragged out and inevitably killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems pretty plausible to me.

       Really? You happened to not circle the inner brake lights that are clearly shown to light up in the numerous images I provided in my search. This has zero to do with the top bar in the window. Please, either educate yourself or stop being intellectually dishonest.

       You're obviously just arguing because you can't admit you're wrong. I continually tell you it has zero to do with the windshield light. The brake lights are the
       <strong>
        inner
       </strong>
       lights surrounding the license plate. Hopefully those reading this thread will be able to see what I'm talking about since you refuse to.

       Replacement part, yes because they exist. Brake light, yes because it lights up when the brakes are used.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't explain why on any other Challenger the middle two lights (by the license plate) also light up when the brakes are activated
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       in your magical example. So again, maybe try and debunk those two inner lights by the license plate... I'll wait.

       I originally provided a Google search, which the person I was replying to poo-poo'd as showing too many different things, so I picked the first one, sourced it (so you can see the forum conversation it came from was specifically showing Challenger brake lights). Apparently you want to defend the argument about the top-center windshield light which has nothing to with what I'm pointing out. I guess you didn't understand or are choosing not to.

       I think we should look at everything. Leave no stone unturned. What is more offensive than the crime is if the crime were pre-planned and part of a larger issue. Otherwise, this is just a case of road rage gone horribly wrong. Charge the kid with the full extent of the law, and give the police a slap on the wrist for doing such a piss-poor job at making sure people were safe. This is getting ridiculous - we have people die for much darker reasons every single day. That crowd was not 'peaceful', and when fear is added into the equation, bad things happen when people panic. Turning the whole thing into a Nazis vs the rest of us is not a genuine representation of what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why hasn't the maroon vehicle which also plowed into a bunch of people been mentioned at all? This wasn't even a one-off incident - the drone video of the mob shows the maroon car also hitting the crowd far before the Challenger joined the fray. The whole thing is strange, even before you add in the helicopter crash for no reason and the strange attention the rally received in terms of Police stand-down, national guard involvement (for a 1000 person rally), and all the strange personalities involved.

       The drone footage doesn't show that it was a chain reaction that started with the Challenger. There are several other videos that show the white car hit by the Challenger and then rear-ending the van.

       We should look at everything. Who were the drivers? why were people being led into an intersection like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that something happened. We're trying to find out how and why. Pretending like we know all the answers does not help anybody. We need to test every theory, unless the kid full-on confesses to a hate crime.

       I agree.

       But to be clear the original commenter I was arguing with was trying to claim a flat out lie, and while questioning everything is important, accepting proven facts should happen in tandem with that — research, verify, update opinion as new facts are made clear.

       I'm open to being wrong, and I appreciate when someone points it out in a constructive way. That currently isn't happening in most of these threads and people are pushing seriously misleading information and insisting biased conjecture as proof/truth.

       The running lights are on the inside.  The running lights are off.  These are brake lights.

       If you read the descriptions, the image you provided shows comparisons of different LED bulbs. Notice how when it mentions "brake" (images on the right) the light sections that are being compared are the inner light chunks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, the top image is comparing Stage 1 (left inner brake light) to Stock (right inner brake light), and the bottom is the same, just comparing Stage 2 instead of Stage 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how does this prove what you think it proves? In fact, your image has provided the best proof yet that he
       <strong>
        <em>
         didn't
        </em>
       </strong>
       hit the brakes.

       If you have a driver's license you would know what running lights and brake lights are, specifically the third brake light.  What is missing from that image is what the car looks like without running lights turned on.  None of the bulbs would be illuminated.  When the brakes are hit, only the outer and upper (third) brake lights will illuminate.
       <br/>
       Compare the right hand side of each image in the top row.  This is "stock running lights" compared with "stock brake lights".  Now imagine that the running lights have been turned off.  Clearly the outer lights are brake lights.  I think you are being willfully dense to soak up my time.

       If you look at the images labeled brake you can see that the outer lights in
       <strong>
        both
       </strong>
       images do not change in brightness (compare to the "running" images on the left). This clearly is showing a comparison of the inner left (Stage 1/2) and inner right (stock) — thus, the inner lights are the brake lights.

       No.  IN the top row, the passenger side lights described as "stock" are being compared to an aftermarket replacement part called "Stage 1".  The top row compares this product to the stock running lights and the stock brake lights.
The bottom row is comparing another product called "Stage 2" to the stock lights.  This is why the top left and lower left "stock" (passenger side) lights are the same.  The passenger side lights in the right column are also the same.  The right column shows the stock brake lights engaged on the passenger side.

       so why did the maroon car slam into the crowd as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the police back down and allow things to get completely out of control? Why was the national guard called out for a 1000 person rally (very small)? Why were government actors the first to respond? Why did a helicopter seem to crash for no reason at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of questions to ask about this event. The fact alone that he apparently drove off and waited to turn himself in a few blocks away totally matches the hat you are putting on the guy (hateful racist Nazi zombie). There are clear signs of aggression towards his car before and after the hit. Could he possibly just be a kid who doesn't know how to drive well who panicked? And if so, how irresponsible is all of this political pandering to anti-Nazi sentiment (very easy target, nobody likes nazis).
      </p>
      <p>
       it's all a little much to swallow, yet here you are handing out horse pills. Why can't we just wait to see what comes from it instead of being super sure that everyone else is wrong like you are doing?

       I would actually say it was. Terrorism is the use of violence to accomplish political goals. Or as google puts it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        terrorism - the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't know how political his goals were, I haven't really heard anything about his motivations, but it seems likely there was a strong political motivation based on the context and therefore it technically meets the definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not a huge act of terrorism compared to what we might normally consider terrorism, but I'd argue it technically qualifies.

       No. You don't see a bunch of white supremecists killing people and prosecute the individual. You need to find the root of the problem and go after that or it will keep happening. They've floored it though cars, blown up government buildings, shot up PP, bombed mosques and taken over bird sancuaries, it is not an individual doing this it is an ideology.

       It shouldnt matter what 'side' the guy was on. It happened and the reasons why are far more important than political affiliations.

       I agree, extremists suck, and they should not be given the spotlight. And they
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       should not be painted to represent a mainstream political party, or even worse half of America. That's extrapolation beyond reason, yet I keep seeing it again and again. Divide and conquer is alive and well in 2017

       Its how it works everywhere.

       Where i live (over the atlantic), the left and right are a lot more center leaning. The extreme right is essentially the church (which is laughed at now) and the extreme left are very small in number.

       First of all, as someone who doesn't live in the USA and doesn't support either Political party. What was the point of the White Supremacists protest? What are they protesting exactly? Second of all, waving swastika flags, doing the Nazi salute. It's 2017. THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING. Those who support the Right and are level-headed should also be against these people. The US FOUGHT against the Nazis in WW!!. There's no room for them in this day and age and anyone who supports that is vile. Now, on the other side. If these people wanted to protest, then let them protest. Who were they harming? If they want to be so deluded into thinking that there's an oppression against White America at the time, then let them protest. The people supporting the Left that decided to go and march against them at the protest are the vital reason all hell broke loose. I've seen so many Leftists say all White Supremacists should die and deserve to die. Who are YOU to judge that? Isn't that what Hitler did? He believed an entire race should be exterminated? It really is no different than how Nazis think. Yet, we applaud the latter. Stop being pressured and brainwashed into thinking one event describes an entire group of people. The minorities are the first to want to drop stereotypes and discrimination but they are also the FIRST to place these stereotypes and discriminate. You don't fight inequality with inequality and you don't fight against violence with violence. Because when you do, it's a never-ending cycle that gets us NOWHERE. Regardless of which political side you support, CONDEMN violence. CONDEMN hate speech. CONDEMN racism, sexism, homophobia where it applies. CONDEMN inequality.

        What are they protesting exactly?
This started after Virginia was going to take away some statues that honored a Civil War General.  It appears the Nazi's attached themselves to that protest.  Just an FYI.

       Yep.. It's insane, the level of retaliation. I even resorted to checking out /pol/ to see if they had any undiluted speculation in the realm of conspiracy, and nope, almost every other post was what I assume to be shills, shaming 4channers, rubbing this in their faces, saying things like "we tried to warn you and now you're Nazis to all of America", just weird stuff. I hadn't ever had a reason to go to that board, so I don't know if all that division has always been there, or if its the same as how we have been infested with here, but shit's so crazy..
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think that they're super desperate on this plan being as damaging to their opponents as possible, because maybe they are afraid of the message that a group of white people might bring to the stage of identity politics if allowed to do so? I dunno, but they're hitting this so hard for a reason, and I think that maybe it's that there are too many easy arguments to make against the way that this happened, the way it's being handled, the story involved, the knee-jerk reactions, the obvious crisis actors, the ties to the deep state of prominent and viral witnesses.. it's too absurd, as you said, and there are too many new instances of strange happenings, so they're sticking to their "EVERYONE THAT DISAGREES IS A NAZI AND THE WHOLE WORLD THINKS SO", shaming the world, hoping this sticks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, the shaming probably will make this stick in the end, or at least it will be accepted as the official version of events without too much rebellion, but the small solace that I take is that nothing is truly free, and there is a cost to each of these plans which they have to foist on people, each death that is caused by their subversions and manipulations, and that cost is most dear to someone who lives completely in the dark: illumination. They have to reveal a bit of themselves each time they do things like this, and their power lies in remaining hidden at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno I'm rambling, still sorting this stuff out, personally. Thanks again though, and stay strong! :D

       I agree. The harder they squeeze, the more it slips through their fingers. Their own pressure to control things will be their undoing, because they will someday push it too far and people will act. Seems to be the pattern of history.

       That's not what my point was. There's an excessive focus on this story, and certain aspects of this story, because they're pushing a civil war narrative. They're exacerbating the situation by disingenuously framing the story, which may cause
       <em>
        more

       violence, which I would like to avoid.

       all these comments are honestly trying to bury you from your original point. I was getting so caught up thinking about this that I forgot about the EVERY DAY problems people are going through and that everyone wants to forget that  there are problems we can fix with the amount of attention that these crazy planned issues get on a daily and forever basis.

       Of course it's not a coincidence, but the point is over emphasized to the point of ridiculousness. Do you think Nazis are the only ones who want to kill others because of their ideology, or something? You can't erase an entire ideology form the earth, it doesn't work that way. And these are people with a serious victimhood complex, so persecution only makes them feel more justified.

       We're talking about a specific event that was carried out by someone who had just participated in a Nazi (or Nazi-like, if you prefer) rally. Just because other people kill people doesn't detract from the seriousness of this event, and the fact that it is related to Nazi symbolism. I don't see people ever saying something like that when it's a terror attack attributed to a muslim person, so it makes it difficult to see statements like these as anything other than trying to downplay this event and the relation to Nazis (or those pushing Nazi-like ideologies).

       One guy did something though. What is your proposed solution, to wipe nazi ideology from the earth? Good luck with the backlash from targeting those who get their identity from playing victim... They need to be ignored, because they're unimportant. Not put in the spotlight to hate on over and over, because that only feeds them and makes them grow larger and have more members

      <p>
       Um, I don't disagree if we're talking about a positive spotlight. However, by shining a light on the negative things these groups do and calling them out for their bigotry and violence is the only way to educate people so that they
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       feel like they need to defend something (unless that's what they actually believe in I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to be held accountable for their actions, and if their actions were encouraged and fostered because of some group and their ideologies (that the perpetrator takes part in or aligns themselves with) then people should be made aware of that. It's no different from pointing out a muslim terrorist was a member of ISIS or some other group pushing Jihad and/or violence against "infidels."

       These people don't know the difference between negative and positive attention. They thrive on negative attention. These are people who voluntarily call themselves neo-nazis. They thrive on conflict, because it's the only way they know how to get attention.

       If this is the case, why are there so many people on here trying to lessen what happened? I mean really, you can't have it both ways here. Either they're proud of what happened and don't care that negative things are being said, or they
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       care about the negative stuff and are actively trying to mitigate the blame.

       They want attention. Good or bad. I am against giving them attention, because they're losers who should feel unimportant. They should not feel like the center of attention, good or bad, because that just attracts more members.

       It's a post about the overreaction of the media. You'd be wise to know the actual story before you start claiming whether or not the media is overreacting. Literally if you had taken 1 minute to research it even a little bit you would've seen that an entire crowd was attacked, not just a single person.

       There wasn't this big a reaction when the alt-right guy killed two white people on a train who were sticking up for Muslims even more recently either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for this is because driving cars into crowds with the intent to kill many people has so far been a tactic used by ISIS and it is very easy to say "See, I have been telling you that these guys are terrorists and now you have to accept it" when they take actions like this. This was a terrorist attack and it can no longer be denied.

       Oh that's where I heard this "three people died" thing from... There is so much fuckiness going on with this story right now. I feel like there are 3 parallel narratives going on in the media, each denying the reality of the other 2, and I honestly can't tell which is true. This is one of the most confusing and propagandized stories I have seen in a very very long time

       I am stuck going back and forth between this was scripted, and this was just taken advantage of by opportunistic groups that seek to inflame all sides of these issues. I think the latter is more likely, and I think you can always find funny and confusing bits after an event like this to construct an apparent conspiracy around. But I won't pretend to be convinced either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think my main takeaway is that this is being used as a psyop NOW, regardless of where the incident originated from.

       I think they've just been increasing the pressure on both extremist sides, and it was just a matter of time until something like this happened. In that sense it was "scripted", but I don't think they like hired an actor to drive the car or anything. I think that was a real neo-nazi asshole who went mental. But they created the conditions for that type of person to do something like that. And then of course were poised to take advantage of it the minute something
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       happen. Just like they're doing with NK and Syria. They're laying the trap, and they're ready to react the moment it springs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even heard reports that both sides were peaceful, until at one point the white supremecist group was led directly in to the antifa group, by the way the police had positioned themselves. It almost sounds like they kettled the antifa in with the white supremacists intentionally. They're supposed to stand
       <em>
        between
       </em>
       the two groups. Also the police were letting the antifa throw bottles at the white supremacists, and then also were afraid to confront any of the white supremacists because of how heavily they were armed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lot of fishy crap going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though, the key thing is that it's being used as a psychological operation NOW, and they've got quite a foothold to use as leverage.

       Yesterday was really bad. And I believe synthetic. I didn't recognize hardly any of the accounts with the hateful and violent messaging I had to deal with yesterday. And they weren't stacked accounts like we see with the pros. These were month old throwaways and the like for the most part.

       We are being gamed. Everyone should keep that in the back of their heads no matter where they lie on the spectrum as they motor around the forum the next few days. This will pass, but they will try to maximize the amount of aggression everyone feels.

       Yeah, we're being gamed. I've just about had enough of reddit today, 90% of the conversations I'm having are just straight up infuriating and completely disingenuous. But I know that's by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like when there was the london high-rise fire, the site godlikeproductions had the forum literally 80% filled with posts about anal sex. Just to drive people away from discussing how the building was not collapsing like the three buildings on 9/11. Absolute forum slide, using hyper-emotional content. Seems to be the preferred angle these days.

       It's all documented in a multi-part series on Youtube if you'd like actual footage of actual Swedish citizens talking about their actual problems.

       Do you know why other cars were in the street? Most protest are roped off and blue lines are placed when counter protesters are approved to rally.

       He was going at speed toward a crowd of people with no room to stop before anyone touched his vehicle. But let's pretend you're correct. Having your car hit by a pedestrian is not an excuse to plow into a separate group of people at high speed.

       Agree.  However tensions were high and he reacted.  I don't understand why they allowed counter protesting to begin with and 2nd I don't understand how they didn't rope off the block and put a blue line in the street.  Some stupid shit by the state if you ask me.

       At what point did I say it was a good excuse? I'm not justifying anything this man did.  He is guilty of manslaughter and deserves punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       People on here are claiming this guy had a premeditated plan to drive through a crowd of protesters with the intent of killing them (like a terrorist).  Based upon what I have seen from video footage - it doesn't fit that objective.  It seems more like an angry reaction (road rage) instead of it being a premeditated terrorist attack.  Again, I'm not taking a side here just pointing out the obvious.

       I honestly wonder if the people defending James Alex Fields Jr. ever read their post out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean would they ever go into a social setting - like a happy hour at a bar or a lunch with coworkers or a picnic after church - and blurt out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One guy runs his car in to one person, and the media is acting like nazis are back and civil war is on the horizon. It's beyond absurd
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the answer is no, then I hope they realize that they advocating noxious opinions due to the anonymity of the of the internet that they would say in real life because their friends and family would think they are assholes.

       A lot of us would not feel guilty saying such a thing in a social setting, because the theory is backed by numerous facts regarding the corporate media being used as a facilitator of collective psychological thinking. In other words, a lot of us do not share in the fear that others will disagree with us because what we know is fundamentally fact based. And we tend to feel the way we do because we understand that separation is a mind-based illusion (despite many people, obviously, disagreeing), creating the sense that race is even a thing worth considering, and there is an agency (that often hides in shadows and behind money) at play that utilizes this Achille's heal of humanity (the tendency to believe everything we see for convenience sake) by using its money to play with the collective mind that is our species.

       How is that the statement you feel most proud of leaving regarding this post? How is that the thing you take away from the sentiment and the implications it carries? People were hurt, and it's absolutely terrible. No one should ever be hurt regarding the game that is 'the world', because it's just a game and it's literally just a thought. We create it with our minds and believe it, but ultimately -- as scientists will tell you (r/holofractal) -- nothing
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       exists, so logically, nothing actually matters. It's ridiculous to get hurt because of your beliefs, because they're inherently childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we should turn our attention to the fact that this
       <em>
        war
       </em>
       seems to be sort of a conceptual, psychological phenomenon that a lot of people are believing but which
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       isn't real. It's created. And we can also see that a lot of powerful people perpetuate their financial growth via these issues. We shouldn't just say, "You forgot about our feelings, so screw you." We should, instead, focus on the facts of the matter so that we can work on their implications.

Its happening slowly...but...its happening and thats all that matters. Its true when they say good will overcome evil and were in the mist of it and there isn't a damn thing they can do about it except watch it crumble in front of them.. Peace and may the light destroy darkness

       What about every other similar attack that ended up killing way more than one person? Why is this one being pushed so hard by the media as the one to divide us? And how come our response as a nation is so easily influenced by the media? Why isn't anyone thinking this through more?

       Runs his car into one crowd of people? Is that what you meant? Stop trying to downplay this terrorist act. I never so much complaining about the media reporting on terrorism when a Muslim does it.

       Of course there were neonazis there. These small groups of idiots have been around for decades, and one guy went mad. That does not make a civil war, nor does it mean nazis are back.

       Cheers for the downvote, but how is that remotely in the realm of civil war? I keep hearing in this sub how there are hardly any Nazis, nothing to see here etc. You really need two comparable sides to start a proper civil war mate.

       I don't think so. That could easily lead to gun bans, and they love bringing guns to intimidate others.

       Cars, however, simply cannot be banned, and nobody will hold you as suspicious just because you're driving one.

       True but there's a particular activity that is treated
       <em>
        relatively
       </em>
       leniently: showing up to demonstrations with full tactical gear and semi-automatic rifles. That kind of brazen display of force is relatively out of place, and I think is tolerated mainly because none of them have shot at anyone yet.

       Running over people who are unlawfully assembled is not an appropriate reaction to the events that unfolded.

       Do we want to encourage this kind of behavior? Im assuming the next time white nationalists assemble and some are killed because they lacked the required permits you would be fine with people taking the law into their own hands, right?

       I never said it was okay... just that there's perhaps been an overreaction for political reasons, that isn't justified, that is whipping people up in to a frenzy that might cause even MORE violence. That's what I really don't want.

       I'm arguing with them so that others may see why they're wrong, but I suppose it's a waste of breath in most cases and they're just forum sliding and my responses just further that.

       yeah my dude, your titally right.  in fact the guy telling you not to argue is probably a shill himself.  trying to waste your time and tell you its not worth it to argue.  just like you replied it IS worth it because if just one ignorant person learns something and learns how to spot all the b.s. it will have been worth it.  keep doing what you do my dude!

       his point isnt that the acts werent serious or upsetting.  his point is that there were thousands of other deaths some probably more horric but this story is getting the attention by msm to stir shit up and keep ppl fighting.  he isnt downplaying shit.  if you cant see the point he is trying to make then you need to educate yourself at an elementary level my friend.  this concept isnt hard to figure out....

       of course we should care but we shouldnt be giving them so much air time.  fuck racism.  my point is fight racism in your everyday life and be a good person.  by continuing to give this story light the nazis feel like they can keep coming out of the shadows

       However the way the media is holding them up for the sole purpose of bowbeating them, is only going to create more supporters and justify those who feel attacked and victimized. Which will only lead to more violence and more extremists. Which is obviously not what we want.

       No, that is black and white thinking. There are many people on the fringe, and when people start flinging mud, those on the fringe will become part of the group, and it'll grow bigger and bigger.

       this isnt due to the group he is part of, at least not completely.  this kind of shit thinking starts at home when your young.  he is 20.... this is a generational problem.  racism is handed down just like the other habits and nuances you pick up from friends, family and other influences.  he should go to jail and we should keep ignoring stupid fucking kkk members because they dont matter.  the more power you give this story the more power they have.  we need bigger thinking and bigger solutions to this type of problem in america.  on a side note why does it always seem there is some think tank with the worlds leading scientists for stuff that has negitive impact but never one to help solve world hunger or other large global issues.  strange that.

       The whole state of this country is like 2 people talking shit about each other's mothers.  Just let them fight and get it over with.   It's the only way people will see that violence is  not the answer.   I hate to say it bit maybe civil war needs to happen,  and the first few battlefields should be in rich people's and politicans back yards.

       We did that though! We've done that over and over. I'd take the bickering over a war. People need to cool their heads. I think this "let's get it over with so it'll improve after" is very dangerous thinking. It's accelerationism, that isn't necessarily guaranteed to produce a good result

       Uh maybe some honesty and condemnation of the alt-right for what it really has always been? Fucking rebranded white supremacy with coded language. If people don't want to be associated with people carrying Nazi flags and giving Nazi salutes maybe they shouldn't march with them.  Hell, the original march they were changing blood and soil waving torches surrounding students. The point is, people out there who are informed about neo-nazis and their strategies the past decade can see right through this coded rhetoric, can recognize these phrases, for what they are, even if half the country wants to play ignorant and be like "what is racist about the alt right????" People aren't using "Nazi" as hyperbole, this literally movement literally began on stormfront

       How about make white supremacists eligible to be charge with terror like the rest of the fucking people of our nation... Trump fucking removed them without justification when they are the largest terror group operating within the US currently. Look up the statistics before spouting off your bullshit. These fucks should be charged for acts of terror end of story. Driving a car into a crowd? If the driver was Muslim we'd be bombing a country right the fuck now, but because they're white and trying to use fear it's a fucking slap on the wrist by comparison?!?!

       You're a moron... Street gangs killing 10 people doesn't compare to the supremacy groups plotting to bomb crowded buildings with hundreds in them. Not to mention this has nothing to do with the Cartels you were talking about that you claim are worse than the supremacy groups found throughout the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since I feel bad for you based on your inability to really defend your own point, I'll give you this one and we'll pretend thats a terror attack. So you're contending that gang violence which we're already actively fighting is worse then the white supremacy groups planning large scale bombings that were recently removed from the terror lists?

       So you're saying that injury=murder?!?!??!??!
      </p>
      <p>
       See how you feel? That's how you argue. That's what you do all day. I can't know for certain that you don't understand that you do this, so on the chance that you are sincere in your beliefs, you need to have more integrity, stop twisting people's arguments to create a scenario in which there are winners and losers, look for agreement, stop the condescension. You know that these are ugly habits; don't abide them in yourself. Be above the ends justifying the means. Be a good person.

       Bro that was reaction bait, and then I explained how it was reaction bait in the following paragraph, but you took the reaction bait and reacted before you even read the rest, I assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       You finished your comment with reaction bait. Try to be more reasonable, and then once you get that down, try to be agreeable.

       You're retarded. that wasn't even the point of his post. what the fuck did you do, read the first line, ignore the rest, take it in as your dumb willed self did and get straight edgy instantly thinking of a rhetoric to oppose him with, cause you read something that doesn't appease to your views? I'm confused why you even commented, what was your point?

       never knew that was a thing. Its like the one thing in arguements that agitates me, leaving a shitty 'oh so intelligent' comment with no back up to their arguement, only to try and make you look bad and an attempt to get you and others to see their view through their eyes.

       Thanks for posting the unedited version.  Comment deleted.  I had read that his car was hit before he accelerated.  I then saw this video and thought it was unedited.

       Let's not turn into the politics sub and try to destroy each other.  I'm just someone who wants more information on what happened.  We're not enemies.  I didn't delete my profile, I deleted the comment since it had an edited video that is deceptive.

       Another person posted this exact same thing but deleted their profile. I made a second edit on the post to you on accident. I think you may have seen the edit before I deleted it. I deleted it quickly but you probably saw it. I was trying to point out that video everywhere I've seen it. I just don't understand why people need to edit the footage to fit a narrative. I could see why you might think that he accelerated after his car was hit if that's the only video you've seen.

       I vote by the numbers, statistics from reliable sources with decent reputations and candidates past voting records.  Because of that I find myself voting with the left slightly more than the right, but I do t side with them near 100% of the time.

       Again - no logical argument, no reasoning, no facts, nothing except a personal insult and a repetition of the claim that I'm a shill, again without any basis or evidence.  (And just for the record - no one has ever paid me a penny to post about politics or anything else, I have never taken a penny from any political or influence group, and I pretty well detest all of these people.)

       Too bad so sad, they are coming.

       The truth is not the warmongers narrative, it's his only option. Thus, it is prophecy that the race wars are coming.

       The "prophecy" is something the warmongers made for future warmongers to fulfill, so it can look like the cosmos is aligning with the warmongers, which gives them the appearance of being more powerful than they are

       No the prophecy is a locked understanding of destiny by the LORD. In order for Rothschild to fall, it means attacking every angle of white supremacy from numerous amounts of nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, as Rothschild is attacked, whites lose power, this in effect will turn whites against minority groups. This is cause and reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example would be how Obama went for green energy to produce more lucrative and less damaging energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well this in turn hurts coal and oil and which states happen to be have the most coal mines or oil rigs? Who lively hood is that actually effecting?
      </p>
      <p>
       White folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take that same idea and apply it to something else like open borders in Europe allowing millions of migrants to move into normally white countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       These things are already in effect, it is only a matter of time before it bursts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the more Rothschild is attacked economically, the more chaos we will see.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people did not write the Bible nor did God give them power to do so. Instead, these vagabonds once known as slaves took something that was not theirs and instead of destroying it, they kept it and began to use it the wrong way on purpose. Thus they continued prophecy for it was written they would do so.

       Their hypocrisy is on full display yet again.  Did you hear what Holder said?  Mr. workplace violence is condemning the president for not calling out white terrorism.  The left and the leftist media is just a dying joke at this point, hopefully they don't take out too many more people while in their death throes.

       Before we work on any of this, we need to focus on enacting laws to protect users from influence marketing and making propaganda illegal once again, repealing the patriot act. Let's pick something and unite.

       Yup. 6 corporations own 95% of the media in the US, and it's not too hard to bribe 6 corporations when you have as much money to work with as the CIA does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad what I just said would be considered a nonsense conspiracy theory by 50% of the population, because they're taught that by that same media. Makes me a little upset. At least there's still some good shows out there, here and there. Things do definitely leak through, they don't have total control, especially now that the internet is around.

       right wing extremism has been on the rise for the last 10yr, this event took place in the context of a right-wing extremist rally, the crime was committed by an admitted extremist. how is this being overblown? if anything the media has been ignoring this trend for years in spite of many warnings from people who track this activity and in the face of a large increase in domestic terrorism. I think it's long past time the media gets on this in a seriously loud voice.

       stormfront has had their page for over a decade, their people used to recruit from this site regularly (probably moved to voat now), those articles were late IMO, FBI and SPLC had numbers that saw a sharp rise right as obama was elected and the crash didn't help anything either.  I would say the rise even went back to Katrina when whites were scared of an entire city full of POC migrating to their towns but ya, mostly it was Obama.

Now the trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed. Uncle Andrew did. He soon did hear nothing but roaring in Aslan’s song. Soon he couldn’t have heard anything else even if he had wanted to.

       Extremism in general is rising leading up to the economic failure of the country.  Shit will just get crazier across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I have one anecdote about black people, my friend owns a super large forum for black people about a thing and he told me that just some short years ago the tone really changed there and some people started using the forum to talk shit about how white people are the cause of all problems in the country.  They use "yt" for "whitey" and sometimes some numerical equivalent of "yt" so that they can talk shit undercover.  They are cultural Marxist, racist, angry people.  He says that its all new within the last four years.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Soros and others have been paying to foment race wars and it has taken hold and now its just a matter of how large it will get.  Its a build up to a payload for use when the economic situation becomes untenable.  This shit plays out!  I was in Ukraine in a basement bar with chicks, booze, nationalists, some racists and these two guys were adamantly telling me two years before the war that there was going to be a war.  Some weeks later I was invited to a sort of football hooligan Naziesque squat lair to hang out and drink and I found out that someone was paying them to do stuff related to football and their ideologies.  The football touring seemed like cover for political maneuvering and possibly even subversion.  I didn't really put it all together at the time but I knew that something was up.  I definitely didn't think that war would break out but I had a strong feeling that extreme mischief was in the works.  It turns out that Soros was all up in that country spending BILLIONS fomenting rebellion.  To this day I have a strong feeling that some of that Soros money was trickling down to these guys and that this is who their patron ultimately was.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is simply that shit is brewing and its going to come from a lot of different directions in the community since those knuckleheads of all stripes have been paid and encouraged to be useful idiots when their time has come.  Plus people are just independently stupid, drugged and whatever else.

       I don't know about other medias (Haven't been reading the news that much lately), but at least in reddit they're fueling the flames HARD. 
Just take a look at the most active threads on r/all concerning this incident, the divide &amp; conquer is real, and it's a little scary how well it seems to be working. I know this has been said a lot on this sub, but I hope people are starting to see how much of all the hate and divide is manufactured by the media, with the help of these sad, fucked up incidents that they spin as best as they can to divide the populace even more.

       Yeah, they're playing the public like a fiddle. And with an unknown amount of bot/shill accounts playing the part, making it look like the public is doing something it's not... it convinces a lot of people. Breeding extremism is a "death by 1000 cuts" thing and the media managers know it

       Looks like a false flag to anyone with half a brain.  Continue your outrage though, I'm sure you will concede and change your views once more information comes out and we see who was really behind this.  Oh wait, no you won't.

       Calm the fuck down.  Nazi's aren't running through town smashing windows and carting people off to camps.  A bunch of them got together - lawfully - to protest the removal of a statue they all like.  The legally assembled to celebrate their collective narrow-mindedness.

       They can be assholes.  They have the right to be assholes.  You don't have the right to beat them up.  It's not okay to beat the shit out of people you disagree with.  This is a nation formed by people from many different backgrounds, religions, etc, that means we have to be extra tolerant of each other, not beat up people with whom we disagree.  Even if they are really awful people.

       I usually don't. But both the protestors and counter protestors were armed. So yeah there were sides to this rally/protest. One side wanted the statue to be taken down and one side wanted the statue to stay.

       Unless they were all on the same side? I'm not sure what you're trying to say besides insults.

       Tim McVeigh was anti-government.  He wasn't right wing, he was anti-government, if anything his politics were more in line with Antifa and the anarchists.  He was an avowed anarchist.

       McVeigh was 100% right wing. Anti-government, gun rights, racism, I mean what more do you want? What part of him isn't right wing?
      </p>
      <p>
       He read and was found with pages of the Turner Diaries on him, owned a fuck ton of guns, and hated the government and taxation.

       No expert, but it seems like he was right wing to me...

       Your comment looks like a joke. Alt-right vs non alt-right. Are you kidding me? Is the world so black and white to you that it's just alt rights and non alt rights? A bunch of assholes that are pretty widely disliked and ridiculed on a regular basis got together for a protest. It was very poorly organized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow the opposing protesters, or "non-alts" so I can bring it down to your level, got all intermingled with the skinheads. Are you surprised at what happened? They are skin heads. Neo Nazi's... they are IDIOTS with aggressive and violent views.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this protest BS was happening closer to me, it's possible I would of been there protesting against neo nazi's myself. But I wouldn't be caught dead doing that right in front of them. I would of been safely distanced somewhere near the police peacefully protesting. That's the way these things are normally set up. If we should be mad at anybody, it's whoever was responsible for letting these two groups get so close to each other and leading to the horrifying outcome we are all talking about here today.

       No, in fact I was specifically referencing this incident. The vast majority of us sit somewhere in between the "alt-right" and BLM etc.

       Then go protest them, as you are entitled to in the US. I would support you in that.

       If we have learned anything from this incident, it's that everyone is allowed to protest, and we all need to be safe about how it's done. The event was very poorly coordinated, and it should of never gotten to the point it did.

       That's not true, like at all. If someone punches you into the face and pounds you into oblivions, I doubt you'd respond "hey man it takes two to fight!"

       Every single protest , every single time antifa shows up anywhere it always ends the same . They were there just like the Nazis were , and that is to fuck shit up. People have been maced, beat with locks, had piss thrown on then ect. That isn't just Nazis intact up till now it has been regular Trump supports vs antifa and  no one stepped in yet everyone acts surprised when a nut job escalates it. For someone reading conspiracies you sure are short sighted or in denial.

       Have you ever actually read ISIS literature? Bombing them isn't what drives them. It doesn't hurt obviously, but they explicitly state that their mission is jihad and the establishment of the caliphate. Vengeance is just a bonus.

       I don't understand. So, like you don't think a monthly newsletter on ISIS's goals and accomplishments would give insight as to why their ideology might be attractive to some? You don't think the official ISIS propaganda that potential recruits would come across before joining has anything to do with that? Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Their doctrine has nothing to do with revenge, or at least nothing significant since the creation of the state of Israel. They do not see themselves as being at war with America. They believe they are at war with anyone who does not follow their interpretation of Islam. You need to get your head out of that bubble.

       I hear you. But I also want to point out that one or two nutjob white supremacists can do a lot of damage.  See the Oklahoma City bombing. It only takes a couple of people who are mad and mentally unstable.

       Ok thank you, the first actual proof i've seen of any nazi flags and saluting since this all outbroke. I'm not agreeing with those white supremacists(which is all they are), but i'm also not agreeing with the media and their portrayal of these "Nazis" and everyone is just eating it all up. They certainly aren't "Nazis".

       To be fair, how many events this year have seen the extreme left attacking people and beating some people close to death? I don't like the low intelligent nationalists I saw from this weekend and I don't condone them. My girlfriend isn't white so I know they would hate me for this fact alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       But bringing body armor and weapons is not extreme when they knew they would be attacked by the alt-left. I can find  literally hours of compilations of innocent people being attacked by antifa. I don't think you can say the same about the alt right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples like the bitcoin hat girl again who was peppered spray for NOTHING while the extreme left tried burning Berkeley down? Fuck Trump but he is right when he said both sides are doing wrong.

       You mean like the radical leftist antifa movement that has been responsible for far more organized violence than any political group in America by far since the election? The man who committed that act was enabled by such groups and the propaganda pushed by far left media. Pundits land liberal political figures literally calling for right wing blood in the streets. Again, this is a weak effort. Totally transparent shilling.

The scene that went on at Berkely was disgusting. The shooting at the softball game was also disgusting. The beating of people with bike locks was equally disgusting.

       Actual Nazis? Probably stand for being dead and/or dying. Todays morons that attribute to Nazi ideology? Misguided nationalism and extreme levels of ignorance/stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual Nazis, or the old heads of the Nazi part in Germany had a very specific goal in terms of the "final solution" and the creation of a massive Germanic state following the eradication of non-Germans in their relative region and the enslavement of slavs and others. Also potentially world conquest, but immediately just to take over land and slaughter everyone they didn't like in their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean what the general Nazi stood for, it was all kind of bs to conceal Hitler's actual (next level insane) goals.

       Have you examined the other footage and the threads examining the anomalies of the crash? Or are you allowing your particular ideological inclination to lead your thinking?
I condemn violence from the right, but if the left didn't give them attention the crash would not have happened. Starve them of oxygen and they will die.

       Again, examine the anomalies in the other thread. He certainly was distracted, most likely panicked. We have seen the footage which has subsequently emerged showing leftists striking his vehicle.
If you deny that a violent leftist presence didn't elevate this from a non-event to the current shitshow, I think you may have ideological reasons for doing so.

       I agree the alt-right's  rhetoric is a problem but from what I've read, they had a permit and stressed their non-violent intentions. Hence why I believe, had they been left to their own devices, that there may have been some incensed locals but the whole rally would have turned into a non-event.
Also, re: Antifa's intentions, they seem to stand for shutting down "fascists" (which is often loosely defined: Trump, the alt-right, that Milo guy, Ann Coulter,etc) with violence. Anti-fascist
       <strong>
        action
       </strong>
       doesn't make me think of non-violent protests.
Again, I should clarify I am not trying to excuse the alt-right. They are rightfully being condemned by every side. I am simply more concerned about the fact that the violent leftist contingent was not criticised, in fact just the opposite. I am very concerned about violent political groups in the United States on the left and the right.

       They had a permit and stated no violence yet carried weapons and torches. Mixed messages at best.

It's the job of the police to prevent the use of weapons, not the group's ideological opponents. I do not support political violence in the United States.

       There are actually numerous threads in this very sub (most are screenshots of investigations on external websites) analysing the footage from different angles, some of them have enhanced close-ups of the driver. It's also interesting that this all went down not far from CIA hometurf.
I'm suspicious at this point. There are a lot of people who would benefit from violent escalation of political divisions within the United States.

       Well, you'd be better off to be suspicious, I think. Repeating something OVER AND OVER does not make it true or a fact. What I mean by repeating is that there was ONE MAN-CHILD who was obviously a NAZI and he MURDERED INNOCENT CIVILIANS with mommy's car. This is being hammered into my face. Why? I'm amazed so many of these people accept this as though they were personally there to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, thank you. I have seen a shadowy pic of a very cut, lean dude who looks waaay different than marshmallow Nazi Man-Child who was supposedly in that car, and don't know if I buy that either. But it's something to ponder. I do wonder who took the shadowy pic, as it is very clean.

       Too bad that the HJ, and other arms of the NSDAP, were violently opposed from the beginning by leftist groups by Rote Jungfront and in fact thrived on such confrontation. I'm sure you're familiar with Herbert Norkus and such?

       Maybe they shouldn't be such giant pussies that they have to gang up and attack people who aren't nice to them? One neckbeard alone could never do anything, but get 10, maybe 20 of them together? Then they feel un-cowardly enough to attack individual people without shitting themselves.

       I dunno, I had a convo here yesterday about the guys waving Nazi flags at Charlottesville.

       I thought we were having a philosophical convo about what citizenship means et cetera, but no he was just saying hitler did nothing wrong and it's all just a conspiracy by the Jews to do something, make the earth bad I guess?

       I've been on not as long as you, but a couple of years over a couple of accounts. I noticed a shift when T_D invaded last summer as part of the run up to the election. Had it not been for two particularly political in nature conspiracy theories, I'm sure this sub would've kept on trucking business as usual.

       Instead it became a forum to be far-right and pro-government.

       Funny thing is, they were nowhere to be seen before that asshole ran down those people. They've come out of the woodwork to cause shit in here and make us look bad. I've encountered quite a fair bit of racism here in the last two days, and it's people I rarely see.

       I would say I see alot what you would call "holocaust denial" on this sub but not so much "nazism" as in people relishing atrocities inflicted upon people of a certain race/ethnicity.

       This is /conspiracy after all, so of course something as infamous as WWII and the Holocaust are going to be scrutinised and researched within the bounds that society permits.

       Holy shit, etc. I thought t_d and cpnspiracy told me these Nazi fucks were protesting peacefully until they were provoked by those evil anti Nazis? Talk about a conspiracy. I haven't seen the MSM cover this at all, that they were beating minorities in the streets. This is why I laugh when people here claim the media is radically left wing. Sure they're condemning the nazis but the right is still pushing the narrative that they were attacked or being civil before anti protesters arrived or that "all sides" are wrong. They couldnt do this if the media showed this. In addition to a professor from UVA saying that the anti protesters saved their lives from nazis that day. None of that has gotten MSM coverage. Shit like this, and putting a spot light on the 5% of unruly BLM protesters instead of the 95% who march peacefully(and unarmed) is why i scoff at all the right wing crying that the media is biased against them. If anything the media has covered up their BS

       But a ton of people protesting. If there was a protest this large about Muslims trying to instill Sharia law, we would all be understandably outraged. I'm all for free speech, and the like, I just hate the damn hypocrisy. Also, come on, people waving the Nazi flag and wearing shirts with Nazi quotations? These people are either crazy or very, very, very, stupid.

       Have you been here the past ten years? Where was the same treatment for "white nationalists"? Almost like you, and the media who have had their way with your minds, are able to acknowledge the difference in scope and the difference in how often these terrorist attacks happen, yet become severely more upset towards the correct "bad guys" when it happens.

       Except I'm not an apologist and I have on many cases stated my views online and IRL about the major flaws of Muslim ideology. Just bc I think the alt right are a bunch of insane quacks, doesn't mean I think Muslims or BLM or ANTIFA are positive.

       Yeah, because I've never seen this sub spam front page posts to try to dismiss an attack like this before. We both know if he was from BLM or something there wouldn't be anyone defending him.

       i did think the helicopter crashing the same damn time was a bit suspect, first thing i thought of when i heard that on the radio. how often are there coincidences like that on such a massive scale (the terrorist attack, oh and btw this helicopter happened to crash at the same time).

       The BBC absolutely reported non stop for days when Ariana Grande and the car attacks happened.  The same goes for most countries reporting onvtheir own terror attacks. It just happens that American audiences don't really care about things happening in not America.

       B.b...b.but.... There are extremists of
Nearly every ideology, religion, creed and color. The whole "lone gunman" motif can hardly be blamed on a whole group - and banning and censoring things IS nazism, even if you think you're in the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six months ago they were trying to paint all BLM and SJWs as extreme violent protestors, now it's the supposed altright. I don't fall for any of it. Most people are reasonable folks going to work with everyone else without incident and then coming home to "24 hour news: horror story edition".

       Yeah but he's one fucked up guy. It wasn't an organization that launched an attack with a significant back from the populace. Even the white supremacists are distancing themselves from him. If there were rallies and public Nazi rallies the next day I would be concerned. A racist crazy young man attended a rally to protest the removal of a general that fought for states to have slavery. He does not represent a large group of people. Even racist ass clowns don't support what he did,

       The difference being this is on US soil. It hits home differently. It's also a subject everyone who's taken a US history class is aware of. We haven't had hundreds of thousands of drafted troops die fighting ISIS. The same can't be said about Nazi's. This shouldn't be some partisan issue.

       "defending the nazi's" lol.  Pretty sure people are saying this isnt the end of the world and does not justify a full blown media frenzy. It is happening for a reason. What we see in mainstream media is 100% controlled and scripted. Now ask yourself why now? Why is this getting so much attention now? Do you think these people are all just coming out of the closet? No they have always been there. You can bitch about a dude hitting a crowd with a car all u want, why dont you also bitch about the daily murders in Chicago? Why not bitch about the American illegal invasion of the middle east and the current proxy war in Syria killing thousands and sending millions into refugee status? I'll tell you why, because you are a brainwashed cunt. that's why.

       yeah, the main point though is that this is not something that should be causing a media frenzy. That's it. Fucking send the idiot to jail and ignore the other dumb fucks and move on with your day. They are whipping the populace into a frenzy on purpose to distract from what is really going on...The illegal invasion and bombing of the middle east.

       What are you talking about? Both of those stories were huge news when they happened. The one with the bikers in NYC went viral almost immediately. It made national headlines and was reported by almost every MSM outlet.

       Yeah I remember you now too, you were the guy who resorts to childish insults when proven wrong. If I reported you and you were banned, then maybe you'll have learned your lesson now and won't act like a child again.

       They were ignored in this context, they couldn't politicize it, I remember you also ignore inconvenient facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Manhattan car bowling was done by a Hispanic person high on PCP, so the media ignored it as they couldn't make it political. The media wasn't egging Trump to denounce Hispanics for the act of one individual on PCP. The media wasn't urging Trump to denounce Range Rover guy's political affiliation for running over those bikes because he feared for his safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they're doing that for this white supremacist and everyone else in that fringe group because of political reasons. I don't disagree with the fact what this guy did was wrong, it's a shitty thing to do. If this was domestic terrorism, then so was the Manhattan guy plowing through people.  All I ask is that the media be consistent, the virality of the videos are irrelevant, in any case the link I posted has 420 views, hardly viral if you ask me.

      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post is just pointless ranting so I won't bother quoting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also point out that the NYC biker gang incident happened in 2013 and is totally irrelevant to what happened over the weekend. Although the Times Square incident is not as old, it is also irrelevant to what happened in Charlottesville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems you're desperately grasping at straws in order to deflect. This thread is not about a 2013 road rage incident in NYC. Maybe that's why you're ignored? Which is something I should probably consider doing too

       How are they unrelated? They're both involving a driver plowing into a crowd of people and injuring them. The only difference, the reason the media isn't going haywire over these stories, is because there's no political motivation. I thought I made that clear.

       Isn't it wrong to hate though? Why is hatred and bigotry towards a minority group ok, but not towards others? Seems a bit hypocritical to me, not that I defend their actions or what they stand for, nor do I care, just looking at things objectively.

       Man reading through the comments here is very difficult. I completely agree with you OP. It's sad to see people split up by bullshit racism when we should be banding together to build the middle class. Unfortunately your labeled racist if you try and downplay these events. I'm sick of the lack of focus by the American people while the middle class deteriorates.

       Yes...this is a form of terrorism...YES...and then?
      </p>
      <p>
       The left continues to make more and more demands...this time, not really concerned with the incident it self, but more so that we are all pointing out that it's home grown terrorism...and he's white!  AH! Logic being that every time there is "Islamic-terror"...we have to call it islamic terror...but this time, we dont even call it "terrorism" correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the left trying so hard to place a label on an event?  Because their ultimate goal is to seal the deal and paint the patriots in this country as the terrorist-extremists...sounds fine, until you realize that they want to blackball and lump anyone they don't like into that group.

       The fact that thousands of pro-Nazi people are coming out from hiding and participating in public events like this (and to be clear, they are 100% within their rights to do so), is what makes people think that "the Nazis/KKK are coming back". It's hard not to draw parallels when you see pictures like

       Implying that it was just one person driving a car into one other person is incredibly dishonest and it's disgusting that you minimize the intent here. As you can see clearly from

        this drone footage

       , that piece of shit drove his car into a crowd of about 100 people. It is lucky that only 1 person died and I'm sure that asshole will be disappointed to have only murdered one American.

       When the truck drove into the crowd in Nice, did you consider that a 'tiny ass problem'? Were you telling everyone that they shouldn't worry about ISIS or Muslims etc?

       These "Nazis" remind me of the neo-Nazis from the 80s and 90s--8/10 were either informants or agents.

       Instead of going after the evil elite, we are being played against each other. It reminds me of BLM getting riled up about cases like Michael Brown instead of obvious cases of police misconduct. It made it white vs. black instead of everybody against abuse of power. Now these guys are in the streets fighting with wooden swords and shields while the criminal elite laugh all the way to the bank.

       That's the biggest conspiracy of all.  We, as a society, love the charade.  You and me might want peace, stability, freedom, and justice, but most people just want to feel engaged and have whoever their daddy is take care of everything.  Oh that and an enemy to hate.

       I'm pretty sure this isn't the first issue we've had in recent history with Nazi's lately... In fact they've been trashing Jewish cemeteries all over the place around here since January, so you can't even pull the fake news card on me for this one. Neo-Nazi's are an issue that is just now coming to a head. Bury your head in the sand all you want, but it's not fixing anything and it's not a conspiracy.

       "It's easier to fool a man than to convince him he's been fooled." - Mark Twain
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid we have to convince a bunch of people they've been fooled, which is just tough as hell because people are egoistic and prideful and don't want to admit they've been fooled. Or can they move to the next level in a way where they don't have to realize it, but instead can just adopt a new paradigm? Maybe that would be the trick. I'd rather people just become aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps a trick where for like 3 hours everyone thinks the situation is far more serious than it is, somehow? Make the modern condition incredibly obvious, to everyone all at once. Still seems like a big gamble and I don't even know what it'd be, really

       Civil war would be better than continuing ont he path we are on under this bi-partisan oligarchy. The system is not ever going to fix itself, that is a pipe dream. Like spilt liquid in your keyboard, you could clean it well, but you will never get it all out. We need a new Constitutional Convention to replace most the existing Governors then restructure the federal Government and return it to the people instead of the corporations and financial upper .05%.

       I've not yet watched much media on it and i'd not be surprised if they're blowing things out of proportion, but wanting us to take sides?  As opposed to what?  Yeah the guy drove a car into them, but lets not forget how they kinda deserved it a little?  How can we not take sides?

       I would like to know who told the police to let fighting happen at all and not to video tape and arrest anyone committing assault. And who's idea was it to let these to groups meet. There almost as many people with cameras as there where with shields and clubs. Who decided shields and clubs where the weapons of the day? I don't think we've seen racism and fighting like this since the 70's unless you count the governments crack down on the crack they where selling to inner city blacks to fund a illegal war but thats more the government vs the people not really the people vs the people. Unless this was setup by the government to unite the people against the enemy of right wing Nazi's and it's all propaganda to get us to band together the fight the people who keep killing people on our streets.

       Of course it's not a coincidence, but the point is over emphasized to the point of ridiculousness. Do you think Nazis are the only ones who want to kill others because of their ideology, or something? You can't erase an entire ideology form the earth, it doesn't work that way. And these are people with a serious victimhood complex, so persecution only makes them feel more justified.

       all these comments are honestly trying to bury you from your original point. I was getting so caught up thinking about this that I forgot about the EVERY DAY problems people are going through and that everyone wants to forget that  there are problems we can fix with the amount of attention that these crazy planned issues get on a daily and forever basis.

       I know about Operation Paperclip and how the bushes funded the Nazis, but associating one random guy with that is a real reach, imo. These guys are hicks that are LARPing, they have nothing to do with these high level operations that were all 50 years ago

       "defending the nazi's" lol.  Pretty sure people are saying this isnt the end of the world and does not justify a full blown media frenzy. It is happening for a reason. What we see in mainstream media is 100% controlled and scripted. Now ask yourself why now? Why is this getting so much attention now? Do you think these people are all just coming out of the closet? No they have always been there. You can bitch about a dude hitting a crowd with a car all u want, why dont you also bitch about the daily murders in Chicago? Why not bitch about the American illegal invasion of the middle east and the current proxy war in Syria killing thousands and sending millions into refugee status? I'll tell you why, because you are a brainwashed cunt. that's why.

       yeah, the main point though is that this is not something that should be causing a media frenzy. That's it. Fucking send the idiot to jail and ignore the other dumb fucks and move on with your day. They are whipping the populace into a frenzy on purpose to distract from what is really going on...The illegal invasion and bombing of the middle east.

       I originally provided a Google search, which the person I was replying to poo-poo'd as showing too many different things, so I picked the first one, sourced it (so you can see the forum conversation it came from was specifically showing Challenger brake lights). Apparently you want to defend the argument about the top-center windshield light which has nothing to with what I'm pointing out. I guess you didn't understand or are choosing not to.

       Actual Nazis? Probably stand for being dead and/or dying. Todays morons that attribute to Nazi ideology? Misguided nationalism and extreme levels of ignorance/stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual Nazis, or the old heads of the Nazi part in Germany had a very specific goal in terms of the "final solution" and the creation of a massive Germanic state following the eradication of non-Germans in their relative region and the enslavement of slavs and others. Also potentially world conquest, but immediately just to take over land and slaughter everyone they didn't like in their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you mean what the general Nazi stood for, it was all kind of bs to conceal Hitler's actual (next level insane) goals.

       I honestly wonder if the people defending James Alex Fields Jr. ever read their post out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean would they ever go into a social setting - like a happy hour at a bar or a lunch with coworkers or a picnic after church - and blurt out:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One guy runs his car in to one person, and the media is acting like nazis are back and civil war is on the horizon. It's beyond absurd
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If the answer is no, then I hope they realize that they advocating noxious opinions due to the anonymity of the of the internet that they would say in real life because their friends and family would think they are assholes.

       You finished your comment with reaction bait. Try to be more reasonable, and then once you get that down, try to be agreeable.

       Of course. No way people could really be outraged that Nazis killed people.  No way on a website made up of almost exclusively of millenials,would said site be against the hard right ideology that they voted against in 48/50 states last November

       If you look at the images labeled brake you can see that the outer lights in
       <strong>
        both
       </strong>
       images do not change in brightness (compare to the "running" images on the left). This clearly is showing a comparison of the inner left (Stage 1/2) and inner right (stock) — thus, the inner lights are the brake lights.

       Have you ever actually read ISIS literature? Bombing them isn't what drives them. It doesn't hurt obviously, but they explicitly state that their mission is jihad and the establishment of the caliphate. Vengeance is just a bonus.

       All this event shows about cops is that they are the servants of corporate interest at the stake of the public good. Weep not for the cops, weep for yourselves.

       Torches are fine. Weapons obviously are not. 
It's the job of the police to prevent the use of weapons, not the group's ideological opponents. I do not support political violence in the United States.
