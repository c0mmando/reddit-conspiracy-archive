<p>Season 3 Episode 1 when he watches 9/11 happen on the news. &quot;NO! They are going to use this as an excuse to take away our rights.&quot;</p>

<p>Season 3 Episode 3 with Pickle Rick. He went on a short rant explaining 9/11 was an inside job. Don&#39;t have the full quote, but its in the start of the episode.</p>

<p>Season 3 Episode 4. He keeps wanting to talking about Israel, saying its &quot;The greatest evil that is never mentioned.&quot; He does go on a bit, while drunk, but tells how it&#39;s shunned to talk about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the writers are wanting to Red Pill a show with a massive growing fan base. </p>

<p>Its either that or turn Rick into a Conspiracy theorist. Since Rick is seen as an always correct genius, it looks good.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting people talking, so its&#39; a start.</p>

<p>There are other quotes with Rick rambling about things like such, so if you know it, post it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Who cares? Global acts of terrorism happen every day, Morty! I&#39;m a pickle!&quot;, is what he said I believe.</p>

<p>If you read it again, he&#39;s not saying who cares because it&#39;s not important, but because it isn&#39;t special. There are dozens of 9/11s happening every year, just more prolonged and spread out since the first one. But they&#39;re all the same, done by the same people. The same who brought down the towers, which he thinks was an inside job. He pretty much confirms and expands his original statement.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s what I got from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I heard it as &quot;who cares if it was?&quot; As in people need to learn from it and move on instead of staying stuck in a day ~16 years ago. We never left the Shoneys, so Rick had to fabricate what he thinks normal people would remember as significant moments in their life. Why would 9/11 have been significant to him? He has access to infinite timelines, has a device that can transport him to any place in any universe, and is a terrorist himself. 9/11 is a tool to him to get people&#39;s attention.</p>

(Ra is said to be an Avian race) </p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A drunk supervillain who thinks it&#39;s fun to play Saw when he&#39;s drunk who can do literally anything says that there is a true evil that <em>he</em> feels powerless to stop and only mentions when drunk. </p>

<p>I was thinking its a dig on the show&#39;s creators. Like, Rick knows his universe is a Jew-run universe, because he knows that he&#39;s in a cartoon on cartoon network in our world, because he&#39;s Rick, and so he wants to live, but the only way to do so is to continue making the show awesome, so he stops being basically a god in his universe, goes to earth, finds an entertaining family (luckily his own estranged daughter&#39;s), makes Morty his sidekick, and goes on weekly adventures that he both seems to mostly hate, and grudgingly accept. I was thinking that him confessing his powerlessness in the face of Israel when he is drunk is because he is Rick fucking Sanchez, he is nigh all-powerful, and he is beholden to some gross and, to him I&#39;m sure, weak little expression of perverted power that is Israel. He has to sing and dance for people he hates, to stop his life, his ambitions, his true calling, in order to go and play fun time science babysitter adventure grandpa for ratings. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very loose theory, I know. </p>

<p>The actual artist/creayor who voices both Rick and Morty is Justin Roiland and I think he is a little more open to thinking critically.</p>

<p>I am afraid they will fight and Dan will end the show. He invited that anto Trump newscaster or whoever on as a writer after they made the Baron Trump autism joke. Of course that was honestly prob not serious, but I could see his predeliction for sjw/establishment thinking being at odds with his freedom to joke about anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not the writers. Dan Harmon is kind if anti PC, but also kind of an SJW. He is the man who made the show happen bevause it is brilliant. However the CREATOR, who created the concept and characters and voices both Rick and Morty seems very woke and controversial.</p>

<p>There was a short clip of Rick and Summer stomping a nazi released by dan Harmon a day or two after the attack, but I think it was without Roilands voicing and maybe without audio period. Not that I disagree that nazi are bad, but I disagree with perpetuating violence and the &quot;punch a nazi (hopefully you are smart enough not to misidentify someone as one)&quot; narrative.</p>

<p>They have gotten into fights (i believe one delayed season 3?) and Harmon is notoriously hard to work with which scares me because I think Rick and Morty will meet the same abrupt ending with people begging for more. Harmon has a tendency to go off. I appreciate him delivering Roiland and the show though.</p>

And if was trying to &quot;redpill&quot; people on this subject, he probably wouldn&#39;t use Rick, an unstable, cynical, selfish, alcoholic asshole. </p>

<p>As for the delay, he said it was due to just taking way too long to write the script. Which makes sense considering he is a notorious procrastinator. There were times apparently on the set of Community where they wouldn&#39;t get the scripts until the last second. He openly admitted to being months late on pilot scripts for major networks.

<p>Season 3 Episode 3 with Pickle Rick. He went on a short rant explaining 9/11 was an inside job. Don&#39;t have the full quote, but its in the start of the episode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s not at all how the scene goes. he says, &quot;what more do you want from me, i&#39;m a pickle and 9/11 was an inside job?&quot; &quot;was it?!&quot; &quot;who cares!! international terrorism happens every day!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Season 3 Episode 4. He keeps wanting to talking about Israel, saying its &quot;The greatest evil that is never mentioned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

Again you are really not representing the scene correctly. For one, Rick really does not want to talk about it, which actually much more effectively shows how taboo the subject is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dan Harmon, he delivered the creator and became co creator.</p>

<p>The actual artist/creayor who voices both Rick and Morty is Justin Roiland and I think he is a little more open to thinking critically.</p>

<p>I am afraid they will fight and Dan will end the show. He invited that anto Trump newscaster or whoever on as a writer after they made the Baron Trump autism joke. Of course that was honestly prob not serious, but I could see his predeliction for sjw/establishment thinking being at odds with his freedom to joke about anything.</p>
