<p>If anyone challenges them, they will ask for smoking gun proof knowing damn well that smoking gun proof in this Tom Clancy novel we are living in is hard to come by and so we must rely on circumstantial evidence. Even when smoking gun evidence is shown, they make some outlandish claim to cover Soros. For example, if someone was to post Soros abusing kids in a Satanic ritual, the sympathizers would claim someone edited in Soros face to frame him for some unknown reason. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t interested in finding out the truth. They are interested in protecting Soros! And how does Soros control such loyal slaves? Hint: $25 per hour. </p>

They same powers that are behind the events I just mentioned are the same powers behind America&#39;s current race war. Not Soros.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soros has been running fake protestors ever since Trump was elected and he uses George Soros Jr to represent him on the ground floor. </p>

<p>This whole protest looks orchestrated. There was a Craigslist ad for fake protestors a week before in some nearby city where they used busses to transport them into the protest area. All those tiki torches look like something straight from Hollywood. Those dudes were given those torches to add suspense. That man who drove into the crowd was most likely a puppet of higher powers. The ordinary citizen doesn&#39;t do stupid shit like that. Why would someone risk life in jail for pretty much nothing? The driver reminds me of that guy in James Alafantes pizza shop that shot and destroyed a computer pretending to be upset over the Pizzagate scandal. It turned out he was nothing but a shill just like that guy driving the car. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all right there in front of you. If you only look, you will see it. </p>

<p>Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state. “Let’s not allow Soros to have the last laugh” say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nazi racists are are just as ignorant as Soros who actually worked for the Nazi regime as a young man.</p>

<p>Soros himself said he worked for the Nazis and did not feel bad for harming the Jews on Nazi orders. He figured someone was going to hurt the Jews anyway so it may as well be him. </p>

<p>After realizing that he admitted to all this on live television through the 60 Minutes show, he tried to ban the interview from the public. Luckily it later surfaced so we could all see who this monster truly is. He even admits that he is both good and evil. I guess it depends on his mood. Watch him admit all this here:</p>
