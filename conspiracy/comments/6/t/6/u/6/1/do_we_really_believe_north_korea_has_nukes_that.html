    <div class="md"><p>Just my speculation, but I feel like we would have some sort of missle defense system before anything reaches mainland US(sorry Guam and Hawaii). Maybe I have too much faith in our weapons systems, but it seems like the secret programs are always 10-15 years ahead of anything the public knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about that earlier. Someone was claiming our missile defenses were like 60% effective. I believe they were referring to something like the THAAD system we gave S. Korea. I highly doubt we are giving anyone our best secret equipment. Then again our next fighter jet is apparently a trillion dollars pile of shit, so who knows lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep Thaad interceptors have about 50%-60% success rates in tests, but you can also launch more then one at an incoming missile. While Russia could obviously over saturate the system, North Korea stockpile is estimated under 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know. I agree the rhetoric is not good, but Trump always had a no-nonsense stance against NK. I mean he&#39;s doing exactly what he said he would do in 1999.   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1WE-ivtO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1WE-ivtO4</a>     Of course Kim jung IL was in power then, but Kim jung in has been keeping pace with his old man on empty threats to get what they want.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the evidence is pretty clear. The problem is we have extensive missile defense systems that could easily take them down. That&#39;s why all the paranoia is fake.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been quite surprised by Tillerson calling for calm on this. Actually, I&#39;ve been really surprised by Tillerson overall, because he seems to be generally level-headed compared to most of the people that have occupied his position in recent years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t believe they could actually hit us if they were capable due to our own defense system but it&#39;s the trying that would be an act of war which would concern people. </p>

<p>And with Tillerson, I agree. I was totally surprised/impressed by his hardlined stances that didn&#39;t necessarily line up with Trump&#39;s rhetoric. The cynical side of me says it could be posturing and Tillerson may just be a little smarter about public presentation than the rest but who knows. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m just curious, what exactly is the evidence? I&#39;m just extremely scrutinous of things that may lead to justification for war. USS Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, Iraq etc. I think hindsight is 20/20 but history loves to repeat itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like Iran, who here thinks Iran wouldn&#39;t get instantly nuked after launching a nuke at another country.  Fuck, multiple countries might react!  </p>

<p>I picture them putting a gun to their own head when we hear this bullshit.  It&#39;s a death sentence.....its annihilation within hours if they chose to do so.  </p>

<p>That was one of the arguments for everyone having nukes, with everyone having nukes, no one would dare use any because the rest would nuke the first one to start shit.  It&#39;s fucking stupid.</p>

<p>For all the people who hate Iran and Korea, they should be wanting this, they probably wouldn&#39;t be able to hit us and our retaliation would destroy them.</p>

<p>I think this is them taking a breather and buying time because they couldn&#39;t make Russiagate stick.  Now they&#39;re on to other things, namely getting Trump to react just like any other president before him.  Starting wars and drone striking people......if they can do that, they can manipulate him almost entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is that even if they have the capability to reach mainland US, would they launch? The assertion in the mass media that Kim is a madman who does not care about his own annihilation makes no sense. Despots crave power and being dead does not really achieve that.

<p>so let&#39;s say north korea sends all their missiles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all the analysis we need to do. North Korea has, at best, a handful of missiles. Maybe if they launched all of them at LA, a single one might have a chance to get through, but I sincerely doubt it. </p>

<p>And then North Korea gets nuked into oblivion by every civilized nation on the planet.</p>

<p>I suppose if you genuinely believe Kim Jong Un wants to have his people all die in nuclear hell, this might be a plausible scenario. Otherwise, it&#39;s not happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im starting to think that the Korea bullshit is the distraction from the US invading Venezuela. I knew Korea was a distraction from something I just didn&#39;t know what. But after those comments Trump made yesterday I feel like this could be it. He has talked about MS 13 specifically which seemed kind of random to me but there are a ton of MS 13 leaders in Venezuela which just so happens to be very convenient if Trump wanted to invade. Venezuela not only has oil and tons of natural resources but also one of the biggest cobalt reserves, and you know what cobalt is used for. The dots are connecting. </p>
