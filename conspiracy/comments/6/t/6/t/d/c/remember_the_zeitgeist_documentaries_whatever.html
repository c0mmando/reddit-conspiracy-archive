       "It was debunked" is a great trick. Imagine if something important came to light. In the comments all you will see is shill accounts saying, "this has been debunked."

       so I just spent about 20 min reading through just the part II debunking.  And have derived from just that section that this is the best shill crap i have ever read.  He uses the examples of buildings 1 and 2 to I'll illustrate how 7 fell.

       I didn't read it ao i cannot  comment.  I can say however that the concept of the super-uber-ultra rich-powerful running the world as a "shadow government" is overwhelming abundantly clear.  So any attempt to "logically debunk" it is either a shill shilling or gross incompetence.

       Ok, ok... I hear the underwhelming sarcasm in your simple reply.  Let me give you something to consider.  Bare with me, I will make my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all the past presidential debates and in countless pundant and media personalities you have heard time and time again the issues of budget.  What our country can and cannot pay for.  I won't expand too much on the details, but the small item include universal healthcare and welfare and roads, infrastructure and utilities and things like clean water.  Or even the individual income tax and tax rates for the rich and poor.  All these topics surround money and the lack of it.  The inability to provide universal care for all our citizens because the expense would be outrageous!! Quality care and quality pay???!!!  It would be like 15 Billion a year!!! NO WAY!! we dont have the money.  Reduce taxes for the poor?  NO WAY  we cannot afford it. And so on...Money, Money, Money, Money....
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what I think about when I hear that? But that  NEVER gets brought up in any MSM, or politician, or candidate?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one ever asks Why we need to tax so much.  Why we have no budget for the benefitof all.  Well they do gloss over it.  They say things like "We got to pay our debt."  But do you know what they mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know the Federal Reserve is a private bank.... A PRIVATE Bank.  A Private bank that nominated itself in the 1920s to be THE bank to control ALL the money in America.  And REQUIRED all dollars, every penny, to be loaned, AT INTEREST, to the government amd thus the America people.  And over time We The People, have come to bear the weight of continuous spending to the point that today just the interest payment on that debt, to a private bank mind you, is around $380 billion a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if we owned our own money and invested that "extra" $380 Billion in ourselves.  $15 billion a year for universal healthcare?  hell what if it was $50B?  Leaves us $330B left... Think it would go better to The People than line the pockets of Bankers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alas I digress...  My point to bring up the Fed is not about the money they steal.  But to consider that (Well aside from Ron Paul and maybe Bernie Sanders) that intrest payment has NEVER been spoken about in Politics.  In no President debate or any "News" show on any MSM network.  Why do you think that is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to come to my main point and how it relates to Part III.
      </p>
      <p>
       That private bank (the Federal Reserve) is private because it has an Owner.  Who do you think that owner is?  What kind of power do you think that Owner has?  Did you know that, that Owner owns other banks, in other countries.  Would you care to know that owner owns banks in virtually EVERY country in the world?  There are a few hold outs, but they are being dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, would you think that Owner and his "friends" dont talk?  You dont think they have "plans" about their business and how to keep it their business?  They own virtually  ALL the money in the WORLD and ALL that money was LOANED WITH INTEREST.  Meaning every country owes more back than exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just "MummmHummm" think those Owners, with that leverage over the world, are just Honest Businessmen trying to make a buck and that the MSM, politicians, canidates all recognize that and choose not to ever bring it up because, ya know, they are just Honest Businessmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       They Own The World and they have a plan. Plain and Simple.

       Discussion about interest payments is extremely common. It is, actually, why people like Paul Krugman were saying that we should have been doing MORE government spending while interest rates were essentially negative and the economy was struggling. Had the GOP not existed, we'd be in the place we are now economically about four years ago.

       I see this a lot. Is it specifically just the religion shit in the first one? I remember the second or third one is just about how we have more debt than money and how the Federal reserve and banks create debt and inflation.

       The first one was three parts. The first part was the Jesus conspiracy, the second one was 9/11, and the third part was banking and federal reserve conspiracies. I think it was the Jesus bit that had the most inaccuracies, though

       The 9/11 portion was very cringey, seasoned 9/11 theorists have dismissed over half the stuff they present in that for years. And most of it is still in the 2011 version of Zeitgeist, too.

       I think an intelligent person should be able to see past all of that and understand the good you can take from a video series like that.  Nothing is going to come of it, it is only ideas and the want to give information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is any one video that would apply to any and all groups of people, religiously inclined or not.  Some groups of people are built to listen to their own little realm of information, they Catholic this or whatever.  They live in that world and not much will bring them out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the purpose of the video was to get everyone into the understanding that we're all in the same manipulated boat, some will be unable to see past their bubble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally, I'm just adding to your comment here.  Credibility is important and that's why we have such muddy waters of credibility to wade through, because it is perfect cover for criminals/sick fuckers with too much power to operate in.

       It was based on single source OP style literature. Of the aliester crowly/madame blavatsky variety. It doesn't discredit the whole thing but it does make it harder to watch because it requires careful examination and is often espoused to be some gospel of the conspiracy movement.

       Eh, I've never seen a good refute for the Jesus stuff. The stuff like, "we'll he says this god was born on 25 but that's not true!!!!" when really the festival for that God was on the 25th. There's also a lot of "no sources say this" when Zeitgeist lists their primary sources so where does the "no sources" thing come from? I just think a lot of religious people can't handle that part so they say it's false info.

       See Zeitgeist Refuted on the youtube then. But it's all down to opinion. Some people don't even think Jesus existed at all, because the lack of 2000 year old peer reviewed documents. Good luck finding those.

       Well there are better ways to refute it. Like for example the lack of evidence for key people in the Bible and scholarly debates about the historicity of the Bible which have been going on for sone time. It's kind of suspect when you jump out of one ideaology and straight into another regardless of how well meaning it seems.

       The lack of evidence for key people in the Bible doesn't refute Zeitgeist. Unless you mean there are better ways to refute the Bible than the Zeitgeist argument, which I agree with but it's just another perspective. People have been saying Christianity is just zodiacal for ages, it's not new. Zeitgeist just takes that idea one step further, that all religions are zodiacal.

       Well I did mean the latter, Zeitgeist refutes Bible somewhat. My criticism comes about from as you put it - Christianity is just Zodiacal. I agree that it clearly is, Zeitgeist does make this point quite well, better than most, let's say.
      </p>
      <p>
       My criticism tends to come from where they are trying to go with these ideas. And I'm very familiar with astrology and occult stuff generally. They seem to de-emphasize the divine aspects and bring it into a sort of psycho-astrological, either paganism or a psychology - almost a kind of 'explaining it away' post-modern approach. And the reason for this, of course, is to fit it into a more leftist, communal futuristic vision for society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if that sounds excessively vague and jargon laden but that's really the core of my criticism. I think the Bible is still really answering a question about theology, man's relationship with God and is doing it in a way which includes the astrological themes and other religions as a way of acknowledging their work. But still the theme of Jesus isn't quite as simple as Mithra, Krishna and the Sun. We do also have the concept of the Logos and Greek philosophical ideas that are another layer baked into the cake. This tends to sound hierarchical which post-modern thinkers like to shy away from but still it's an aspect I think needs to be included.

       Don't worry, your point is clear and interesting. Zeitgeist does make the argument, even if implied, that because it's not historical, it's nonsense. You could definitely make the argument that people are drawn to find spiritual meaning in the stars or that there is an actual spiritual element to the stars. Also, to your point about the hierarchical aspect to religion and since this is a conspiracy sub, it's worth noting that the reason why the reformation happened was to get rid of divine right so that the non-royal elites could have a shot at the throne. It's an odd balance between needing just enough hierarchy so that someone can have power but not so much that it can't change hands.

       Well I think astrology has been almost proven scientifically - by that I mean that astrological aspects have been shown to have strong statistical correllations with human characteristics. It's hardly something I can really justify even an agnostic position towards. And so that ties in with the star myths and the ancient interest in astrology, these people were not just superstitous primitives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I talk of heirarchy, I don't mean the church and the royals etc. What I'm talking about is the idea of a spiritual hierarchy where you have this diverse spiritual realm which is structured and populated by beings of various ranks. And I'd add on that human institutions change and grow as they interact with it, or them. Human corruption is a very real problem. As well as a profaning of the sacred, wars, ateocities.
      </p>
      <p>
       In someways when you go way down this path, the conspiracy end of things just seems less scandelous and more and more obvious. Like, of course, if you have entites running around then obviously people are capable of all sorts of nefarious behavior. Many cans of worms are opened at this point.

       I've only read a little on that (if you have recommended reading/watching on that off hand it would be appreciated) but it's worth exploring I think. Like you said, Zeitgeist dismiss the idea entirely but I don't think it's a coincidence that cultures around the world revered the stars so much so that they dedicated time and resources to create "heaven on earth" so to speak. But then the question becomes, what happened? Why did this change?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with your point about conspiracies seeming less scandalous when you realize human corruption runs deep. If you tie it spiritual corruption, it's easy to see how a person can become twisted. However, not everyone who lacks a spiritual side is twisted. There are many who don't follow the spiritual side who are just normal people, which has led me to wonder if the depth of human corruption we see must be committed by a person with a spiritual nature. That is, true evil cannot exist without a spirit to corrupt. If so, spirituality becomes a dangerous game and would explain the "unforgivable sin" present in Christianity and other religions. That is, the only sin that cannot be forgiven is a corrupt soul.

       The podcast play button is mid-way through the text. I tend to follow Skeptiko pretty closely for these matters:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://skeptiko.com/renay-oshop-peer-reviewed-astrology-345/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So on evil and all that stuff. I do have a strong sense that humans are made in the image of God - even though that's a myth. That myth is crucial in setting the tone for these discussions. Adam and eve and how they ate of the forbidden fruit. The power to know good and evil. I don't know of any other model to explain our situation that that. People know right from wrong, even atheists. Animals do not, they just act according to their nature. So when God gives Adam dominion over nature, it's not just in a literal sense. Man is not just some life form subject to forces around him but already knows good and evil. The trick is in how to choose correctly and to subjugate the animal within. So we can't broadly condemn evil as some thing out there but we have to realize that process is taking place within every damn second. This is a high stakes game because the minute I am insincere about it, or I disavow my own evil by pointing only to you as evil, my demons get this free pass and drag me pretty rapidly into my own private hell - and I can personally attest to that. I admit to being a bit agnostic on the subject of God because it's all a bit too vast for me, but I'm pretty well acquainted with hell and evil. So that's what I think of as the inforgiveable sin. The blind following the blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This realization is really the whole point because we need it to understand not just good but maybe we need to understand concepts like what it means to walk in the path of righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well this does tie into your question about why we lost our traditions. The answer has been laid out by Nietzche of all people. We good so good at uncovering truth, through science, reason etc that we lost the ability to see as children anymore. We can't just be followers anymore. We can't rely on our parents or even God to make up rules just for us to pretend to follow but then wriggle out of. We have to face our choice. We're in that free fall stage of the young adult who has really left home for the first time and has to decide if his parents were telling him the truth. If you're spiritually aware at all, you can see it. You can see the corruption of the 'service to self' message out there.

       They may or may not be having meetings, but we need a Step 1. The last zeitgeist proposed an "awesome" city design, but didn't give any solution as to how we could reach a point to start building these cities.  WHAT WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR IS A STEP 1.

       a step 1, and step 1 is getting others to understand the validity of many of the concepts therein so that more and more people can come together and get behind the project.

       The 9/11 and religious sections were great, but once 2012 happened, that whole Mayan theory kinda ruined its credibility for all the other awesome things they touched on. But, still it's a great documentary, especially the second one where they talk about the banking system. They need a new one though, we could really use another.

       I'm wondering this too....I don't recall them ever talking about any 2012 Mayan theories or doomsday events. They talked about us entering a new astrological age in 2150 (I believe 2150), but nothing negative related to the new age.

        "This shit's got to go"

       monologue in the opening of Zeitgeist: Moving Forward.  It was inspiring and his subsequent take on what our culture is doing wrong seemed spot on. His "resource based" economy sounded good but he never seemed to explain exactly how it worked or how we would transition to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, every time I see or hear yet another example of systemic idiocy I hear Jacque's voice in my head, "This shit's got to go."

       The movement suffers from not really knowing how to get to the resource based economy. There's a lot of them that don't even realize how basic income and cryptocurrency can play important roles in the transition to an RBE.

       You nailed it.

      <p>
       A large group of people with no plan.  And that's not surprising.  It takes a long time to figure out a plan, and a costly dedication to spend that time.  You can't expect folks to get a clue and also suddenly know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that there are people with plans.  The plan that's going to work has to be withheld until there's a critical mass of people ready to receive it.  I think we're very close.

       It's basically just a social network for people who have vague objections to the system, but little to no idea of what is really going on. You are quite right that they mean well, and that they do not have a clear plan. Nor do they need a plan. All they need is the good feelings that come from feeling like they belong.

       Wasn't their interpretation of the Bible debunked? Much like Michael tsarions almost identical interpretation. At least that's what I recall as to why those films died out. I however enjoyed them alot. But aaron russos freedom to fascism is still the absolute best red pill IMHO. He was friends with a rockefeller and died of cancer iirc

       Peter Joseph has a lot of good work out following the success of his movies, which he admits were intended more for entertainment than education.  I'll be most people don't stick with him because he can come off a bit smug and can be a challenging listen.  Check out his talks on youtube!

       The Venus Project felt they had been hijacked by the Zeitgeist Movement and they had a falling out a few years back. Not really sure what's been going on with the Venus Project lately other than Jacque Fresco died early this year and his partner is now running it.

       Peter Joseph is still pretty active and is a somewhat common guest on RT shows. The 4th Zeitgeist installment Beyond The Pale seems dead unfortunately. Check out his Culture In Decline series on Youtube if you haven't seen it yet. He's got a book out too.

       You nailed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large group of people with no plan.  And that's not surprising.  It takes a long time to figure out a plan, and a costly dedication to spend that time.  You can't expect folks to get a clue and also suddenly know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that there are people with plans.  The plan that's going to work has to be withheld until there's a critical mass of people ready to receive it.  I think we're very close.

       It's basically just a social network for people who have vague objections to the system, but little to no idea of what is really going on. You are quite right that they mean well, and that they do not have a clear plan. Nor do they need a plan. All they need is the good feelings that come from feeling like they belong. After all, isn't that what all 'movements' are

       The 9/11 portion was very cringey, seasoned 9/11 theorists have dismissed over half the stuff they present in that for years. And most of it is still in the 2011 version of Zeitgeist, too.
