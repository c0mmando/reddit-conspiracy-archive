    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing wrong with the battle flag of Virginia. Most folks consider that the confederate flag today. It was not in the 1860&#39;s. The &quot;dixie flag&quot; that you speak of, was only used by Virginia battle companies The actual confederate flag was the &quot;stars and bars&quot; it had 2 red stripes, 1 white stripe and 13 stars. I could fly the &quot;real&quot; confederate flag all day long in liberal Seattle and they would have zero clue about what it was or means...because liberals are stupid and haven&#39;t yet figured out how to open a damned history book.

    <div class="md"><p>The flags that get placed are usually the stars and bars and the &quot;dixie&quot; flag. Mind you, &quot;dixie&quot; refers to territory south of the mason-dixon line which determines the southern border of Pennsylvania and the eastern border of Maryland. Technically, Washington DC is in Dixie, or what was (and still is) considered the &quot;south&quot;. At least by southern folk. If you don&#39;t believe me, go visit the south. The Northern climate doesn&#39;t kick in until you hit the Adirondacks. </p>

<p>I got called out at work for whistling the song known as &quot;dixie&quot;</p>

<p>When someone told me that it was offensive I replied singing:</p>

<p>Well I wish I was in the land of cotton
Where all things lost are not forgotten
look away
look away
look away
dixie land </p>

<p>I had to explain to HR that I had spent the last several decades in North Carolina and Texas, and that it was a catchy tune. </p>

<p>I have heard a dozen variations of these lyrics. I learned mine from an old timer. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that either side was wrong or right. I think that History is sanitized to promote whichever side won. Obviously, we know how that went. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad I am not the only person who had this idea tonight.  I was searching for livestreams of the event, and I couldn&#39;t find any.  </p>

<p>The first thing I try to find when looking at potential propaganda is <strong>context</strong>.  It is easy to state that there is a race riot, and then show a picture of four Nazis.  Were all of the attendees Nazis?  </p>

<p>If it truly was a race riot, why does the MSM try to pin this as an action of the &quot;right&quot;, and not racists?  </p>

<p>Even before the election MSM has been conditioning the populace to believe that moderates, center right, and Nazis are one and the same.  To the MSM, thought provoking youtubers like Stephan Molyneux are the &quot;far right&quot;, and thus, Nazis.  This type of doublespeak makes it become increasingly easy to paint a broad brush and call all conservative discussions racist, misogynistic, and homophobic.</p>

<p>I find this incredibly disconcerting, and I absolutely despise Nazis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the right label much of rhe left as SJWs and cucks. </p>

<p>Basically both groups have encouraged themselves to increase their distance from the other, maybe with outsiders helping to do this initially but certainly it&#39;s self perpetuating now. The left think the right are evil conservatives while tje right think the left are cry baby snowflakes </p>
