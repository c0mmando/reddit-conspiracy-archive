       I will admit, seeing a posting (supposedly) directly from "Crowds on Demand" (
       <a href="https://crowdsondemand.com/">
        https://crowdsondemand.com/
       </a>
       ) that was archived 1 week ago seems quite suspicious. But what does this never come up
       <em>
        beforehand
       </em>
       ? If they are so blatantly and obviously filling event with paid protesters, shouldn't it be somewhat easy to find the next "event" and try to expose what they are doing before it happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not sure of all the ways that the archiving sites work. Does it have to be a distinct user that decides to archive a page, or are their scripts that crawl websites and just archive everything?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were a distinct person, archiving those listings and exposing them right away before something happens would be a lot more helpful than posting them after the fact. Or maybe they are just getting auto archived and people are going back to search through the last few weeks?

       I think that happened here at least once... guy made a topic predicting where and when some sort of crisis situation would happen based on a couple of craigslist ads... and then it happened...

      <p>
       I don't exactly remember very well... but I think it was a bank robbery and standoff in Florida? I might be wrong though.

       Yes, someone had asked for crisis actors in Florida and the next day their was a hostage situation at a bank, saw that one myself and I'm still not really sure although I am a skeptic myself.

       all good, if thats what happens we should end up being able to expose that as well. Everything just seems a little too convenient after the fact some times.

       Are you retarded, I can walk into Wal-Mart, make a Craigslist post and verify it with a online sms or temporary email. If you try to say "there's cameras" I can just wear a hood, sunglasses and a mask the sick wear. 100% unseen

       Why the fuck would people who are holding a public rally want to pretend like their rally was a false flag? Rallies are
       <em>
        meant
       </em>
       to show people that you're there and you're doing your thing. That makes no sense. Groups who are rallying want people to know that they're rallying. That's the whole fucking point.

       It's been confirmed they're funded for Soros. Plus, the far left (antifa) is heavily organized as well, an organization. In contrast, the alt right isn't really at all. It's basically everyone who opposes them, but doesn't want to be singled out into a group. Some support the white nationalist movement, others just free speech, and everything in between.

       Sure, it was really weird.  I went to a bar in my neighborhood and a friend of mine was talking to a guy outside.  He seemed friendly enough at first and then the conversation turned to the protests.  He said that he was a 'first responder' and a shooting that happened at one of the protests.  Said he watched the guy die and he was convinced the cops shot him.  At that point I was getting a little wary and asked how long he'd been an EMT.  He said he wasn't an actual EMT, he hadn't gotten the certification yet, and started getting evasive.  I flat out asked who paid him to do his job and he told me that was a very capitalist attitude and that he was what was  called a street medic.  Her had medical supplies in a bag and he went to events as his social conscience directed.  At that point I realized he was completely full of shit.  The conversation went back to the protests, and how the cops shot the guy, and that he felt more afraid of the cops than anyone else.  Said he keep a gun in his car, for the cops, and that's when I left.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked his name up when I got home, he was part of the protest to remove the Confederate flag in South Carolina, had previously been arrested, and was on a terror watch list.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was pretty surreal.  I just thought, holy shit, how many people like this are out there?

       Yes, I secretly videotaped the entire thing. In 4K.  My production team is editing it together.

      <p>
       That's exactly what it felt like.  I don't give a shit who believes me, it happened.  I actually emailed our mutual friend the next day to apologize for leaving so abruptly, the cop comment pissed me off, she said she didn't know him that well and he was known for working peoples' nerves.

       Probably more used for political photo-ops and seat filling than rioters. Capitalism will fill any void that is profitable I guess. I would imagine (no real sources, just seems the simplest option) that paid protesters are a small part of what you see at any event.

       You just said that capitalism will fill any void.  Now you say that Russian shills don't exist because... why?  What kind of logic is that?  You say that he doesn't think that shills or online PR management don't exist.  Then you go on to say that Russia, a country with vast resources, doesn't employ those same techniques?  I don't get your reasoning.

       There is only so much they can do. When the world revolved around TV, there where only so many TV sources. "alternative" music, sound, and video had by nature a very very limited audience, because it could never have a large distribution network, because there was a monopoly on those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with the internet, its possible for anyone to have a global reach for distribution, and its easy to scale your distribution network. The amount of capital needed for mainstream penetration is small, and the talent pool is large.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are no more technical limitations. Therefor the old system needs new ways to keep peopled in a walled garden. They have their new ways, but they will never be as effective.

       What does any of that have to do with the existence of online PR? If anything you just made an argument for why establishment media would use shills, since they need to control the "alternative" viewpoint the internet allows for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you dedicated an entire paragraph to how easier they have it today requiring less capital, less talent investment, etc.... then you finish by saying they have fewer resources?
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it, has their need for capital decreased and market penetration easier... or are they rendered ineffective now due to less capital?

       If you have a billion dollar business you aren't going to "just give it up". Reddit is owned by Conde Naste. That is an advertising firm, so you can guess whats part of PR and advertising.

       what would be grounds for a lawsuit? I dont think there are any laws that state you cannot be paid to go to a protest. You still have to respect the laws of the land you are in, and if you violate those laws and get maced (don't take this as a defense of the cops), then you have no grounds for a lawsuit.

       Yeah when you request a quote, in their examples of why you might need a crowd it's pretty obviously BS.  Listing "Protests" as their first use is a little on the nose.  That'd probably be more of a skunk work expensive "need to know" someone service they offer, not advertised as the first use on their site.

       Agree with you here that is an over-used response here, however, this sub has clearly been besieged with what appears to be bots or agenda driven paid redditors for quite a few months now. The sidebar even has a link to the tactics and objectives used by people looking to take over a forum:

       This sub appears to be manipulated in order that people no longer use it anymore out of frustration. To be honest, it's working on me to an extent as I used to visit often, the Trump is good/bad endless nonsense has really made this place quite tedious in recent months. Of course, it could be that a new influx of users are genuinely interested in reading about how good/bad/indifferent Trump is, but my feeling is that this place will soon be bots/paid posters from both sides talking among their multiple fake accounts, upvoting the same talking points until everybody else leaves.

       Some of the posts recently from people apparently interested in the topic of "conspiracy theories" just seem, to be polite,"ill-suited" to posting here. Whatever theories you may or may not believe, at least people here were once of the consensus that things need to be questioned. Now it seems to be a case of "yeah, but that side should be questioned more". Again, I could be wrong and maybe it's just me who is feeling this as I've always lurked and read rather than comment or contribute on regularly. Can anybody recommend any other conspiracy(ish) forums?

       You are right. I think the "paid protesters" have other ways of communicating and so we never see a real ad. Often though no such paid protesters are needed. Plenty of people who will willing protest.

       This conspiracy theory really seems to be aimed at discrediting counter-movements but is ultimately a very weak argument. Keep asking questions and best of luck to you.

       Well both sides know that there are infiltrators in their midst. Both sides know that their views are not shared by the majority of Americans. In this realm then it is necessary to discredit and minimize the opposition to make them seem fake while what they represent is real. I cannot imagine that organized efforts to discredit any movement, be it the Standing Rock movement or the Neo-Nazis movement, would use things like Craigslist. Psyop campaigns are real, I believe, but the idea they would use ziprecruitor or craigslist is beyond me.

       There are records of similar behavior especially in the fight against communism. But again the method was to find sympathetic people from within the machine, not just random people who after doing their work might make public the arrangement.

       These are made to discredit opponents. I've seen it done for at least 3-4 different protests to date, as well as fake ads offering retainers for paid protestors and fake sites like

       so basically if we were to reply and see if we get a conversation going about actually trying to do it, that could help prove whether it was a bs listing or actual recruiting?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess one could say that all of the ones on craigslist are BS (unless anyone has actually verified by signing up), however it wouldnt be that surprising if that company really did find employees this way. As far as I can tell from their website, they are a real company and if they offer the service they need to staff people some how.

       Yes, but you'd have to actually find a random Craiglist ad like this in advance. The story accompanying this one is that it was taken down right away iirc, which I don't really buy. You can post one, screenshot, delete too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the name of that company used as proof that fake ads could be real, so seeing it in an ad doesn't necessarily tell us anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted to look into this you'd need a way of crawling the site 24/7 looking for keywords.
