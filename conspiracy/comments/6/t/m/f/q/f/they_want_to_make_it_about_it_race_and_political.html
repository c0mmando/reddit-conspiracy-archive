    <div class="md"><p>What ideology? Like Communisim, Socialism, Dictatorship, Oligarchy, all of those still exist, See NK, Venezuela, Cuba, U.S., Philippines, with predictably bad results. No system of governance is perfect, Russian style Marxist communism led to a lot of death and oppression, as did Nazi Germany, but from a purely economic point of view they were successful. The U.S. has plenty of bloodshed on it&#39;s hands, particularly the natives, not to mention the people we nuked, and the brown people we&#39;ve slaughtered for a good while, not to mention the countless puppet dictators we&#39;ve installed that had no problem being ruthless oppressors on our behalf. However from an economic point of view it did a lot of good for us. </p>

The man was understanding; poor dude was fuckin surrounded by white people.

    <div class="md"><p>Made up boogey man? You think the KKK is a made up boogeyman? You think that Nazis are a made up boogeyman. (In America)Black people are racist towards whites as a in kind response to the brutality ignorance and oppression that they had (and sometimes still due) endure. The only reason the divide and conquer tactic works is because of plenty of white people are the ones that don&#39;t realize that they should be aligning themselves with the disenfranchised minorities. It&#39;s a tale as old as the states themselves. &quot;White&quot; wasn&#39;t an ethnicity until the elite decided they couldn&#39;t have indentured servants rising against them with the slaves. So they divided them by fooling the people of many different cultural and ethnic backgrounds from europe (who all happened to be fair skinned) that the dark ones were responsible for their plight. Thus the strictly American &quot;white race&quot; was born. Still to this day it is like this, I can guarantee that any non-white disenfranchised group would be glad to work together with disenfranchised whites to solve the problem that is the elite. The same cannot be said of the other side. They have already decided that the solution is genocide. Fact of the matter is the NOW disenfranchised whites brought this upon themselves by not standing up for the disenfranchised minorities that rightfully shared this country and allowing the elites to fuck them raw. Had the mistreatment of FELLOW AMERICANS been curbed at race we would not now be seeing it at the economic level. The cherry on top is the fact that once again the plight of the disenfranchised white is being blamed on minorities while the elite steady stay balls deep in them so much in fact that they are able to control their arm into pushing a button that makes them vote against their own interests. </p>

<p>TLDR: Divide and conquer has worked incredibly well because whites have been brainwashed into thinking that non-whites are the root of the problem. Someone on the left is more readily willing to work with ALL disenfranchised groups to reach a solution where as the alt-right has already chose their solution. Displacement or death.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, have you read some of the comments on YouTube recently from people who are black (or, to be fair, people who are posing as being black)?</p>

<p>There&#39;s really vitriolic racism on both sides. I&#39;m white and from the UK so I admit that my own bias might skew my perspective, however, it appears that there are constant narratives in the mainstream and popular YouTube videos that promote ideas, such as, non-whites cannot be racist towards white people. The idea being something like &quot;power + privilege = racism&quot;, therefore it&#39;s acceptable to make sweeping statements that all white people are evil but that can&#39;t be labelled as &quot;racism&quot;. Also, all white people are being told they have the original sin of &quot;white privilege&quot; so even if a white person from a poor economic background succeeds, it&#39;s not because they worked hard or may have had a more difficult time than a black middle-class person who was encouraged to learn. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t believe this narrative is coming from the majority of black people. Personally, I believe most people just want to spend time with their friends and family, make a living doing something they enjoy. To be proud of your skin colour or to attack someone for theirs I find insane. Being proud of something you have no control over is not something I want to identify with as a value. Being sucked into caring about social groups and not the individual just seems so backward. There are tons of great black people, white people, Asian people, Muslims etc. and there&#39;s an equal amount of hateful people from all those groups.</p>

<p>you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone on the left is more readily willing to work with ALL disenfranchised groups to reach a solution</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not consider myself on the left or the right, but in terms of policy I would say people would say I am on the left, but the so-called &quot;progressive left&quot; are a huge part of the problem at the moment and are actually the reason for the rise of the alt-right. Shutting down free speech just causes people to start thinking &quot;why are these people being shut down - maybe they have something interesting to say&quot; or causes them to double-down as they are having their voice taken away (or at least it&#39;s perceived to have been taken away).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the move towards group think that the left seems to want. It seems to be &quot;tolerate all opinions but any that differ from ours&quot;. Honestly, how is it acceptable that a black person who says &quot;I can achieve anything and won&#39;t blame my failings on society&quot; be called disgusting slurs, such as &quot;coon&quot; and &quot;uncle Tom&quot; or accused of &quot;internalised racism&quot; or &quot;self-hate&quot; by black and white leftists alike? So, not willing to be accept the apparent narrative from the left means black conservatives are supporting &quot;white supremacy&quot;.</p>

<p>I actually think that many of these so-called progressive leftists are more racist than those on the racist right. At least the right view people of colour as a capable threat, the leftist &quot;ally&quot; seems to regard PoC as a group of perpetual victims in need of pity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not from the US, so I can only speak from what I read online. I live in London and fortunately, the racial division doesn&#39;t seem to be anywhere near as bad as the US. Are you sure that there are really the number of alt-right racists though? I&#39;ve seen videos online where groups of people have been called &quot;&quot;white supremacist protesters&quot; by counter protesters and the mainstream media, but when a reporter went over and asked the group they were adamant they weren&#39;t white supremacists or against PoC.</p>

<p>As I said, I could be looking through my own distorted lens of the world so could be focussing on what is only a small, but vocal element of pages I&#39;ve visited in the last few months. From my outsider perspective, it does seem that the US police need to be reigned in. I believe there are cases where both poor black and white citizens are abused by police with seemingly no repercussions. These incidents need to be called out by all races too. If these policemen were trained to not have some siege &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality and actually faced prison time for their actions then I could see how this would go a long way towards rooting out distrust of the police. At the same time, calling for the killing of police only gives the police justification in their own minds that it is &quot;us vs them&quot;,</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t have to be said in 2017 either, but judging anybody on anything other than their ideas is stupid. At the same time, ideas should be up for debate as long as criticism is civil and not personal attacks. Sorry for the long post, but it&#39;s disappointing that in 2017 the idea of the individual is being replaced by social group. Hopefully the remainder of the year will see less division between races, sexes and beliefs and more people will start to look at who avoids scrutiny while social groups are pitted against one another.</p>

If you could strategize, and act through proxy, you could hide your real organization from the world and pull the strings much like they do.</p>

<p>then, after the final battle is one, allow them to meet like the soviets and the allies in WW2 D-day, then they wipe each other out out of hatred, and you send a core of your most elite warriors to finish off whomever survives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;white&quot; supremacy would be similar to black supremacy in that the ENTIRE GROUP bands together to empower each other.</p>

<p>it cannot be considered &quot;white&quot; supremacy unless these elites are going door to door making sure each white has a job and better education; if government and economic positions are not relegated out by some totally white conspiracy.</p>

<p>just because the few dictators and string pullers happen to be white does not make it &#39;white supremacy&#39;</p>

<p>its the same reason hitler killing the jews was wrong -- its not because some jews aren&#39;t evil and pulling strings -- they well might be -- its that the guy off the street who is poor and has no job has ABSOLUTELY NO PART OR SAY IN IT.</p>

<p>if he did, he wouldn&#39;t be hungry and poor, would he? he would be part of some grand conspiracy which ensures his personal advantage on at least some level.</p>

<p>My talking about 2012 isn&#39;t just about some aztec calendar calendar change seasoned with alien mythology, to me it represents a very real shift in the way counter culture was presented across the internet during that stage.</p>

<p>If you followed the types of sites back then that published the kinds of articles people are prone to link here, you would have noticed a surge of fear based articles coming out on the need to prepare.  Not necessarily because of the approach of 2012 but during the era of general frenzy and panic over a number of stories that were floating around.  </p>

<p>Remember, back then some people were certain a mass depopulation event was just around the corner. Many articles attempted to claim that the facilities FEMA uses to store mobile housing that gets deployed during disasters were actually concentration camps being prepared for the &#39;few of us that might manage to survive&#39;.</p>

The whole alt label in general is a media fabrication.  I think you&#39;ve bought in pretty heavily to the concept of &quot;alt&quot; means &quot;bad&quot;.  How about you just take in as much info as you can and judge things for yourself?  I have to assume it&#39;d be pretty obvious and in your face when you&#39;ve encountered a nazi, rather than subtle.  I think your worldview is much more paranoid than the worldview you assume belongs to a large swath of people, and its because you&#39;ve chosen to believe someone.</p>

<p>My talking about 2012 isn&#39;t just about some aztec calendar calendar change seasoned with alien mythology, to me it represents a very real shift in the way counter culture was presented across the internet during that stage.</p>

<p>If you followed the types of sites back then that published the kinds of articles people are prone to link here, you would have noticed a surge of fear based articles coming out on the need to prepare.  Not necessarily because of the approach of 2012 but during the era of general frenzy and panic over a number of stories that were floating around.  </p>

<p>Remember, back then some people were certain a mass depopulation event was just around the corner. Many articles attempted to claim that the facilities FEMA uses to store mobile housing that gets deployed during disasters were actually concentration camps being prepared for the &#39;few of us that might manage to survive&#39;.</p>

If you could strategize, and act through proxy, you could hide your real organization from the world and pull the strings much like they do.</p>

<p>then, after the final battle is one, allow them to meet like the soviets and the allies in WW2 D-day, then they wipe each other out out of hatred, and you send a core of your most elite warriors to finish off whomever survives.</p>
