        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t believe there were any deaths and maybe even no big arrests in the Seattle protest yesterday. Police were out in full force, both sides were seperated and nothing happened.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Virginia, police were told to stand down and let two pissed off sides go after each other. This isn&#39;t Virginia&#39;s first rodeo with protests by the way, so they know what can happen.</p>

<p>What did the Seattle police know that the Virginia police didn&#39;t? I don&#39;t think it takes a genius to see that two sides who hate each other are probably going to fight if they are allowed to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, it&#39;s &quot;real&quot; as there are actual people who make up the &quot;white nationalist&quot; contingent but the number of &quot;card carrying&quot; members is tiny.  The media focus on this event makes the head count seem larger than it really is, especially the hand-wringing paranoid editorials of the liberal left who make this out to be emergence of an active, widespread Nazi movement.</p>

<p>All-in-all, I think the media&#39;s focus on this ultimately ends up adding armchair sympathizers to both sides, resulting in even further impressions that one side or the other is a significant movement.</p>

<p>WTF does that even mean in this context. You&#39;re going abstract to the extreme about a specific claim. </p>

<p>Going into the event there were a few knowns at the very least, including a protest vs. counter-protest situation between groups that have become volatile and violent before when together. </p>

<p>So the response of &#39;well different police have different tactics...&#39; is pretty meaningless when someone points out that this situation only got out of control because it was allowed to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Seattle police have made rioting and crowd control a priority since the WTO riots. They also get lots of live practice since it&#39;s a pretty politically active city, and every May Day there are huge protests all over the city that usually result in riots - though this year was thankfully pretty tame, Portland and Olympia seemed to have more rioting.</p>

<p>It is pretty crazy to watch them on May Day. You&#39;ll see groups of 50 cops on bikes in full riot gear ride through intersections and literally block after block of police SUV&#39;s lining the streets with 4 cops in each. It definitely gives a creepy police state vibe, but they&#39;re not going to be completely out manned or disorganized like they were in Charlottesville.</p>

<p>Last May Day I was headed home from a peaceful BBQ/protest against a new youth detention center and after passing two blocks of unmarked police vehicles I looked over at one of the SUV&#39;s that had it&#39;s windows down and said &quot;dude, I think you&#39;ve got the protesters outnumbered two to one&quot;. An incredibly bored looking cop replied &quot;tell me about it, I&#39;m ready to go home and have a beer&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at videos from the day you&#39;ll see that police presence was rather light. They didn&#39;t look like they had the manpower to do more than contain the whole thing, I don&#39;t think I even saw police in riot gear until later on. Pretty crazy when the protestors/rioters had that gear on!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why they weren&#39;t prepared with riot gear and a plan to separate them, after all there was violence the night before. But the game plan was to let them at it then you would still expect to see a stronger force corralling both sides together.</p>
