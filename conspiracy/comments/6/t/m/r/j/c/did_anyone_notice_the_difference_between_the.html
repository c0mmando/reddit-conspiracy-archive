       I don't believe there were any deaths and maybe even no big arrests in the Seattle protest yesterday. Police were out in full force, both sides were seperated and nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile in Virginia, police were told to stand down and let two pissed off sides go after each other. This isn't Virginia's first rodeo with protests by the way, so they know what can happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did the Seattle police know that the Virginia police didn't? I don't think it takes a genius to see that two sides who hate each other are probably going to fight if they are allowed to.

       IMO, it's "real" as there are actual people who make up the "white nationalist" contingent but the number of "card carrying" members is tiny.  The media focus on this event makes the head count seem larger than it really is, especially the hand-wringing paranoid editorials of the liberal left who make this out to be emergence of an active, widespread Nazi movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       All-in-all, I think the media's focus on this ultimately ends up adding armchair sympathizers to both sides, resulting in even further impressions that one side or the other is a significant movement.

       The Left has been trying to get exactly this incident to happen for a couple of years. Every other time something has happened, they were quick to blame the right, then got egg on their face when it turned out to be someone else, usually associated with the Left.

       Some media company should just setup a whole stadium for the two sides to duke it out and have the whole thing televised... have em sign some waivers and then just have at it until one side is destroyed. It would make big bucks and get the crazies off the street so that all fighting is 100% consensual.

       Police around the country do not act the same. They all have different procedures and are headed by different people making different decisions. US Police isn't some large, single acting organization. It's thousands of police departments in different states and cities, and each state and city have different rules and different ways they handle these sorts of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police in one area acting different than police in another isn't something that's "strange" or to be noted.

       WTF does that even mean in this context. You're going abstract to the extreme about a specific claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going into the event there were a few knowns at the very least, including a protest vs. counter-protest situation between groups that have become volatile and violent before when together.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the response of 'well different police have different tactics...' is pretty meaningless when someone points out that this situation only got out of control because it was allowed to.

       I bet it's a combo of things.  Places like Seattle have protests frequently, the cops are going to be a lot more ready.  I also think that in Charlottesville they didn't want to have the appearance that they didn't let the pro-Lee statue side speak their mind.  Pretty stupid given how many people showed up with weapons.

       Seattle has a long history of protests. The police know what to expect. Also there aren't many alt right in the pnw so the numbers were so low that no one cared

       I can't speak for Seattle but a few years ago back when I lived in Tacoma, we had some Soros BLM type people block traffic in front of this arcade because the owner called somebody the n word. Regardless of reason, the police told them they'd all be arrested unless they get back on their out of town bus and leave. And they did. Washington cops don't fuck around. Too used to getting clapped just for sitting at a coffee shop with a badge on.

       Not that I'm d riding the police. Just saying they don't take chances in Seattle.

       The Seattle police have made rioting and crowd control a priority since the WTO riots. They also get lots of live practice since it's a pretty politically active city, and every May Day there are huge protests all over the city that usually result in riots - though this year was thankfully pretty tame, Portland and Olympia seemed to have more rioting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is pretty crazy to watch them on May Day. You'll see groups of 50 cops on bikes in full riot gear ride through intersections and literally block after block of police SUV's lining the streets with 4 cops in each. It definitely gives a creepy police state vibe, but they're not going to be completely out manned or disorganized like they were in Charlottesville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last May Day I was headed home from a peaceful BBQ/protest against a new youth detention center and after passing two blocks of unmarked police vehicles I looked over at one of the SUV's that had it's windows down and said "dude, I think you've got the protesters outnumbered two to one". An incredibly bored looking cop replied "tell me about it, I'm ready to go home and have a beer"

       If you look at videos from the day you'll see that police presence was rather light. They didn't look like they had the manpower to do more than contain the whole thing, I don't think I even saw police in riot gear until later on. Pretty crazy when the protestors/rioters had that gear on!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why they weren't prepared with riot gear and a plan to separate them, after all there was violence the night before. But the game plan was to let them at it then you would still expect to see a stronger force corralling both sides together.

       That's really not true, it really is simpler and more truthful to say that everyone up here in the NW are big ol puss pusses for the most part compared to say the south where you can still beat people in the streets and get away with it.
