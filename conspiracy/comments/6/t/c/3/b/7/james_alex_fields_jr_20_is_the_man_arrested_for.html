<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. You&#39;re the one claiming &quot;the media outlets were all saying he was a neo-nazi or a white nationalist&quot; and then cited nothing to support it. You gave a search result that didn&#39;t support your claim at all. Now you&#39;re acting like it does, but have never cited one of these media outlets.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also just calling me a liar for pointing out that there isn&#39;t anything backing your point in your url.</p>

<p>What is my lie, exactly? Because all I&#39;ve said is that you never actually cited anything regarding your claim.</p>

<p>Huh. Weird. Just a few years back, people on this sub <em>loved</em> to outline their evidence for a claim, especially if it was something that would shine a truth spotlight on the media.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s an &quot;pointless argument.&quot;</p>

<p>Weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry for this. This is what reddit turned into about six or so years back, which is why most sane people fled. Truth is considered wrongthink here. You&#39;re right though and your country has high court rulings (see: binding, not persuasive) as well as extensive obiter that driving through a crowd is A-OK if you&#39;re being attacked. He had no way to gauge the severity of the impact as it&#39;s not often one drives through people, and from the looks he was quite obsessed with his car--his prize possession--and thus would never have wanted to smash it up even more than it was being smashed up while it was pelted with rocks and bottles. </p>

<p>The guy who smashed it&#39;s tail lights with the bat should be indicted, as well as the guy who threw the rock that took out the back window. Those two people alone would have triggered the guys freak out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually - something similar.  My friend had a heart attack during Mardi Gras.  Ambulance had to come get him.  The crowd became pretty wild and as we were riding in the ambulance to the hospital the crowd started rocking the ambulance back and forth.  It was scary - but the driver <em>slowly</em> accelerated speed, and as he <em>slowly</em> pushed the people out of the way, word quickly got out to move out of the damn way - and people did.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s not the exact same.  But there is a right and a wrong way to handle that situation even <strong>if</strong> you are under attack.</p>

<p>And hitting the gas and plowing through innocent people is not the right way to do.  </p>

<p>You can see one of em taking a swing at the car before the crash with a sign (that person doesn&#39;t look aware of what is about to happen either as their body language changes immediately after the impact). Suffice to say if there was anyone attacking the dude or his car before he accelerated the crowd would have little impetus to name that person or group of individuals because it is one of their own and would &quot;Get a white supremacist off.&quot;. Let justice run its course and don&#39;t let talking heads who&#39;s careers depend on peddling to whichever crowd has political clout, Charlotteville apparently is the home of the #Resistence in that state so you can take a guess, because that usually ends in draconian punishments and martyrs for the wrong sort of people.</p>

<p>To the left about 3-4 s before the crash there&#39;s a dude taking a sign to the car (by the looks of things). Considering I&#39;ve not seen any footage of the speed up I can&#39;t ascribe intent (most videos that show protester/car related incidents show the whole interaction, this doesn&#39;t and people want to ascribe innocence or guilt based on what amounts to be 2 min of footage, him fleeing the scene isn&#39;t a declaration of guilt though because there&#39;s footage of cars that tried to wiggle their way through a crowd far less violently getting attacked when stopped so in that sense it could also be legit fear of getting pulled out of his car and treated to a pavement lobotomy). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video does not show anyone attacking the car before it plowed through the crowd and killed at least one person.</p>

<p>There is footage showing this guy drove from a clear street, where he was not surrounded by anyone, through an intersection where he could have gone at least 2 ways without going into the crowd and thus escaping any danger he might have thought he was in, and instead turning into the crowd and hitting them unprovoked, without ever touching his brakes. </p>

<p>Problem is if one person hit the car in under 50 s of footage combined with the now infamous image of the car ploughing into people (ref: <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345338185.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100">https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345338185.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100</a> ) having visible the symbols of two groups with very violent activities on their record (to be clear: Antifa and BLM) moves the possibility of it being a spooked driver from remote to not unlikely considering he was front and centre visible with people deemed as white supremacists/nazis by those two gorups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The guy was not slowing down when he was only a few feet from a crowd of people (he was even speeding up, by some reports) - eye witness accounts backed up by the lack of brake lights on the car. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eyewitnesses should be treated with care in this scenario because if they were attacking the car they have a reason not to be honest. Also as for your claim of no break lights being visible:
<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345328256.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100">https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345328256.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100</a>
that&#39;s the problem with viewing this from a perspective rather than looking at things objectively (no offence intended, I literally don&#39;t care for anything but the truth and the people getting their deserved punishments). Be very careful of this stuff as I am seeing many people from my circles who proclaim to be sceptics proclaiming this is a terror attack even with so many uncertainties in the footage. One thing I&#39;d like to know is why isn&#39;t the chick filming the street down which the car came (visible in one of the videos) hasn&#39;t come forward with the footage because if there was a crowd attacking the car when it sped up it would be visible in her footage chasing after it or if it was premeditated it would be a empty street.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your first three examples are of modded breaklights. Your google search is a clusterfuck of modding images too. You&#39;ve actually shown we can&#39;t trust the tail lights either way considering the possibility they were modded.
Just looking briefly up this video seems to show a unmodded challenger</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/s4x7msoBJA8?t=5m3s">https://youtu.be/s4x7msoBJA8?t=5m3s</a></p>

<p>Notice the entire strip is illuminated faintly? Now back to the image I showed you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345328256.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100">https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nintchdbpict000345328256.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=960&amp;amp;quality=100</a></p>

<p>Only two parts of the break light strip are illuminated and much more strongly than with the, what I assume to be, stock challenger. See the problem you&#39;re having yet? (you&#39;re not looking at the facts you&#39;re looking for facts to fit a conclusion) If I were like you I&#39;d just throw up chaff or insult you but I am not.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re ascribing intent to the last minute of a multi-minute event. You can&#39;t do that without knowing all the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other footage also clearly shows that no one was attacking the two cars that were parked in the crowd, that this guy rammed into, so there&#39;s even more basis to suggest no cars were being attacked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the other two cars contain a dude linked to white supremacists? No? Then you&#39;re trying to tell me a squirt gun is a good approximation of the effects a 9 mm Beretta will have on a human skull (incomparable items).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>here is a longer version of the video you posted above that CLEARLY SHOWS there was no one near this guy&#39;s car when he started driving into the crowd: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/aug/12/car-counter-protesters-charlottesville-video">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/aug/12/car-counter-protesters-charlottesville-video</a> - apologies, in looking further this is not a longer video, it&#39;s just the full video (not the link above, which skips to the third second of the video - which you did to help me see what you were pointing out, not trying to imply anything else!). Still, it clearly shows the empty road he came from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows a already in speed car not a accelerating one. You&#39;re really having a hard time grasping that point. I want to see what it was doing before that point, did he turn the corner and was like &quot;Fuck yeah that black dude who punched me yesterday, time to GTA his fucking ass <em>floors it</em> &quot; or if he turned the corner, was recognized by someone in a crowd not visible in the video which then started slamming his car (note the crowd he ended up hitting was chanting &quot;who&#39;s streets? our streets&quot; which tells you something about their mood).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What goalposts have been moved? I adapted to the unknown fact of Challenger tail lights being often modded to a extensive degree (well beyond what I&#39;ve seen done personally in my neck of the woods to other car models).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>implying somehow that my &quot;side&quot; is/I am insulting you when I&#39;ve done no such thing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I said if I were dedicated to a conclusion, like you seem to be, I&#39;d begin flinging insults for that tail light bit because it did come off as slightly disingenuous to link examples of modded tail lights. Oh and this is just as a aside: If I feel insulted trust me you&#39;ll know it (you only have to look at my posting history for that to know).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>your general condescending tone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is warranted considering you don&#39;t look at the facts objectively. I&#39;ll be the first dude asking this guy get a Gitmo holiday if he&#39;s proven to have had intent to murder people with his car ( my rage towards such individual doesn&#39;t much care for creed or race ).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the fact that you seem okay with blatantly making shit up to fit your agenda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What agenda? Urging calm and objective thinking?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m done. Talk to me when you can show some real evidence, not conjecture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have. You choose not to listen because it might suggest a white nationalist is innocent of the type of crime you&#39;d think fits his stereotype. Call me when you realize what you&#39;re doing.</p>
