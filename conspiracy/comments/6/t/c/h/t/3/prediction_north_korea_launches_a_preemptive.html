    <div class="md"><p>How do you decide if it&#39;s a false flag, instead of a legit attack?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I pretty just asked that because I&#39;m sick of everything being called a false flag. It makes it seems like the only evil people in this world are all working for the US gov. If Guam is stroke, I would pretty much believe that it was 100% because of NK, now if anywhere in the states is struck, I think it would be more false flag. The US has such better tech then everyone else, that a missle from NK should not be able to reach anywhere close to the states.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A missile should not be able to reach the US, that&#39;s why Guam is a good choice, since it&#39;s an American territory. They couldn&#39;t hit Hawaii because that would be too much like Pearl Harbor hah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s why I don&#39;t think it would be a true false flag attack(as in the US attacks itself) No one is really going to care if NK attacks Guam(unless nukes are involved.) I feel like we might let NK hit Guam, and use that to attack NK, and the public wouldn&#39;t really care.</p>

<p>On a side note, I lurk this subreddit quite a bit, and I will admit that  I do so with a very skeptical vibe. I usually see people(usually OPs) just go into a tirade and incoherent rants against anyone against their view. I&#39;m very glad you a being respectful and that we can have a nice conversation even though we&#39;re not seeing eye to eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t put what I thought in the best words haha. I meant that NK attacking the states=full on war. NK attacking Guam=maybe some airstrikes but not a full on assault. Sorry I didn&#39;t put that clearly.</p>

<p>And thanks for expecting skepticism. For the months I spent on this sub, the worst is seeing OP not being able to defend themselves and going straight to attacks on the dissenters. I feel like if you can&#39;t answer questions about your post without getting upset, you shouldn&#39;t be posting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bigger the strike, the bigger the reaction there&#39;s going to be. A nuclear strike on any target in the world by NK I think would result in at least an equally devastating strike by US. I think to truly unite the country against a common outside enemy, you&#39;re probably right, NK would have to hit a major target. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just hope that no nukes are launched, and if NK does have a suicide wish, that we don&#39;t respond with nukes. I feel like the US needs to set the precedent that a nuke doesn&#39;t need to be dealt with with another nuke.</p>
