       I'd watch out for a false flag NK attack. It would be a great opportunity for Trump to "unite" the country and quash the spiraling out of control racial tensions to focus on an all out war on the Korean Peninsula.

       I like it how you have 'launches a preemptive strike' in quote marks. It seems to mel ike you also suspect the 'nukes' are a beat-up. After seeing

       How do you decide if it's a false flag, instead of a legit attack?

       If NK does indeed strike Guam, I do have a feeling that it's because the government let it happen.

       I mean there's usually no way to know for sure, but it would be might convenient for this administration if an outside enemy attacked. It would give the gov the opportunity to attempt to unite folks against a common enemy.

       I pretty just asked that because I'm sick of everything being called a false flag. It makes it seems like the only evil people in this world are all working for the US gov. If Guam is stroke, I would pretty much believe that it was 100% because of NK, now if anywhere in the states is struck, I think it would be more false flag. The US has such better tech then everyone else, that a missle from NK should not be able to reach anywhere close to the states.

       A missile should not be able to reach the US, that's why Guam is a good choice, since it's an American territory. They couldn't hit Hawaii because that would be too much like Pearl Harbor hah.

       And that's why I don't think it would be a true false flag attack(as in the US attacks itself) No one is really going to care if NK attacks Guam(unless nukes are involved.) I feel like we might let NK hit Guam, and use that to attack NK, and the public wouldn't really care.

       On a side note, I lurk this subreddit quite a bit, and I will admit that  I do so with a very skeptical vibe. I usually see people(usually OPs) just go into a tirade and incoherent rants against anyone against their view. I'm very glad you a being respectful and that we can have a nice conversation even though we're not seeing eye to eye.

       I didn't put what I thought in the best words haha. I meant that NK attacking the states=full on war. NK attacking Guam=maybe some airstrikes but not a full on assault. Sorry I didn't put that clearly.

       And thanks for expecting skepticism. For the months I spent on this sub, the worst is seeing OP not being able to defend themselves and going straight to attacks on the dissenters. I feel like if you can't answer questions about your post without getting upset, you shouldn't be posting.

       The bigger the strike, the bigger the reaction there's going to be. A nuclear strike on any target in the world by NK I think would result in at least an equally devastating strike by US. I think to truly unite the country against a common outside enemy, you're probably right, NK would have to hit a major target.

       Let's just hope that no nukes are launched, and if NK does have a suicide wish, that we don't respond with nukes. I feel like the US needs to set the precedent that a nuke doesn't need to be dealt with with another nuke.

       I don't understand your point. How can you quantify the number of people experiencing racial tension? Am I experiencing racial tension right now? How could you know. Racial tension can be simply thoughts you're having in your mind.

       If one is experiencing racial tension without racial tension, they should be seeking professional help, not expecting a race war. Laws were put in place a long time ago to prevent racism. There is certainly racism remaining in America, but not nearly what you think.  A very small segment of the population shown on the media doesn't speak for the entire nation.

       I see racism every single day on social media, in comments made by everyday Americans. Hundreds of thousands of such comments are made probably every minute are made. These are not media reports, these are real people using racist rhetoric in online conversations.

       What laws exactly are you referring to btw?

       The laws were put in place because there are so many racists in this country, not because there are few.

       And that's why I hate having Trump as a President. The US could wipe out NK with conventional arms quite easily, but I feel like Trump would fight fire with fire.
