<p>What type of powers do they have? Do we know fully what capabilities they have? </p>

<p>Is it possible that they can delete someones existing coins/whatever? </p>

<p>The reason I ask this because it seems that the end game is digital currency (makes no sense when we haven&#39;t even gone to the measures of protecting our power grid and electronics from solar activity and the like.), once its in place, if they can delete accounts or erase or reset your accounts, it would give them total control. </p>

<p>Is this scenario even possible with digital currencies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, youre correct, its possible. the cool thing is, until it does crash (if so) you can set up a computer rig to &quot;mine&quot; crypto currency. you can really go crazy designing the hardware and storage systems, even basing everything off grid for extra precaution. IF it goes to hell, so be it...until then, you should understand right now is a &quot;pre apple ipo-esque&quot; almost-golden age of crypto. Imagine you could go back in time and buy apple stock on tbe day of their ipo....ehhh??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cryptos are the logical and inevitable foray of &quot;currency&quot; into 21st c. digital tech. Someone had to design a monetary unit to parallel traditional banking. The missing link until bitcoin was convincing savvy and cautious investors that their non-physical assets could be secured in a non-physical vault. Encrypting is our best choice to date for securing any non-physical-digital files. So...when encryption math finally achieved a track record over the past few decades, some mysterious people twiddled their keyboards and created a sweet architecture specifically for non-physical currency. Its all quite fascinating, since we are witnessing its evolution from day zero. Just like any investment portfolio, no one should go all-in with &quot;cryptos&quot;. Learning a fine balance of different crypto options, each accruing interest in its own unique manner, is an artform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the recent &quot;split&quot; was slang for a generic new category of cryptos that is more easily and specifically designed for converting to cash, so you can go to mcdonalds and spend 1/1000 btc on a coffee or whatever. &quot;Spawn&quot; is pretty much what it sounds like: the collective efforts of btc miners around the world create new units one at a time with their custom rigs, connected online with the overall architecture of the various currencies. To start investing, you get some form of a digital wallet, many companies to choose from, and your investments live and appreciate in the &quot; safety &quot; of the wallets you create. There are lots of different companies, and some are dominant at the moment. Like i mentioned, setting up your own computer with custom hardware to mine btc is an excellent decision, because the raw material/commodity stage of any global investment usually always pays handsomly when executed efficiently. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t just do it efficiently with any ol&#39; computer, you need high-end GPU rig or ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) to justify the power and cost expended to be efficient enough to be profitable.

<blockquote>
<p>yes, youre correct, its possible. </p>

<p>no no it&#39;s not possible</p>

<p>bitcoin is a DECENTRALIZED solution, go google what that means first</p>

<p>there is no database, like facebook has or google, it&#39;s distributed through the network, encrypted, safe</p>

<p>nobody owns bitcoin just like nobody owns a marvel movie after it&#39;s uploaded to piratebay</p>

<p>nobody can delete your coins either or your accounts</p>

<p>that being said, it&#39;s still not suitable for replacing FIAT currencies but the technology is interesting and the best things done with it are yet to come</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i appreciate that you answered op&#39;s specific questions. His main concern was highly merited however: what about a 100 year / 1000 yr event? EMP or CME rendering utility grids worthless. OP is rightfully cautious to explore all possibilities. My point to you is to test your theory of invincibility. Market volatility notwithstanding, the arguable most significant risks are hacker/cracker ponzi schemes and electricity / magnetic anomolies destroying base ifrastructure</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In theory, yes it is possible to reverse transactions in crypto-currencies, even if there is no &quot;owner&quot; or central authority of the network.  In practice, doing so is nearly equivalent to a force majeure.  Technically, 50% of miners are always in control, and can do whatever they want.  But they cannot exercise that control without dire economic consequences, so they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But it has happened.  Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum does have an explicit leader (Vitalik Buterin), and has already split over the reversal of the supposed &quot;theft&quot; of a buggy contract that belonged to the Ethereum Foundation.  So there is now Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.</p>

<p>Bitcoin had a split several years back when an upgrade went badly, and was reverted.  Some transactions were double-spent in that incident.  I&#39;m not sure how long those who decided to split over it maintained their client.  But, as far as I know, interest eventually died out.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there is no &quot;Mister Bitcoin.&quot;  Control of various aspects of the Bitcoin network was deliberately divided among several well-known individuals.  And then Satoshi disappeared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take the market cap of the top 100 Cryptos, you get about ~$135 Billion.<br/>
Just the top ten, it&#39;s about $110 Billion.  </p>

<p>Meaning, the size is so small that someone with huge pockets can easily manipulate a particular currency or even a few currencies up or down as they wish.  </p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;m seeing a lot of positive buzz on Bitcoin in the MSM. CNBC is all over it for example. This scares me a bit as I suspect there&#39;s an agenda at play. The price moves are ridiculous and very unhealthy. People who know nothing about Cryptos are jumping onboard with borrowed money (credit cards). A flash crash will wipe out a lot of individuals.  </p>

<p>According to some, Cryptos are being used to rob the masses. Others believe it is the future of money. I think it&#39;s both.</p>

<p>Ridicule, bargaining and now acceptance. It&#39;s a technology and the early adopters will be greatly rewarded. Among these early adopters, you will find young tech-savvy people, but also bigger fish in the financial world. There&#39;s no clear group that&#39;s being &quot;robbed&quot;.</p>
