       I've seen that 99 year figure and been meaning to confirm it.  Seems it might be wrong.  Can you please explain why you say that such a solar eclipse hasn't happened since 1918?

       hmm, maybe you mean that in 1918 there was a total eclipse that cut across the country from Oregon to southeast.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A total solar eclipse occurred on June 8, 1918. The eclipse was observed by a U.S. Naval Observatory team at Baker City in Oregon. The painting below shows totality when the Moon prevented the Sun's rays from hitting that part of Oregon. The track of the eclipse was a band across the entire contiguous United States.

       That is not my opinion, I'm just quoted the "numerologist" in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally find it odd how often the number 33 is pushed by the media and our government, like NASA is about to test sonic booms around eclipse time.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how many sonic booms NASA plans?

       33 is the largest positive integer that cannot be written as the sum of distinct triangular numbers. Triangular numbers are a tiling- / stacking-based sequence. I think this may be partially related to the whole pyramid / occult math and numerology thing.

       The result is provable with induction, not a totally simple proof but not very hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for a conclusive proof of its Hermetic significance, I'm no expert on that. All I mean is that if you look at pyramids and various stacking problems, you're basically stacking polygons (assuming some regular stacking) which are composed of triangular numbers. All polygonal numbers can be obtained from triangular numbers via formula.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess would be that the handful of numbers up to 33 (and none greater) which cannot be expressed as distinct sums of triangular numbers would therefore need to be represented more explicitly in the tiling design. Numbers  greater than 33 are implicitly represented as sums of tiles. This would be under the hypothesis that the pyramids are storehouses of ancient knowledge a la Shakespeare Equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I can't go check the pyramids myself, but my guess is in important rooms/chambers we'd find tilings that highlight important occult/hermetic/scientific numbers. My theory is that at least some of those numbers would be the ones unexpressable as distinct sums of triangular numbers. I know 11 and 22 are also occult numbers, but you can express these as triangular sums, so it's not some conclusive theory I've got. But hey, I don't think we'll get the full story any time soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the triangular number thing also has something to do with why you hear occult/numerological people say that 11,22, and 33 are important "master numbers" but do not include other higher multiples of 11 like 44 and 55, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird to think about nothing conclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reply above about how he's certain it's the proportion of fallen angels seems a little too sure and simplistic, given Gnosticism/Hermeticism appears to pre-date even the old testament by a lot longer than we're told.

       Actually it has more to do with the percentage of fallen angels (one third). Everything comes back to the spiritual realm, our world is just an illusion.

       Sorry, I was trying to be clever. I am actually aware of the pineal gland and that there are also many historical references to ancient consideration of its importance.

       I do not put much value on this eclipse thing. It's pretty cyclical and uneventful.

       I don't think the eclipse is a big deal either. Well, maybe it might have something to do with us moving into the Age of Aquarius, but I don't know.

       The whole spinal cord having 33 vertebrae interests me because I just discovered that many people believe the story of Jacob's Ladder (in the Bible) is really about the spinal cord (looks like a ladder) going up to the pineal gland. Just makes me think.  :-)

       Well, some people don't believe Jacob's Ladder (Jacob had a dream about a ladder going to heaven) is the spinal cord. But some do.

       Yes, we tried to watch a film about Jacob and Esau, but one was in French and the other is a 90's tv movie not yet available online....at least not on Amazon or Netflix.

       It's an interesting story. I'll have to read about the ladder, it was mentioned and depicted by a drawing in wikipedia article, but I had a garage wall to build and Sunday is "go for milk on the motorcycle before it gets dark" day.

       I think 33 is just a sign that someone pulled the numbers out of their asses. It usually just means a third. But the number stick in the brain so when you're looking for a good guess it pops to mind. Just like 99% it's amazing how many things are 99%.
