        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello all,</p>

<p>The mods of the subreddit wanted to take a moment to remind all users to refresh themselves with regards to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement/">the rules of Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette">reddiquette</a> and the rules of this sub (which are listed on the sidebar).</p>

<p>In light of an extremely hostile and intense political divide within the US at the present time in history, this subreddit has become somewhat of a battleground for various ideologies; while the moderators stand firm in their commitment to the free exchange of information, we also feel that civility is the enabling condition of fruitful discussion and we implore all users to focus on attacking ideas while engaging in debate, rather than other users.</p>

<p>To that end, if would be of great assistance if folks help us by quickly reporting all rule violations to the modmail; <strong>this urgency holds especially true in the case of things such as doxxing, threats and calls to violence and/or endorsements of violence.</strong></p>

<p>The moderators will act on all reports as quickly as possible and we appreciate the continued patience of the community during a cacophonous period in the American Experiment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you are inclined to appeal a ban, submission or comment removal please feel free to message the modmail. As a general note, insulting the moderators during one&#39;s appeal is not usually a workable pathway for success.</p>

<p>We also have been working on a new backend tool which we hope will give the mod team better insight into when brigades are being aimed at the subreddit, which will allow us to more quickly inform users in an affected thread (with the aim of preventing the brigade from being effective.) The mod team will not allow outside groups to manipulate comment/submissions scores with the aim of sowing discord among the userbase of this subreddit, and we are actively working with the site administrators to put a stop to this outside manipulation.</p>

<p>As the subreddit has matured over the past few years, it has no doubt been the case that the level of sophistication behind the attacks directed at the subreddit have also increased. To that end, the mod team has been stepping up  efforts to respond to the best of our abilities, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to fight to protect one of the last places on reddit wherein moderators defer to organic curation of content in all but the most extreme of circumstances.</p>

<p>Cheers and regards,</p>

<p>The mod team</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. If not, then people everywhere will think they have the right to point at someone, and mark them as intollerable. Since laws are mere suggestions and the rule of law is facilitated by force, the only way to enforce one&#39;s views on the intllerant, is by the justification and use of force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why do you want the calls for the destruction of Israel or all Jews taken down?</p>

<p>In one sentence you call for censorship of view and in the other say that we should allow it and not turn to force. My comment was to imply that the opposing perspective one could have about these comments is that they call out the intolerance commited by Israel. With their comments they are choosing to be intolerant towards others who are intolerant and you respond to that by being intolerant of them if you choose to censor them. </p>

<p>I agree, this is not a world that anyone wants. I personally feel that all speech should be allowed. If a comment or viewpoint be unjust/foolish/unacceptable then that should be easily proven and we should encourage each other to do so via discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, tolerance. It&#39;s sort of a silly question, because it presupposes a choice. I do not believe we have the ability to control others, and though we can manipulate our environment, I do this for defensive purposes only. I am not so impressed with myself that I believe I can run the world better than it can run itself. So yes, tolerance, as if there were another way.</p>

<p>Calling for the destruction of Israel and all Jews is the worst thing I&#39;ve seen online, but no I wasn&#39;t falling for it to be censored. I just felt it was ironic to make such a big point about it, while doing nothing about those posts. If people wanted to do away with Zionism I wouldn&#39;t disagree at all, but when you lump all other Jews in with them...it&#39;s like letting some bad apples spoil the whole bunch right? Anyways...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it isn&#39;t.  Alt-Right is what those people started calling themselves.  It is a specific group with specific beliefs.  Antifa is specific group that is radical left wing and with specific ideals.  Alt-left on the other hand doesn&#39;t signify any specific ideology. This is intentional - they can easily group anyone left as &quot;alt-left&quot; since it&#39;s a bullshit term.  This is what happened with the most recent protests - all the counter protesters are being called alt-left.  That was the most ridiculous part of what Trump said - he implied the entire counter protest is the &quot;alt-left&quot;. I hate to break it to you - there are a shit ton of people who are against neo-Nazis, including a lot of conservatives and republicans.  It&#39;s total garbage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;m just saying &quot;alt-left&quot; isn&#39;t a fair term. Alt-right beliefs are much more clearly defined - it doesn&#39;t just mean someone who is very conservative, or someone who is far right republican. It is a specific, more extreme group.

<p>Not as a rule - you can&#39;t get more liberal that slate and they aren&#39;t.  I&#39;m sure you can find some example where someone is wrong, but that&#39;s not what matters.  The right is right now using alt-left to mean all counter protesters.</p>

<p>Vice News did a recent segment where they had a reporter follow these guys around Charlottesville over the weekend and one of the guys who helps run The Daily Stormer (neo-nazi website) was literally bragging to the cameras about spreading memes, organizing on the internet, and recruiting people. </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re showing up to these rallies armed to the teeth, wearing riot gear, wielding bats and clubs, and the whole attitude of brushing these guys off doesn&#39;t really work anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you&#39;re saying about dismissing them as insignificant backfiring, butni really don&#39;t think it&#39;s a tactic they are employing. Bragging abiut spreading memes and recruiting on the internet does not strike me as someone trying to make their movement seem powerless or silly. That&#39;s my point, it&#39;s not them doing it. Just for the record if there ever is some kind of major nazi movement I&#39;ll take up arms against them, I don&#39;t think they are insignificant.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty fucked up.</p>

<p>I have one more question, cause I think you do make a pertinent point when you point out how years of telling people something is a silly little fringe gives it room to grow: what do you think about the fringe of radicals on the left calling for white genocide, or, for example, this fine gentleman I&#39;m having a conversation with right now:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6txwr3/as_a_general_reminder_under_no_circumstances_will/dlolng1/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6txwr3/as_a_general_reminder_under_no_circumstances_will/dlolng1/</a></p>

<p>He told me if I think that comment is racist, &quot;just wait&quot; </p>

<p>Insignificant, ignorable fringe? Or problem waiting to happen, insulated by its assumed insignificance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just guessing and could be totally wrong. But, hearing that guy talk about spreading memes and recruiting over the internet just resonated with me. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen stormfronters and neo-nazis post straight up racist and anti-semetic bullshit here on reddit but then if you look at their profile most of their posts are total nonsense.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trolls who start arguments and make all types of inflammatory comments in various subs and then sprinkled in between memes and bullshit is some slight holocaust denial here, maybe some crime stats about black people there. </p>

<p>I mean, yeah there&#39;s definitely the full-on &quot;I hate n-words&quot; types but I think there&#39;s also a lot of dog whistling that happens and its more subtle. That&#39;s where the &#39;oh they&#39;re just trolling&#39; dismissal can be deceiving. Clearly there are a decent amount of people who will show up for these things in real life now and they&#39;re not just shitposting on the internet anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will give you credit; nothing in this thread can be considered defending them, and I apologize. I want to avoid assuming their is a conscious connection....but UTR was an attempt to unite right-wing groups, and it was no secret neo-nazis and klansmen were going to attend. Please like Richard Spencer, in my opinion, want to further nazi-esque goals while hiding the swastikas, and to that effect may try to normalize their putrid beliefs with more moderate Rightists.</p>

<p>But because Spencer might want to do that doesn&#39;t mean it will happen, and you certainly have no place in such a hypothesis. Again, I apologize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accept your apology. You should recognize the problem you have when you assume anyone who disagrees with you is a nazi sympathizer. That&#39;s a really bad problem that is going to cause the kind of problems for you that a simple apology won&#39;t fix. I am an independent with a degree in history and political science who&#39;s voted for 16 years, never once voting Republican. Never once.</p>

<p>You need to <em>stop</em> apologizing for the left. What you said early about how people want to blame both sides... I absolutely fucking blame both shitty ass sides. I blame both sides working towards their endgame while being 100% bought and paid for by corporate interests.</p>

<p>I blame people on the right who do nothing but talk about the left and apologize for the right. I blame people <em>like you</em> who do nothing but tall about the right and apologize for the left.</p>

<p>All you&#39;ve done in this thread, besides criticize Nazis, is whatabout for the left and call a lifelong independent a nazi defender, all because I criticized the left and you&#39;re trigger happy.</p>

<p>Get your head on straight and stop being a hyperpartisan. Acknowledge that problems are problems and the existence of Nazis doesn&#39;t make the people who want to &quot;dilute white DNA&quot; any less of a problem, regardless of if you or I consider the Nazis worse.</p>

<p>Want to k ow what scares me? Not the Nazis, they&#39;ll be fucking dealt with. Without a doubt, if they ever tried anything major, people would fucking destroy them. This backlash over UTR is just a taste of how much fire the Nazis would have coming their way. What scares me is the fact that the vast majority of people say the same shit about the racists on the left that the nazi apologists say here: &quot;they aren&#39;t true ____&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s just a tiny fringe of basically no one&quot; yet the backlash against a guy saying he want to dilute white DNA is nothing. Nothing at all. That&#39;s what scares me</p>

<p>I&#39;ve voted Democrat twice but with all the radicalisation and popular support for that radicalisation, I won&#39;t be doing it again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A group of 10 to 20 counterprotesters were waiting for the Klansmen at the park with “the intent of perpetrating violence,” a police statement said. As some KKK members began pulling out “White Lives Matter” signs, counterprotesters swarmed the SUV and smashed a window, prompting the SUV’s driver to take off, leaving the greatly outnumbered Klan members behind.</p>

<p>Seven of the counterprotesters were seen attacking Klansmen and hitting them with wooden posts, the AP reported, and the KKK members responded by stabbing three of the counterprotesters</p>

<p>This sounds like a call to action; looking out for a Reichstag Fire and not-so-subtly use it to justify violence, and blaming the victim to boot. Nothing I say will push almost-nazis the rest of the way; I hope all those assholes in Charlottesville were just Cosplaying fascism, with the Richard Spencers and Steve Bannons of the world I am concerned they may try to gain further influence.</p>

Communists don&#39;t have a viable political agenda (IMO) but don&#39;t legitimately encourage violence against a group the Supreme Court considers a protected class (random and vague threats against capitalists notwithstanding). Again, both sides are bad but one is worse.</p>

<p>Happy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of this.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that we should hang them anyway just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>When I say hang them.Im not advocating lynching of pedophiles by the angry mobs . I would like to see the edracation of pedophiles from society by lawful execution,the hanging them part is colourful language on my part but we are free call for reinstatement of hanging as a form of punishment in a democratic society. Aren&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I understand this is very extreme position (I bet it would be popular one with the unwashed masses,the voters) and it&#39;s very unlikely to garner much political support ,politicians voting to kill pedos is like turkeys voting for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>I also know that there is all sorts of issues with this position,how would you prove it,what if it was accidental etc,so most likely my position could be softened through debate. Maybe I could be pursauded that non offending pedos should just be chemically castrated instead.</p>

<p>Basically my political position on the pedo problem is that the strongest possible punishment and deterrent should be used .I feel that the wider public would be in favour of a much tougher stance on pedos and our political representatives should make laws and policy that move towards wiping out the pedo problem from society .</p>

<p>In a democracy am I not allowed to call for this?</p>

<p>Is not a legitimate opinion?</p>

<p>I mean that&#39;s why I brought it up. </p>

<p>I we no longer allowed to express our political opinions on this sub?</p>

<p>Do I have to tone down my language?</p>

<p>I love a response from the mods. I don&#39;t want get banned for saying hang the pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about the rights of pedophiles.Fuck them. They can swing as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

<p>I think this would be the most effective way to eradicate the pedo problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an ideological position and impossible to enforce or prove but it would massively reduce the number of pedophiles that are alive today and as such our children would be safer.</p>

<p>The issue in this thread is are we allowed to say this anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say pedos are a bigger problem than the people that want far tougher punishments for them.The people that want to harm our children are what&#39;s wrong with the world not the people that want to protect them. </p>

<p>After all I couldn&#39;t hold these views if child sex monsters didn&#39;t exist.A bit like Antifa who according to CNN and other alt left fake news propaganda only exist as a reaction to facists,these views only exist as a reaction to pedophiles.</p>

<p>As I have said I&#39;m aware these views are extreme but many many people hold them and this is why it&#39;s important that we can discuss them openly,no? That way they can be tempered and tested and challenged.</p>

<p>His name is Joshua Ryne Goldberg, a Jewish lad, then aged 20, who had a REAL talent for stirring up trouble and sowing discord. He would often pose as a &quot;radical Islamist&quot;, other times as a &quot;white supremacist&quot;, and other times as a racist, Palestinian hating Jew. </p>

<p>We had nothing to do with his being busted, that was all his own doing. But we (myself in particular) called that Troll out for what he was months before he was arrested by the FBI.</p>

<p>He was here - and all over Reddit, and he went to great lengths to try to associate this sub and its moderators with &quot;White Supremacists&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot; lunatics -  even writing an article for a White Supremacist website that called this sub a &quot;fertile recruiting ground&quot; for the White Supremacist &quot;cause&quot;.</p>

<p>The article was a fake, of course, and THAT is what I called at the time - of course I was MOCKED by others who, like Goldberg, have been working to smear and destroy this sub for years.</p>

<p>Here are a few relevant articles:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/terrorist-troll-pretended-to-be-isis-white-supremacist-and-jewish-lawyer"><strong>‘Terrorist’ Troll Pretended to Be ISIS, White Supremacist, and Jewish Lawyer</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article34766070.html#storylink=cpy">Florida man is accused of helping supposed bomb plot at KC event commemorating 9/11</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. We do our best to examine all reports, and to enforce the rules of this sub and of Reddit, but sometimes we miss things, especially during hectic times like these.</p>

<p>Please send links to the <strong>comments</strong> you referenced to the Mod Mail <em>(Please</em> <strong><em>do not</em></strong> <em>post them here, or reveal the name of the user in the threads, thank you!)</em> Also, send the links to me in a PM, and I will personally investigate any <strong><em>rule violations</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Regarding PM&#39;s I doubt we mods could help with any unsettling messages you may have received, as we are unable to validate them. I suggest you contact Reddit Administrators for help with PM issues.</p>

<p>I actually disagree with you here, even though I think the Jews stuff is fake and totally discredited. We need to allow free speech if it&#39;s genuine, and we need to stop worrying about whether people will be offended by honest discussion.</p>

<p>Proof, please. Not wasting money, investing in productive activities, etc. are applicable to all economies.</p>

<p>Of course. But you have to invest it in productive investments that grow your capital faster than the interest rate you&#39;re paying. Build roads, or a hyperloop, or a space elevator, and you&#39;ll grow the economy.</p>

<p>But borrowing for war doesn&#39;t grow your capital stock at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you just said which is why it is curious that there is such a demand for war.  There is a a productive side to war spending (research and what not as well as potentially adding trade partners) but the destructive side surely outweighs it.  </p>

<p>The trick is to artificially suppress interest rates and pay for the debt via inflation so that it is less noticeable.  That&#39;s the standard play.  If inflation numbers start getting too high then you just change the formula.   It&#39;s short term economic activity that is paid for over years but it gives a nice little boost hence the parallel to a personal credit card.   </p>

<p>I don&#39;t look at it any differently than Bush&#39;s tax rebate or the cash for clunkers.  Definitely not productive investment but it yields a short term gain for the sitting politicians with a price to be paid by someone else.  I&#39;m obviously very dubious of certain branches of economic thought but it is partly for the reason that these theories seem to promote entering war recklessly.</p>

<p>This is why they fight wars. Maintain the dollar as the reserve currency, which lets you buy physical goods while not giving equal value in return.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully agree that infrastructure is a worthwhile long term investment.  I sort of think there are a lot of overblown theories on the reserve currency thing though.  My opinion is that the reserve currency status just simply comes from the position of being a stable government and economy mixed with being the largest market and having the largest military so it isn&#39;t by choice and it can&#39;t be undone as quickly and easily as some theories would suggest.  The US Dollar is the reserve currency mostly because there isn&#39;t much of an alternative (Brexit shows the clear problem with the Euro since it can be theoretically rolled back by a vote).  The reserve currency situation does ensure that the costs of war via inflation are spread to other countries which is another reason I find it so dishonest and evil.  Just my theories as an arm chair economist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not terribly informed about the circumstances there but it seemed to be the French who were really driving the regime change effort.  The timing also seemed more likely to be because of the Arab Spring.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think a new Libyan currency would pose any threat to the US.  I don&#39;t see China suddenly deciding to hold Libyan currency instead of US treasuries for example.  From what I remember it seemed he was trying to come up with a pan-Arab or pan-African currency but even still, would you trust them to be able to stable group?  Those regions are way too volatile. If the Euro isn&#39;t stable enough because of its political construction then an Arab or African union certainly wouldn&#39;t be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with &#39;NAP&#39; is how to define &#39;aggression&#39;. There are some things that are obviously aggressive, such as saying, &#39;I&#39;m going to kill you if you don&#39;t give me money&#39;. Other things are not quite so obvious, such as walking around in a large group and making &#39;visits&#39; to particular places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever someone describes the NAP as being difficult to apply, I find they are being deliberately disingenuous in order to justify otherwise-unjustified violence.</p>

<p>Walking around in large groups?  Maybe aggressive, but not a situation for self defense.  Making &quot;visits&quot;?  Same.  I might tend to leave rather quickly, but executing violence in &quot;self defense&quot; in these situations is not appropriate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, and thank you for pointing that out so we can move to the next part of the debate. It&#39;s about Intel. How do you get your Intel? Can you confirm or deny any of it? If not, your NAP plans may be I&#39;ll conceived, because you would not know, would you?</p>

<p>So in effect, those lacking knowledge remain on the sidelines in their minds, while the lines get moved and a whole world gets swept up into violence against the illusion of the last remaining threat to society. So ironic, when all of the old threats are still very real.</p>

<p>Through Operation Paperclip, the USA assimilated many Nazi scientists. Wouldn&#39;t you know it, there have been Nazis around the world since, and in the camps of Zionism and now the Ukraine, all thanks to America. You weren&#39;t ready for all that, though, were you?</p>

<p>You are unprepared, and you are not ready, and you don&#39;t seem to have what it takes, to get things done. So keep your NAP Right next to your armchair. No problem. I seek a more active approach to solving the world&#39;s problems. </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not violence. I believe people must find a new way to live, for the very system under which they live free ranged, is becoming increasingly hostile. A collective will seeks to take away the minds of many. By then it will be too late for your NAP.</p>

<p>What will you do, when the levy breaks? Small arms will not be enough. Organizations of 500,000 men won&#39;t be enough. Laser weapons and drones, cyber warfare and space weapons, will ensure world order. Then a New Dark Ages will come, clothed in false light..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say the act of self-defense is pretty self explanatory.  Until the act of force or violence is committed against you, you have nothing to defend yourself from.  Preemptive strikes are not allowed under the NAP, unless in the face of direct threat of violence.</p>

<p>For instance, if witness someone waving a knife around saying he&#39;s going to cut someone, you would have the right to eliminate that threat even though he never attacked you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Waving a Nazi flag around <strong>is not</strong> a direct threat of violence.  Posting &quot;punch a Nazi&quot; memes is closer to a direct threat, but <strong>is not</strong> a direct threat.</p>

<p>I am in medicine and we have strict rules about this, rules which might be helpful here.  We ask about suicidality and homicidality.  If someone admits to having thoughts of killing or hurting others, it triggers other questions to determine whether there is a credible risk of violence.  A question string might look like this (copied from a Violence Risk Assessment questionnaire from California State University):</p>

<ol>
<li>Have you ever had thoughts of hurting anyone? </li>
<li>If you wanted to hurt someone how would you do it? </li>
<li>Have you ever thought about killing someone? </li>
<li>Have you thought about killing someone in the past? </li>
<li>Do you have thoughts of hurting or killing someone now? </li>
<li>How often do you think about it? </li>
<li>Do you have a plan? </li>
<li>Are you planning on hurting _______? </li>
</ol>

<p>Means, motive, opportunity.  Specifics, not generalities, indicate an actionable call to violence.</p>

<p>Now with that said, if someone is posting about &quot;punch a Nazi&quot;, I think that qualifies as &quot;threatening&quot; and should be banned.  If someone is posting pro-Nazi crap, I don&#39;t think that qualifies, but if they are posting virulently anti-Semitic material that again qualifies as &quot;threatening&quot; and should be banned.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents, not that it matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wondered the same thing until I saw it happen.  The fact of it is, &quot;stupid&quot; has nothing to do with it, and &quot;violent&quot; ... well ... look around you.  Sometimes people get that way.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised what people admit to.  If someone is plotting something consciously and with full control of their faculties in good mental health, I suspect they might not admit it in a doctor&#39;s office, but if it is associated with mental illness, yeah people will admit to it.  It&#39;s a relief to admit it to someone, really.</p>

<p>As for what you do, it depends a lot on the potential victim, the individual situation, the urgency of the situation, and the clinic.  It varies from nothing at all, to &quot;duty to warn&quot; under the Tarasoff decision, to calling for emergency police right away.</p>

<p>There are lots of interesting things that individual facilities do in these sorts of situations in order to protect life+limb and minimize corporate liability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Waving an ISIS or Nazi flag isn&#39;t threatening?</p>

<p>One flag represents a group of people who want to put non-muslims to the sword.
The other represents a group of people who want to put all non-whites in ovens.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say waving either means you support the above sentiments.</p>

<p>A flag might say &quot;punch a Nazi&quot; but Nazi scream out a far more threatening and complex message.</p>

There can be things like invasion of privacy that aren&#39;t an act of force or violence but that can degrade ones quality of life significantly.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where property rights come into play.  As mentioned in the NAP, a violation of force against oneself and property is defensible.  Anyone spying on you on your property, or with your property (phone/computer) has already used force to gain access to your property.  You have the right to defend yourself against that.  That is, unless you gave prior consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, defense of property is wrong?  Seems like you&#39;re fighting against the forces of nature here.  </p>

<p>Ownership of property, such as a home, and defense thereof is pretty inherent in the animal kingdom.  Go try to share a home with a badger, see how long he&#39;ll let you stick your arm in it&#39;s hole.  </p>

<p>Homes/tools/weapons/shoes/clothes (you know, property) is how we humans survive, thrive, and raise our young.  Our lives become more enriched by providing for our loved ones with property, this includes intellectual.  By moving property rights as defensible you&#39;re removing the basis of how we live and take care of each other.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t jump to conclusions that the NAP say property is defensible by lethal force.  Lethal force is only acceptable when there&#39;s a lethal threat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think a badger has the concept have property. He may defend his space, but not his &quot;property.&quot;</p>

<p>Western common law already severely limits the ability to use force in defense of property. You can&#39;t shoot someone unless your life is threatened, and even in using lower levels of force it has to be reasonable. </p>

<p>I just put a much lower value on property than life so I don&#39;t think it should even be a defense. Fight it out in court or call the police. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too value life greater than property.  Once again, the NAP doesn&#39;t say you have the right to use lethal force, just that you have the right to use &#39;defensive&#39; force.  Defense has many applications and degrees, it&#39;s not a one size fits all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you&#39;re not a super property rights guy and want to use unreasonable force. My point that it&#39;s better to have a rule that you can&#39;t use any force. Someone stole your bike and is walking away, you should not use physical force to stop it, call the police and sue the person for it. We wouldn&#39;t lose much if we lose the right to use force, and society will be safer. You could still use appropriate force to protect yourself during a theft/robbery. And you can still confront that person (&quot;hey, give me my bike back. I&#39;m calling the police.&quot;)</p>

I think you should consider reading <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/charting-wage-stagnation/">this</a>. Americans produce more and receive less than ever before in the history of the country. That&#39;s not romantic, it&#39;s a quantifiable, economic fact.</p>

<p>I think you should consider reading <a href="https://condensedscience.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/life-expectancy-in-hunter-gatherers-and-other-groups/">this</a>. From the article, &quot;A common misconception that exists today is that the lifespan of early humans was extremely short. Often people quote numbers like 30 years as the average life span of early hunter gatherers and farmers. A look at modern day hunter-gatherer societies is the best way to examine the likely life span of early humans.&quot; Now obviously in many of the examples they give, these hunter gatherers will have access to a lot of life saving technology that their ancestors did not. That&#39;s an important factor to consider. For the most part though, our modern society improves life expectancy simply because it reduces infant mortality rates. That&#39;s a massive factor to consider. If you made it to adulthood in an ancient hunter gatherer society, your odds of living to a ripe old age were about as good as they are now.</p>

<p>The only thing preventing our current system from being a form of slavery is the fact that you can leave the system as it stands and won&#39;t be killed or punished for doing so. You can go live somewhere outside the clutches of government in the wild parts of the world without persecution from the society you leave. You&#39;re right it&#39;s not technically slavery, it&#39;s just damn near close.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>A better socioeconomic system than capitalism? I never suggested such a thing, but I have no doubt mankind will have to find an alternative in order to survive, as this current system is destroying itself without the help of external pressures just fine. In general I believe if we want to survive we&#39;ll have to find a way to provide a check and balance to the powers of the market and the state. We need a third power, clearly articulated, in order to bring those other two into balance. Technically there already is a balance there, it&#39;s the people, but the people have been asleep for a long time. I think there needs to be a structured communal organization, like a public organization owned by the human community that is subject to direct democracy and free from tax levying. It&#39;s just one idea, I have no idea if it would work, but I do think that whatever solution we propose will need to empower people to be more autonomous and involved in decision making in the market and the government both.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not close.  Not by a mile.  The reason I&#39;m sticking on this is that when you exaggerate the problem, no one takes you seriously.  We&#39;re not slaves. We can come and go as we choose.  We have options and rights.  We have social mobility.</p>

<p>Things need to change.  Maybe they will, maybe they won&#39;t.  I think we&#39;re ultimately going to see a major division in class, probably in the next 25-75 years. We&#39;re eventually going to see the end of the middle class and reduced social mobility. The gulf between the haves and have nots will magnify.  I&#39;m thinking that by the year 2100, America will look very similar to Mexico / Brazil socially and economically. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say there&#39;s more and more of us that believes this everyday.  One resists the invasion of armies; one does not resist the invasion of ideas. ;)</p>

<p>The religion of Statism, with it&#39;s dogmatic practices, gospel and clergy is dying.  It&#39;s a parasitical believe structure that places the collective over the individual, and survives solely on theft through force. </p>

<p>You&#39;re asking for more of the same and have offered no solutions.  The problem with a State power structure is that it can, and will (as history has shown us) become corrupted.  The damage a State power can do is always great than the damage an individual can do.  The only way to eliminate this threat is to decentralize/destroy the State power structure.  While individualism is bound to have complications, denial of the current problems with Statism is disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People will naturally gravitate to which ever society they want to live in.  It&#39;s called Spontaneous Order.  Force isn&#39;t necessary, it&#39;s a concept most Statists have a hard time understanding.</p>

<p>Think of the fibinachi sequence, like in the spirals of sunflowers.  There&#39;s a natural, underlying order to this Universe.  If left alone, it&#39;s ability to flourish is unleashed.  </p>

<p>Yes, sometimes life gets a bit messy and chaotic.  But that&#39;s just life.  Any attempt to mitigate life&#39;s inherent risks through laws has negative and unforeseen consequences.  </p>

<p>For example, look into the rise of motor vehicle deaths after they imposed seatbelt laws... They were trying to save lives... Oh well.</p>

<p>Just like the spiral of the sequence, human society wants to flex, fold and bend.  Change is really the  only constant you can depend on.  Government restricts this natural order and delays change through force, which always has consequences.  This builds tension in the society, and if sustained for a long enough time breaks the society (most of the time violently).  </p>

<p>Think about the lives that have been ruined over prohibition, of the past and the present.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a better way forward, but it&#39;s going to take the strong few to stand up and live what they preach.  It&#39;s just a matter of time for the herd to catch up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What has happened recently that is so much worse than the shit that happens every single fucking day on this planet? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The alt-right has spent the last 12+ months calling some of the left&#39;s movements ultra violent (BLM, antifa, etc) while holding themselves up as the paradigm of peaceful virtuous reason. Charlottesville happens and the left is using that as a YOU&#39;RE MORE VIOLENT THAN US example</p>

<p>The fallacy is that any of these movements are new and neither side has ever been particularly peaceful. There&#39;s a long history of extreme right vs extreme left violence. It had died down somewhat as of recently but it&#39;s been around for a long long time</p>

Imagine The United States of America facing something like a civil war, or a violent resistant/revolution. It would destabilize the entire world. Hundreds of millions would likely die, and the power vacuum would be filled in part by other nations such as Russia and China, that have created far more restriction on liberty than we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Threats of violence also mean material for potential blackmail. I&#39;ve only learned the Non-Aggression Principle in the last year after years of anger problems, because my behaviour both online and offline got completely out of control, so I&#39;ve had to work huge time on myself. I&#39;m likely going to struggle with mental illness for the rest of my life but I can at least say I&#39;m no longer violently aggressive and thin-skinned. Working out is helping me build confidence, I just have to make sure I keep working out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off to all those whom stick to NAP. I do favor these ideals, I do. Yet, why give quarter to an opponent that clearly has given you none. This, present day westernized nations, is a dying mode of civilization. We need to pay as little, and as most, attention as we can to this. There has been no forgiveness on their part. There will be no forgiveness on mine. Therefore, little should be spilled towards their direction. This thought process is dying and as with all dying things, it is fighting back with a last ditch effort. So keep a solid eye fixated on and exposing real stories. The battles now are not fought with guns and swords but with 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol..since this shit site was created, there have always been calls to violence in some form. Go on any thread involving black people in one of the news subreddits and some backwoods fucking retard will always be on there talking about how the ape needs to be hanged. There are many of these. Nothing has ever been done about it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t for one second act like you don&#39;t notice this either. Go look at any muslim thread, half the comments are calling for all muslims to be exterminated.</p>

<p>But of course, that&#39;s okay because it furthers the agenda of this website. Reddit is nothing more than a propaganda tool and i feel like a fucking idiot for even taking time out of my day to type this or even read anything on this cesspool.</p>

<p>Side note, this sub has been utter shit for over a year now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mods you guys get a lot of shit for the work you all do. It is pretty thankless business, so yeah thanks for all that you do.</p>

<p>The only thing I get really concerned about is when new initiatives, rules, guidelines, or precedents are set and then are used as a pretext to shut down free discussion by one group or another. I have seen this done on many web boards, including a subreddit in the last year. It is chilling to be perfectly honest, and it starts to make you feel paranoid. You start to think that you are crazy because multiple voices of dissent to the corporate/globalist agendas are slowly getting strained away. Censorship is done in clever and insidiously sneaky ways. As a result, whenever I see that new mods are being added, or if there is a temporary shutdown of the board, or if new and sudden rules are put in effect, or whatever,  I get really nervous. Anyways I think I can trust many of the mods here and hope that you have goodwill towards freedom of expression, even ugly, evil, or unpopular kinds. We must talk to one another, and reason together. We must realize that our enemies became our enemies for a reason. That nazis and commies did not crawl out from under a bunch of rocks. Radical ideologies give purpose and meaning in these strange times. The economy is in a terribly unhealthy state, made worse by a cold, amoral, and dangerous progress towards globalization, where we are not at all represented, and the corruption is not even disguised. Identity politics is played by collectivists and students of relatively new and critiqued social theories. I frequently see race and sex being used as weapons of division in these kinds of beliefs, particularly on the left end of the spectrum. On the right end of the spectrum, the pernicious and monstrous white nationalism and white identity are creeping forward. Both kinds of identity politics will further breed one another and we are dangerously close to an irredeemable situation. I cannot see a way out of this mess we have got ourselves in if we cannot learn to listen to one another and keep on belittling one another&#39;s grievances. If folks of all sides will not humble themselves, then we are facing race riots, states of emergancies, slaughters, confiscation of weapons and properties, the destruction of civil liberties, and ultimately the crumbling of the rights and privileges American citizens have enjoyed for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>One or another of these thoughts race through my head all the time, and especially when I see bastions of free exchange in ideas start to disappear. I pray to the Lord this place does not become one of them.</p>

<p>We are at a mexican standoff, and nobody is willing to lower their weapons. People have to be man and woman enough to lower their guard and face ideas that might disgust, shock, or terrify them. They have to empathize with why these thoughts are entertained. People have to see that everyone is capable of losing their heads in just these kinds of times just because we have grown so far apart from one another, and that is the last thing that needs to happen.</p>

<p>Oh America I love you, and I love all Americans. Progressive brothers and sisters, conservative and traditional brothers and sisters, we have to TALK to one another and we MUST tolerate one another. A multicultural society cannot function without tolerance. I have seen folks on both extremes write in disgust about tolerance, saying it is not a virtue, and it is only appeasement. These are the words of an ideologue, and of a fanatic. Wake up Americans!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, defense of property is wrong?  Seems like you&#39;re fighting against the forces of nature here.  </p>

<p>Ownership of property, such as a home, and defense thereof is pretty inherent in the animal kingdom.  Go try to share a home with a badger, see how long he&#39;ll let you stick your arm in it&#39;s hole.  </p>

<p>Homes/tools/weapons/shoes/clothes (you know, property) is how we humans survive, thrive, and raise our young.  Our lives become more enriched by providing for our loved ones with property, this includes intellectual.  By moving property rights as defensible you&#39;re removing the basis of how we live and take care of each other.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t jump to conclusions that the NAP say property is defensible by lethal force.  Lethal force is only acceptable when there&#39;s a lethal threat. </p>
