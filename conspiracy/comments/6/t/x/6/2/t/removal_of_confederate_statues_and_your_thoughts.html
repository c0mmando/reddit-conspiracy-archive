       Is it just me? Or has this country lost it's mind? I'm a white male in my late 20's. I got my bachelors degree in history. Learned a lot about the Confederacy at the majority liberal public college I attended. The most important thing I learned is that if you don't remember history, then it can/will repeat itself. I don't view these Confederate monuments as a lasting image of a war or ideology lost. If anything, I see this monuments as a reminder of where the country came from, and where we are now. It's not glorifying the South in my eyes, but it's a constant reminder of where we have come from.

       It's a joke.  Most of those men were just fighting for their nation state, which is what the original states were.  Funny how that gets glossed over in the MSM history books, huh?

       You're not alone. The media and social justice nonprofits are pushing for race war though. Honestly just weather the storm and keep speaking out on true history.

      <p>
       Btw, if you don't mind I solicit your expertise, what have you learned about Albert Pike? Any validity to the 3 world war quotes attributed to him? And did he really have as much of an impact as some theorists make him out to be? (Some say he begot the KKK and ADL, and was pretty much the main guy who made the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry as significant as it became)

       Certain segments of society have, yes. People feel lost, powerless, and hopeless. Taking down statues makes them feel like they have control and that they're accomplishing something. When you realize that, it completely explains the whole SJW segment of our society.

       If you were a Jew living in Germany would you feel the same way if the government was putting up Hitler statues?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "don't forget history" line wouldn't play for that, some people think that it shouldn't play here.  Statues exist to glorify people/ideas and to pretend otherwise is very disingenuous in my opinion.

       These statues have been up for quite some time. Over one hundred years for a lot of them, some of them put up in the 1800s...

       Facts are facts, sorry if they upset your revisionist narrative where the statues were organic expressions of heritage. They weren't. They were part of an organized propaganda campaign to put black people "back in their place" and resist integration.

       Why do you assume that's why I think the statues should remain?

       Can't it be that some people think they should remain for a talking point, a way to remember our history and a way to teach our children?

      <p>
       No matter the reason for some of them being put up, they are important to our country's history. Have you visited any civil war sites, statues or museums in the south? I have visited numerous, none of them were hateful.

       I didn't assume your motives, I stated the motives under which they were erected. The history they signify is the repeated campaigns to push back against equal rights, first during Jim Crow, then again during the Civil rights movement.
       <em>
        You

       are the one erasing history when you refuse to acknowledge the motivation for their being erected. You're the one saying "it doesnt matter why they were erected."

       Why some of the statues were built doesn't change the fact that not every southern man who fought and died for the south wanted slavery. Some men don't flee their country when war comes to their doorstep, some stay and fight. Some people may not understand it or like it, but that's a big part of it to many southerners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not revising any history. Taking statues down is just the first step. Next will be the books that have pictures of these statues or that include information about the subjects of the statues...

        The most important thing I learned is that if you don't remember history, then it can/will repeat itself.

       Many of these statues were erected as part of a pushback against the Civil Rights movement. Not because they wanted to memorialize the mistakes of the past, but because they wanted to send a racist message.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even with all that aside, these statues exist to glorify traitors. If a town or community decides they don't want to glorify traitors anymore, then they can take them down.

       These aren't monuments to an ideology they are monuments to real men who gave their lives to a very misunderstood conflict. I see no reason to deprive these men of their immortality. Furthermore i enjoy classical art and don't like seeing it destroyed. we can learn a lot from old art perhaps this is one reason for the push to destroy it, it's become apparent in recent years that some works surpass our modern ability to cast iron or carve stone. Specifically the horses atop the

       the only reason to deprive them is if you assume you know what they were fighting for. there are tons of different motivations in war. the majority of soldiers were fighting because they were drafted. I'm sorry that you have been tricked into believing that the civil was was about freeing slaves might i remind you that slavery is still legal in america if you are incarcerated and that 30 million people world wide are slaves. so much for that argument. so was it to make blacks and whites equal... well no in the words of the most beloved president in existence Abradolf Lincler

        "I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in anyway the social and political equality of the white and black races - that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything." -Lincoln-Douglas debates, 1858.

       This topic is about the removal of Confederate monuments in general, but it looks like you're talking specifically about the one in North Carolina. In that situation, it was brought down by mob vandalism which I don't support. But the statue definitely seems more innocuous than the Lee statue in Charlottesville

       Yeah slavery was on its way out. It was losing massive support, the north was largely ignoring the fugitive slave act, and it was being outlawed in new territories. However it was still a massive industry in the south and its what the south started the war over.

       It wasn't about it "losing support". It was about how expensive it was to own slaves vs using machines to do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there was a lot more to "freeing the slaves" than the altruistic-seeming tagline. Free them
       <em>
        to where
       </em>
       ? Where were they going to live, what were they going to eat? Don't even get me started on what happened to the children of slaves that were forcibly taken from their families, put on steamships and placed in northern orphanages to be "homed" with proper Northern white families.

       How would you feel about Nazi flags hanging on a German courthouse or government building? How do you feel about the ten commandments being on courthouse grounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think most want to destroy the statues altogether but rather move them from places of honor and authority (on the courthouse steps for example) to a museum - where they can, exactly as you suggest, remind people of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a major difference between trying to hide the past and simply trying to stop glorifying it. Placing things such as confederate statues, Nazi flags, or the ten commandments on government property such as courthouses shows more than just "reminding people of the past," it shows some kind of tacit approval of that message.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would bet most here would be offended if courthouses were allowed to display huge ten commandment statues in their lobbies. If you have a problem with that then ask yourself why. Because if you do you should have similar concerns with confederate statues being in the same location.

       The civil war was not a black and white emancipation conflict.  The biggest atrocities were committed by union soldiers who raped and burned their way through the confederacy.  Most confederate soldiers were not slave owners, simply men protecting their own.

       Slavery was a rallying point for republicans to start a war over democrat succession in the south.  The truth of the matter is far more complex than emancipation, and I cringe every time that I hear ignorant people call the confederates traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Succession was a right granted to the states, and the average confederate soldier never owned slaves.  Many confederate soldiers joined to protect their land and families.  I am fine with any state or municipal government removing statues or relocating them as I believe in federalism, but erasing or editing history benefits no one.

       Republicans wanted to end slavery and there is nothing wrong with that as a platform or a policy. Are you saying there is? No, it's not more complex and I don't give a fuck what you cringe about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Confederates were traitors. This is like saying "not everybody who fights for ISIS should be killed, some of them are just fighting for their home land. Let's build them statues!"

       Seccession not Succession and not a single state had the "right" to secede. You're spreading alot of bullshit about this and it's pathetic. Removing memorials to traitors does not erase or rewrite history.

       Extremism begets extremism.  I grew up in the 80/90's and began my adulthood as a moderate Republican.  Over time, I've watched Republicans move further and further to the right, which pushed me to the left.  So I now consider myself a moderate liberal - which is where it seems most of my peers are.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for those that are older (60+) or younger (30-), it seems they've been sucked up by the extremes - on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have the people my age, who can see both sides of this Confederate debate, and honestly probably don't give a shit either way and would prefer to just leave it to the communities to decide.  You have the old people who are hanging strong to tradition, refusing to accept that the intention of these memorials were predominately racist and a "fuck you" to the Union.  And you have the young people that are saying "fuck that" and tearing the memorials down - which is not the right way to handle the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extremes are taking over (just like this sub) and everyone in the middle is being forced to choose sides or get stomped on.  The right is stomping on people's personal liberties and the left is going social justice warrior and
       <strong>
        ALSO
       </strong>
       stepping on people's liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, we're losing our personal liberties because the extremists have lost their goddamn minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, that's my take on it all anyway.

       Perfectly fine with anything being in a museum, or on privately owned property. I think it's anyone's right to display what they want to in a case like this. If an employer doesn't like it and wants to fire them, or a business doesn't want to serve them for what they chose to display, that's fine too!  So long as we're talking private businesses at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for public/state property, id like to see these things be voted on, perferably in a way that the public has as much personal representation as possible like a referendum. I don't really like seeing groups literally rip these things down, but if the people of the town/city want it gone that should be something that can happen.

       I don't see what the big deal with the statues is. I think if there was a major war it's pretty normal to have statues of the generals just to keep track of it. Plus, I think its a reminder to the people who actually have ancestors that died in the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this the fact that the U.S. barely has any history compared to other countries and you see how ridiculous it is to try to get rid of statues about one of the few major wars the U.S. was involved in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are reading into this too much and trying to oversimplify people's motives and beliefs. It's one thing to vote democratically to take them down, and another to just topple them.

       I think the destruction of these monuments is akin to the Taliban/ISIL destroying historical monuments in the Middle East. From their point of view they have the best of intentions. I would hope people could put the Southern Statues into an appropriate context, but I am often at odds with contemporary movements.

       I didn't assume your motives, I stated the motives under which they were erected. The history they signify is the repeated campaigns to push back against equal rights, first during Jim Crow, then again during the Civil rights movement.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       are the one erasing history when you refuse to acknowledge the motivation for their being erected. You're the one saying "it doesnt matter why they were erected."
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is the historical revisionism.

       Funny how you don't know that the KKK and political allies installed these, and have little to nothing to do with the war. Just used as a threat

       Slavery was a rallying point for republicans to start a war over democrat succession in the south.  The truth of the matter is far more complex than emancipation, and I cringe every time that I hear ignorant people call the confederates traitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Succession was a right granted to the states, and the average confederate soldier never owned slaves.  Many confederate soldiers joined to protect their land and families.  I am fine with any state or municipal government removing statues or relocating them as I believe in federalism, but erasing or editing history benefits no one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our past is full of lessons we must not forget or we are destined to repeat them.

       I too don't gaf what you think or find pathetic.  The history of our country is important, and it should be preserved not destroyed.  The vigilante destruction of statues does absolutely nothing to move us forward.  Go fuck yourself.
