       Sersiouly? You guys are downvoting this guy for telling you to do some research?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conspiracy forum. Do some fucking research and stop shilling and laughing at the guy when flat earth would be just about the single biggest fucking conspiracy of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've done my research. Earth is fucking motionless. It does not move. Therefore, it doesn't rotate. It's not a fucking ball. Space, galaxies, universes... don't fucking exist. This is all we have. There is no big bang or evolution if the earth doesn't move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some fucking research and just try to ignore all the people calling you a flat-tard.

       This. I laughed about flat earth theory until I spent an evening going through some of Dubay's work. I like conspiracy (research) when it is something I don't subscribe to but I can play devils advocate. The FE theory honestly didn't have me defending a ball earth.

       Heard the theory. Until I see north and south I can't be certain. I am certain of many flat earth principles like convergence of the horizon ,and incorrect moon phases ,  And that physics we see around us don't apply to the globe, particulary water not curving anywhere.

       Level 10: Aliens are Demons; Project Bluebeam is real; the Elite serve Satan, an actual extra-dimensional negative-energy entity-being who has an army of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ is GOD, by and for which all things were created.
Belief in him through faith causes the Quickening, where spiritual and supernatural discernment is now accessible immediately within the consciousness.  This "Divine Intuition" is grown by studying through the living Document known as the Bible, brought to one's mind at a moments notice for whatever Divinely Providential application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith in Christ allows a superposition, where our soul becomes saved in alternate dimensions, forever; and thereby allows God's direct supernatural intervention in your life through prayer.  Jesus Christ is the Defense Attorney for all those which Satan accuses, rightfully as sinners.  Instead of God, the Judge agreeing with the case brought against you; Christ himself sacrificed himself for all that would believe.  He shows your name, written with his own blood in the book of life, And God says: "CASE DISMISSED",  as Christ already paid with his life sacrifice on the cross for your atonement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his infinite mercy, GOD became man, lived a perfect life and died for the sins of humanity.  Christ on the Third Day was raised Incorruptible and Everlasting.  The Lamb, who takes away the sins of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       GOD's perfection cannot coexist with evil as it is a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       God in his infinite wisdom created a method of Salvation which is antithetical to all other belief structures. Grace by Faith, to which sharing Salvation with others is the ultimate goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This direct connection causes a change of lifestyle, as the Vessel of Christ no longer deigns to participate in evil; whereby the Holy Spirit attaches itself to the consciousness to be a guide, a helper.  Reminding and convicting the believer when they need it, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       God then begins to show his will to the Believer, who beings to find a path and meaning for their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate goal is the self-sacrifice for the good of others; via Salvation and spreading this amazing mystery of Good News.
      </p>
      <p>
       If God is with me, who can be against me? If I know I am with God, WHOM SHALL I FEAR?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go forth.

       Some RTards believe that somehow alternate timelines? dimensions? are converging or diverging. For example, people remember hearing that Nelson Mandela died around 2000? (he is dead now (2013)) These imbeciles have developed some incomprehensible theory that Nelson Mandela did in fact die in 2000, but due to shifting realities he became alive again. Or, the barenstain bears were actually the barenstein bears back in the 1980's, but through some bullshit these childrens books defied all odds and changed their name.

       I don't think we're going to need to wait that long. To me, the evidence is pretty clear that the antichrist will come because we have established reasonably good government on the Earth, and Satan won't tolerate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the idea that everything is a decay until finally it becomes unbearable. Just look at how much good has come to this world from the just-ok government of the United States the last few centuries: literacy, doubled lifespan, freedom to learn about God and worship him if we choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the antichrist comes "out of the Abyss."

       Maybe. More and more people are waking and its really different at the individual level. These things really take a lot of time. The momentum is very slow to build but once it gets going nothing stops it. That is why you see governments overreact all the time. They are desperate to to stop any momentum or perceived loss of authority.

       Sometimes it seems things like pedophiles in high places could jolt the paradigm shift. After looking at a packed parking lot of a catholic church or penn state football game it doesn't seem likely though.

       It's inevitable. More and more are waking up everyday, and once they wake up that's that. Waking people up is not an exact science, for some it might take something like delving into Sandy Hook or other truther movements, some might find it in some dusty FBI file, some might hear it from a friend or family member, or overheard in a conversation, some come to spontaneous awaking by just sitting and pondering on the world for a bit. In time... In time...

       in there gut, that maybe, way back in September 2001, they where lied to.

       Happened right before our eyes! And I still have to argue with people who want to tell me the DNC didn't rig the primary and Russia is really behind the leaks. Proof means nothing to these people. They want to feel superior to conspiracy theorists as they call us (un-ironically as the term was part of the MKUltra program). They like the comfortable lie.

       Doubtful. It was a big deal for all of a few days when it finally became public knowledge that we're all being digitally surveiled 24-7. After those few days passed women got back to taking pictures of their dumpers and men got back to fantasy football and "vidya". And instead, now we pay for the privilege of having recording devices in our homes a la the Amazon echo and other similar offerings.

       It'll make way to the public once the world has woken up. As David Icke said, it's all about the control of perception. Media, hell the whole system is built to think no other than the herd: trust the government, watch the news, pay taxes, work, put your children in the same cycle once they're able to walk.
'Our' duty is to educate our kids to think critically, easily manipulated minds result in the 'sheeple' we know today, ultimately in brainless slaves with implanted microchips, run by AI. The system as it is now will break down automatically if people aren't fooled easily. (And, of course, if it's not too late already with nanobots coming soon)

       Nope. Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld could come forward on national television and admit they personally did 9/11. Most people still wouldn't care or even listen. They're too busy keeping up with the Kardashians.

       Never going to happen. The means of mass communication are in the hands of those with the self-interest to never see something like that happen.

      <p>
       If something like that were to happen it would have been 9-11 and we would have made Saudi Arabia glow in the dark. And yet, somehow the masses believe that the act perpetrated by a group of men, 15 of 19 who were Saudi, coordinated, trained and funded by a Saudi Prince who was found living in Pakistan was instead concocted by Iraq and Afghanistan. *blink*

       Yeah, the truth behind DMT and what happens in those experiences would change the world FAST if it got out- and it's getting out, thanks to people like Terence McKenna, Dennis McKenna, and recently Joe Rogan. The big secret is that the experiences are real and involve alien contact.

       On a global scale, I fear not.  My belief is that modern human psychology won't allow for it.  Too many people are unwilling to change their worldview no matter the evidence provided.  And there will always be strong forces working to keep that paradigm the way it is.

       There already has been. Warrant-less Wiretapping program is one. But the bottom line is even with something like MKUltra which was considered one of the more crazy conspiracy theories for like 50 years once CIA documents were declassified and standing as proof most people still call it a conspiracy theory. No one cares about the truth, just maintaining the comfortable lie.

       That has already happened. Ppl are pretending it is not happening. Those that make noise get discredited, fired, or worse.  Crimes are being committed in broad day with the protection of law enforcement. The constitution is being outlawed more blatantly every other day.  No free speech. No due process. No speedy trial (no trial at all).  No privacy. The 1% stealing massively from the middle and lower classes. It is no secret.  Police abuse citizens routinely, and tazer/ kill more than any other country.  Ppl are treated unjustly by "justice system". Rich are above the law. Regular ppl get prison and asset forfeiture.
