        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The ramifications of this are huge.</p>

<p>Number one..by not having to sign the non-proliferation treaty Israel avoids embargoes.</p>

<p>This is in direct relation to the Anti-BDS bill our Congressmen are pushing because it all relates to the embargo laws established in the early 70s.</p>

<p>Despite multiple attempts in multiple years by the international community to verify if Israel possesses nuclear weapons nothing has been done.</p>

<p>Still to this day...Israel will neither confirm or deny they possess nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>If our congressmen continue to support the Anti-BDS bill it&#39;s time for them to demand an inspection by the UN for nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Edit: Even more important is the attack on free speech on the internet by the state of Israel.</p>

<p>How much longer before I&#39;m not even allowed to make this post due to censorship of anything critical of Israel?</p>

<p>those bullets in 1961 nearly decapitated JFK and he wanted to inspect Israeli nukes.  Of all the weak reasons given on TV (mafia, cuba, lone gunman) the israel nuclear plant Dimona is the most plausible reason for the assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no lover of Israel, but I think some of your notes should be expanded on &amp; corrected.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So this &#39;country&#39; pops into existence<br/>
Jews had received official support for a state from the British in 1917. This promise came in lieu of other national promises the British probably had no intention to keep (just like they betrayed the Arabs), but it did encourage increased Jewish migration to Palestine, which leads to...  </p>

<p>right after the world tried to kill each other.<br/>
Rather, WW2 created the moral impetus that Jews used to lobby Britain to keep their word from 1917. By the end of WW2 Jews had the demographic edge in what would become Israel, to justify getting their own country, separate from Palestine. Numerous factors of military, technological etc. superiority then allowed Israel to expand to its current borders.  </p>

<p>Gets nukes<br/>
Didn&#39;t so much &quot;get&quot; nukes as much as Israel was allowed to develop them. France and South Africa are likely collaborators with Israel&#39;s nuclear program. From a military standpoint, Israel&#39;s desire for nukes is perfectly understandable (if macabre, as per the nature of the weapon).  </p>

<p>continues to be racist...AND is getting bigger<br/>
Problem is that anyone openly going at Israel for their settlement policy etc. would go against the US, and no one really cares about the Palestinians that much. There is no altruism in geopolitics. It was easy to shit on Saddam&#39;s treatment of the Kurds because he had no friends, but no one is going to risk relations with the US just to be nice to Palestinians.  </p>

<p>Nobody wants regime change their?<br/>
US is the main purveyor of regime change, and there&#39;s no reason why the US would topple their main ally in the region.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not defending Israel on anything. There&#39;s nothing in the OP that I&#39;d find false.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p><a href="http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207">http://winteractionables.com/?p=25207</a></p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report">https://www.scribd.com/collections/4010452/9-11-The-Dancing-Israelis-FBI-report</a></p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html">http://911research.wtc7.net/wtc/analysis/design.html</a></p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579">http://www.haaretz.com/odigo-says-workers-were-warned-of-attack-1.70579</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1387069/US-arrests-200-young-Israelis-in-spying-investigation.html</a></p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not. Unless you work in Government disinfo departments, how would you know what gets attention and what doesn&#39;t. I think you&#39;re vain for pretending you do know.</p>

<p>By the way you still haven&#39;t answered my question, does RES have shared tags? Maybe I should download it and tag you as &quot;annoying shit&quot; to test it out?</p>

<p>How do you know? And why would it matter?</p>

<p>You have no idea how Government psyop departments work and yet you pretend you do. I&#39;ve had two reddit users who disputed what I said claim they worked for the Government previously. One claimed to be a pentagon employee, another claim to be ex intelligence.</p>

<p>Did the person who tag me as &quot;liar&quot; even bother to give any evidence, such as linking to a deceptive post?</p>
