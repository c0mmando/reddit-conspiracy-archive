       I have seen the video footage of the Pentagon strike. There is  absolutely no aeroplane in the video. Whatever that hit Pentagon looks way smaller than a passenger plane. Why is this never discussed?  I'm not saying I believe in some conspiracy, I need someone who doesn't, to explain why there's no plane in the footage.

       I 100% agree.  The official Petagon footage shows something that looks like a small drone hitting the Pentagon.

       Are you talking about the few frames that were released? If so, i agree. No plane in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are talking about the video the shows a small white missile hitting the pentagon, unfortunately its a fake that has been properly debunked.

       It isn't unreasonable to think that if they have trillions of dollars of untraceable tax money that they could design a missile to look even more like a small plane.

       Well, to play devils advocate, who knows when that CCTV camera was installed and how old it is exactly, but I do know that those older CCTV cameras are very low framerate and with a fast moving object like a plane/missile you cant expect to capture a lot. Even if it did capture it, they could edit it out just so you see something that they could call a 'nose' of a plane and then rely on planting plane parts around the pentagon like the metal chassis parts and the engine and what not.

       Ehhh when you can make the receipts for trillions of tax dollars disappear, I don't think they care about one video. Nobodies argument that 9/11 was a coup/inside job solely rests on the validity of this video so you are just kind of beating a dead horse.

       Unless I'm mistaken all four planes crossed over a milliary base that day and based on the speeds that they were clocked at my personal belief is that all four plans landed there and drones were sent out that were made to look like the planes. As for the passengers? I believe they were executed at that base.

       Agreed but honestly I think it's true. it gets even more fucked up though. So you know the phone calls made on the plane that crashed in Shanksville? Well when you looks at all the calls place and their durations it becomes clear that they weren't made on those planes, at those altitudes, for those durations since cell phones weren't and I believe still aren't capable plus all the calls sounded perfectly clear with practically no background noise which is ridiculous if they happened on those planes. To me this means that those passengers were likely forced to make those calls and then we're executed.

       Following the theory, all of those atrocities were commited in order to make the world we now currently live in today. I imagine the perpetrators would consider it was all being done for the greater good.

       Yup and more specifically to give an excuse to invade Iraq and Afghanistan, further the military industrial complex, destabilize the region, create an endless "war on terror" and make those in the administration a lot of money.

       It’s funny to see new conspiracy theorist go through and learn the conspiracy’s you have learned before. This is well known. All the conspiracy’s you read about are well know. Although now there seems to be a shift to discredit a lot of conspiracy’s, the biggest being the 9/11 attack. No doubt in my mind it was a missile. There was a video out for a few hours a few years back, I watched it, clear as day a missile, then the video was gone from existence.

       It's been discussed but there are only two kinds of people who see a plane in that footage. Those who are paid to and those who are terrified of the truth. You can't have a lot of discussion with either brand.

       I'm mobile right now and can't do a proper search. But there's a fairy well known image that's been posted here before of a missile mocked up to look like an airliner. I'll post it later. But I recommend you do an image search in the meantime.

       Why what? Was it used? My personal opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Middle eastern terrorists sponsored by Saudi Arabian oil bajillionaires planned and carried out the attacks. The government a la Pear Harbor knew,  but let it happen for their own purposes. With the knowledge they also took advantage of the situation to hide huge financial crimes and mismanagement of military budgets by destroying the paper trails etc. at the pentagon and WTC 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The missile simply because its way easier than hijacking a plane yourself. There are holes in that framework but the main ideas are there and it's the weekend so I'm in no shape to elaborate more coherently.

       This is something that I always thought people looked over. The attacks were known to be in the works a month before hand. The CIA knew this was all happening and warned Bush about it in a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US">
        daily brief
       </a>
       . How come security in the US wasn't beefed up after Bush got this warning? If anything, I've heard some of the security was seemingly laxed on purpose. Is it possible that maybe the attacks were known to happen but nothing was done so there would be an excuse for war? That would be a lot simpler than saying it was this massive inside job which hundreds of people would have to be involved. And every single one of them would have to be kept quiet. You would think someone would have felt the need to speak up about the death of thousands of Americans.

       Nothing would need to be done to prevent attacks on the Pentagon. It's ringed with advanced automated anti-missile batteries. For something to hit the Pentagon those systems would have to be turned off.

       It has anti missile batteries which are normally turned off because the pentagon is literally located at the foot of an airport runway. Airplanes flying towards the pentagon is an hourly occurrence, or was up until that point. There is a fairly big misconception that the pentagon was some military fortress impressible to attack. But in reality, everything was generally unarmed unless there was a heightened sense of threat.

       So, yeah, even on live footage you can hear the news reporter saying how he/she can't see any pieces of aircraft larger than the size of a brick surrounding the Pentagon. It was most likely either a drone, missle, or bomb which blew up the section which was "hit."
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly is why? Two days prior to 9/11, the pentagon announced that it had "lost" 2.3 trillion in records of pentagon financing/spending. Now, this in itself may not be a direct connection, as the pentagon routinely "loses" and covers up trillions of dollars of covert spending, let alone the covert agencies which don't have to release their spending reports publicly or to congress. But, it just so happens that the area which was hit in the pentagon was the
       <em>
        exact
       </em>
       area where the pentagon stores its financial records. You can draw a lot of conclusions on why this happened on 9/11 as opposed to any other day(as there is a lot more to it) but I'll just leave you with the most simple result: no one even remembered the pentagon saying shit after the catastrophe that was 9/11 and there were no physical records left to search. Pretttyy fishy.
