       Who has the louder voice on a pseudonymous platform like Reddit? A bunch of random individuals with a variety of nuanced opinions, or governments and corporations with endless budgets to promote their viewpoints?
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that there are opinions being parroted over and over verbatim by bots, that help frame the conversation and amplify the echo chamber. The internet is turning into a constant stream of drivel where everything is an opinion and facts are worthless. Anyone who proposes filtering the signal from the noise is shot down as an opponent of free speech and biased. It's completely insane and it is rapidly eroding our cultures outside of the internet.

       Yeah it is funny to me that people want to argue about things they are reading about second hand. They just want to argue in general, use you to jerk themselves off, feel superior, etc. It is not like we can be 100% certain about most things, so I just usually share my off the cuff thought/opinion and move on. There is not much on here worth arguing over, especially when there is so much deception going on.

       I was in the army reserves, but working full time. I had this cool Platoon Sergeant who most definitely did use sexually harassing language around some females (I don't think what he said should have landed him in any trouble.) The Major called me into his office and I got to use the "I don't recall defense." I was basing this off of Ollie North testimony not Bill Clinton's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I support sexual harassment. Back in 1999 I thought what he said was no big deal.

       That's what they want you to think, but the thing is that this sub is over two years old and before the election, it reasonably promoted free thinking. At least it didn't tell people to accept an immediately propagated narrative attributing killer Nazis to over half of the legal US population who voted for Trump.

       ...but if that free thinking ever happens to coincide with what the MSM is reporting, then don't. Because it must be wrong.

       Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Just blindly believing the opposite of whatever the media says is just as detrimental to free thinking.

       You completely mischaracterized my statement. I'm not telling people to stop asking questions. I'm just saying be careful not to fall into the other trap of just blindly believing the opposite of what the MSM is saying.

       Absolutely agree. However, if the answers to those questions wind up suggesting that he is simply a white nationalist who drove his car into protesters out of anger, then we need to be willing to accept that as well.

       On a non news habbening day, why can't the mods log the accts that flood the forums with non conspiracy political posts (both sides)?  I'm not saying ban them, they should make a sticky and call them out.  I.e.  here is a list of conspiracy posters that blatantly flood the sub with partisan political posts that are non conspiracy related.

       What? How is he saying that? He's saying apply critical thinking, take no one's word for anything and form an opinion yourself. He specifies no specific opinion for you to form, so I'm unsure why you're triggered by this post.

       This account is only a month old (to be fair this is like account number 8 over the last like 6 years) but people would call others shills or tell people they're idiots constantly, even when discussing Antartica and Ancient Civ shit back in the day. This sub went to hell during the elections and hasn't recovered since, no matter which side you're on. Both sides are accusing the other of the same exact thing and our justifying their actions using the same reasons as the other side.

       It's so different now, back in the day it was ok to talk about things like Sandy Hook here. Hell I even remember people getting bashed for coming here and asking about it, the general sentiment of this subreddit back then was that it was one of most obvious false flags and a great starting redpill for any budding conspiracy theorist. Nowadays any mention of Sandy Hook, even in this subreddit, is met with anger and downvotes.

       When a controversial or sensational event is reported by the MSM, our first response as a sub should be a concerted effort to
       <em>
        confirm or deny
       </em>
       the event to see if it
       <em>
        holds up to scrutiny.
       </em>
       Not to simply accept every detail we see on CNN and then circlejerk about the political implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know about Operation Mockingbird -- right? We know that the mainstream cable news outlets often report literally fake news -- right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So why should anyone come under fire for questioning the veracity of these lurid claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, "there's video therefore it's real" is not critical thinking!

       Fuck these joke bs top comments. Op is right. Especially today. This shut has gotten way out of control. The true advocates of the sub that brought the useful researched posts have moved on. These days most forums are like this. "You suck" "government shill" "alt right" "you only because of this" "blah blah blah". There is no substance. It's garbage posters.

       This guy has posted this exact same post, word for word, at least three times in the past two hours. He's either karma whoring is is a shill. There are so many reasons why this entire post is just b.s. it's why he got down voted to oblivion the first like five times (I've personally commented and seen three posts, I would assume this dumbfuck has been at it).

         Free thinking is defined objectively. I.e. in relation to who the user characterizes "free thinkers." I think that many T_D users on this sub are not "free thinkers." I would assume they think the same of me.

         As conspiracy theorists we actually
         <em>
          depend
         </em>
         on the work and research of others. It is critical. This sub is the prime example of that. What other function does this have but to come together as a community of like minded individuals to share, debate and question each other. Ultimately, i have formed my theories on the backs of other users. Off the top of my head, for instance, u/astralrocker2001 made a post one day on a topic i had never even heard of. How am i supposed to interact with info i cant even begin to debate or form my own opinion on? Simple, i didnt need to. I just listened, processed and proceeded. And it changed everything for me. How we filter and process the information is what is important.

       Yeah the whole comment was nonsense honestly. "Free thinker" isn't just a term used to classify people in a group. It's used to describe an individual who decides to take responsibility for him or herself and doesn't let anyone else make them their bitch or tell him or her to think a certain way or disregard anomalies or to not question the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       A free thinker isn't just someone who says that they are or says that another group isn't. It's someone who's willing to
       <strong>
        think for themselves
       </strong>
       and look at the facts objectively to form their probable conclusion, without being influenced by those egotistic assholes telling him or her how and what to think.

       I honestly think he's trying to make it seem like being a free thinker isn't possible. But that's just not true. It is possible to be happy with what you have, not attach your identity to any groups, and learn about all sides of an argument or subject in order to form an objective and properly informed perspective.

       No, exactly the opposite. Being a free thinker requires a much deeper level of understanding than what I've seen demonstrated in this post. I fully support "free thinking." My issue stems from your approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally posting about this issue in the broad way that you did is a huge red flag. What are you accomplishing? Like I articulated,
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       defines themselves as a "free thinker." Think Platos allegory of the cave. The people living in the shadows deem the real world to be fake since all they know is shadow. The parallel would to reddit would be what I described with me and T_D users. Nothing of merit is accomplished by your post. Quite the opposite. It affirms the same qualities and thinking that keep people trapped.

       You should delete it because all you're doing is pandering the divide and conquer technique and assuming a bunch of bullshit. And based on that first assumption of yours, I doubt you're thinking through your argument fully and are instead falling victim to your ego.

       Where's the link? From an outside perspective, snowmandan made a post from mobile and it double posted (happens often with comments and posts when I'm on mobile with spotty service) and then you swooped in to be a jerk about it. I'm not saying that's what happened, but that's how it appears. Is there a link for your second edit that would offer some clarification?

       I honestly didn't understand what you were trying to convey at first. I did notice that you made the same "you posted this 5 times..." comment 3 times in your post history. I searched this thread cause I assumed you posted here 3 times and thought they were 3 different threads. Though only one of those posts is in this thread. Which does lead to your statement being credible. Though I, A. Don't really understand the ramifications. And B. Can establish you are correct. I had not seen op make same post multiple times. I only saw this one. I only checked your comment history to try and establish the context of your post because I wasn't sure. Though, since only one of your posts is in this thread, I have to assume you are correct atm.

       How would investigating the patsy theory be defending Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignoring the fact that these white nationalists are pro capitalism whilst the Nazis where pro socialism (but not the Marxist/Communist variant) defending Nazis would involve making arguments regarding what Nazis believe, not whether a horrific event was actually a psyop designed to further justify digital censorship measures currently being rolled out.

       Don't push this shit, Nazis were pro-capitalism, but they weren't Pro-free Market. They believe in what is basically an extreme form of mercantilism. Trying to equate Fascist collectivisation to Communist collectivisation is absolutely inane and just lowers the bar of debate on both. They were very different beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Occam's Razor says that the simplest explanation is most often the truth. A known white supremacist driving his car into a crowd protesting a white supremacist rally is much simpler than trying to say he's some antifa plant, or a government psyop agent. You'd have to go in already believing that this was the case to come to this conclusion, and going into an event with an agenda is most likely because you want to shield the most probable instigator from indictment. That's what I meant by saying "defending Nazis".

       Is that really the most likely reason? Especially considering that huge numbers of people that think YouTuber's like 'Sargon of Akkad', for example, are alt-right and that we live in an age were accusations of belonging to a hated group are all that is needed to prove the accusations are true.

       State Capitalism is Socialism you utter plonker - the state owns the means of production i.e. the capital. Marxist's try to argue there's a difference using surplus value as evidence, but all that means is that economic activity mustn't be used to create more economic activity i.e. growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism">
        State capitalism:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Marxist literature defines state capitalism as a social system combining capitalism...with ownership or control by a state...where the government controls the economy...extracting the surplus value from the workforce in order to invest it in further production.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...many people argue that the modern People's Republic of China constitutes a form of state capitalism and/or that the Soviet Union failed in its goal to establish socialism, but rather established state capitalism.
       </p>

       So basically attempts at socialism always produce state capitalism because the only difference between the two is Marxist literature.

       And so are like 95% of the conspiracies posted here, but that doesn't stop people from spouting bullshit. Much like today, that guy is guilty as fuck, admitted he did it, videos of him doing it including pictures of him in the driver seat, he's an openly known neo-nazi who is a member of vanguard america, was shown to be with them before the incident. Please point me to where the conspiracy is in this? Isn't it more likely that there is just a sick motherfucker in a group of neonazis?

       It's unfortunate that one of the banes of being a flat earther is the constant attacks or questioning of ones academia. Unfortunately a lot of this is through ignorance of exactly how big a puzzle Flat Earth theory is to start making sense, including how gravity doesn't exist, only up down, buoyancy and density, or how the sun is not big and far but small an localized, just two examples of "unprovable" things (unless you subscribe to the gospels of the religion of NASA). You say I didn't study physics (I've studied plenty of physics), but sometimes the things you learn just aren't true when new better explanations come to play, like how I mentioned with gravity.

       Because the parameters of the theory allow most people to automatically dismiss it. It is too big, and is not just a conspiracy theory but has all kinds of other undesirable properties. It requires an astounding number of scientists, teachers, and various public figures to be deliberately misleading everyone, and thus it comes with a fantastic anti-intellectual bent. It requires extraordinary explanations for commonplace things that are much more easily explained by a spherical Earth. It requires our planet to be somehow different than all the others we can observe with the naked eye and low-powered telescopes. I'd sooner believe in Sasquatch, ancient aliens, and a wrathful anthropomorphic god than a flat earth.

       What we observe with our eyes and telescopes are just lights. They are "planets" only because NASA and the powers at be indoctrinate you to think stars are giant suns far away and wandering stars are planets. To believe in flat earth you must discredit all space agencies entirely (because they have no credibility) and not accept any source of information from them. Once you do this you realize there is no evidence for a sphere earth or even outer space including the size and distances of the sun, moon, and other aspects of "outer space".

       so one side is saying to be ignorant and not look at things which might sway your opinion...
      </p>
      <p>
       and the other is saying look into everything and weigh it out....
      </p>
      <p>
       there is nothing wrong with engagement and education on a subject. I don't think those two approaches are equal - there is great danger in being ignorant, and I don't think there is quite the same risk in being critical and evaluating all options.

       All bluster and strong words must be tempered with facts. And some decent theory-building skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theories (all theories whatsoever) come in 3 varieties:
False
Possible &amp;
unfalsifiable
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are the only choices available. Ever. Doesn't matter if it's a murder case, tax fraud, chemistry problem, engineering, recipe mystery, it doesn't matter. And the only thing differentiating a false theory from a possible one is it's ability to predict some yet unknown factor, a.k.a., a test.
      </p>
      <p>
       This of course, only counts for falsifiable theories. If a theory is true under all circumstances, it's definitely a piece of shit theory and can be immediately discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this, refine it. Understand it. It is applicable in all cases past, present and future for any inductive theory that can be dreamed up.

       You should delete it because all you're doing is pandering the divide and conquer technique and assuming a bunch of bullshit. And based on that first assumption of yours, I doubt you're thinking through your argument fully and are instead falling victim to your ego.

       I'll post a link in the edit in a second. Even if it was a different user, it was word for word the same post. How is it possible that two out of three comments are accusing you of double posting within 20 mins of posting?

       See, there's your problem.  You think that the real world is a nice tidy package that can fit into some bullshit logical axiom such as Occam's Razor.  Occams' razor is the intellectual equivalent of a maggot festering pile of shit on a West Texas highway.

        there is video comedy montages

       showing the many times he has disavowed , so these people are pushing a narrative and trying to link Trump himself to it, flat out.
