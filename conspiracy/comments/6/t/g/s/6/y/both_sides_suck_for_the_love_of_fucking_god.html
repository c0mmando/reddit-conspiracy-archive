    <div class="md"><p>I seem to remember a man saying &quot;why can&#39;t we all just get along&quot;, many years back. But how do we do that when some people have decided to hate others based on them belonging to any number of different groups. If someone hates me because of the color of my skin, how do I make peace with that person? If someone hates me because of my lifestyle, religion, gender, age, weight, race or belief system, how do I make peace with that. If you are someone who hates on groups, it is you who needs to change. People are not groups, they are individuals, each with good traits and bad ones, and should be judged as such. The division is a choice each one of us needs to make, it&#39;s not a group decision, it is an individual one. Decide for yourself what kind of world you want to live in. The only puppets are the ones who follow blind ideology and have hatred for strangers. Get to know someone you think you hate, chances are you have more in common then you realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best bet is to redpill everyone you know while also telling them how we are divided artificially by mental programming from media/education. They divide us by:</p>

<p>Race, income, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, political stance, and many many more ways. All these divisions create many groups but in reality there is only 1 group and that group is Earth. Once we become 1 group again, we will move mountains. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t be total anarchism, there would likely still be government bodies to oversee the purchase and operation of the water facilities. Why would a libertarian capitalist society limit someone&#39;s ability to purchase and profit from supplying water? It would be in the person&#39;s right to own private property under the basic idea of libertarianism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never said to privatize everything such as our basic needs as humans.</p>

<p>I would consider medical care and the methods of critical thinking and analysis taught in higher education to be basic human needs. Where&#39;s the line drawn?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before the government got involved, college was cheap. You went to the bank, asked for a loan, they asked for your grades and the like, then the bank decided how risky you were and gave you money accordingly. </p>

<p>Colleges had to put their tuition to a high enough level that they made a profit, but not too high to where banks wouldn&#39;t lend out loans. They competed, and prices were low.</p>

<p>But then the government decided that education was a right, and that nobody should be denied a loan. So now kids can take out their entire tuition as a loan via Sally Mae and such. </p>

<p>Colleges have no incentive to NOT raise prices now. Students will continue receiving loans and paying the ridiculous tuition prices anyway.</p>

<p>Problem -&gt; reaction -&gt; solution</p>

<p>Now since the government got involved and screwed up a working system, they say that all college should be free and publicly funded so that your college degree is now not valuable and becomes completely worthless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is the privatization of the most basic human need- your livelihood.</p>

<p>Reading your other responses, you&#39;re making the mistake of defining socialism as &quot;when the government does stuff&quot; bit there is such a thing as libertarian socialism. An escape would be anarcho-syndicalism. Contrary to what your public education might have told you, but anarchism isn&#39;t &quot;no government,&quot; its proponents are simply opposed to all arbitrary hierarchies. Libertarian socialists are those who are opposed to state tyranny <em>and</em> private tyranny. They recognize the issues with state bureaucracy but also understand that wage labor within the capitalist system is tantamount to slavery. When the vast majority have no alternative but to labor for another&#39;s profit <em>in order to survive</em>, they are no better than slaves. They&#39;re simply free range livestock, with the illusion of freedom and the American dream. But it&#39;s the American ruse, perpetrated on all of us by the moneyed elite.</p>

<p>I believe a potential solution to look at is participatory politics, or parpolity, particularly as advocated by Reddit partner Aaron Swartz before his murder, wherein people are represented by a series of nested councils approximately 25-50 people in size, who vote on issues and elect a representative to the next tier. Through exponents, only 5 or so councils are necessary to represent all 300 million Americans. </p>

<p>Contrast that with today&#39;s politics where we have one representative for over <em>750000</em> citizens, all elected mainly through virtue of campaign donations from wealthy contributors (notice capitalism inevitably allows such accumulation of capital that it permits distortion of the political system?) .</p>

If they cannot unite properly, how do they expect places like America to ever fully unite when it bas been politically divided from the start?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what is I think you&#39;re saying.  The extremists are really just arguing about who&#39;s ideology is worse for the country with out making a case for their own side.  Neither side can ever concede their stance on any issue.  It would destroy their entire foundation if they were wrong on any point. It might be time to write them off. However, I wouldn&#39;t disparage the disagreements we have in the center.  When we argue with each other, we usually argue about very specific issues.  issues that maybe should be debated.  Those arguments can be productive and interesting to follow, and there&#39;s no real shame in having you&#39;re opinion changed by them.  If we had our own sub i&#39;d spend a lot more time there then I do in this roaring dumpster fire.</p>

<p>They&#39;re bullying white students and professors in schools. They&#39;re influencing legislation in Canada to take children if you don&#39;t give them sex changes. It&#39;s blind to common sense. It erodes every ounce of common sense tradition. It&#39;s a historical cancer of great societies that, if it doesn&#39;t outright destroy them forces them to rebuild, never to be great or prosperous again. It battles basic common sense in all things. It attacks everything, tears it apart. It ruins education, family, racial and sexual relationship. It kills the very fabric of society.</p>

<p>And it is demonstrated by large swaths of society. You cannot tell me it doesn&#39;t. I know it does.</p>

It is pretty obvious that this dude in the car panicked when some jackass protest-tard started bashing it with his sign moments before he accelerated into the crowd trying to escape. When he hit the other car he couldn&#39;t see initially he reversed as fast as he could to get away from the percieved danger. His car was still functional if he was intending to maim and not escape why not take another pass at the crowd?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe we should just simply remember we are all human and not personally identify with either side?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that the main problem? Our mental identification with a particular side. It literally translates to - &quot;I am liberal&quot;, &quot;I am conservative&quot;. No, you are a human being (or for those more spiritually inclined, simply a being).</p>

<p>Thus you can agree with certain aspects of one side and disagree with certain aspects of another side, but as long as you equate your identity to either side, you&#39;ve already thrown yourself into the fog of illusion. You will then defend that side and get angry when anyone attacks it, whilst attacking the other side. </p>

<p>Not realizing that you can agree with aspects of a certain side and not label your very core self as part of that side. As soon as you do that your identity is mixed up with &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;left or &quot;right&quot;....</p>

<p>You can agree with conservative and/or liberal principles, but don&#39;t make it part of your identity. That is what I see as the main problem.</p>

<p>If you have to identify as something, identify as a living being, or simply as a being. This will help you have compassion for your other fellow beings that you inhabit this beautiful planet with, including all of nature with its incredible animal and plant-life.</p>

<p>Promote compassion, not hate. By not mentally identifying with a position or label it&#39;s much easier to have compassion and empathy for the other side, because you see the other side as equal to you and you don&#39;t have an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality.</p>

For some reason, it&#39;s only Whites who are supposed to be these hyper-individualists divorced from any coherent beliefs or ideology. </p>

<p>Diversity and multiculturalism are what create these divisions (i.e. forcing people from different races/ethnicities/cultures to co-exist). The more diversity you have, the more conflict there&#39;s gonna be. As the conflict &amp; personal atomization increases, the more people will become identitarians. Education, Hollywood, &amp; the media are more than happy to push anti-White sentiments; White people see this and they&#39;re tired of it. Burying your head in the sand and calling both sides stupid isn&#39;t a solution. They hate you if you&#39;re white, and saying you&#39;re above it all won&#39;t matter when shit hits the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just stopped by this sub to see what was up. Haven&#39;t checked in in a while. Holy shit looking at some of the other posts on the front page.. this truly is not the subreddit it was one year ago. </p>

<p>This place is now plagued with massive left vs right arguments, those of which are making up the top comments of front page links. Lefties are un-ironically calling Trump a Russian puppet, while the righties are furiously downvoting anything (and often times legitmately) critical of the man. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t get how anyone could be sincerely participating in this forum while identifying themselves as being on one side of the political spectrum. These people aren&#39;t woke. They&#39;re just as brainwashed as the side they revel in mocking for being &#39;brainwashed&#39;. Holy fuck. Rant over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, sounds about right, just today I was basically called a leftist commie, and that me and all the SJWs would be crying as the right rises. I got this reply by saying that trump wouldn&#39;t likely win a second term, especially as his popularity declines. I am very neutral when it comes to politics as I sit more of in the middle in between parties.  It appears to be getting worse as the team style politics gets worse and both sides just sit here and refuse to actually communicate. I myself have learned to see both sides as for what they are after being wedged between socialist and conservative friends in my social group. </p>

<p>What rings true to me is what my conservative friend said once when asked what was the greatest threat to America. He said that the left and their bad ideas are not the greatest threat to the US, the threat is the pendulum effect and hyperpolorization. Every time one side gains dominance it leads to the other moving slightly in the opposite direction, so over time both sides have became more extreme and in the end the US is going to either have a Nazi or a communist in power because both sides keep pushing each other away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False equivalence is bullshit.</p>

<p>The Alt-Right wanted to have a peaceable protest against the removal of Confederate war memorials. They were accosted by the City of Charlottesbille, who refused to honor the permit, in direct violation of their First Amendment rights. Charlottesville and the Virginia State Police prevented the rally from happening <strong>in direct violation of a Federal Judge&#39;s Injunction</strong> and kicked the Alt-Right out of Lee Park, where they had lawfully assembled to peaceably express their First Amendment Rights. </p>

<p>Not only did the Police and the City of Charlottesville violate the civil rights of the protesters at Unite the Right, <strong>they put them in danger.</strong> The police funneled the Unite The Right protesters into the &quot;counterprotestors,&quot; mask-wearing AntiFa agitators there specifically to disrupt and use violence. A lot of people were badly beaten by AntiFa due to the Police&#39;s intentional actions that lead them to harm. </p>

<p>The First Amendment is literally the most important part of our Nation&#39;s legal foundation. <strong>I don&#39;t care what you think about the Alt-Right, what happened in Charlottesville was wrong.</strong> We can no longer stand by and let people trample on our First Amendment rights. That is wrong, I don&#39;t care how untenable the message being expressed is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the whole point. The Elites don&#39;t care that we fight among ourselves. In fact, they get off on seeing us fight about things that don&#39;t directly affect them. Hence the police not intervening (at all). The police &amp; all law enforcement are owned by the Elites (bankers, pharma, MIC corporations, etc.), and the only time they&#39;ll send in the police is when there&#39;s little chance of having both Right &amp; Left groups present. Compare Ferguson to Charlottesville. It&#39;s always the same shit. Whenever two sides appear (particularly when you have open-carry militias), the police back the fuck off, and then you get incidents like the car ramming into people happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In full, as in everything they published? None of them. I&#39;ve read most of what most of them are most famous for, &quot;Levaithan,&quot; &quot;A Critique of Pure Reason,&quot; &quot;Civil Disobedience,&quot; but much of what many of them wrote isn&#39;t necessary for me to read in full in order to grasp their points. </p>

<p>I guess that it is similar to the way that many Christians never read the Bible cover to cover, but still know where to look to draw inspiration.</p>

<p>Unlike a religion, though, I don&#39;t find it necessary to accept all of any one thinker&#39;s words as gospel in order to for them to be useful.</p>

<p>Marx had interesting views on organized religion, but I don&#39;t agree that profit always equals exploitation, and plowing completely through Das Kapital would be take too much time away from exploring new ideas, while still not convincing me of the merit of his position. Locke had great views on property, but I found his speculation on religion to be bigoted and ridiculous. With Hobbes, I though his argument for a sovereign was full of reasons why we should not submit to one, though his points on anarchy were worth considering. Kierkegaard had excellent insights into religion, but he wrote from so many different and contradictory points of view that reading most of his work would likely provide me with more insight into his mind than it would into more relevant issues to me.</p>

<p>Time is a commodity, and I don&#39;t think it would be productive to dedicate the years it would take to fully immerse myself into each and every great thinker that came before me, when I can extract the essense of many of them from just a few chapters, and revisit them for clarification later, if necessary. </p>

<p>In an endless buffet of thoughts, one does himself a disservice by filling his plate with any single offering.</p>
