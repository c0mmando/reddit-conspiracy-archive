       Honest questions.  No flat earth bs.  I believe they are hiding something big about space, this planet, something next level that tptb want to keep us away from, keeping us in the dark, dumbed, numbed to the soul.  We are the lost souls.  Why dont we have loads of pictures of earth from outer space? Entire frame full planet shots? Not the paintings or cgi enhanced composites. Why dont we have any modem day outer space views of earth? Again, the ones i can find are supposedly images placed together using various computers, etc, so TECHNICALLY they are composites and not a true image. Another question, Why cant i find any real photos of satellites in space?  Like look up and see how many satellites are supposedly in orbit, but yet we never see a view of any of them.  Photo challenge peeps.  I mean, shouldnt the folks in the international space station be able to spot space junk floating around in our atmosphere?  Small, but still viewable.  Their are tons of satellites up there.  Why not put any webcams, attached to them for space views?  Why not? Why not have drones flying around the moon by now? Why not have webcams on the moon by now?  We can send a rover to mars, but cant have like even one on our own moon, why not!? Lack of money and imagination is all i hear. Smells like bs to me.

        answered that question
       </a>
       .  It's because unlike the digital camera in your phone, which snaps the different color exposures near-instantaneously, DSCOVR takes them about 30 seconds apart.  (Yes, this is a "composite," but in the same sense that basically every photo you've ever seen in your life is a "composite" of masks for the three primary colors and black &amp; white.)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        EPIC’s “natural color” images of Earth are generated by combining three separate monochrome exposures taken by the camera in quick succession. EPIC takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband spectral filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images.
       </p>
       <p>
        Combining three images taken about 30 seconds apart as the moon moves produces a slight but noticeable camera artifact on the right side of the moon. Because the moon has moved in relation to the Earth between the time the first (red) and last (green) exposures were made, a thin green offset appears on the right side of the moon when the three exposures are combined. This natural lunar movement also produces a slight red and blue offset on the left side of the moon in these unaltered images.

       Fair enough, I don't know enough about astro-photography to dispute it. Still; where are the blurring effects from the atmosphere moving during the exposure times, where is the refraction of sunlight around the edge, why is there no noticeable stratospheric effects, what part of the planet even is that, I can't recognise any continental shapes, why does the ratio of the size of the moon compared to the Earth look vastly different from the photos taken from the moon landings? This just looks sloppy.

       slow from this scale. The highest wind speeds ever recorded are around a couple hundred miles an hour, and average global wind speed is around 20 mph.  The moon is moving at 2,300 mph.

       I'm not sure what you expect to see.  Remember that the satellite's located at the Lagrange point directly between the sun and the earth, so it's perfectly backlit, centered on the exact middle of be planet.  You can definitely see that it's hazier and more defuse by the circumference, where the angle goes through more atmosphere.

       before, where you zoom out while pulling closer to the subject.  You can see in the gif how objects in the background appear to shrink as you pull closer to the subject in the foreground. If you're orbiting the moon, the foreground object (moon) is about 10 miles away while the background object (earth) is about 250,000 miles away.  From L1, the foreground object is about 750,000 miles away and the background object is about 1,000,000 miles away.  The latter gives you a more accurate perspective -- in reality the moon is about a quarter the diameter of earth.

       .  You have no frame of reference for what things should look like from Lagrangian 1.  Relatively few spacecraft get further than a couple thousand miles from earth, only a fraction of those ever go beyond the moon's orbit, and most of those are heading out to other bodies.  Only a handful of craft have ever been parked at the Lagrangian points and none have been capable of taking true color photos like this.  It looks sloppy because it doesn't match up with what you
       <em>
        expect
       </em>
       this to look like, but none of the experiences forming that expectation were anything like sitting at Lagrangian 1 watching the moon transverse the earth.

       It was your expectations that were wrong, not the photo

       But why is that laughable?  What's your basis for thinking the moon
       <em>

       look like a burnt cookie from L1?  I'm not being facetious here, I'm trying to get you to be open minded about your preconceived notions.

       You've never seen the far side of the moon, illuminated by full sunlight, from 932,000 miles away in space.  You've only seen the near side of the moon, from the planet's surface, through an atmosphere, from 239,000 miles away.  You have no frame of reference for what this scene
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       look like, so your gut sense that it looks "wrong" isn't based in anything at all -- you have to question your instincts that aren't coming from anything within your personal experience.

       This right here is why I will not address anything else in your comment. You didn't even notice the glare and how it should show on the moon, as well as Earth. Look at the gif again, lol, then come back to me.

       Oh, the gif.  Sure, I hadn't posted that.  Yes, the glare right in the middle of the planet is what you'd expect from the position the satellite's in at L1, positioned exactly between the sun and the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's there and not in the moon because it's reflecting off of water, which is obviously way more smooth than regolith that's been blasted by meteorites for a few billion years.

       I'm not saying it should reflect the same, I'm saying that a light source should appear on the moon, regardless of whether it's water or rock. Shine a light on a rock and on water. May look different, but the light is still present.

       I don't quite understand what you're saying.  Obviously the light is present because you can see the moon instead of a disk of pure blackness.  What do you expect to see on the moon, and why would you expect that?  I mean, the moon doesn't have a glare spot when you see it from earth, why do you expect to see one here?

       You should see a change of brightness on the surface of the moon. You can see it on Earth prior to the moon covering it, when it should be seen on the moon. Look at the gif again, and tell me if you see a change in brightness anywhere on the moon as it covers the spot on Earth. This is not hard, it's simply using one's own eyes for observation.

       Check with nasa them selves in what your posting. If i photoshop a bunch of images together...thats called a composite. Its not an original, plain old photo of earth.  Why dont we have tons...instead you post the latest crap from nasa mind control money grab corp.

       I don't think you get what "photo" means . . . .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, NASA didn't send up satellites with simply visible spectrum cameras like you have in your phone.  I mean, do you think NASA just straps a Nikon CoolPix onto a satellite and rockets it into space?  Wasting precious launch weight on a simple true-color camera would be ridiculously stupid.  They have more sophisticated equipment to measure a wide swath of wavelengths that are all captured and used for different purposes, including mixing into "true color" images for public consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, what do you think photography
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       ?  A normal film camera uses film sensitive to three different primary colors -- when you make a photograph, mix four masks, one for each color and one for black &amp; white, and with the final image being a
       <strong>
        COMPOSITE
       </strong>
       of all four channels.  How do you think your eyes work?  Cones sensitive to particular colors are triggered by specific photons and then combined by your brain into a single image, alongside rods detecting light level.
       <br/>
       (One could almost say your brain makes a composite).
      </p>
      <p>
       A photo is just a photo -- photons hitting a light-sensitive receptor. It's not less of a photo because it's only capturing a particular wavelength, including those outside the visible spectrum.

       Why would there be?  Satellites and space junk are not that big and they're moving tens of thousands of miles an hour in the dark, that's hard to take a picture of.  That being said, if you Google you can absolutely find pictures taken with fast shutter speeds of the ISS passing in front of the moon,

Tons? Or the same 10 composites from nasa.  Thats your while collection? Still waiting for anwsers and satellites in photos from outer space.  Did you post a silhouette of iss against the moon. Great...still waiting.

       How could you tell?  The edges aren't in frame here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bulge is 26.5 miles, out of a diameter of 7926 miles.  That's about 0.3%.  On this image, which is about 1300x1300, that literally would be about 4 pixels. (Though I'm not sure if the underlying image the Jpeg I posted derived from was that resolution, and you can't increase resolution, so it might be less than a pixel functionally.)

       If NASA could take some of that $50 million a day and make a decent camera that can make a good resolution, we can measure an 8000 pixel wide image because that would be one mile per pixel. I measured a non-composite 3000 pixel Apollo 17 picture of Earth, that's roughly two miles per pixel. I zoomed in on one edge as far as I could so pixels were huge, and you can see blue Earth pixels meeting black space pixels. There is no 12-pixel bulge anywhere on the sphere.

       What?  I'm not sure what you're expecting to see.  It wouldn't be some bulge right at the equator. It's just that if you measure the earth's diameter across the Equatorial latitude, it's 26 miles longer than if you measure down the axis of rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hadn't considered earlier that you difference in circumstance wouldn't be fully expressed from a point of view it unless you're looking at earth from a vantage point perpendicular to the axis of rotation and aligned with earth's center.  The earth's equator isn't aligned with the orbit of the moon -- there's about a 30 degree difference -- so no pictures from the Apollo missions (which would be taken from the orbital plane of the moon) would be perpendicular to the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why would NASA waste money on something like you said when they've already measured the bulge (and the rest of the planet) far more accurately by pinging the surface with radar and measuring gravitational pull from low earth orbit.

       I just measured the Apollo 17 picture of earth (not a composite), and this time I put guides on the left and top of the earth and starting at the intersection of guides drew a perfect circle of the earth so I could fill in the tiny sliver of terminator line/night on the right. My measurements:
      </p>
      <p>
       2688 pixels wide, 2689 tall.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I measured 1 pixel too tall, almost a perfect sphere. Where is this bulge of over 12 pixels? Where is it pear-shaped when the image is a perfect circle? The only image I measured to have this bulge is the 2012 VIIRS composite with a ridiculous 162 mile bulge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try the measurement in Photoshop yourself. Keep in my mind this is one of
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       few they claim are actual pictures and not made in MS Paint, or Photoshop or whatever software they use to fake the usual pictures of earth.

       Wouldn't the dark side of the moon be as bright as the earth with the sun on that side of it? Or am I just missing something?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would just think that with the Earth directly lit, anything in the path of the light rays would be illuminated as much or more than the object behind it... right?

       You would think there would be a brightness change, yes. But, there isn't. That is why I'm calling this shit fake as all hell. There is no change in lightness or color. Fuckery, basically. Notice the sun spot on Earth and the lack thereof one on the moon as it passes over it. People who think this is real, really need to get their heads checked or at least their eyes. Science is all about observing, but if you observe this and think it makes sense, then I don't know what to tell you (not saying you personally, just you in general - people).

       yea, I noticed that .. also, if you compare the globe to others presented, it seems the ocean size/land distance is off comparable to the others, which tends to happen from one pic to the other anyways.

       In this image, if the moon were any brighter the earth would be overexposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photo exposure is set to get both earth and moon, given earth is brighter, the moon subsequently appears darker.

       They stay way apart from each other on purpose. That was my biggest gripe about the movie Gravity. They aren't "right over there". They put as many miles as possible between them. I suppose there must be images of the hubble from the shuttle as it approached. And probably others. Anytime the shuttle did maintenance on a satellite there was a period of approaching it.

       Not that complex, post a picture of satellites in space, or how about a full view of earth, single shot.  Not some admitted composite or cgi addition excuse crap.

       Are you trying to actually have a discussion of just scare any chance of one away? Don't intimidate us before we even try, we're all here for the truth, dude. I'm wondering why we don't have live feeds of space and tons of pictures with all the money the govt spends on other shit, you'd think space would be important to educate your populace on, since it is the future, so we're told. Anyway, just be more inviting and less dic-tater like 😉 We must work together, not against one another, to find our truths and put all the pieces together.

       There are no satellites that are that far away from Earth. Here's a
       <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1269312.1367865691!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1020/image.jpg">
        photo
       </a>
       from the international space station. Nothing is far up enough to get a good photo of Earth. The farthest thing up is the GPS satellites, but they don't take photos.
       <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/3-as08-14-2383a.jpg">
        Here's a photo from the moon
       </a>
       It's a fairly famous photo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason you don't see any photos of satellites in space is because no one thinks of taking a photo of them. Photos from the space station don't shot show them because they're insignificantly small. And it's really hard to see anything small in space unless it's being directly hit by lite. If it isn't being directly hit by light, it basically looks invisible.

       Why do people keep asking why we'd want to see pics of satellites around our planet??? Why wouldn't we?!? I want to see nothing but pictures of space all the time, live feed that shit!

       I didn't ask that. I asked why would you want to see a singular satellite in space. That's a boring photo. There's a lot more effort needed to be made to get that photo than there is benefit.

       Interesting point. All the geo-orbits seem to be touched up or composited.

       As a comparison the STEREO satellites are not really contested in being legitimate or functional. Granted no one knows where they are actually located but

       There are satellites 22,000 miles away from earth which don't even orbit. They should be able to get some good photos, but no one thought to put a camera on any of them.

       Because you have to go far beyond orbit to get the whole planet in frame. We have plenty of photos of the earth from the moon missions. And I think I've seen some from the Mars missions as well. I don't know where to go to find them but they were certainly in the news and documentaries at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the satellites it's the opposite problem. They're usually about the size of a refrigerator. Maybe a semi truck. What do objects that size look like from a few miles away? A dot. Now put one in orbit. It's very tiny. Even with a telescope it's just a small blur.

       If they had honest photos of Earth from space, they would be shoving them down out throats. They couldn't even take a photo of Earth when the were supposedly on the Moon. And, the fake photos of the Earth that they do have show the Earth as a perfect sphere, and yet The Grease Tyson admits that the Earth is shaped like a pear. So, what is it: a pear, or a perfectly round sphere?

       It is very obvious that they are hiding something. That is why there are so many "conspiracy theories" regarding the planet we live on. NASA is nothing but a tax-funded smoke-screen for the military industrial complex to make hundreds of billions of dollars on bogus space explorations.

       There's a chance the face on Mars and "evidence" of ancient structures on either Mars or the Moon were put there in photos as priming for the upcoming alien invasion bullshit. Those things may not be simple pareidolia. Then again NASA just loves to troll people, especially their true believers.

       Keep in mind there is still no real explanation for why the atmosphere supposedly rotates perfectly with the earth, at hundreds of miles per hour, for all time.

       The only truth is that earth doesn't rotate. You can go from there.

       Air is a highly viscuous gas. The boundary layer thickness could not extend several kilometers up.

       To make things worse, the atmosphere
       <em>
        superrotates
       </em>
       – it exhibits a net motion
       <em>

       than that of the spinning ball underneath; it takes 2-3 weeks for a complete eastwards exchange of air. The effect is even more pronounced in upper layers.

       Why would it? The boundary layer thickness is independent of the diameter of the ball:

       The air moves in the same direction as the planet, just
       <em>
        faster

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       TS was right when [s]he said "Keep in mind there is still no real explanation for why the atmosphere supposedly rotates perfectly with the earth". There isn't. And there are even less explanations for its superrotation.

       I don't believe in the easter bunny...if you do, the burden of proof is actually on you.  I have many basic questions, that no one can really answer.  You don't think its just a bit odd that not even ONE photo of satellites in our atmosphere exists?  People just saying "why would we have them" is an excuse. Or how no one has answers to anything else I pointed out.
