       The alt-right was a rebranding of the far right, that has always been there.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a certain candidate and his backers expanded their ranks with those who felt disenfranchised, and gave them all a platform and political capital.

       It's more like there is still a small far right like there has always been.  And the media is basically calling everyone who is right wing the "alt-right".

       You don't have to hate people because of their skin or even have white skin yourself now.  All you have to do is agree with the president or disagree with the left.  If you stand up for the wrong person's freedom of speech... Well you're a Nazi now according to the media.

       The mainstream right is not. The alt-right seems very much to be the same old white supremacy but with updated branding and PC-sounding terminology.

       The ONLY reason the alt-right "seem" to be anything is because of the media's constant attempts to associate anything that isn't one of the mainstream political parties as a radicalized group of extremist.

       that's what I find amusing about the whole circus. If the "alt-right" is racist then the mainstream right probably isnt. Thus, the media has been lying all these years about the the right being racist. I wonder if the talking heads on tv truly understand what logic they are using.

       ORRR they're both filled with racists (though I certainly would argue that the majority of the Right is absolutely not racist, the alt-right is another story...), but one group just happens to be populated by more open/empowered racists.

       depends on what you define as conservative. Do you think Nigeria's conservatives are white supremacists? The Soviet Union's conservatives , capitalists? In America it's usually very formal uptight moralism. Family values, God over atheism, capitalist, and a few other traits of self serving beliefs to pretend that one is superior to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The leftists do the same thing, but with different values. Oh we are anti racism! But if you arent in their ingroup they call you a racist in order to tear you down. That's the only way to pretend they are better than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alt right isnt conservative but regressive. It's as if the events of the past half century have no meaning to them. Their evil doesnt exonerate you or anyone else. We are all going to be judged according to our own actions.

       I'm looking at the logic of "if the alt right is X, then the mainstream right probably isn't." It doesn't make sense to me. I get that there's differences between mainstream conservatives and the alt right but it's not so simple.

       holy shit what makes the alt right an alternative? What actually defines them? What truly bothers them about the mainstream right that they need to break away and form their own group? What is it about them that the mainstream right doesnt do that forces people to search for an alternative?

       That's just not true.  I live in the South, yet within 5 minutes of discussion it's pretty easy to differentiate between conservatives and the alt-right.  And make no mistake, the alt-right has grown significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, the majority of my family has always been racist, but they were slowly progressing.  A racist or hateful remark still slipped out every once in awhile, but they were evolving.  However, in the last 5 years, they've regressed further back than the 80's - one might even say they've gone full retard.

       In your experience has it been facebook (and the internet in general) that's swayed them?  It seems my older family members are totally unable to distinguish between actual news stories and obviously fake news stories.  They also seem to have bought into the "obama is a muslim/kenyan" notion.

       Yep.  And I mean, it's hard to blame them.  The older generation grew up with 1, maybe 3 news sources at best (newspaper + Walter Cronkite).  All of which believed strongly in journalistic integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the blink of an eye they are inundated with news sources.  Those of us 50 years old or younger grew with the internet, so we know how bullshitty it can be.  But my older relatives?  They see it on Facebook and think it MUST be true.

       Yeah no. What happened is that the far-right found a market. The white middle class is suffering as a result of automation. Those factory and coal mining jobs that they could rely on back in the day are gone and they aren't coming back. The far right shifted the blame to other people. It's the immigrants taking their jobs. It's lazy black people living off of welfare taking their tax dollars. It's globalist moving their factories abroad. The far right figured out how to appeal to the white middle class. Their arguments are definitely based on racism. The middle class isn't racist though. They're just desperate and they'll throw their support behind anyone who seems to have a solution.

       I don't recall people ever calling Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan or Lindsey Graham "alt-right". All four are right-wing if you look at their voting records and public statements, but none are associated with the alt-right. Cruz was associated with the Tea Party (the precursor to the alt-right) and Paul Ryan exploited the TP in mid-terms, but none are ideologically similar to alt-right leaders like David Duke, Richard Spencer or Milo the Pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, the most socially extreme of the bunch - Ted Cruz - has most to lose as he's a Cuban-American who'd be sent to the gulag if the alt-right ever got into power.

       Of course there will be violence - You put two opposing ideologies together at the same time in large groups, absolutely there will be violence - what concerns me is that you aren't blaming a right-wing nazi-supporting, swastika-American flag waving movement that was the basis of the problem to begin with. Racism is just an excuse for people to use when they won't blame themselves for their situation in life (I mean both whites and blacks as well!! The whole "blacks are being disproportionately killed by cops" is a bullshit statistic that I disagree with.)

       There was absolutely violence on both sides. One side attacks the other, and people will fight back. I'm absolutely left-leaning and if a skinhead comes up to me waving a baton threatening to beat me up, I'll fight back. However there wouldn't have been a "violent left" group randomly showing up last weekend in Virginia if it weren't for the right-wing hate group that showed up looking to start shit. The racists nazi group didn't show up to have a peaceful sit-in....they were looking to pick a fight.

       Why can't you answer?  I'm not defending anyone, I'm just pointing out that one group was trying to exercise free speech as deplorable as their speech may be and the other group was trying to shut down their free speech.

       I'm not sure if you're aware that free speech is protected by the Constitution while not being offended is not.

       What is "far right" or "alt right"? Can you even meaningfully describe these terms? Are they specific policy proposals?

       No, certain new media branded themselves as a haven for the alt right and also described the alt right for everyone so it was clear that the alt right was for all of the aggrieved white folk. (

       Clearly the 60 million votes for Trump aren't Nazi far right supporters. But you can't tell me they didn't exist before his election, nor the quite obvious support for those groups who also adhere to Trump's popularity. Come on.

       Of course they existed before Trump. (yet I've never met one) Who cares who they support, what they say or what they think. They are such a minuscule portion of society that your association of them to Trump is ridiculous. It's mental fodder for headline readers who need something to feel victimized over.

       I know many Trump supporters and not a single one of them give two shits about "white" anything. Cultural Marxism and race baiting. Long used tools of the left. *yawn

       No sir. It's a difference between accepting that the majority of them unfairly support Trump and associate themselves to him. Trump has called out against them though so I'm not sure what your original comment was even getting at.

       If the shoe fits. At Unit the Right there where Nazis trying to unite with alt righters and turns out 1 terrorist.

If you lay down with dogs you might wake up with flies. /shurg If moderate conservatives want to distance themselves they need to speak a little louder and have their actions match there words.

       Seriously? Look at our political climate as of current. This shot is unprecedented:
      </p>
      <p>
       Accept Gays
Accept Trans
Accept Muslim immigrants from radical countries
Accept Black Lives Matter preaching kill cops and kill with white people
Accept feminism preaching down with (white) men and (white) patriarchy
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time ever, good old fashioned do-right white folk are under attack comprehensively. I'm not part of the alt-right, but everyone has their breaking point.

       You're probably under 30, because this was actually a very major until pretty recently. I really don't are what your opinion is on it, but pretending like this wasn't a major societal change is simply inaccurate.

       That doesn't make the comment you're replying to any less legit. They didn't say it wasn't a major societal change, they just (rightfully) acknowledged that, hey, having to accept people that are different than you doesn't actually hurt you in any way so, you know, get the fuck off it and don't be a Nazi.

       You're out of scope. I didn't say whether they were right or wrong, I said you're not seeing the magnitude of this. ~98% of human societies throughout history were totally intolerant of homosexuality, and now all homosexual behavior is being pushed as normal.
      </p>

       That includes things like

       Only common in Greece, where it was actually child molestation of boys by older men. Nothing like the modern idea that two men would get married and live together like a heterosexual couple.

       And long-term, committed gay relationships between men are vanishingly rare, in the low single digits according to most good studies.

       Nice virtue signalling. The issue being discussed is not your personal views or perceptions, but the fact that disapproval of homosexuality was a supermajority position a generation ago, and has flipped to a supermajority against position today.

       I think that those actual Nazis weren't actual Nazis, and were actors wearing costumes saying Nazi things. Their clothes say working class joe, but their everything else says college trombone player, not to mention the crispy new flags, how they're always alone in a little group, how most of the protesters are unified in decidedly not nazi clothes that are mostly black and gray, as far as I can tell, for theme. I dunno, it seems too stupid, to me. Like they're going out to make a statement, not engender hatred. I don't think that they're that stupid, from what I've seen so far.

       Not sure what you are saying here. There is tons of footage available on a click on every search engine and even the most popular reddit posts have people on there I'd not exactly describe as college trombone players.

       As a "neo-nazi" I can explain. It's an Alinskyite tactic "own the insult". In current political climate no matter how moderate you are, if you're right-wing (or Christian) and refuse to compromise on your core beliefs, you're inevitably going to be called "Nazi". So it's much better to preemptively own this label and be proud and upfront about it.

       In terms of persecution complex, yes. You won't believe the level of "we're the oppressed and persecuted champions of Truth" mentality among contemporary right-wingers.

       I don't really care about internet points, but the opening was intended to be taken ironically, given the following explanation of why some people call themselves "neo-nazi white supremacists". Of course, I can't speak for everyone, I'm sure that there are some people out there who unironically consider themselves National Socialists and follow the NSDAP ideology. I don't take them seriously tbh.

       Nah, there's always been a minority of people who actually do proudly present themselves with Nazi imagery. It shouldn't surprise you that there are 500 or so of these types of people around the country who would be willing to travel to Virginia for a big protest. There are hundreds of millions of people in the US, I'd be shocked if there weren't a lot more than 500 neo nazis scattered out there.

       Your words can be interpreted to imply you cast him to be a nazi. He is clearly angry &amp; hateful possibly for ration reasons in his dis-eased mind, but I would not define him as a nazi.

      <p>
       I do not like confederate statues &amp; hate slavery that continues to this day on this planet, often in a hushed manner due to mostly if not all non western whites doing the ill slavery behavior. Whites who led the abolition that led to the ending of slavery in the west &amp; beyond are often in fear of speaking up when non whites are acting in ways they do not tolerate from other whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also can rationally guess that some @ that rally were there to support not removing those statues absent of any hate for anyone &amp; lived in that town with ancestors that died &amp; were on the losing confederate side largely because of their place of birth seeding allegiances largely due to mental loyalties tying them to locales formed mostly by the high ruling classes there that were pro slavery slavers.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO the statues should remain with added peaceably worded plaques to reduce potential for idol worship absent of calling them nazi rebels or be relocated in a civilized manner by vote of the local populous.

Eventually it was coopted and turned into Palin supporters and the rightwing/neocons again.  It was a fun time

       It wasn't started for any 9/11 truth movement.  The Koch brothers started the movement and funded it completely, and they didn't do it for any 9/11 truth movement.  They started it up right when Obama took office, which was the end of the world for two old rich elite white guys.

       I had never heard of Spencer until he did his "Heil Trump! Hail Victory!" shtick right after the election, and I only heard of him then because the media heavily pushed it. The fact that he's Jewish makes the whole the whole thing downright comical.

       Okay so its not ruled out, but tell me which seems more likely in theory; the government is false and in it lies a group of conspirators willing to risk their lives and freedom for power and have managed to create a lie by (apparently) buying protestors, buying silence, bribing thousands of people so much money that not one person has talked. Every major attack is a "false flag" created by the government, and even though you somehow elected the biggest piece of shit in American history with the minority vote, everything is STILL rigged against you, and 75% of the world is colluding against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or option B; there has been a very real sensationalism of young Americans this year and for many years caused by a VARIETY of factors including education, crime, lack of medical care for millions, ignorance, greed, drug epidemic, lack of available jobs/continued price gauging on every front by corporations, etc. This has resulted in a vacuum of ignorance and hate that humanity has seen many, MANY times in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer option B to A because option A you need at least 20% of the entire country in on the same charade in order to make the scenario plausible. In option B its the simple course of humanity that repeats again and again. Scenario B doesn't need anyone "in on it" since it is simply the culmination of millions of people routinely doing what is "best for them". Occams razor my friend.

       In 2008 the internet loved Obama, certainly way more than McCain. In fact many Obama voters are your current alt right. He's a democrat, so 90% of media outlets covered him positively or fairly. It was converse to what you see today with CNN, MSN, ABC, shows like Colbert &amp; Daily Show constantly generating negative content about the candidate/ president. Most people could turn on their TV's and read papers feeling their beliefs were widely held and represented. Today the internet is a much larger and more popular machine than in 2008. With Fox being essentially the only mainstream outlet not dedicated to trashing Trump, it's subscribers likely felt trapped in an echo chamber. Reddit then (and places like pol, etc.) represented free speech bastions were ideas could be discussed without hearing Nazi, racist, etc. from media pundits or sheep. The fact these ideas were safe and supported by so few platforms made those few in existence much stronger. You didn't need strong communities like that with McCain because he was given a much fairer shake. He wasn't portrayed as the anti-christ and you his follower.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think much of the alt-right simply came into existence due to the extreme one sided negativity from the left. The rights favorite past time is pissing off libs they will even admit it, and this stems from their genesis in being the counterculture to a toxic media machine. They represent the other side of the scale to create some kind of balance. The media wasn't tipping it so hard in 2008 with McCain, and places like this didn't have nearly the traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also reddit is just a different place culturally in 2017 compared to 2008 as documented here:

      <p>
       There was less division because politics was not an issue, Obama was president and most of reddit was happy with that. Now subreddits are protected shells of ideology with moderated narratives battling each other. Every sub now has a narrative that must be protected, but back then open and genuine discussion was more common.

       The new young alt right aren't the people who supported Obama, they're the ones that grew up only knowing Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't have the frame of reference to understand the idea that there was a massive and well-funded mass propaganda effort to make him look like a failure (which clearly succeeded since Trump is getting accolades for producing relatively worse jobs numbers than 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       They weren't able to see what a real warmongering president looked like or how Obama was railroaded into continuing many of the same policies as Bush by saying that he was enabling terrorism at every step.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump hasn't even gotten started, and they'll learn how they were tricked into sacrificing their future and going to war in due time. Hell, seems like they might learn that last one by next month.

       What did I just say about Glenn Beck, what do you think that was? What percentage of coverage of Obama was positive on FOX News? Where do you think Breitbart got his money from? Where did the Tea Party come from, you think that was just a bunch of people meeting up? Hell no, there was a well-funded and organized effort to do their best to make Obama a one-term president, and then just to make sure everything he did was viewed as a failure. It's what made many people believe Benghazi was a bigger fuckup than Iraq and that 5% unemployment meant the economy was struggling. Stupid shit like that.

       There can be multiple mass propaganda campaigns at once though, would you agree? I think u/wwwes32 is accurately pointing to one of those campaigns--the one that continually called Obama soft on terrorism even though he used drones to kill more terrorists (and civilians) than bush, even though his administration bagged Bin Laden (if you buy the narrative I guess); also the one that called Obama soft on immigration even though his deportation numbers were the highest in recent history and certainly higher than Trump's; also the one that spread a grass-roots internet based campaign depicting Obama as a Muslim/native-African/non-American/primate who was married to a transsexual; etc. These were demonstrably active campaigns during his administration propped up by a nascent alt-right.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was also certainly an Obama circle-jerk going on, but to say that it was all one-sided praise on the internet or in the media is utterly fanciful.

       Overall it was probably 80% praise 20% criticism. The 20% being fox and the 80% being every other media outlet. You people act like Fox can somehow compete with MSNBC, CNN, ABC, and CBS all by themselves. For every hit piece fox ran on Obama there were 10 positive stories being run by the other networks. Fox is greatly outnumbered and don't have as big of an effect on culture as people on this sub seem to think.

       You're also not taking into account Rush Limbaugh's and other right wing commentators' radio audiences, which were considerable during the Obama years. I actually can't recall if there was

       Maybe they had the highest ratings cuz they are the only conservative outlet on tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes conservatives dominate radio, probably because tv has been taken over by liberals. Which do you think is a more influential medium, radio or television? Lmao you know the answer to that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ratings mean nothing when you are literally by yourself. Fox News is by themselves I don't how else to spell this out to you guys. I point out that fox is outnumbered 5 to 1 and you guys respond by saying foxes ratings were higher. How much higher? Definitely not high enough to dominate the market. It's pretty close actually if i remember correctly.

       The FEMA camps do exist. You can visit them and see. Not implying what the purpose is, but just that they do exist. They also have a shit ton of plastic coffins ready for only what I could assume is either war or pathogen outbreak.

       As for death panels, for instance, in Canada, if you are really old, and have a bad illness/disease, you might not get priority healthcare compared to a younger person due to not enough doctors available at the time for an operation. This is why many people don't get treted for cancer for nearly a year waiting on the insurance to okay it. Some pundits called that the death panels.

       You're wrong about what the death panels were, they were actually boards of physicians that would determine where the line was between experimental treatments and cost, whether it would ultimately be worth the expense. If you're saying to yourself, "that sounds a lot like what insurance companies do", you're right.

       And I was told the FEMA camps were to lock people up inside against their will. Specifically Republicans.

       Obama largely continued and tried to wrap up wars that we were already involved in. Often with zero political cover. He also kept Israel from nuking Iran, which was imminent at the time and ALSO did not make him popular. He tried to close Guantanamo from day one and found that all his allies, even people who were agreeing with him, deserted him. Is it really in question why he didn't do more to get us out of the middle east?

       Bombing an additional 5 countries is doing all you can to get us out? That's just a plain lie, and I take the rest of your comment as disingenuous. His drawdown and inaction has let the caliphate flourish, then they doubled down and paid them to fight in Sryia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you are sitting here trying to tell me the positives, shows he had plenty of political cover, by the media whom saw no wrong in anything he did. It appears you forgot as well in a short time frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you feel about him expanding warrantless wiretaps on citizens?
      </p>
      <p>
       He expanded on all accounts our war on terror, and destablized several more countries in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly see islamic extremism on the downswing right as we have teenagers that have been bombed their whole life coming to age? This "issue" has multiplied.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's completely asinine to tell me why do I question why he didn't do more, when in essence all he did was expand the operation. He failed at mopping up the middle East, as he failed at implementing univseral healthcare, and closing Guantanamo. I didn't get to keep my provider, Obama had the lie of the year in 2013. 22 million didn't sign up. States are left with only one marketplace option to choose, and are forced to do so to avoid penalty. Guantanamo is still open and housing 41 inmates.
      </p>
      <p>
       But boy did he further the surveillance state, thanks Obama.

       I fault him for not following through on his promises for transparency and for allowing the patriot act to continue unabated. He disappointed me in an extreme way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I supported him bombing countries to continue trying to fight Al Qaeda and other muslim terrorist groups, and I don't have a huge problem with Trump doing it either. Those groups are fucking evil.

       As for healthcare, maybe you should blame the people who actually stopped every possible route towards a good solution. Public option was killed, single payer was killed, the mandate needed to keep it affordable was killed, the Medicaid expansion to give it to people who needed it most was killed. Of course it didn't work that well, it was fucking gutted. It's actually remarkable that it has done as well as it has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if people stopped questioning why Obama didn't do more and started questioning why CONGRESS doesn't do more, things would actually improve in this country. Or do you want to pretend that they didn't exist? I'm sure it makes things simpler.

       The problem with the extremism is publicly we state we fight it, while privately funding numerous sides of the conflicts. Situations where CIA Funded rebels were fighting DOD funded rebels, is a waste of tax payers dollars. While this bumbling idiots in Washington worry about how to pay for all this shit. There is no good coming out of bombing any of those countries. It's not stopping any terrorism worldwide, that's for sure. And it's turned the lens outward, when prior to 9/11, America was concerned with domestic terror. Look what we have festering domestically now..

       I mentioned the keep your plan lie from Obama because it's the biggest factor here. 30 million Americans were forced out of their plans because it didn't follow aca 10 rule, and were then pushed into the marketplace with it's single option. If you can't see how this caused people tons of finaicial grief and blame it solely on Republicans, I think that's where we have to wrap up this conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What honest good has came out of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       We wanted to cover 10% population, got 5% and spent a whole lot of money on nothing. Ultimately, charged up those who had coverage before legislation to cover increased costs, that government says will be lower 10 years later. "Hey if you pay now, it's cheaper later" I'm not buying that story. Aging population with only more boomers needing more healthcare, with less companies offering plans, means higher premiums for all involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a good compromise, that should have been pocket vetoed. But because it was his baby, we pushed this broken piece of trash through. Undoubtedly the republicans killed it. But why did the Dems still think it's okay to push through in the current form? It's created a monopoly market in many states. For all the good it may have had built in, the common healthy person just saw an increasing bill to cater to a small minority of people. Couldn't Obama and a few senators drawn up a less comprehensive plan that included benefits like no denial of coverage. But then there are things like guaranteed coverage for addicts, which I don't think should be represented in my premium, though it is.

       What mainstream media outlet has made Obama look like a failure? They covered up his wars and made him look saintly. The alt-right is a reactionary counter culture movement. You are correct in your assessment that they will be sorely disappointed in their savior Trump because he's just more of the same deep state warmongering like the rest of these government criminal mass murderers are. Just a different flavor of shit.

       Obama was a deep state puppet just like Bush. Continued the exact same policies as Bush and expanded on some of them. For example review the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 which was signed late in the evening on New Years Eve (sketch as hell). Obama as a nobel peace prize winner, dropped more bombs and spent more money than Bush overseas, yet no media outlets covered it. He was a cult of personality, which is why people loved him. However, if you look at what was actually accomplished during his presidency, it was a resounding failure. Marginally better or worse than Bush depending on what metrics you are looking at, but in NO WAY a good president.

       Obama was a pragmatist, for all the good and bad that entails. And I think he was the most progressive president we could have actually had. When his legacy is placed against what came before and after, that will become more apparent. It's easy to measure his accomplishments against what would have been best, much harder to measure them against what was actually possible.

       Obama was at war the entire time he was in office, longer than any president. He was a warmonger of the highest degree, far more so than Trump. Obama was a failure, though msm ignored it. In what way did obama help anyone?

       May I ask why you on a conspiracy forum defending Obama and claiming that because Fox News (one of many news organisations) is unkind to him that means the whole media was some orchestrated effort to make him look bad?

        They don't have the frame of reference to understand the idea that there was a massive and well-funded mass propaganda effort to make him look like a failure (which clearly succeeded since Trump is getting accolades for producing relatively worse jobs numbers than 2016).
       </p>

       <p>
        IN 2010, PRESIDENT Obama directed the CIA to assassinate an American citizen in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, despite the fact that he had never been charged with (let alone convicted of) any crime, and the agency successfully carried out that order a year later with a September 2011 drone strike. While that assassination created widespread debate — the once-again-beloved ACLU sued Obama to restrain him from the assassination on the ground of due process and then, when that suit was dismissed, sued Obama again after the killing was carried out — another drone killing carried out shortly thereafter was perhaps even more significant yet generated relatively little attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks after the killing of Awlaki, a separate CIA drone strike in Yemen killed his 16-year-old American-born son, Abdulrahman, along with the boy’s 17-year-old cousin and several other innocent Yemenis. The U.S. eventually claimed that the boy was not their target but merely “collateral damage.” Abdulrahman’s grief-stricken grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, urged the Washington Post “to visit a Facebook memorial page for Abdulrahman,” which explained: “Look at his pictures, his friends, and his hobbies. His Facebook page shows a typical kid.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Few events pulled the mask off Obama officials like this one. It highlighted how the Obama administration was ravaging Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries: just weeks after he won the Nobel Prize, Obama used cluster bombs that killed 35 Yemeni women and children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Obama's pre-election promises to close Guantanamo Bay and remove US troops from Iraq never manifested. Maybe he did personally want to do those things, but that just adds further credence to the idea that the President is nothing more than a front-man for agendas that continue regardless of who is in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was certainly a more charming and better public speaker than Trump, but they are both as superfluous to any real decision making. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss...

       Exactly right. I lived in NYC back then and I vividly remember seeing lots of graffiti with "Bush - Obama, Same Shit" all over the place as Obama's term went on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I voted for Obama and even joined a "parade/march" when he secured the nomination. Everyone was equally happy that Bush was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Obama's first term ended I had already decided not to vote for him again. As the second term went through its motions, I lost all faith in  my own ability to be tricked into believing that a "cool guy" like Obama (and my entire family loved him) was anything more than clever PR by the higher powers.

       See, I want to read this as being genuine, but then you say something like how he broke his promise to close Guantanamo Bay and it makes me think twice. He didn't close Guantanamo Bay, but what happened when he tried early in his presidency?

       Ok, with regards to the Guantanamo Bay closure, I am wrong. I didn't realise that was blocked. I'm from the UK (not an excuse to not know something), but I wasn't following the ins and out so just remembered he wanted to close it and it was still open. Totally my error. I at least respect that he tried to close that down then. I still think that shows that even the wishes of the president are secondary by the power behind the scenes/Deep State/whatever you want to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had some hope for Trump in terms of him promising a non-interventionist foreign policy, however, the attack on Syria and arms deal with Saudi Arabia shows he is controlled too. Regarding the travel ban, again, if he had also banned Saudi Arabia I would've had some respect for him and hope he wasn't useless. Saudi's seem to be manipulated/controlled by the British though. There are reports that British Intelligence played a part in the creation of Wahhabism which has moved mainstream Islam towards the justification of terror, not just on the west, but on other Muslims too. I'm not well-versed enough to understand the full extent, but I tend to agree with what Assad said this year, that the faces change, but the policies remain so I'm sceptical of any frontman people claim can change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think it's worth defending Obama? He was certainly better than Bush, but had a coin toss be used to decide major decisions, that would've worked better than Bush. There aren't many people worth defending in politics, so why bother defending Obama vs Trump, sure, one is better than the other, but there's got to be someone vastly better than what has come before.

        Unbeknownst the most of the Muslim world, Saudi Arabia was created by oil interests and continues to serve them. This relationship ripened after the oil Crisis, when the Saudis were recruited by the CIA to use their massive funds to finance their covert operations. This began with the funding of the Contras, that eventually evolved into the Iran-Contra Affair, which traded Nicaraguan cocaine and Afghani opium to finance the so-called Mujahideen.

       I defend Obama because he was just so much better than all the other trash in Washington. The GOP is a mixture of people who are defined by hating liberals and people who use that first group to serve corporate interests. Democrats often have the right priorities, but the ones that seem genuine are completely incompetent and lobbyists buy off just enough of the rest to enable the GOP to block all progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Obama was fucking smart and funny. You'll never see any of the typical conservative intellectuals ever volunteer to debate him ever because they know he actually knows what he's talking about. Go watch his takedown of the GOP during the healthcare debate while they try to run through their media talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was a good man in an environment where no good things could be done. If Bernie had been elected, he'd have faced exactly the same sort of blockades that Trump does now, even if he wouldn't be facing the same sort of FBI investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, the US is fucked right now, and it's at the highest level imaginable. The answer to our problems is a new constitutional convention to fix our legislative system, and even if we got that, it would take nothing short of an armed revolution to keep that convention from being controlled by corporate masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel for the people who supported Trump, I really do, but they made one mistake, they supported the GOP. And the GOP only wants to create tax cuts for the rich, kill social liberties and sexual freedom, and make sure they can never be voted out of office. If you don't believe me, look at ANY state legislature where they took over and tell me what their priorities are.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT....
      </p>
      <p>
       You're probably dead-on about Saudi Arabia, but what could Obama (or Trump) possibly do about that? At the end of the day, these are people who have insane amounts of "fuck you" money and a chokehold on the world's economy because of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, talking strictly about foreign policy, and since we're on r/conspiracy, I think that Israel/Saudi Arabia started secretly supporting ISIS as a plan to disrupt the Arab world and create a serious threat to Iran since Obama wouldn't let them launch a nuclear strike. People talk about how Obama created ISIS, but the only place in the world who actually benefits from a region full of atrocities (and the only group of politicians who would openly be happy with said atrocities) is Israel. That one isn't sourced by anything I can remember, but it just seems to make sense.

       It's a real shame that Hilary cheated her way to be the presidential candidate. It's a shame that Trump was the "anti-establishment" candidate. Before the election, his supporters seemed represent something interesting, it was lots of different people who believed the "drain the swamp" lets start again message. Since the election though it's just seemed to be a matter of Trump supporters blindly following him (mainly because of the arguably over the top coverage of him in the media, kind of like they have to double-down and support him just because they're being hammered unlike any other set of supporters I've seen before)
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an older politician in the UK called Tony Benn. He was old school socialist. I didn't agree with many of his policies, but he at least had principles and would much rather have had his socialism than anyone who has been in power since I've been alive. I feel Sanders would have been a lot like him. He at least seemed like he was genuine. I find it strange that people seem to think that it was just racists who voted for Trump. It was literally a choice between known corruption establishment candidate or someone who at least seemed like he might shake it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Republicans, I still find it odd how the party that tries to appeal to Christian people in the US can make an argument against nationalised health care. Jesus was all about fucking over the poor and destitute. Obviously, the size of the USA is insane compared to countries in Europe, but it just seems so bizarre that the right will fight to not have a health care service that at least offers poor people the chance of survival if they get cancer or need surgery. I've been indoctrinated in believing free health care is something a nation should offer its people and respect the idea that you don't necessarily want the government to know more about your health than they need to. The NHS isn't perfect either in the UK, but at least it's something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be more firm on the idea that there should be low taxes, no regulation etc, but I'm starting to see that only works when you have people with decent intentions, otherwise, as you say, it's great for the rich to benefit and leave the rest with crumbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       One question, as far as you know, do corporations actually pay the required tax in the USA? In the UK, companies like Amazon, Google Starbucks all pay the absolute minimum in taxes whereas the small businessman has to pay around 20% corporation tax. It seems to me that if these companies actually paid what was required then infrastructure could be improved without even having to bother increasing tax for individuals. These companies clearly make a profit from being on our shores so I'd love a party that just says if you don't pay you can't do business here anymore. Again, just a pipedream, but

       Bingo. I know in particular General Electric pays no corporate tax. I think they might even run a tax credit.

       What do you mean by that? Is there anything you think needs a massive change in the US constitution? From the outside, it looks pretty decent on paper. If there was one law you could introduce to make the US better what would you implement? I thought about this the other day, that I've never been asked that question and don't know anybody who has been asked that either. It seems like a question that everybody should be asked,

       This podcast about cities of the future is probably overly optimistic but it might be a way to avoid the corruption and greed that seems to be rampant in most countries.

       Listen up kids, once upon a time a president named Ronald Reagan actually created the Taliban by funding a proxi war against the Soviets. 
He also saw the downfall of many south American countries which have resulted in the the long economic downturn in South America that has lead to such high immigration numbers. So much history you young guys have to learn about.

       Also, we have NAZIS marching on American streets. 
As a veteran, that makes me sick. 
If y'all want a war, my god you will have it. 
Our grand fathers stomped fascist and maybe y'all forgot what being fascist meant. 
If that's the side of history you wish to be on, so be it. 
But some more history. 
Everything you hated about the left, it's what the DonAld does as well, you just don't want to be wrong.

       Military aged men are getting passionate and angry about politics. We're heading towards a right wing revival, that's just. How the pendulum swings.

       I used to be a moderate libertarian, but I had to leave because moderates are too concerned with not being seen as extremists. They won't call out banks or interventionist wars. Only the alt right will, and to a greater extent the far left.

       Basically, the subversion of the Tea Party via the Neocons was up and running and the focus of Obama being a "Kenyan Muslim Commie" was all the focus. Granted I'm not a fan of Obama foreign policy wise, but any credibility the Tea Party had in regards to the taxation of the people in favor of the corporation (sounds like what Occupy was harping on) as well as government accountability was in the rearview mirror. Now the party was nothing but bullshit. The Alt Right is basically that, but now more tech savvy.

       What seems to have happened is a lot of young people saw the right saying so much bullshit about obama that obviously wasn't true, they now assume the same is happening to trump. When in reality the attacks against Trump are based on things he actually says and does, not imagined fearful panic from the right.
      </p>
      <p>
       So young people think "both sides act this way" when it couldn't be further from the truth

       They were at a boy scout camp having their leaders gently wiggle their fingers up their buttholes while telling them to take it for their country... These men were raped at a young age and we need to let them know that its okay to be butt hurt... Now bend over and take it like a man you nazzis I gotta long lasting erecting, line em up.

       Even the term "alt right" is designed as a psy op. What does "alt right" mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it economic nationalism, like JFK and FDR supported? Is it anti-immigration? Is it pro-white? Is it white nationalism?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's best to just avoid using ambiguous terms like alt right, Republican, Democrat, conservative, progressive, etc. Instead, just discuss specific reasons that you support or oppose specific policies.

       It was a name Richard Spencer used for his publication and was later used as a rebrand for white supremacy. 
One of the reasons why it has emerged now is that the racist far right forums really emerged at the beginning of Obama's presidency. Now those impressionable angry teenagers have  grown into the people you see at the marches.

       I'm tired of hearing this "alt-right" bullshit label. It was completely fabricated and incubated by the media. The media loves to conflate ideologies and put everyone in a box, group, or category and they use terms interchangeably. That's unethical, dishonest, and dangerous.

       Alternative Right was a publication by Richard Spencer that began in 2010 and is now an online blog. The term has since been appropriated, softened, applied to all sorts of subdivisions of extreme conservatism. This has been done by left
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       right wing media for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not completely fabricated by the media, though. It has an origin...Richard Spencer and his crew.

       Not really, it was an entertaining sub. The obesity issue in America and other Anglo countries is serious business. It's not even regular obesity, it's morbid obesity.

       There was a lot of overlap. It got its initial subscribers and attention from backlash to the whole fat acceptance tumblr thing. Fat acceptance tumblr blogs were an easy target for people who hated tumblr. So the sub was really full of people who hated tumblr, multiple genders, and whatever. There's actually a lot of history there. Gamergate too created a lot of the alt right Internet personalities. Sargon of Akkad, Milo, Paul Joseph Watson were all nobodies until they started harnessing the attention of gamergate.

       Sargon of Akkad is pretty much an old school liberal. I don't like the guy much personally as I think he's a bit smug, but there's no way he's aligned with the alt-right. I've heard him talk about wanting universal healthcare and gay marriage. The only thing he says is that there should be no concessions in law to social groups, all laws should be based on the individual. How is that alt-right? I also saw a video earlier where Milo said explicitly that he is not alt-right and doesn't agree with their position. He's jewish, so being a part of Nazi group might not go to well for him. Again, I don't care for the guy. The only things in common the people you list have are they are anti-sjw. Saying people should be treated as individuals and not given better or worse treatment because of the social group they belong to is the opposite of racist

       Eh, I guess maybe you have to have a feel for it. It's the same underlying current. They can equate Nazi with alt-right with white people all they want, but it's just people upset that the values that were once enshrined by society were replaced with what seems to be perversions and corruptions which are not only preventable, but altogether artificial. Honestly, I think that seeing white people gather together for white people scares the crap out of them, so to nip it in the bud, they tried to give us all a heavy dose of white guilt with all of this new stuff, to make us think the world will think we're all Nazis if we enter into the realm of identity politics at all as a group.

       He's not even right, the "alt-right" was around long before the primaries. I can link to "alt-right" podcasts from Obama's presidency, like around the time of the Ferguson riots, etc.  Dumbasses just repeat buzz words they hear on CNN.

       I agree with you op.  There has always been racism.  But we shun it and shame it as a society.  But its just another divide and conquer, order out of chaos tactic from tptb.  Ai systems tell the elite how to best keep populations down and cause a problem so that their system has a life line and a purpose. Alt right is now a label, a label can just be stamped on it anything they want to silence.  Its bad and when you give up liberty for safety,  you lose both.

       We started in the wake of Trayvon Martin and the ensuing racial tensions. It's not an old movement. But it did start and grow rapidly under Obama. Let's not forget how absolutely horrendous Barack H. Obama was at instigating racial tension..."if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon Martin."
       <strong>
        Obama called out police for being racist at the funeral of the Dallas policemen and women who were shot by the BLM guy.
       </strong>
       That this sort of shit is what solidified our resolve, when the cultural marxists showed us what they were really about and bared their teeth at "whiteness," maligning us for our race. This is what is meant by "reactionary;" we sprang forward mostly as a reaction to the provocations of a political faction, represented by Barack Obama, who openly despised us and condoned violence against our people.

       Not anymore. This isn't going to fly in my country, not without a fight. We're going to root out the cultural marxism and drag the rest of you kicking and screaming into a better tomorrow. For everybody, not just white people. It's going to stop.

       Fox News invented this propaganda to give people like you a convenient enemy to hate and fear, but that enemy is bullshit.

       Fox News was race-baiting cops and Republican thugs for years, painting entire communities as inferior and violent, stoking the inevitable hatred and division that comes from authoritarian pro-government racists. When you say "so quickly", you're looking at it with the same perspective as the people BLM was protesting against: you couldn't recognise violence and hatred when it was being inflicted on black people, but as soon as they came out onto their streets and made some noise,
       <em>
        suddenly you care and paid attention

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So much projection and self-glorifying bullshit. Fox News entirely created your "movement", or rather, simply inspired a new generation of lonely cowards to hate and fear an enemy that doesn't really exist. And that was entirely using "identity politics" to turn you into a single tribe of unthinking puppets.

       How the fuck can you still be talking about fighting against the rest of the world that despises this cowardly ideology, when this same pathetic rhetoric is what led up to the Nazi terror attack on the weekend? How about you fight the scum that are actually killing people, instead of against the people in your own country who just want to feel safe from fucking Nazi terrorists?

       @influentia -  I thought the Alt Right were essentially younger people. The idea that Fox news would incite people under 30 to become white supremacists is giving them a lot of credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I can see, the alt-right is much more likely to have formed as a result of what they've seen their extended network on social media promoting over the last 5-7 years. The University system would also have pushed them towards the right. I don't believe Fox News had anything to do with them. I would bet that many Alt-Right probably once identified with many of the ideas on the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       The newer members of the alt-right seem to have joined as a reaction to the identity politcs  pushed by the left. They were essentially shown by white leftists that group identity is currency now. The white male is used as default "oppressor" on social media sites so I think many thought, "I'm accused of racism anyway" and every other group seems to be protected by members of society speaking out apart from the straight white man. I don't think the majority of the Alt Right from what I've read online when I've come across their posts had the aim of wiping out other races. They saw it more as "we need to come together as a group in order to preserve our group going forward".
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately though, their formation and rise in numbers has now given the left the ideal group to claim to be the oppressors. I can also see their "preservation of being white" turn to carrying out attacks on non-white groups in the future. I could be wrong in my theory, but I would like to know if anybody from the alt right did join because of the points listed above.

       It's an orchestrated plan to get different groups to hate other and it seems to be working as intended, unfortunately.

       This is well thought out and presented, and I respect the perspective you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       But where the violence against those Dallas officers was a symptom of racial tension, daily violence against blacks is systematic, causes too separate to compare along the same moral spectrum. One is loathsome and cowardly and personal, the other is widespread, frustrating and unavoidably coming to a head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where your grief with Obama is that he perhaps used the wrong words, Trumps response (as well as, it seems, your own) is simply wrong. And to me, who does not see things as you do, it betrays a weakness in your ideology: that you are willing to go shoulder to shoulder with actual Nazis, that they are your "comrades". There is no sanctity in
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       belief if you allow others with beliefs you are opposed to call you brother.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you, personally are not a Nazi or bigot, and your heart is split between protecting your own self interests and improving the future, as you see it, of all races...(i understand the difference between supporting physical removal and being a genocidal blahblahblah)...your ranks are bolstered by them. Their hearts are not split. They see one, final solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are with the people waving the flag, and you're with them while they name the names.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see this with the discourse for the leftist public as well. Theyre cowardly college students with bike locks, professional victims, fucking whining losers. Or they're blinded by evil corporate globalists intent on destroying America and bringing the world under one order, themselves being the beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all been goaded into believing we are under a cultural attack from the extreme other. This culture war is a matter, not just of life and death, but of the very way of life we think we love dying out. The Other will rape our wives and kill our children, that sort of thing. I understand being a reactionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you shouldn't want solidarity if it means holding hands with this kind of...unamericanism...that makes you just as fucked as the people you're in the streets against. The ends do not justify the means anymore. That's not where humanity needs to go if we're going to see a future anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can choose to believe that
       <em>
        this time history will be proven wrong
       </em>
       ...that this time using the same means will bring us a different end, but I'm not so sure that can happen.

       Some sanity at last. Appreciate you called out both sides too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can totally see the reactionary element from the right coming from the nonsense pushed by the left. There's been a huge increase in the media to have the most extreme views by BLM and similar organisations pushed regularly with almost no actual criticism. The idea that you can't be called racist for hating white people is deliberately pushed as it's obviously not a reasonable position to have where one group is allowed to escape criticism of their racism while the other is constantly told any success they have is apparently undeserved because the system is set up to benefit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, I can understand how seeing police officers escape with a 2 week suspension for killing someone and not have to face any responsibility for taking a life when the situation could easily have been avoided will cause black people and PoC to start to look for someone to blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Social group are presented with the most extreme and abhorant views each has about each other by the media in order to increase tension. All the while, the idea of the individual is being pushed back and instead we're supposed to identify ourselves by our social group.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need to go down that road. People are people, some in each group are good, some are bad. The average person isn't trying to keep you down or hold you back. Not because they're nice people, but in the real world, most people are indifferent to anybody outside our family or friends. Indifference to each other is much better than creating enemies based on the narrative being pushed by the media.

       Marxism and neo-Marxist ideologies such as Cultural Marxism have literally always been primarily advocated by the rich elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theodor Adorno certainly never wanted for anything. Neither did Marx, Engels, Horkheimer, etc. It's actually kind of a "thing;" it's always the very rich who seem to gravitate towards communism - the naivete inherent in such utopian philosophies sort of predisposes itself to the very rich, who don't really understand how the "real world" works. It's a special kind of naivete that would lead one to espouse communism, and the rich (ironically) seem to possess that sort of naivete in greater quantities than the proletariat, who generally embrace capitalism.

       Wow, so who decides what is acceptable free speech? Any speech that calls for violence against a group or individual is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is one of the most important elements that make up a free society. We allow people to speak their mind (again, unless there are calls for violence). If you disagree with something that's said, you then have the chance to respond and put forward your case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without this is place, who is to say what is appropriate speech? New ideas that are different from the status quo might initially be thought of as hate speech. What about legitimate criticisms of a subject, when do these become hate speech? So, if I believe I have genuine criticisms of Islam, am I no longer allowed to make those points in case somebody finds them offensive?
      </p>
      <p>
       We should defend the speech of what we most disagree with so we can have a truely free society. There are Holocaust deniers, but should they be stopped from speaking if they genuinely believe they are presenting evidence that the concentration camps in Nazi Germany weren't used to gas Jews? Obviously, this is a distasteful idea to many, but, again, if there are no calls for violence against a group or individual, then letting people speak is far better than the other option which is that any topic that differs from the consensus is dangerous and should be stopped.

       Not all of the "alt right" are white supremacists. Most white supremacists probably consider themselves "alt right", but most of the alt right is probably run-of-the-mill racists rather than neo-nazis. They're the type who would probably say "Santa Clause is White!" not the type who would say "Whites are the superior race!" Casual racists are extremely commonplace, but full-on white supremacists, not as much.

       As a former Floridian, Cuban-Americans have a weird, special status for Conservatives. There are a lot of white Cubans who are of European descent (I know a ginger Cuban) who are still considered Hispanic. Also, many left Cuba to escape a socialist regime, so conservatives love to hold them up and embrace them.

       They fled a brutal communist dictator, that's why they are conservatives you fool. I don't know what that has to do with them having a special status, unless you apply that to every minority who escapes the leftist plantation.

       I'm well aware. The fact that they escaped that puts that as something conservatives like to point to. I think you'd have to be from Florida to understand the way that Florida conservatives work to cater to Cubans and how important the voting block is to them. It is really interesting how it has evolved as the older Cubans have been dying off, because younger Cubans are less conservative.

       I've spent a lot of time on voat.co.... they are real and definitely not a psyop. Most of them are just edge lords and people who just go out of their way to hate everything just for the sake of it. I would say about 40 percent of them are genuine racists maybe like 20 percent are pissed off  free speech advocate intellectual types who could care less if the world burnt to the ground but cling to conservative values cause they think it's humanities only hope.. the other 40 percent are just douchey antisocial edgelords who probably don't even believe half the shit they type. Just my interpretation however but I have had an account on that site since short after it's birth (about 3 years) and have been fascinated by these people

       Oh no. I'm saying they're given a shit ton more facetime on mainstream news now simply because they are needed. They could give two fucks about BLM when obama was in office just like how on MSM they could give two fucks reporting on antifa currently, because they simply are not needed..yet.

       Not a psy-op. Term alt-right was first used Paul Gottfried/Richard Spencer in late
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">
        2008/2009
       </a>
       . and there was a website alternativeright.com (created in 2010 I think?). As the Obama presidency progressed and leftists/media became more anti-white/extreme, places like /pol and thedailystormer as well as alt-right ideas (nationalism, protectionism, isolationism, immigration restriction etc) became more popular. Along comes Trump, who's stances on immigration and trade are close to the alt-right, and the media begins covering the alt-right to try to hurt Trump.

       A lot of Bernie supporters and centrist have joined in supporting Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilary and the DNC are incredibly corrupt. Illegal Immigration is a much bigger problem than I realized, and no other policy is as important to fix as immigration.  Want a sane healthcare system? Can't provide that with a large percentage of the population not paying taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats have done nothing with regard to policy to fix it. Not during 8 Obama years, not during the 8 Clinton years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hand washing about the alt right is just too tie Trump supporters to 'racism.'
      </p>
      <p>
       This will also fail, just like Russia. Just like better deal. All it does is cement the Democrats loss in the midterms.

       Not arguing your point but you also need to factor in that the folks who did not especially like or vote for Obama just rolled with it and accepted the "Peaceful transition of power" and got on with their lives until the next election cycle (and the one after that).

       But last year they got another shot. And they won and now the other side flat out refuses to roll with it and get on with their daily like the losing side always does.

       They were there, you just didn't see them. Milo, for instance, has been famous for quite a while (though most people hadn't heard of him). He's been writing his same brand of bullshit for a number of years (I've followed him for ~4 years). Baked Alaska, Richard Spencer, etc. were all there too. They weren't called "Alt-Right" until 2010 when Spencer coined the term, but they were there.

       There is no such thing as the "alt right". That's a label invented by deranged liberals who want to stamp all political opposition as hostile and marginalize their views BECAUSE of their views. It's an attempt to associate racism and neo nazism with the political right and the Trump campaign.

       Remember when the tea party movement started up? Before the Republicans astroturfed the whole thing?
       <br/>
       It was about economics and wall st bankers, and national sovereignty. No more foreign wars, audit the fed, etc.
       <br/>
       That must have been Ron Paul 2008 or whatever primary season. But then the Republicans took it over, and it became the 'alt right' as denigrated in the liberal press. Just another way to destroy grass roots opposition to corporate policy.

       I think you misunderstand what's going on. George Soros created Antifa and financed BLM to start racial trouble. As long as they were ignored then nothing would happen. This is a bunch of nuts taking the bait. The MSM has been running this narrative for a few years now of police brutality against blacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont take sides in this. The power elite wants racism to be an issue. It's the one emotional issue in America that can be abused to create a police state.

       Watching all the puppets dance and act like real people is surreal and plain spooky. It will be an interesting time when everyone finally realizes that this was the watershed and it was ignored because everyone was to busy or the water was to muddy. Everyone will have reason and excuses, but will not be able to change it. Keep this idiocy up America and eventually the military will need to step in. And remember this, George W Bush took the control of the National Guard away from the individuale states. There will be no revolution.

       the "alt right" is just the new tea party. Instead of old super religious people, they are now young pissed off snowflakes who truly think that the overwhelming majority of whites in this country are somehow being persecuted.

       Only common in Greece, where it was actually child molestation of boys by older men. Nothing like the modern idea that two men would get married and live together like a heterosexual couple.

       And long-term, committed gay relationships between men are vanishingly rare, in the low single digits according to most good studies.

       I defend Obama because he was just so much better than all the other trash in Washington. The GOP is a mixture of people who are defined by hating liberals and people who use that first group to serve corporate interests. Democrats often have the right priorities, but the ones that seem genuine are completely incompetent and lobbyists buy off just enough of the rest to enable the GOP to block all progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Obama was fucking smart and funny. You'll never see any of the typical conservative intellectuals ever volunteer to debate him ever because they know he actually knows what he's talking about. Go watch his takedown of the GOP during the healthcare debate while they try to run through their media talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was a good man in an environment where no good things could be done. If Bernie had been elected, he'd have faced exactly the same sort of blockades that Trump does now, even if he wouldn't be facing the same sort of FBI investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, the US is fucked right now, and it's at the highest level imaginable. The answer to our problems is a new constitutional convention to fix our legislative system, and even if we got that, it would take nothing short of an armed revolution to keep that convention from being controlled by corporate masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel for the people who supported Trump, I really do, but they made one mistake, they supported the GOP. And the GOP only wants to create tax cuts for the rich, kill social liberties and sexual freedom, and make sure they can never be voted out of office. If you don't believe me, look at ANY state legislature where they took over and tell me what their priorities are.

       BUT....
      </p>
      <p>
       You're probably dead-on about Saudi Arabia, but what could Obama (or Trump) possibly do about that? At the end of the day, these are people who have insane amounts of "fuck you" money and a chokehold on the world's economy because of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, talking strictly about foreign policy, and since we're on r/conspiracy, I think that Israel/Saudi Arabia started secretly supporting ISIS as a plan to disrupt the Arab world and create a serious threat to Iran since Obama wouldn't let them launch a nuclear strike. People talk about how Obama created ISIS, but the only place in the world who actually benefits from a region full of atrocities (and the only group of politicians who would openly be happy with said atrocities) is Israel. That one isn't sourced by anything I can remember, but it just seems to make sense.
