<p>The reality is that the masses are never going to wake up. They are incapable of thinking. They have been <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/epsilon-agenda-thumb-revised-1-800x445.jpg">intentionally retarded</a> since they were still in the womb.

At this point I&#39;m fighting for people to have the right to pursue happiness.  We have so many problems that we need all hands on deck to take care of them sufficiently.  This is the wake up call.  Everyone was deceived, and everyone will need to know the truth if we are going to make this country a place where we would be proud to leave to our children.</p>

Next time around, it&#39;ll just be the same or worse. To jock of the great Bill Hicks, some of us are saying: &quot;It&#39;s just a ride, and we can change it anytime.

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. I&#39;ve been through quite a bit in my life. A part of me would never wish it on someone else, but there is a part of me that thinks it would be necessary (or helpful) for people to experience some of it, in order to gain a new perspective. Not saying mine is the right one, but it&#39;s mine, and in life at the end of the day, it&#39;s really only you and you&#39;re spirit being. Let&#39;s just say, over the years, I&#39;ve come to have a profound respect for monks who go off into the mountains and think inward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmm. You know, if the propaganda stopped, then <em>eventually</em> people could be informed and awakened from their misinformed slumber.</p>

<p>But. With the power structures as they are I don&#39;t see that happening. It&#39;s better to equip others with the power to see past the propaganda at the bigger picture. Then it has no power.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say NO power, but it definitely lessens the grip. Just because a fat person realizes they&#39;re killing themselves doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll start eating properly. </p>

<p>The tricky thing about the propaganda is that it&#39;s so emotional, and we&#39;re emotional creatures (who are made to be even more emotional by our hyper-emotional media) so a person may realize it&#39;d be good if they unplug, but that emotional part of them needs that battle or whatever or else they feel empty because they&#39;re so used to that. </p>

<p>I think we have to address this emotional addiction issue too, which is the other side of the coin from just the intellectual understanding of the issue. </p>

<p>Was it propaganda? Or was it honest reporting about the crimes the US commits? The US supports terrorists attempting to overthrow democratic governments and has civilians by the thousands using drones. Our economic system is so broken that wealth disparity is the greatest it&#39;s been since the time RIGHT before the Great Depression, and that disparity is only getting bigger and bigger as time goes on. If your news media doesn&#39;t expose these facts, then you&#39;re looking at pro-America propaganda, but you&#39;re making it seem like things outside that pro-America image are just trying to deceive you. </p>

<hr/>

<p>And yea, it&#39;s the anti-capitalism part. The people in far east Asia don&#39;t care about domestic issues in the US.</p>

<p>My homeplace has embraced capitalism and &quot;innovated&quot; into a morphed pseudo-capitalism socialism type. Whenever there is a failure (like the recession 2008), or a shortage, or just about something bad, the media goes full on attack mode and blame it all on the preferred scapegoat &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;USA&quot; without addressing the root cause.</p>

<p>Much like what is happening in Venezuela right now.</p>
