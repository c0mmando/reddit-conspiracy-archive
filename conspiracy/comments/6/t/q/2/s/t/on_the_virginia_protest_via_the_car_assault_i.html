       Maybe isn't a rational answer and users have shown images showing he was following traffic according prior to the act. As well as showing a potential dirrect attact with the forementioned bat moments prior to the act.

       No, I'm questioning the narrative because certain things to not add up about it. That's called actually thinking for myself. You on the other hand, merely peddle and believe what the boob tube tells you.

       I don't have cable, myself, but every time I ask someone for evidence that the car was attacked prior to accelerating into the crowd as claimed I either get brushed off, attacked, or shown a video that contradicts the claim entirely. It's happened many times today.

       There is photo evidence of the driver not being the person in custody via the mugshot. This could have been a deep state false flag, and the person they have is a patsy. And before you say it, I do think neo-Nazis exist and yes, they are scumbags, imo.

       Completely different facial structure. There are also possible eye witness accounts that the car used or the man in it was swiftly taken away by other cars. Then, coincidentally the helicopter that was covering all of this crashes and both people inside die. Pretty odd series of events, no?

       Wat? The mugshot guy has a chubby round face, while the picture of the person in the car has a strong jaw and muscular neck. Dude looks military.

       Dude, this is 4chan saying there was a "switcheroo" based on the shit doxx they did of that innocent kid in Michigan. It's basically 4chan being doubly retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a set of photos of the arrest of James Alex Fields. 4chan is confused because they were expecting that young kid Joel from Michigan. Because 4chan is very stupid.

       Did you even watch the video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Beginning clearly shows the driver was braking (red lights on the back of the vehicle) after going over the speed bump. By the time the camera pans left, the driver is clearly moving slowly and letting the crowd disburse in front of him. He was certainly not accelerating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video clearly shows a man in a white shirt swinging a flag into the back of the car. Keep in mind, this was a the time when the car wasn't moving fast at all. After the flag bash, the driver freaks out and accelerates, probably trying to get away from the mob behind him with baseball bats.

       Nobody is attacking that vehicle until he's driving into the crowd. You can see the crowd diving out the way prior to anyone striking the car.

       At the point this video begins his intent is already clear. I've seen this video a dozen times today.

       When someone makes a claim they should have evidence. I'm not making a claim, I'm asking you for evidence of yours.

       I'm not claiming it's impossible, I'm saying that nobody has provided evidence that shows he was attacked prior to accelerating into the crowd.

       Of course it does. Why would he need to be accelerating from as far away as possible? He intentionally got up to a deadly velocity,
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       tapping his brakes. Whether he was aligning himself or having second thoughts or just braking by reflex upon seeing a wall of humans, I have no idea. It doesn't matter, when his
       <em>

       Again. The intent isn't to claim he's innocent. Im not defending him.

       The intent was to demonstrate the difference between intent. Failing to abide by the law is criminal in either extent. However tge circumstances of his actions should be carefully overseen and evaluated prior to escalating this to a willful act. As others have been physically outlining.

       Having done some investigation of criminal and fraudulent activity, asking whether people took the optimal actions to achieve their goals is not an effective line of inquiry. People don't do the most efficient thing. People act on impulse or emotion, they make mistakes, they get sloppy.

       I don't imagine that you do imagine that. Speculating that maybe other unknown sources exist to support your speculation is also not carefully analyzing the available evidence.

       Maybe isn't a rational answer and users have shown images showing he was following traffic according prior to the act. As well as showing a potential dirrect attact with the forementioned bat moments prior to the act.

       Did you even watch the video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Beginning clearly shows the driver was braking (red lights on the back of the vehicle) after going over the speed bump. By the time the camera pans left, the driver is clearly moving slowly and letting the crowd disburse in front of him. He was certainly not accelerating.

      <p>
       The video clearly shows a man in a white shirt swinging a flag into the back of the car. Keep in mind, this was a the time when the car wasn't moving fast at all. After the flag bash, the driver freaks out and accelerates, probably trying to get away from the mob behind him with baseball bats.
