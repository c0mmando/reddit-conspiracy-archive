       If you believe those words are so wise, why do you delete all your comments and run from threads the moment someone criticizes you or points out your belief system? If you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       believed that you should speak your mind and not care about votes, you wouldn't run away and hide your views the way you do.

       Your account is less than 5 months old. There's a high percentage of people who are criticizing me who have new accounts. If you know anything about me, you'd know how stupid it is to call me a white supremacist. It's almost entertaining to hear.

       Many people have been pm me and commenting about how I'm a white supremacist racist bigot these last couple of days. They seem to think that me writing about how Europeans may have developed writing before the Egyptians or sumerians makes me a racist. However if they did some research they might realize that the vinca script is a few thousand years old. I also have an African paternal haplogroup, so I guess that makes me literally hitler.

       In all fairness, you
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       say that minorities plan to kill all whites and that after they're done the world will descent into primitivism. IIRC, you also said the only white people who support minorities are white people who don't have to deal with them.

       I also said that the blacks in South Africa cut the eyelids off of white farmers so they're forced to watch as their daughters and wives get raped because the socialists government is race baiting, which is typically what leftists do. That's a fact.

       So you argue that if you removed the white race from the globe everyone else would descend to a primitive way of living, and yet you can't understand why some people have called you a white supremacist? You can't possibly be that lacking in self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if these are your beliefs, stand up and own them. Constantly sanitizing your beliefs and scrubbing your past is cowardly. If you're right and you're righteous, if you believe others seeing as you do can prevent the world from going to shit, you should have no problem leaving your comments up for everyone to see.

       And if white people do get genocided who will provide medical treatment, and modern technology to third world people? Much of the things we take for granted are invented, developed, or available in developed nations which have a prodominantly white population in them or benefit from a legal system that is based on western values.

       If you are contributing quality or at least thought provoking content, and engage in conversations regardless of your views, you should have no problem. Been there, done that.

      <p>
       Obviously it's a lot harder if you reach out to the bigger subs were regardless if you go against the hive mind you will be slammed with downvotes purely out of mob mentality and not because your contribution lacks substance. That too, I have done.

       Thanks for the sentiment, but it does matter to a certain extent.  You probably don't remember, seeing as how much you have, how if you're low enough you're censored and can only comment once every nine minutes.

       lol, nice username to post ratio. I take it you use this account just to post on conpsiracy? I don't blame you. The normies simply are not ready for the esoteric side. For example, consider

        this 90-second video

       That's nonsense. When the top comments are right-wing and are supportive of Trump and your viewpoints you say things like "oh good the shills must be off right now", etc.

       Confirmation bias applies to you too, more so because your bias is towards the false narrative spread by the MSM and not the truth.

       Atleast if the bias is towards reality, you are still going to be biased, but not as wrong.

       The pattern is pretty obvious to anyone. If you disagree with the top comments because they don't fit your narrative, shills. If the top comments or posts do fit your narrative, it's because the shills have conveniently gone away.

       It's usually in the comment sections. That's where they all swarm in and astroturf the narrative and shoot down anyone who thinks otherwise. I've seen it more and more lately, there will be a thread with a lot of comments, and the top ones are always peddling the official narrative that they want us to believe so badly, and then the comments replying to that are always circlejerky type comments that laugh at anyone who dares think otherwise.

       It's to perpetuate herd behavioral thinking. 
People tend to search to fit in, and reddit is its own little society. Comments popularized by votes (whether organically, or artificially) might psychologically trigger ones desire to fit in.

       I honestly think there's a hard push to drill the narrative into people that is being perpetuated by all western mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       In recent times, the MSM has lost a lot of credibility, and now they're playing the numbers game, hoping to convince as many people as they can in a last ditch effort because after all,  consensus isn't based off of truth, it's based off of the majority's belief of what they think the truth is.

       Alt-right ain't terribly bright, they hate "word games" because they're too illiterate, like their "god empergoon" himself, to be able use words without feeling dizzy and going into a swoon! Evolution has left some folks behind and becoming a white nationalist fascist isn't gonna set that personal problem right.

       I have no love for 'white nationalism', but you should realize when you are being manipulated by
       <em>
        seemingly
       </em>
       lofty rhetoric.  Antifa has been made to look like heroes, defending ppl from racism, but they have a very disturbing history of provoking, attacking their fellow citizens violently and being bussed in to facilitate their purpose.  Trump has been made to appear closely associated with this group; the MSM is continuing to discredit and call for his removal or worse. Regime change in US?  Isn't that how they do it in other countries? Both groups are taking attn away from legal theft by economic fleecing of 99%, Corruption in the highest level of gov, and burning of our constitution.

       There is a video of the guy idling down the road before he hits anything, the car gets wallopped with a bat, the kid  smashes the gas flies into the crowd. In the pictures of him driving into the crowd, he is looking in his mirror, probably at the guy who smashed his car. Even in the real video you can hear the bat hit before the engine revs and the car comes into frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real conspiracy is that it was a 20 year old kid who tried to drive away from some douche smacking his shiny new car, and then tried to back away from guys doing the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't share this thought anywhere else, because it would make me a nazi, but this really seems like a kid making a bad call more than an attack, which goes against all narratives.

       The kid is a hell of a driver. It's a lot harder to pull off that reverse maneuver after the attack than you would think. Maybe he got lucky. Maybe he's taken some offensive driving lessons.

       I'm all for people speaking their mind, bit some people on this sub and even in this thread really STREEEEEEETCH the truth as well as details.  And they reach and reach to make certain details to fit their narrative like trying to put a round peg in a square hole.
      </p>

       This whole Charlottesville thing was terrible, and what it has done to people on this sub is bad too.  This place was already filled with enough partisan hacks.  Now we have:
      </p>
      <p>
       Leftwing hacks chest thumping saying "look how right we were."  All the while ignoring the violence perpetrated in the name of ideals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rightwing espousing more cognitive dissonance than i have seen anywhere ever in my life because they are faced with something that goes against what they believe and they are desperately trying to prove the world works like they think it should.

       Im sorry to say this but this one is on the mods. It is very easy to identify new shilling accounts and ban them. It is not very hard to identify post that push a certain narrative, truth be dammed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not easy ,but is would be entirely doable to cleanse this sub to a degree where meaningful discussion can happen again.  Mods are allowing this to happen.
