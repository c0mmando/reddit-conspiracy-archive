       I can't. I'm way too far away from any populous down town area. As long as you are not waving it menacingly, I'm not sure what standing a LEO would have to engage with you. I mean, they probably will engage you, but that would be unlawful. They don't really care about that, though. So, I guess if you're going to do this, check the laws, and have a video camera taping it.

       Yeah that's the thing, even if it's not illegal per se, you know you would be stopped by LEO's simply because you're in a crowded area. So how much less likely is it that a pack of (fake) Nazis that looks like a classic pitch fork lynch mob can walk around menacingly with dozens of torches and not immediately get detained and shut down?

       It wasn't officially made known of before they did it, and I'm sure they were allowed because the cops didn't know. Once they were made aware, they probably did engage them and shut it down.

       If you were blasting a flamethrower around the neighborhood, sure. But tiki torches are specifically designed to be safe in public places. Bars put them up around drunk people. Yuppies put them up around toddlers.

       Depends on the local rules regarding assemblies. A group that large might need a permit, particularly in dense urban environments. It's the size of the group that would trigger that though, not the fact that they're carrying tiki torches.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm speculating, I've never looked for torch regulations. But if there is any such law, I can't think of it and no one seems to be able to find one. Or an example of people getting busted for carrying tiki torches.

       They can't. The demonstrators got a permit, if I recall correctly, and cops are very reluctant (appropriately so) to break up lawful public assemblies. It's a core First Amendment right to assemble, especially over political issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even where the assembly is unpermitted, LEOs are generally pretty reluctant to break up nonviolent political assemblies.

       There's a lot of criticism being leveled at the cops for not breaking it up once things got violent. I tend to think they should have stepped in at that point, but it's hard to tell from arm's length.

       Yes, city council office? Hullo, we are a group of
       <em>
        nonviolent
       </em>
       white nationalists and we would like to apply for a permit to stalk menacingly downtown with hundreds of men carrying flaming torches and chanting inflammatory slogans. .

       Yeah, pretty much. And the city literally can't say no. There's generations of legal precedent on this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a massive oversimplification, but basically the city can exercise some discretion based on the
       <em>
        methods
       </em>
       of the march, but not its
       <em>
        viewpoints.
       </em>
       So if they want to use loudspeakers in a residential neighborhood at 4 a.m., the city can say no to that. But it can't say no because the marchers are Nazis. (There are famous cases on that exact, specific point. Ever seen Blues Brothers? The line about "Illinois Nazis" is a reference to one of those cases.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think the city would have a leg to stand on if it tried to deny a permit because the marchers were going to carry tiki torches. The things are literally designed to be as safe as possible. If they made homemade torches with rags and pitch, maybe, but not Pier One tiki torches.

       Yes, that's how the First Amendment works. If the town says no, they expose themselves to lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in fact, the town
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       try to prevent this rally from happening, or more accurately, tried to move it to a different location. As they've done in the past, the

       The tiki torches were CGI.

       I saw a commercial on MTV today where they extinguished a tiki torch and it said something like stop the hate...

       All I'm saying is... don't invest in any tiki companies for a little while
