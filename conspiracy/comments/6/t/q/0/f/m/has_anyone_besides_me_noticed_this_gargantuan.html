       Here. Eye witness accounts. Video can be misleading. Also it looks like the Leftist Mayor organized the whole attack with ANTIFA Scum. At least according to the ACLU. Anyway Leftist have been attacking people all year. Finally someone just had enough and decided to defend themselves.

       That is the most insane fucking nonsense I've heard in my life. How far are you reaching to try and justify the murder of an innocent woman?

       The ACLU said that the police were given a stand down order, which means the police wanted to give the Nazis as much room to cause as much violence as possible. The police brought tanks and automatic rifles to subdue the unarmed BLM protesters whose first amendment rights were viciously rescinded, but they let armed Nazis wander the streets starting fights and driving over people unimpeded.

       A terrorist just murdered someone. You are literally sympathising with and defending a terrorist murdering innocent Americans just because you've been trained to be scared of the same imaginary enemy.

       This is such Fox News bullshit. Nazi scum have murdered a bunch of people this year. How many people have been murdered by left-wing people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember in Portland earlier this year when a Nazi coward murdered two people on a bus for trying to defend young girls from his abuse? And remember when the following weekend Nazis held a rally in Portland, and the cops allowed the Nazis to help them violently suppress the first amendment rights of the counter-protesters?
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck can someone have such a callous and broken view of the world?

       The video does not show what was going on in his head or what may have happened earlier in the day but it does show that him and his vehicle were under no current danger.

       Well if it was the deep state, I'm glad. I'm glad because if this is an example of their power, well, they ran over and killed one person in an event that is largely insignificant and will disappear as forgettable; it is a great big act of nothing that will become meaningless and lost in the sands of time.
