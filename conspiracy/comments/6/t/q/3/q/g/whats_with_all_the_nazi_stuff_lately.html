<p>What does that even mean?? Nazi&#39;s are the KKK whether you believe it or not. Or whether they claim to be affiliated or not. They&#39;re just the hipsters of racism. Should we not confront or protest racist bigotry??? </p>

<p>&quot;In the past people have paid little attention because these groups have no legit credibility to mainstream Americans, thus their activities have been ignored and their members have been dismissed as idiotic trash.&quot;</p>

<p>Clearly you&#39;re white so you really lack the ability to comprehend how stupid this sounds. Cops are nazis, judges are nazis, the only people that never cared about the nazi&#39;s were dismissive white people.</p>

<p>Lmfao Lmfaooo. Why are you talking out your ass? You&#39;ve seen a couple movies or know someone who&#39;s been to prison? I&#39;ll just like to inform you that the KKK/Nazi&#39;s are in a lot of powerful positions.  Like I&#39;m sure if the Nazi&#39;s were a different &quot;racial&quot; group your opinion would be a lot different</p>

<p>Okay but what are you trying to imply with you&#39;re dismissive rhetoric? Is there a issue with america finally starting to cover racism? Or is this is to much of a conidence for you? Is it because of trump? Wasn&#39;t their nazi protests when obama was in office? I&#39;m just confused as to where your end game lyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By reporting on White Supremacy group rallies and etc it just makes their efforts more well know and surely attracts fringe supporters that inflate their ranks.  The Rally in Charlottesville was a local issue about a Statue, yet James Fields traveled from Ohio.  </p>

<p>White Supremacist Groups should be on the fringe of society, instead they are the lead story on every cable news network.  This only inflames and unnecessary divides Americans as a whole.  These groups make up a extremely small number of Americans.</p>

<p>This thread is about News coverage and the White Supremacist that make the News...like the ones at the Rally in Charlottesville.

If you feel so strongly feel free to create a threat detailing your opinion.</p>

<p>First lets stop implying that the nazi&#39;s aren&#39;t inherently racist. Two they&#39;re the fucking hipster kkk. So you&#39;re telling me a group of people that have literally been aloud to spout racist rhetoric for damn near the last 150years is going to go away if we rid america of communist?

    <div class="md"><p>Stop trying to put words in my mouth or show me where I wrote that getting rid of the Commies would end all racism. Nazis haven&#39;t been around for 150 years either. So educate yourself about Hisotry. Nazis gain followers and become a Politcal Force when Communism starts to be accepted. Like it is in our country currently. Communism is a much bigger threat. It has killed way more people, is more violent and has taken over more countries.</p>

Calling them nazi&#39;s is just to give room to voice stupid ass opinions like the one you just had.</p>

<p>So can you explain the lack of ethnic nazi&#39;s if communism is what fuels nazism? I&#39;m sure there would be ethnic groups that would agree with nazi rhetoric?</p>

<p>So what is to replace communism??? to make all the racist people happy? I&#39;m just impressed by the mental gymnastic&#39;s taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very stupid comment you just made. I told you over and over again Communism isn&#39;t what is causing racism. Also you seem to be under the impression that KKK is worse then NAZIs. I would say they are as equally as bad. The root cause of the Nazi Movement right now is the degeneracy being pushed by the Left. It&#39;s pushing more and more normal people to the fringe. Why exactly do you think the Alt-Right Movement exploded since 2012? Let me guess. It&#39;s because Poopie Head Drumpf said mean things?</p>

You feel as though Trump gives you a pass so you take the advantage while it&#39;s offered. The goal is for protesters to get discouraged so you&#39;ll be able to normalize your views and recruit outside of the fringe.

    <div class="md"><p>Evidenced by the way many people already automatically equate/conflate white nationalism, or even civic nationalism, with white supremacy or Nazism, it&#39;s obviously to quell a possibly growing sense of white ethnic identity and group interest.</p>

<p>In almost every thread calling these latest events into question you see the obligatory &quot;Gee you guys will do anything to defend these Nazis, won&#39;t you?&quot; when they are obviously not National Socialists, do not identify as such, and indeed Nazis pose about as big a threat today as snozzwanglers and whangdoodles from Loompaland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say, if you got a bunch of paid agitators to walk around sieg-heiling and chanting inflammatory slogans while waving flags reminiscent of the Third Reich, you could then smear all nationalists and more generally all pro-white advocates as Nazis and cause them to be even more resented and pilloried.</p>

<p>Wow, I was able to think of that simple yet effective plan and I&#39;m not even a NWO elite think-tank.</p>

<p>This is going to be a real mental tour de force for some people, but <em>just because you see &quot;Nazis&quot; marching around on television doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s necessarily a rising Fourth Reich in America.</em></p>

<p>Oh wait, that&#39;s just a movie, it&#39;s not reality. I guess not everything that&#39;s a moving image on a screen is a 100% accurate depiction of real life.</p>
