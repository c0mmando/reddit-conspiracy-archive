       The reason why Nazis are in the News so much is because people are seeking them out to counter protest  and confront them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past people have paid little attention because these groups have no legit credibility to mainstream Americans, thus their activities have been ignored and their members have been dismissed as idiotic trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing is to ignore these people and don't give them any exposure that they will surely find a way to use to their advantage somehow.  Federal, State, and Local Agencies will Prosecute them when they break laws.  Then Correctional System is where White Supremacist are most powerful that should explain everything you need to know.  Many of them but especially the most hardcore and serious one are in already in Prison.

       What does that even mean?? Nazi's are the KKK whether you believe it or not. Or whether they claim to be affiliated or not. They're just the hipsters of racism. Should we not confront or protest racist bigotry???

       Clearly you're white so you really lack the ability to comprehend how stupid this sounds. Cops are nazis, judges are nazis, the only people that never cared about the nazi's were dismissive white people.

       Lmfao Lmfaooo. Why are you talking out your ass? You've seen a couple movies or know someone who's been to prison? I'll just like to inform you that the KKK/Nazi's are in a lot of powerful positions.  Like I'm sure if the Nazi's were a different "racial" group your opinion would be a lot different

       Okay but what are you trying to imply with you're dismissive rhetoric? Is there a issue with america finally starting to cover racism? Or is this is to much of a conidence for you? Is it because of trump? Wasn't their nazi protests when obama was in office? I'm just confused as to where your end game lyes.

       By reporting on White Supremacy group rallies and etc it just makes their efforts more well know and surely attracts fringe supporters that inflate their ranks.  The Rally in Charlottesville was a local issue about a Statue, yet James Fields traveled from Ohio.
      </p>
      <p>
       White Supremacist Groups should be on the fringe of society, instead they are the lead story on every cable news network.  This only inflames and unnecessary divides Americans as a whole.  These groups make up a extremely small number of Americans.

       Listen if you want rant about racism in this country go right ahead, I'll probably agree with you.

      <p>
       This thread is about News coverage and the White Supremacist that make the News...like the ones at the Rally in Charlottesville.  Not about it the larger Racist conspiracy that obviously exists in this country at the highest levels of government and business.  If you feel so strongly feel free to create a threat detailing your opinion.

       I agree with him. I will take it one step farther and say that Nazis appear when there are Communist. We just need to cleanse the nation of Communist and the Nazi Problem will take care of itself. Communism is the disease. Nazis are just a symptom

       First lets stop implying that the nazi's aren't inherently racist. Two they're the fucking hipster kkk. So you're telling me a group of people that have literally been aloud to spout racist rhetoric for damn near the last 150years is going to go away if we rid america of communist? All what happens then?? all the racism goes away?

       Stop trying to put words in my mouth or show me where I wrote that getting rid of the Commies would end all racism. Nazis haven't been around for 150 years either. So educate yourself about Hisotry. Nazis gain followers and become a Politcal Force when Communism starts to be accepted. Like it is in our country currently. Communism is a much bigger threat. It has killed way more people, is more violent and has taken over more countries.

       Like I said. Stop trying to create distance between the Klan and nazi's.
       <br/>
       Calling them nazi's is just to give room to voice stupid ass opinions like the one you just had.
      </p>
      <p>
       So can you explain the lack of ethnic nazi's if communism is what fuels nazism? I'm sure there would be ethnic groups that would agree with nazi rhetoric?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is to replace communism??? to make all the racist people happy? I'm just impressed by the mental gymnastic's taking place.

       The Klan and Nazi are two Seperste groups. I also never said Nazis weren't racist. Communism is a degenerate ideology. Its incredibly corrosive to every aspect of a Society. If any nation accepts it even a little bit it eats at its fabric. When that happens a lot of normal people look around and see the degeneracy in their society and look for a strong ideology to defend against it. This opens up them up to Nazism. Communism is a cancer.

       Lmfao damn man. You're digging a deep ass hole. Some god tier sympathizer logic. You're the type of person to all the westboro baptist church fake christians because they don't align with your view of christianity.
      </p>

       Lmfao Klan and nazi's are only different because the klan probably fought nazi's in ww2 as to where nazi's are the hipsters of racism. Jinkies man keep up we've been over this.

       This is a very stupid comment you just made. I told you over and over again Communism isn't what is causing racism. Also you seem to be under the impression that KKK is worse then NAZIs. I would say they are as equally as bad. The root cause of the Nazi Movement right now is the degeneracy being pushed by the Left. It's pushing more and more normal people to the fringe. Why exactly do you think the Alt-Right Movement exploded since 2012? Let me guess. It's because Poopie Head Drumpf said mean things?

       Yeah you're full of shit dude. That rally was specifically in favor of "uniting the right" in support, direct or otherwise, of white nationalism. You feel as though Trump gives you a pass so you take the advantage while it's offered. The goal is for protesters to get discouraged so you'll be able to normalize your views and recruit outside of the fringe. Don't pretend you're just out to oppose communist marches by black bloc teenagers. Other way around Mr. Revisionist.

       Well Communism is a degenerate ideology. Its incredibly corrosive to every aspect of a Society. If any nation accepts it even a little bit it eats at its fabric. When that happens a lot of normal people look around and see the degeneracy in their society and look for a strong ideology to defend against it. This opens up them up to Nazism.

       Evidenced by the way many people already automatically equate/conflate white nationalism, or even civic nationalism, with white supremacy or Nazism, it's obviously to quell a possibly growing sense of white ethnic identity and group interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In almost every thread calling these latest events into question you see the obligatory "Gee you guys will do anything to defend these Nazis, won't you?" when they are obviously not National Socialists, do not identify as such, and indeed Nazis pose about as big a threat today as snozzwanglers and whangdoodles from Loompaland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the term "Nazis" has been stripped of all meaning and has been retooled as a general epithet towards any group of two or more white people talking about their shared interests.

       Say, if you got a bunch of paid agitators to walk around sieg-heiling and chanting inflammatory slogans while waving flags reminiscent of the Third Reich, you could then smear all nationalists and more generally all pro-white advocates as Nazis and cause them to be even more resented and pilloried.
