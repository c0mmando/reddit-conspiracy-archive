        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I read an article back the 90s written by a person who never felt he was a racist before entering prison, but once inside he became one. Once he was released he had a hard time changing his prison mindset and it bothered him. </p>

<p>He pondered how many other non-racist people became racists while inside and what effect it would eventually have on society when they are released from prison.</p>

<p>The point of the article was cautioning about the dangers continuing to lock up so many non-violent offenders and basically turning them in to animals self-divided by breed. </p>

<p>He wondered what does society think is going to happen when so many racist are released from prison? He wondered how may could go back to how they were before, and how many would stay racist. </p>

<p>The article bothered me quite a bit when I read it. I have looked for the article before, could not find it, but I never forgot it... and since then  I have watched his concerns become reality as The United States only increases its incarceration rate.  </p>

<p>There are many staggering, concerning, scary United States prison (and in prison system) statistics e.g. The United States represents about 4.4 percent of the world&#39;s population but houses around 22 percent of the world&#39;s prisoners.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The United States has 5% of the world&#39;s population, but 25% of the world&#39;s prisoners.</p></li>
<li><p>The total incarcerated population in the U.S. is a staggering 2.4 million â€” a 500% increase over the past 30 years. </p></li>
<li><p>One in every 108 adults was in prison or jail in 2012.</p></li>
<li><p>One in 28 American children has a parent behind bars.  </p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 2007, 1 in 31 adults was behind bars, on probation or on parole.</p></li>
<li><p>Currently, 65 million Americans have a criminal record.</p></li>
<li><p>There are more people behind bars today for a drug offense than there were in 1980 for all offenses combined.</p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. spent $80 billion on incarceration in 2010 alone. </p></li>
<li><p>About as many people were returned to prison just for parole violations in 2000 as were admitted in 1980 for all reasons combined.</p></li>
<li><p>Parole violators accounted for more than 35% of all prison admissions in 2000. Of those, only one-third were returned for a new conviction; the rest were returned for a technical violation, such as missing a meeting with the parole officer.</p></li>
<li><p>A first-time drug offense carries a sentence of 5-10 years. In other developed countries, that sentence would be six months of jail time, if any at all. </p></li>
<li><p>The vast majority of those arrested with a drug offense are not charged with serious offenses. For example, in 2005, 4 out of 5 drug arrests were for possession, not sales.  </p></li>
<li><p>In the 1990s, marijuana possession accounted for nearly 80% of the spike in arrests.</p></li>
<li><p>Three out of four young black men in Washington, D.C., can expect to serve time behind bars. This is despite the fact that people of all races use and sell drugs at the same rate.</p></li>
<li><p>African-Americans comprised 12% of regular drug users, but almost 40% of those arrested for drug offenses.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 96% of convictions in the federal system result from guilty pleas rather than decisions by juries.</p></li>
<li><p>Conservative estimates put innocent people who plead guilty between 2% and 5%, which translates to tens of thousands of innocent people behind bars today.</p></li>
<li><p>Eighty percent of defendants cannot afford a lawyer. Tens of thousands of people go to jail every year without ever talking to a lawyer or going to trial. </p></li>
<li><p>A public defender will routinely have a caseload of more than 100 clients at a time.</p></li>

<p>losing faith that society is just</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no faith (on average) that society is just or fair.</p>

<p>It started with the mean person who fucked me over (as a kid ) long long ago and laughingly said &quot;Who told you life was fair kid?&quot;... add to it the infinite times I have heard that since... and just last week getting fucked over again (by a fucking cell phone company)(&quot;Didn&#39;t you read the fine print&quot; aka fuck me) reinforces how unjust society is.</p>

<p>I would think after a while I would get smarter, but nope, I am still dumb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to hear he left it behind. I bet he is a good man who made a mistake, paid the price and is moving forward. I am happy for him, you and your family.</p>

<p>The person who wrote the article also said (with time) he was also able leave the jail habits and attitude behind as he stopped huddling over his meals and ate normally, stopped always watching his back, etc etc... the question is how many take it with them and/or ramp it up and start marching with swastika flags. </p>

<p>The AB is a real thing and can be scary. </p>

<p>A lot of those (in or out of prison) gangs can be scary, no matter if they are based on being Black, Mexican, White or any other race.</p>

<p>Facts be known it is all damned depressing... and I have not yet touched the Industrial Prison Machine/Complex which is currently making Billions of Dollars locking up as many people as they can. </p>

<p>It is dangerous (and very profitable) like the Industrial military complex which <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;biw=853&amp;amp;bih=384&amp;amp;site=webhp&amp;amp;q=IKE++warns+about+the+Industrial+military+complex&amp;amp;oq=IKE++warns+about+the+Industrial+military+complex&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.12...0.0.0.2083.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1..64.psy-ab..0.0.0.8G8bBWeGdZY">IKE warned us about</a>... and yet knowing all of this there is not a damned thing I can do about it. Both hurt society, both make a few people a ton of money and both make me sick to my stomach.</p>
