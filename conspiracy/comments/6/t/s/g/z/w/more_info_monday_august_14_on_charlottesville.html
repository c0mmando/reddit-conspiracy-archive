        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tonight Monday August 14 on Inside Edition with Deborah Norville had the police dash cam footage of when  Fields was pulled over in ohio in May for expired license plates (tivo 5 minute mark after mom). They show the same Gvf1111 plate on the Charger in Charlottesville. As we know the police report from that stop was failure to update his plates from the old owner of the car to Mr Fields. (also some question if the interviewed lady was his mom but thats another story)</p>

<p>Yet we all know the AP interview with Feilds supposed mother in a wheelchair in hergarage next to her car with no handicapped stickers or tag shows her car as having GVF 1122 on her license.</p>

<p>This is impossible if the charger had plates from the old owner in may.  Fields &#39;mom&#39; could not havehad plates 11 numbers away from an unrelated previous owner of her sons car.</p>

<p>Interestingly ABC World News Tonight  (monday aug 14) when showing the footage of the &#39;mom&#39; recropped the footage so her license was no longer visible.</p>

<p>And I noticed something else. About &quot;BAD BATMAN&quot;</p>

<p>In the ABC World  News Tonight story  they didnt show the people bashing in the back window of the charger after he hit those people. Specifically they didnt show the person known as Bad Batman in Black leggings and black helmet with mask and a baseball bat with a brownish camo jacket and black sneakers with white tread trim line who puts his bat clean through the back of the charger window before the Charger backs up.</p>

<p>However they DO show a scene in the ABC broadcast  (tivo 8 minute mark) which they run along the words about &quot;white supremisist violence&quot; where that same antifa batswinger Bad Batman in the same clothes in hitting an guy using a club with a black and white &#39;no racism sign&quot; which appears to be from earlier at the rally when the antifa were beating up the alt right groups at the Robert E Lee statue. He is hitting a white guy on the pavement who is holding  his american flag as he is being beaten while he is lying on the ground.</p>

<p>So this shows the Bad Batman had already beate  one guy with a club &#39;sign&#39; earlier. He was at the rally point and also the car crash. </p>

<p>So ot appears Bad Batman was very curiously at two key places right in front of some of the most used footage by the news media.  How did he know to be the future car crash scene and how was he the first to jump on the back of the car after the crash?</p>

<p>At the rally point Bad Batman was swinging a club with the antifa sign and hitting an alt right guy who was on the ground with an american flag. Then later the same Bad Batman Antifa guy is literally the first guy on the back of the Charger with a baseball bat after the Charger hits the crowd. Coincidence? Who is that BAD BATMAN guy &amp; why is he so completely covered?</p>

<p>Why does the charger have the prevjous owners plates in may police dashcam footage that differ from the current owners  &#39;moms&#39; plates by 11 digits in her garage now ?</p>

<p>Why did abc run footage of an antifa guy known as Bad Batman hitting an altright guy while saying white supremicist violence when it was the opposite?</p>

<p>Why did abc news crop out the moms license plate which the internet had discovered to be fishy yesterday?</p>

<p>Incidently Inside Edition  ran the more complete footage of the Charger after hitting the crowd then being jumped on and bashed by Bad Batman and several others in helmets with heavy clubs so you cant see their faces (tivo 6 minute mark) . They jump the car almost like a trained unit together. BAD BATMAN is the first one on the car. Why is bad batman always right in front of the cameras in the footage that everyone sees at two different places? BAD BATMAN IS A KEY FIGURE TO ALL THIS</p>

<p>Edit:
And dont forget. One of two people who got the best footage of the whole car incident was a cia guy at the state department whose cia reference was deleted from the state department website where it had been publicly listed for years.</p>

<p>This whole thing is looking more and more like an incident designed by the deep state and cia to enrage us that was filmed by a cia dude and where a guy in a helmet, BAD BATMAN , was a two different places key to the incidents and prominently featured in footage used by the media! </p>

<p>How did the cia guy turn on the camera before the car came down the hill? How did BAD BATMAN hit a guy with an american flag and also then later be in the perfects spot to jump first on the back of the car?</p>

<p>Isnt that the most enraging photo opportunity possible and he was in both?</p>

<p>We MUST figure out who BAD BATMAN is . In one still frame i seewhite ear and face, black helmet with exposed ear like a skate boarder helmet,  brown camo jacket, black leggings or skinny jeans, distinctive workout or repairman or bicycle glove with logo on top of wrist, black sneakers with white line at top of tread line.</p>

<p>I cant post this to T_D because I am banned there.</p>

<p>Edit </p>

<p>Someone posted screengrabs !  Thanks!  </p>

<p>Police dash cam footage from may in ohio when Fields was supposedly pulled over because car woth plates Gvf1111 was in old owners name...yet had the plates that nearly matched his mothers gvf1122 license plate . Hmmm.... How does THAT work.

<p>Bad Batman now at a different location but at the perfect place and the first to jump on the car after the crash and pummel it!  Coincidence? How does he know where to go?

<p>Edit:  just found this other picture from right after BAD BATMAN hit the guy with the flag. This different guy with the baton came into the frame. Now here he is either then or at a different time hitting a guy on the ground while a guy in back seemingly has a police badge on his belt....<a href="https://i.redd.it/c3x114wcjsfz.jpg">https://i.redd.it/c3x114wcjsfz.jpg</a></p>

<p>GVF would fall into the 2013-present category. Two people getting plates at the same time or close to each other would very likely get sequential or nearly sequential plates.</p>

<p>Do you see how your assumptions support your preconceptions?</p>

<p>Dunno. Maybe she doesn&#39;t drive it, being in a wheelchair and all. Maybe she doesn&#39;t like paying the fee. Maybe she lives in a small town and doesn&#39;t need the parking privileges. </p>

<p>Sure. That happens in many states.</p>

<p>But how does the PREVIOUS UNRELATED OWNER OF THE CAR get plates close to the mom of the new owner of the car?</p>

<p>And rememberecen family memenrs dont getnearplate sfor cars that were purchased at differnet times becaise tjey wpukd t expire at different times. So they wpuldnt be in the registration office at the same time. It wpuld be months apart.</p>

<p>My wife and I got new plates at the same time. Hers were expiring after mine, but since I was at the DMV I went ahead and got one for her car too. A vanity plate, a little different situation, but it obviously happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where? It says that if you buy from a private seller you get title to the car, but I don&#39;t see where it says you have to get new plates.</p>

<p>Never lived in Ohio, but twice in my life I or my family sold a car to a private buyer. We never once asked what they were going to do with the plates, nor did we care. I know that in both cases the buyer didn&#39;t bother to change them. (Both times authorities let us know--once the police, when the car was used in a crime, and once the state, when the new owner abandoned it in a public lot.)</p>

<p>So even if new plates are required, which I don&#39;t see on that page, does that mean that new plates get put on?</p>

<p>Mostikes happen.</p>

<p>In hollyowod movies wheremillions srespent tracking every shot with people watching everprop on a list and script sjpervisors and wardrobe and hair all matching every single thing they still miss some things.</p>

<p>So you dont think some false flag can miss something?</p>

<p>Maybe some was suposedto change the plates and didnt?</p>

<p>And remember BAD BATMAN showed up at two crucjal places in front of the main camera at the most important places  with supposedly spontaneous unrehesrsed things including a car crash in the same clothes.</p>

<p>Error. Error.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anomaly hunting. Basic, classic logical mistake that reinforces preconceptions rather than finding facts.</p>

<p>Here, for example, you focused so hard on things not making sense that you overlooked much more likely explanations:</p>

<p>The killer and his mom moved from Kentucky. <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/08/12/car-hit-charlottesville-crowd-purchased-florence-registered-ohio-online-records-show/562283001/">http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/08/12/car-hit-charlottesville-crowd-purchased-florence-registered-ohio-online-records-show/562283001/</a></p>

<p>They&#39;d have been required to transfer their cars to Ohio, and get new plates. Which they likely did at or near the same time.</p>

<p>How much you <em>want</em> to believe in a false flag is irrelevant to whether or not it&#39;s true, and whether or not there&#39;s evidence for it. There isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll watch your Batman movies tomorrow. Based on your approach with the license plates, I don&#39;t have high expectations for the quality of your find there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never did run that source down, so I checked it out. <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/national-international/James-Alex-Fields-Jr-Suspect-in-Va-White-Nationalist-Rally-Car-Incident-440096613.html">Some sources</a> say he was cited for &quot;expired or unlawful plates,&quot; while <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/08/14/charlottesville-killer-pulled-over-cops-ohio/">others</a> say expired plates. </p>

<p>The title was <a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/08/12/car-hit-charlottesville-crowd-purchased-florence-registered-ohio-online-records-show/562283001/">updated</a> in 2015, according to Carfax. He would have got the GVF 1111 plates then. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1502566230773.png">Carfax</a> also apparently shows that his registration expired every year on 4/26; he was pulled over May 25, so his registration was overdue. Not the plates, which don&#39;t have a 2-year expiration date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, I think this going a bit far.  I have no doubt that there were government provocateurs, Batman could very well be on.  But I think it was more of setting the situation up, with multiple cameras rolling (we see this footage, not the others that filmed but didn&#39;t capture it), provoked with help of police inaction, and let it play out.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> crazy people in this country who are just looking for an excuse to snap.  It&#39;s not hard to push them there, just set it up and be ready with cameras.</p>
