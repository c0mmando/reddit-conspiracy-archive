       If you try and point that out they will start lying and saying that Trump supporters didn't associate the act with the ideology when they denounced it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reducing an ideology to its most violent extreme members is a tried and true strategy TPTB have been using against Muslims and Russians for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end goal is the same - civil war.

       Not only the MSM, but the controlled media like Alex Jones. Well, at least the Jews and communists get protection from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews and Communists are the definition of the global tyranny, so not surprising when MSM does not talk about them at all and only a few alt media outlets do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the MSM and the controlled alt media team up to rip the society apart.

       The same way Americans associate all Muslims with the actions of a few extremists? I don't think this is persecution against Trump supporters, unless you agree that Muslims are being similarly persecuted....by Trump supporters.

       and that fact is used as an excuse to try and ban innocent women from wearing hijabs, or for banning entry from majority-muslim countries, or for the general mindest of "all muslims are evil!" that is very real in America right now
      </p>
      <p>
       so I can't sympathize if one white alt-right extremists hits 20 people with a car and people start to thinks all far-right people are dangerous. if you do the same thing to innocent Muslims, then you can't cry when it happens to the far-right too.

       Cool. Historically, nations that have the most diversity are the strongest.

       We should allow more immigrants. Nations that advocate for isolationism and protectionist policies fail,

       There is absolutely civil war happening in the Middle East, and has been happening for several years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also as a side note, not wanting to take in refugees from a country that your leadership is dismantling and sending into chaos against your will is NOT "persecuting muslims."

       Though I agree with most of your points, there aren't nearly as many muslims in America as whites.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been more so called "white terror attacks" than muslims attacks this year. Mosques have been bombed, Christian churches have not.

       Because muslims are a slim minority in the US, on a "compare x incidents to y" scale there will almost always be more "white violence" than "Muslim violence."
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way this would be different would be if we had a substantially larger amount of muslims in terms of total population and concentration.  Basically, a larger pool of people from which dumbasses can be pulled from.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://apps.revealnews.org/homegrown-terror/">
        Here
       </a>
       is an interesting infographic about right/left/Islamic terrorist incidents in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the authors clearly demonstrate that there are more right-wing incidents that have been thwarted or happened since 2004 (post 9-11, which would skew the death tolls significantly), what they fail to account for is the total population of muslims living in the USA.  What the study finds is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Right - 115
Muslim - 63
Left - 23
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/#how-many-muslims-are-there-in-the-united-states-and-how-do-we-know">
        According to Pew Research,
       </a>
       there are ~3.3 million Muslims living in the USA.  This is ~1% of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the revealnews study of 201 completed and/or thwarted terror incidents, 115 were "right-wing" (including everyone from religious fundamentalists to white nationalists to sovereign citizens to anti-government activists) vs 63 "Islamic" incidents (affiliated with AQ, ISIS, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is as a total population percentage, there are
       <em>
        drastically
       </em>
       more coming from this 1% of the population compared to the 63% total population of white Americans, and 99% "not Muslim" population of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, this is a bit scary.  The revealnews study makes it clear their aim was to "show the giant threat of right wing terrorism," but completely ignores (either honestly orndishonestly) the total population in their study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this done on purpose?  Are they pushing an agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       You decide.

       The problem with the whole trump thing is he lends his name to these radicals then when they go off and do something like this trump says something like he did yesterday... both sides do bad things and are equally to blame. (I do not support the censorship craze but preventing free speech is hardly equal to killing people and advocating genocide) which further whips people up. If trump would call me out like Obama did several times during black riots and totally condemn them and put them in context there would be a chance to heal. That said I think most trump supporters do not agree with him and totally condem nazis and fascism. There are a vocal few that drive the narrative and to to the silent complacency of the majority are allowed to turn the movement into a radical one. However I do agree this was the design all along. Civil war.

       The MSM correctly states the information above and rightfully criticizes nazis and the far right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rally goers have also been making it known that they support trump and feel emboldened by him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The msm correctly points this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps response to the terror attack was to never name any of the terror groups in attendance and to criticize both sides as bad, when it was one side that murdered someone in a terror attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       The msm rightfully points out that Nazis love Trump, and that Trump refuses to disavow or criticize the literal Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       What th hell is wrong eith any of that?

       Everyone who supports trump is not automatically a Nazi.

      <p>
       Everyone who didn't support the DNC and their candidate, does not automatically support trump.

       That is the current narrative being pushed. Need to stop putting people into two groups.

       Civil war? You're thinking too small. With the coming recession, chinese economic bubble, war in middle east, North Korea, and russia, with possible backup from China, we aren't looking at just a country divided but the next great war.
