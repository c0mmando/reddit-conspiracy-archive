    <div class="md"><p>Because muslims are a slim minority in the US, on a &quot;compare x incidents to y&quot; scale there will almost always be more &quot;white violence&quot; than &quot;Muslim violence.&quot;  </p>

<p>The only way this would be different would be if we had a substantially larger amount of muslims in terms of total population and concentration.  Basically, a larger pool of people from which dumbasses can be pulled from.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.revealnews.org/homegrown-terror/">Here</a>  is an interesting infographic about right/left/Islamic terrorist incidents in the US.</p>

<p>While the authors clearly demonstrate that there are more right-wing incidents that have been thwarted or happened since 2004 (post 9-11, which would skew the death tolls significantly), what they fail to account for is the total population of muslims living in the USA.  What the study finds is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Right - 115
Muslim - 63
Left - 23</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/demographic-portrait-of-muslim-americans/#how-many-muslims-are-there-in-the-united-states-and-how-do-we-know">According to Pew Research,</a> there are ~3.3 million Muslims living in the USA.  This is ~1% of the population.</p>

<p>In the revealnews study of 201 completed and/or thwarted terror incidents, 115 were &quot;right-wing&quot; (including everyone from religious fundamentalists to white nationalists to sovereign citizens to anti-government activists) vs 63 &quot;Islamic&quot; incidents (affiliated with AQ, ISIS, etc).</p>

<p>The issue is as a total population percentage, there are <em>drastically</em> more coming from this 1% of the population compared to the 63% total population of white Americans, and 99% &quot;not Muslim&quot; population of the US.</p>

<p>Honestly, this is a bit scary.  The revealnews study makes it clear their aim was to &quot;show the giant threat of right wing terrorism,&quot; but completely ignores (either honestly orndishonestly) the total population in their study.  </p>

<p>Is this done on purpose?  Are they pushing an agenda?  </p>

<p>You decide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with the whole trump thing is he lends his name to these radicals then when they go off and do something like this trump says something like he did yesterday... both sides do bad things and are equally to blame. (I do not support the censorship craze but preventing free speech is hardly equal to killing people and advocating genocide) which further whips people up. If trump would call me out like Obama did several times during black riots and totally condemn them and put them in context there would be a chance to heal. That said I think most trump supporters do not agree with him and totally condem nazis and fascism. There are a vocal few that drive the narrative and to to the silent complacency of the majority are allowed to turn the movement into a radical one. However I do agree this was the design all along. Civil war.  </p>

<p>Please enlighten me on how Trump &quot;lends his name to these radicals&quot; and when Trump said he supported or supports &quot;nazis and fascism&quot;.</p>

<p>These statements are very bold and need some explaining.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres what happened.</p>

<p>A nazi went to a rally populated by nazis and other far right groups screaming sieg hiel, waving nazi flags, and tatted up with swastikas. The rally goers came with armed militia and weapons. One member of the rally,who was a part of nazi organization,  murder one women and i jured ninteen others in a rerror attack.</p>

<p>The MSM correctly states the information above and rightfully criticizes nazis and the far right. </p>

<p>The rally goers have also been making it known that they support trump and feel emboldened by him.</p>

<p>The msm correctly points this out.</p>

<p>Trumps response to the terror attack was to never name any of the terror groups in attendance and to criticize both sides as bad, when it was one side that murdered someone in a terror attack.</p>

<p>The msm rightfully points out that Nazis love Trump, and that Trump refuses to disavow or criticize the literal Nazis.</p>

<p>What th hell is wrong eith any of that?</p>
