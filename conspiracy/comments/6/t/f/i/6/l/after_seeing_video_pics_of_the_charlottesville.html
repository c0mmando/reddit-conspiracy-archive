<p>&quot;Tint darkness for sedans:</p>

<p>Windshield: Non-reflective tint is allowed on the top 5 inches of the windshield.</p>

<p>Front Side windows: Must allow more than (50% of light in).</p>

<p>Back Side windows: Any darkness can be used.</p>

<p>Michigan (where the kid who says he sold the car is from)- <a href="https://www.tinting-laws.com/michigan/">https://www.tinting-laws.com/michigan/</a></p>

<p>Tint darkness for sedans:</p>

<p>Windshield: Non-reflective tint is allowed on the top 4 inches of the windshield.</p>

<p>Front Side windows: Any darkness can be applied (4&quot; inches from the top of the window).</p>

<p>Back Side windows: Any darkness can be used.</p>

<p>Rear Window: Any darkness can be used.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe for a second that this wasn&#39;t planned to the hilt. It&#39;s more likely the Joel kid 4chan found is the real owner cuz wasn&#39;t the plate from Ohio how they found him. He is probably being protected not to mention that if that car wasn&#39;t set up with roll bars and wearing a helmet then the driver was also suicidal. I am hoping Sessions finds evidence of what really happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think: if you were going to inflict maximum damage and/or injury at a rally with a car, would you do so by lightly tapping the bumper of a car in front of you at 15-20 mph? Then reversing and escaping immediately? Of course not. Of course this was a staged event. It has every appearance of just another fake car attack just like in Nice, Munich, Melbourne, I even believe there was one in Israel not too long ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That looked like a limo tint, ~5%, and I don&#39;t think that is legal to have on your car in general anywhere. </p>

<p>With that said, it is easy to apply tint and you can order it online. I&#39;ve seen it that dark on a car here before and it is illegal in my state.</p>

<p>Only other place I&#39;ve seen it that dark on all the windows was on a couple o 90&#39;s/early 2000&#39;s black GMC suburbans when I ran into some kind of military/gov training out in the middle of the boonies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 5% on my car for my safety and  privacy.  Here in Georgia all they do is give you tickets to meet quotas. The law they passed is shady to say the least, they allow for gov, emergency people, military etc . Ive also heard a doctor can write you a prescription for darker window tint but not for 5%. . I&#39;ve received 2 tickets in last 3 yrs and paid them.  They Do Not go against points on your driving record just chatge you outragous ticket prices . I refuse to remove mine, I  do not like everyone being able to see me due to robberies and car jackings and so on plus my car is a bit pricy which  makes you a target when your Female..  and another i bought my car off a now homeland security worker- friend of mine who was a cop when I bought the car. It was his personal use vehicle and of course he never ever got a ticket or messed with.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A state trooper gave me my first ticket and was quite informative and really respectful to me .. my second ticket from a tiny tiny town called Porterdale the cop About busted my back window out with the maglight walking up to my car and was female cop, she lectured  me on her safetly issues with such dark tint and not being able to see who was in backseat  which was my 3 yr old at the time was completely rude for whatever reason the ticket was around 200 bucks. I got her point of her safety issues not being able to see,  but I got safety issues to, plus Cops are supposes to be fearless with being armed to the tooth &amp; not scared of the public especially when they&#39;re running your tag even before getting out of car.  lol.. I kept my cool with her because Porterdale is rumored to be a cess-hole of Garbage, trouble and nothing but meth heads. So I never ever drive through there unless I just absolutely have to with all windows rolled down.. lol</p>
