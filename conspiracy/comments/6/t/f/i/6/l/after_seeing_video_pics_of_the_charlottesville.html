       I don't believe for a second that this wasn't planned to the hilt. It's more likely the Joel kid 4chan found is the real owner cuz wasn't the plate from Ohio how they found him. He is probably being protected not to mention that if that car wasn't set up with roll bars and wearing a helmet then the driver was also suicidal. I am hoping Sessions finds evidence of what really happened.

       Just think: if you were going to inflict maximum damage and/or injury at a rally with a car, would you do so by lightly tapping the bumper of a car in front of you at 15-20 mph? Then reversing and escaping immediately? Of course not. Of course this was a staged event. It has every appearance of just another fake car attack just like in Nice, Munich, Melbourne, I even believe there was one in Israel not too long ago.

       They needed him to be caught, not get away with it....especially after they spent hours calling him "white supremacist" when no one supposedly knew who it was or anything not to mention he smashed into a 99.9% WHITE crowd.

       In my state, it's illegal to have your front windows tinted. People still do it. They get really dark tints, even. Then if they get pulled over, they get a fix-it ticket, strip off the tint, get their ticket signed off, and then go tint their windows again.

       How does your state handle license plate registration? Because there is

       They could be vanity plates, I guess.  Not sure what "GVF" would be though.

       That looked like a limo tint, ~5%, and I don't think that is legal to have on your car in general anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, it is easy to apply tint and you can order it online. I've seen it that dark on a car here before and it is illegal in my state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only other place I've seen it that dark on all the windows was on a couple o 90's/early 2000's black GMC suburbans when I ran into some kind of military/gov training out in the middle of the boonies.

       I have 5% on my car for my safety and  privacy.  Here in Georgia all they do is give you tickets to meet quotas. The law they passed is shady to say the least, they allow for gov, emergency people, military etc . Ive also heard a doctor can write you a prescription for darker window tint but not for 5%. . I've received 2 tickets in last 3 yrs and paid them.  They Do Not go against points on your driving record just chatge you outragous ticket prices . I refuse to remove mine, I  do not like everyone being able to see me due to robberies and car jackings and so on plus my car is a bit pricy which  makes you a target when your Female..  and another i bought my car off a now homeland security worker- friend of mine who was a cop when I bought the car. It was his personal use vehicle and of course he never ever got a ticket or messed with.

       A state trooper gave me my first ticket and was quite informative and really respectful to me .. my second ticket from a tiny tiny town called Porterdale the cop About busted my back window out with the maglight walking up to my car and was female cop, she lectured  me on her safetly issues with such dark tint and not being able to see who was in backseat  which was my 3 yr old at the time was completely rude for whatever reason the ticket was around 200 bucks. I got her point of her safety issues not being able to see,  but I got safety issues to, plus Cops are supposes to be fearless with being armed to the tooth &amp; not scared of the public especially when they're running your tag even before getting out of car.  lol.. I kept my cool with her because Porterdale is rumored to be a cess-hole of Garbage, trouble and nothing but meth heads. So I never ever drive through there unless I just absolutely have to with all windows rolled down.. lol

       After seeing the video &amp; pics of the Charlottesville car incident I wondered if it's legal to run people over with your car. I did some research, and it turns out it is not. I think this guy might be some kind of criminal or something.
