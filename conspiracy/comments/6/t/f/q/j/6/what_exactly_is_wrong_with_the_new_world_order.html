    <div class="md"><p>ok i guess this is where my question comes from</p>

<p>why is it always some &quot;satanic&quot; shit? i&#39;m not religious i&#39;m just spiritual so that kinda thing doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<p>if it had to do with money or control i&#39;d understand, but you&#39;re really saying it&#39;s satanic?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it isn&#39;t. bad energy is real. satanism is not. and the elite doesn&#39;t practice it anyways, if you knew anything about ritualistic dark magic etc you&#39;d know satanism has nothing to do with it. and if you truly believe in that reptile shit.. lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suit yourself. Although I believe I&#39;ve met Satan himself in a dream. He was a 7 foot tall crimson red reptilian. The most vivid dream in my life. He looked nothing like the ridiculous pictures you&#39;ll see on Google. </p>

<p>But anyway suit yourself. I could show you hundreds of all seeing eyes in television shows. I could show you how the gmail logo is a free mason apron. Or how the Facebook logo is the symbol of tubalcain. I could show you have the google play logo is the sigil of lucifer. I could show you how Google chrome is 666. I could show you how satanists worship the black cube of Saturn. I could show you how Saturn is Satan. I could show you how santa is Satan. I could tell you about the hexagon on Saturn. I could tell you about Christmas, or as it was better known as saturnalia. I could tell you a lot of things. </p>

<p>Have a good one</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s why Minnesota is getting the nations first satanism memorial will be a black cube? Do satanists worship Saturn? Or are you convinced that it&#39;s just some edgy ideology about serving yourself. Wake up dude. You can try to sound as smart as you&#39;d like. But if you&#39;re convinced freemasonry has nothing to do with satanism you&#39;re kidding yourself. If you&#39;re convinced all seeing eyes, 666, etc are not satanic then you&#39;re kidding yourself. If you&#39;re not convinced that 9/11 was a satanic ritual then you&#39;re kidding yourself.</p>

<p>So tell me oh wise one, why are there so many all seeing eyes in tv shows and movies. Please enlighten me. And please tell me why the satanic memorial will be a black cube. You don&#39;t know shit </p>

<p>Are you serious? Is it that obvious that he has to be kidding himself if he doesn&#39;t know? I bet 99.9% of people have ever even heard of that conspiracy. </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s creepy and occult looking. Just watch an episode of Gravity Falls. &quot;Satanic Imagery&quot; is everywhere because it adds to the lore of a creepy town with secret societies and evil entities. Watch an episode of Supernatural. There are literally angels, demons, unicorns, leprechauns, witches in every episode, so obviously the massive amount of occult symbology is justified by story reasons. </p>

<p>This is all I&#39;m going to send you because I&#39;m pretty convinced you&#39;re just trolling me. You have done 0 research if you&#39;re not aware of how many occult symbols are in movies and TV shows. <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXTd3.jpg">https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXTd3.jpg</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again none of this has to do with Christianity or Satanism. No Satanists don&#39;t worship Satan, yes by their own definition they are exactly what they said you are. Good for those guys on getting a monument I guess. You sound like a 13 year old Catholic kid who just found out what the occult was for the first time. You have a very very long way to go. Also 9/11 was many things, but if you think it&#39;s a Satanic ritual lol.. come on man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people have the idea that a New World Order (NWO) is acceptable because they envision a one world government where all nations get along in peace and harmony. With no more wars, poverty, and fair trade where everybody has equal opportunity, it almost sounds to good to be true. And it is.</p>

<p>The NWO (which is already here) is the extreme wealthy and powerful ruling over everybody else who are slaves. You will not be able to own land, and unless you are filthy rich, you will be put into Bloomberg apartments, or detention centers (if you can&#39;t work), and you will be put to death when you turn 75; regardless of how healthy you may be. George Carlin talked about &quot;the owners of this world&quot;. &quot;It&#39;s a big club, and you ain&#39;t in it!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because NWO is about destruction of sovereignty, individuality, freewill, etc. Look how fucked up our current system is and you want them to architect one with even more control over you? Our technology is evolving faster than our minds and cultures are. We are like caveman with computers.</p>

<p>Forget who said it, but I heard someone once say &quot;If the mind of man binds with the mind of machine, before the mind of nature, the world will never know peace&quot;, or something to that effect and that is what we are seeing happening with this NWO. </p>

<p>Dependence on the government and groupthink is greater now than ever.  All you have to do is go on social media to see how bad the groupthink is. Just try to step outside the accepted narratives and see what happens. That is why we need places like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> more now than ever.</p>

<p>Not to mention deliberate destruction/manipulation of identity through the gender agenda that they are pushing onto the current and next generation. </p>

<p>How do you think it is improving for the individual?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i see what you mean as i hate social media but people are becoming increasingly more individualistic and expressive. you just contradicted yourself, how can they spread the gay agenda yet people be becoming less individualistic? just because that agenda is being pushed doesn&#39;t mean people magically are going to stop being straight lol. and in most parts of the world that influence won&#39;t fly at all. also groupthink is influential in the formation of individual thought.. people want verification they don&#39;t care about other people in reality. but everyone is becoming more expressive, they just need more means to show it nowadays </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it is that a nwo could never work well because it would require the world to be some sort of utopian fantasy land. In a sense it implies that one set of thinking and set of facts are the gospel truth. Realistically nothing can ever be such a simple black and white and their will alwaysbe opposing opinions. this discourages thinking from angles other than the state provided one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So that&#39;s why Minnesota is getting the nations first satanism memorial will be a black cube? Do satanists worship Saturn? Or are you convinced that it&#39;s just some edgy ideology about serving yourself. Wake up dude. You can try to sound as smart as you&#39;d like. But if you&#39;re convinced freemasonry has nothing to do with satanism you&#39;re kidding yourself. If you&#39;re convinced all seeing eyes, 666, etc are not satanic then you&#39;re kidding yourself. If you&#39;re not convinced that 9/11 was a satanic ritual then you&#39;re kidding yourself.</p>

<p>So tell me oh wise one, why are there so many all seeing eyes in tv shows and movies. Please enlighten me. And please tell me why the satanic memorial will be a black cube. You don&#39;t know shit </p>

<p>Are you serious? Is it that obvious that he has to be kidding himself if he doesn&#39;t know? I bet 99.9% of people have ever even heard of that conspiracy. </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s creepy and occult looking. Just watch an episode of Gravity Falls. &quot;Satanic Imagery&quot; is everywhere because it adds to the lore of a creepy town with secret societies and evil entities. Watch an episode of Supernatural. There are literally angels, demons, unicorns, leprechauns, witches in every episode, so obviously the massive amount of occult symbology is justified by story reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again none of this has to do with Christianity or Satanism. No Satanists don&#39;t worship Satan, yes by their own definition they are exactly what they said you are. Good for those guys on getting a monument I guess. You sound like a 13 year old Catholic kid who just found out what the occult was for the first time. You have a very very long way to go. Also 9/11 was many things, but if you think it&#39;s a Satanic ritual lol.. come on man. </p>

<p>Please explain to me why the all seeing eye is &quot;Satanic&quot; to you? </p>
