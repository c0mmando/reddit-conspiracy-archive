<p>I disagree that this was a terrorist incident. Do we really want to live in a nation in which Liberty can so easily be undermined by events like this? As far as I&#39;m concerned, the word &#39;terrorism&#39; should be reserved strictly for proven, premeditated events specifically designed to cause mass panic, which kill far more than one person. Virginia literally declared a state of emergency over this small event.</p>

<p>How does that benefit any of you? What are your own personal reasons for calling this a terrorist attack? What difference does it make for our society, for our government? How do we know this wasn&#39;t a staged event to give the feds more tools to dismantle this &#39;unite the right&#39; movement? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definite terrorism as political violence aimed at civilians, for the purpose or with the obvious effect of creating fear in the public. The number of immediate victims and perpetrators isn&#39;t relevant. I think this qualifies under that definition, as does the Capitol Hill shooter earlier this year.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t take the false flag theories on this seriously because there&#39;s a large amount of evidence of a real event, and none to suggest a false flag. Jumping straight to the conclusion that it was a staged event indicates motivated reasoning, in my opinion.</p>

<p>&quot;and what evidence there is points to an alt-right Trump supporter murdering a protester&quot;</p>

<p>Is merely an opinion. Remember that reporter getting shot on the air? That too, was merely an opinion. Just wait until computer graphics are indistinguishable from real life- you&#39;ll be one of those fools running down the streets screaming, &quot;the aliens are coming, the aliens are coming!&quot;. They&#39;ll be able to convince you of anything at anytime just by putting it on television. </p>

<p>The real truth is, the media&#39;s ability to manipulate you, heavily outweighs your ability to filter fact, from fiction. They will use you and the rest of the frothing masses to instill fear in our hearts and minds. You are putty to them. Moldable into any shape they deem necessary to affect political changes which go against the best interests of the group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Democracy is far too fragile <em>not</em> to assume the worst, and the worst case scenario is, this was a false flag.</p>

<p>&quot;Terrorism refers to planned or completed violence intended to cause civilian casualties or degradation of the facilities of civil society, committed to create an atmosphere of fear in order to obtain a political objective. The act may be intended to cause direct casualties, or to disrupt critical infrastructure.&quot;</p>

<p>I like to look at the consequences, as I think that&#39;s what should determine definitions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Terrorist act: state of emergency, checkpoints, papers please, white suspects, police profiling, loss of civil liberties</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>ordinary violence: NO CONSEQUENCES </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, please explain to me why you choose the option that has the most potential consequences for yourself? What benefit does it provide for you as opposed to labeling this ordinary violence?</p>

<p>Sounds like we agree that the &quot;false flag&quot; assumptions aren&#39;t based on evidence for the attack being a false flag, but the drive some people have to assume such.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t create the definition based on whether it will help me or hurt me. It&#39;s what I remember based on studying terrorism in law school after 9/11. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think a state of emergency was necessary in this case. But that doesn&#39;t affect my definitions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to help the government create an environment which fosters their persecution, understand? The definition of terrorism often includes some sort of political gain.</p>

<p>What the fuck kind of political gain does this event achieve for ANYONE BUT THE FEDS? As a matter of fact, what does it do but HARM THEIR MOVEMENT?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, if you&#39;re trying to use political correctness, and our <em>modern</em> climate of shaming, and social justice, and all that absolute nonsense, stop wasting your time. I&#39;m a realist. That means racism DOESN&#39;T EXIST.</p>

<p>How can you be racist towards your own race? Hmm?</p>

<p>Are we bigoted and cultural, OF COURSE WE ARE. And we have been for hundreds of thousands of years. Do you know what it evolved from?</p>

<p>Being able to quickly recognize group members. This was imperative to our survival. This developed into culture, and cultural differences.</p>

<p>I will openly admit- I work for best interests of my cultural group. If you think you aren&#39;t bigoted, you&#39;re deluded. You just haven&#39;t experienced a situation in which we were stripped of our many privileges and civilities sufficiently enough to make you so.

    <div class="md"><p>Conversations like this feel like fate to me. We were meant to talk, to have this conversation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a white guy. I was a heroin addict for a decade. I spent 6 years in prison over two trips. I am qualified to speak on this matter.</p>

<p>Do you know who the largest majority of cocaine and heroin addicts in America are? whites</p>

<p>Do you know which group of people in America have lost the most wealth and property as a result of the Drug War? whites</p>

<p>The Drug War is equally distributed among the masses, though whites have lost more inherent value over it. Blacks have spent more time in prison. I think both positions are equally detrimental, but I also think prison offers more alternatives and tools for adopting a different lifestyle than addiction does.

<p>Furthermore, who is selling white people these drugs? -- <strong>90% minorities</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>every ghetto in America would collapse within mere days if our illegal drug economy suddenly disappeared overnight. These communities should be more thankful this alternative economy exists than angry it does.</strong> Do you know how much rent heroin pays for in North Philly? Do you know how many diapers it buys, how many car leases it pays, how much literal food it puts on peoples tables? We&#39;re talking about a $100,000,000,000 economy. It&#39;s a necessary evil, and our government realizes that, that&#39;s why they bring the drugs in. If this conversation convinces you of anything, it should be of <strong>just how much you aren&#39;t a conspiracy theorist, and it should shine a light on just how out of place you are in this sub.</strong></p>

<p>I sold drugs for a living. I went to prison for it. <strong>The 6 years I spent in there, was the easiest thing I&#39;ve ever done</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all a symptom of the nature of ghettos in themselves. </p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who the largest majority of cocaine and heroin addicts in America are? whites</p>

<p>Do you know which group of people in America have lost the most wealth and property as a result of the Drug War? whites&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Whites are the majority; this is expected. </li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;The Drug War is equally distributed among the masses, though whites have lost more inherent value over it. Blacks have spent more time in prison. I think both positions are equally detrimental, but I also think prison offers more alternatives and tools for adopting a different lifestyle than addiction does. If you think whites don&#39;t go to jail for petty drug offenses, you&#39;re off your rocker. I did 6 months just for a misdemeanor amount of cannabis, and three years for delivery of cocaine.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spending more time in prison is objectively worse. And if we&#39;re talking about the loss of monetary gain for individuals, blacks still have it worse. Overall, whites in these situations lost more money because there are more of them. This is the wrong comparison to make. Fathers who cannot take care of their children cause far greater stress on future generations and prisoners are literally used as slaves. You are completely moronic for suggesting that prisons are good for prisoners. The absurd amount of mental gymnastics required to reach such a conclusion takes the cake. Ask the blacks what they think about your statement. I guarantee that they do not hold the same views as you do. 
&quot;Furthermore, who is selling white people these drugs? -- 90% minorities.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>90% minorities? Source required. And even if so, that is again expected. Gang members are predominantly non white; this is by design. They have lower job opportunities in the legal market, and thus turn to illegal markets to make a living. Moreover, gang culture is huge due to the absurd number of single mothers, caused by longer incarceration rates. Whites have options beyond joining a gang.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;Finally, every ghetto in America would collapse within mere days if our illegal drug economy suddenly disappeared overnight. These communities should be more thankful this alternative economy exists than angry it does. Do you know how much rent heroin pays for in North Philly? Do you know how many diapers it buys, how many car leases it pays, how much literal food it puts on peoples tables? We&#39;re talking about a $100,000,000,000 economy. It&#39;s a necessary evil, and our government realizes that, that&#39;s why they bring the drugs in. &quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>The ghettos should not exist in the first place. They are the cause of this problem, so stating that without the drugs, these people would suffer is correct. However, without the ghetto being enforced by systems in place, there would be no need for the drug economy. And what in the fuck? The government is doing a good thing by spreading drugs in the ghetto? You must be fucking retarded. All its done is destroy the family units in these circles, which is the foundation for solid growth for children. You think from your own warped and twisted view of the world. You benefited, but those around you certainly fucking didn&#39;t. The kids you sold the drugs to (indirectly or not): their lives are fucking ruined. </li>
</ol>

<p>Cunt. </p>

<p>This is why you are not a true conspiracy theorist. You look at things from your perspective, and do not have the capacity to look beyond that. Why were ghettos formed? What do ghettos entail? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, 9/11 <em>defined</em> terrorism.

<p>If this event is terrorism, what was 9/11? Life is inherently dangerous, look at the definition of utopianism:<strong>the belief in or pursuit of a state in which everything is perfect, typically regarded as unrealistic or idealistic.</strong></p>

<p>The idea that we can somehow prevent incidents like this from occurring is both &quot;unrealistic&quot; and &quot;idealistic&quot;.

That is precisely the sort nanny-state utopianism used to justify a never ending war that so far has cost 1) several trillion dollars, 2) at least a million lives, and 3) whatever was left of the fourth amendment.</p>

<p>Terrorism is a meaningless propaganda term.  When you try to limit it only to things that are big or brown enough, and think everyone who disagrees is an infantile communist, you&#39;re part of the problem.  Specifically, you&#39;re helping to justify the state propaganda that causes untold amounts of harm around the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 as definition of terrorism is a key foundation of the mainstream US position that only Muslims can commit acts of terrorism.  That&#39;s why its been used as justification for a forever war against Muslim countries.  Denying that obvious reality seems propagandistic to me.  </p>

<p>I could understand how 9/11 provided some unique and esoteric definition of terrorism to you that is somehow different than the 16 year dominant narrative around it, but as you didn&#39;t explain yourself I don&#39;t know what you mean beyond what you&#39;ve said.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to cite the dominant narrative don&#39;t throw such a hissy fit when people assume you believe the dominant narrative.</p>

<p>If terrorism applies to, I&#39;m assuming here, government false flag attacks, then would you think it applies to non-false flag government attacks?

    <div class="md"><p>Terrorism has been redefined many times, already. If you look at the older definitions, terrorism must be premeditated. My question is, why was it changed? When was it changed? In all likelihood, it was changed for political reasons. In all likelihood, it was changed to more easily target dissidents, and the new right.</p>

<p>The definitions of words like &#39;terrorism&#39; are purely for political reasons, and nothing more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-our-National-Security-Complex/dp/1782794441">The Paradox of our National Security Complex: How Secrecy and Security Diminish Our Liberty and Threaten Our Democratic Republic</a></p>

<p>There. That book lays out all of my concerns much better than a passing conversation ever could. If you <strong>truly</strong> want to understand my position, and the inherent dangers of labeling ordinary events as &#39;terrorism&#39;, you&#39;ll read it. Otherwise, you&#39;re just a mouthpiece for the establishment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saying I&#39;m a mouthpiece of the establishment because I haven&#39;t read a book you&#39;ve read is a bit silly.</p>

<p>I will tell you this. I majored in Intelligence and have spent hundreds of hours reading about terrorism and I&#39;ve read hundreds of definitions of it and how it&#39;s changed throughout the decades. They all say generally the same thing. However, terrorism didn&#39;t really become a &#39;crime&#39; until after 9/11 Before 9/11, terrorism was just when multiple crimes were committed and said crimes were done specifically to support a political agenda. No one was charged with terrorism. You may have had a political agenda when you did something, but you were charged with that crime. One might be labeled as a terrorist by society, but it wasn&#39;t a criminal charge. In the eyes of the law, a terrorist was just a murderer (or bank robber, or arsonist, etc), that was it. </p>

<p>Today, Terrorism is it&#39;s own crime. But, as far as I know, the last major change to the definition that we know of today occurred in 2004-ish, and there was no &quot;new right&quot; movement then. So the idea that the definition was changed and formed specifically to target the &#39;new right&#39; is nonsense. But it definitely was changed specifically to target those we deemed as a threat at the time, which would have been Islamic terrorists. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t truly want to understand your position or your values on anything. All I wanted to know is what you think the definition of terrorism should be. Terrorism is a fairly simple idea to define. Unless you want to go back to how it used to be. Terrorism wasn&#39;t a crime. Everyone was charged with murder, and terrorist was just a societal label. </p>
