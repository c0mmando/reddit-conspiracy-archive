       It's literally about to be the top post. It's so tiring to see so many people in different subs claim they will be downvoted to oblivion for being anti-Trump. Others claim that Trump supporters have "fully taken over this sub" or "This is T_D 2.0." No, it is not. There are a lot of different people in different subs. I've seen a lot of anti-Trump posts on the front page of this sub, many of which hit the top spot. That cannot happen in a sub dubbed "T_D 2.0." A large percentage of the pro-Trump posts contain top comments that are anti-Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do yourself a favor and use the search bar. Try keywords like 'Trump,' 'sessions,' 'Russia,' and so on. Maybe you simply haven't spent enough time here, so hopefully that will get you up to speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Complaining about a heavily-exaggerated state of this sub is not going to change anything. Just state your opinion and debunk pro-Trump shitposts. That's all you have to do. State your case effectively and honestly. You don't have to pretend that you will be downvoted while you accumulate upvotes. I have no idea why so many people in this sub and others believe something that is so obviously not true. It's one of the weirdest trends I have seen in a long time.

       If you spend enough time here, you will see highly-upvoted comments that say "I know I will be downvoted for this, but [insert anti-Trump statement]." You would think that the fact these comments were upvoted would trigger a realization that perhaps they aren't true, but I guess not. That's why I felt the need to point it out. If people aren't seeing it, then it needs to be pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a wide variety of viewpoints here, which is fine. It's a good thing, but the constant complaints of something that obviously isn't true does not help.

       Maybe sometimes your post makes it and sometimes it doesn't. That's just how Reddit works.

       I'm not defending unwarranted removals, but at least the mod actions are logged in the sidebar links. I'm discussing the community and trends, not the mods.

       I'm aware of both

       , and everyone else should be as well. The blame for shill accusations should rest on the groups who have decided to take up shilling as a propaganda technique. The paranoia of shills infiltrating online communities is caused by the shilling itself. We know it occurs, but the fine details are scarce, so there will obviously be an increase in the amount of shilling accusations as the amount of shilling increases. The one thing I will grant is that some of the mods don't seem to be taking the possibility of pro-Trump shilling as seriously as the opposite, but there is such a huge amount of anti-trump content here (particularly in the comments of political posts) that they will have barely made a dent in it.. if they were pushing a pro-Trump agenda.

       It's for the one where the OP questioned why it had been put into contest mode (the original post being the one about the FBI raid, that was put into contest mode about 5 hours in).  I forget which mod it was, and its hot the kind of stuff I bother screenshoting.

       The military guy just isn't the guy in the car though. It looks nothing like him and exactly like the guy they arrested.

       Members from these alt-right white nationalist groups attacked a peaceful counter-demonstrators the night before. That removed all pretense of being "peaceful" once these torch-wielding people assaulted others.

       so, what is the point of counter-protesting, again? Besides making most sane people hate you, it hasnt done shit. Maybe you should stick to virtue signalling ONLINE, where our boys in blue dont have to waste precious bullets on you.

       The KKK and white nationalists always have much larger counter-protester crowds (composed of many different people) because most sane people hate these groups.

       Of course it has. Case in point, the reaction to the murder of Heather Heyer by an alt-right white nationalist. Counter-protests typically shows that communities usually don't want white nationalists hanging around and barking their crap, which is why groups like the KKK are eventually chased out of town.

       Interestingly close, but no.  Conservatives is a lil broad-  neonazi or skinhead or kkk would suffice.  Because most of the vocal blm reps have all pretty much said the same thing, the main points they get across, when theyre coherent, are fuck whitey and fry cops like bacon.  So yeah, all of blm is associated with this shit just like all neonazis are stoked one of em 'finally did something'.

       This is a mindless deflection from the issues at hand. It's always "yeah but it's THEM trying to make you believe in the left/right paradigm to divide us" anytime the right does something horrible. The rest of the time it's "the left is terrible" all day everyday. You're part of the problem.

       You ever think that maybe the toxic ideals that drove the groups are why they lost? Like, had they not desired to remove rights from others, they would never have started the conflicts which resulted in their defeat. Maybe, just maybe, if they actually HAD something worth believing in they wouldn't have lost.

       The Antifag communists were the ones starting the violence.  If you watch the video, they were throwing things at the guy's car before he ran into the crowd.  What likely happened was that the Antifags were breaking his windows (eg, by throwing bricks, etc), and the driver panicked and accelerated to get away and accidentally hit those people.  Not intentionally.

       Someone hits his car he brought to a rally where most are on foot so he's justified to run people over because you think it's an accident. What a load of bullshit.

       You just said that it is a fact that people were throwing things at his car, and that is probably the reason for him driving into the crowd. You do not know where his car was, so how do you know that’s what they were throwing things at? Also, you provided no evidence of them actually throwing anything in any video.

      <p>
       The investigation is over, he was charged with murder. You act like there is some fantasy world where there is justification for reckless driving and vehicular manslaughter, do yourself a favor and pull your head out of your ass or wherever the fuck you managed to lodge it.

       Still waiting for a point in the video where they are throwing things towards where his car

       Get this bullshit out of here. The 'driver fearing for his life' angle is being spun to appease the conservative base. Those 'antifa communists' aka crisis actors who decide to randomly start beating on some dudes car during a peaceful protest? More disinfo to distract from the glaringly obvious evidence that the suspect in custody was not the one photographed driving the car.

       Doesn't matter anyways. Fearing for your life doesn't give you carte Blanche to do whatever you want. He could have immediately removed himself from
The situation by reversing as he did to get away and since he didn't, no matter what he felt, dude is liable for what he.

       The Antifa assembly was not a peaceful protest.  It was an attempt to unlawfully intimidate conservative opponents--lawfully gathered conservative opponents--into silence.  This was Antifa'so Berkley Method applied with deadly consequences.

       Two separate statements. By trying to shift any blame to antifa you are essentially defending the people at that rally, who were carrying nazi flags, chanting nazi slogans, and using the Hitler salute. How's that for evidence? The other part of my statement is that you're also defending someone who drove a car into a group of people. The evidence is that he drove a car into a group of people. However, it's probably safe to assume he is also a nazi.

       Pretty sure EVERYONE was against that bernie bro shooting at congressmen. No surprise to see your reaction and where it went. Show me where people defended the guy on this sub like you did.

       It's a valid question.

       Some right wing guy attacks a crowd of protestors and you say the right-media is trying to start a civil war.

       Some left wing guy tried to assassinate right wing politicians in Alexandria so does that mean the left-media is also trying to start a civil war?

       You literally did defend him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you state you think he is a "racist prick". It's not the same thing and both are different situations. One targeted a political figure, one is trying to run over fellow Americans during a heated protest. As it is well documented in American history, crazy left wingers shoot up political figures, while right wingers shoot up planned parenthood.

       I agree.

       Try to think of it like this, then. Taking out the king will most likely result in drastic changes. Taking out some peasants will piss off other peasants, and THEIR lords, but the chance of this changing things is minimal, beyond frightening the populace. Both are usually wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assassination can be terrorism, but fear is not the main goal, taking out opposing powers is. Most cases of Terrorism are more aimed at the populace. theres a much bigger psychological component to those kinds of attacks.  I do not condone killing your opponents. I don't even think they should be jailed, in most cases. But that's another subject.

       It's relevant to OPs question.
      </p>
      <p>
       If OP has said, this guy who drove into a crowd of protestors in VA is a bad guy and what he did was wrong, I would have agreed with him 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not what he said, he is trying to make everything about the right being wrong and I simply wanted to know if he applies the same reasoning to the left.  It's a perfectly valid question when considering the OP's post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you so worried about the same standards being applied to the left?

       I'm not at all, I'm just asking how the right-media is trying to start a civil war, when the left media isn't.  It's pretty obvious to everyone what my point is with exception to those who are perfectly okay with the left-media saying "take our country back by any means necessary!"
      </p>

       We obviously have idiots on both sides of the political rift doing stupid shit and trying to kill people.  It seems unimportant to you until someone on the right does it.

       It'seems exactly what happened.  I've seen all videos from all angles.  The driver was being attacked and drove blindly forward through the crowd to escape.  When he hit a car, the mob set upon his car from behind with baseball bats.  He backed them over.  One died.

       Most ppl here should be familiar with how it goes. Very odd event happens with a ton of weird coincidences and things that don't add up - an MSM created narrative is created that all the sheep can agree on and blast across the internet - the reaction to the event goes exactly to plan - then, just as everyone outside of subs like this begin to forget about the event (as something new and juicy will replace it) then the truth quietly comes out and all the people regurgitating the lines mere weeks ago simply don't even remember what happened enough with the original story to care that everything they were told was bullshit.

       They've been doing it for years and it never ceases to fail.

       The first amendment protects their right to have unfortunate and ridiculous opinions and the ability to voice them.

       It sure does. And it also gives the other side the right to protest their opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're talking about inciting violence. The pro-Trump cult rallies do this only for the violence and trying to get the other side to be violent for recruitment purposes. But... it seems one of the kekistanis deliberately tried to run the opposition to his little rally. He's been pictured before he got in his car to be a murderer.

       No, you just stated that rallying was violence. That's not the same as "inciting violence" which antifa is just as guilty of. Speech is not violence, but hitting someone over the head is.

Second guy in your post is a completely unrelated veteran who looks nothing like the guy in the car picture and who for some reason is being smeared as the perpetrator of a false flag just because he shares the same name.

       The leaders of blm didn't denounce this because blm has no leaders, that is the point. The guy who shot those cops wasn't even marching with them, he was hidden in a building and had written his manifesto on how he wanted to kill people.

       The right is always about guns, that's kinda their thing.

       But given Antifa's history of inciting violence dozens of times over the last year or so, I think it's reasonable to go prepared.

       This is the driver.  His name is James Field.  His political affiliation is unknown to me.  He is not the man they arrested.  The man the arrested is James Fields, and he appears to be some kind of neo nazi.  However, he is innocent of this particular crime.

       I think we should get out of all wars. I have no problem with Russia but I do have a slight problem if they are going to hack people's emails. I'd be against it if they hacked repub emails too. It sets a dangerous precedent. Someday a democrat may call China or Israel to hack right wing politicians.

       Not a fan of Israel, I think they are jewish white supremacists. I wonder why we go all out for Zioning that region which is the size of New Jersey.

       NK is a dictatorship. Their people are afraid of their government which is now a right wing fascist country.

       Of course they did, there's probably a 4chan archive of threads for the trump cult rally advertisements somewhere.

       You do realise that whatever this person's motives were for writing that, he is not wrong. White people aren't immigrating to coloured nations it's the other way around and they are vastly outnumbered. Think whatever you want of it, but his statement is arguable valid.

       Immigration is different from destroying history. Native Americans still have a rich history in spite of what the Europeans settlers did to them.

       Just so we don't misunderstand each other. I am talking about the fact that it can be safely argued, even though nothing like it is certain, that white people are diminishing if you look at demographic trends. The dispersal, demonisation of white history can be interpreted in many ways because his comment was so short, but since he references it to PC culture you can argue that that trend of SJWs and tumblr-like ways of thinking has infiltrated a lot of actors in society. Don't you think it is safe to say that they often show a tendency to want to "change", minimise or demonise western history and culture. Again, I am not an alt-righter I am just trying to bring some nuance because I'm tired of the tunnel visioned trench warfare from both sides.

       Do you realize how fucking stupid this sounds? Do pre-colonial civilizations not count because of their relative lack of technological advancement? The land wasn't uninhabited. It was settled by people, who formed cultures, and yes, nations. The Iroquois Confederacy in the Northeastern US, the Triple Alliance in Mexico... There was a wide and varied population that was conquered and exterminated by invading colonizers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus, this is fucking 18th century thinking. "They weren't civilized enough so there's no problem just taking the land." Should Americans stake a claim in Africa because they're "less civilized" today?

       Who's fault do you think that was? Could it possibly have been due to the centuries of exploitation by European colonizers and imperialists? Africa doesn't exist in a vacuum. It was just a couple decades ago that there was still apartheid in South Africa. You don't think Europeans contributed heavily to the currents state of African development?

       Justify? No. But I can explain it by pointing to the centuries of abuse by white landowners and elites against the African population there. Do you think there would be a "genocide," which I think we both know is exaggerating the violence, if Europeans didn't force them into slavery or a destitute lower class

       Actually I don't like his point for other reasons.  He is saying that removing confederate statues is destroying "white history".  This just isn't true at all.  Why is "white" history only brought up when discussing the confederacy?  There were plenty of whites fighting against the confederacy, and we all know who lost.  What about the massive immigration wave at ~1900 - all those people are white, and have zero to do with the confederacy.  Whose history are we talking about with "white" history?
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't erasing white history by removing these statues from public places, they are just choosing not to glorify traitors.

       Yeah I've always had a beef with this "white pride" stuff.  I mean - I'm from Italian immigrants.  We weren't even considered white for a big chunk of time in this country (I guess until browner and poorer people started coming in bigger waves).  So I've never understood their viewpoint and can't relate to it at all, even though I'm white.

       Its not exactly the "White Pride", stuff. Its the question, to why its acceptable for other groups to be proud of who they are, but the second a white person is proud to be white, you are a nazi and a racist. Meanwhile BLM groups can do this and its acceptable.

       You should not be on this forum. You are pushing a far left agenda. There is nothing wrong with being proud of who you are. Whether your white,brown,yellow or GREEN. This is insane, you are clearly part of the indoctrination of the new America were logic is throwing out and any point is racist. How is me saying, being proud of who you are is racist? With you're logic then BLM is racist then right?

       It's impossible to have this discussion if you keep making up shit.  I never said you couldn't be proud of being who you are.  I just pointed out that whenever I hear the term "white pride", its always some neo Nazi bullshit.  Or do you see those groups as the only way to express pride in your race?

       Actually I agree with this but this is the point am making. Just because I say am white and proud, does not mean am racist. Which for the record I don't. but why the double standard? How is this okay for same and not okay for others?  How can BLM march the streets but not a Alt-Right group? Which I personally believe them to be both racist. But this is the point am making. The Mob mentality the left has created is a fascist movement. The mob always believe they are doing right but we knew threw history there not.

       The point of BLM is that they think blacks are being treated unfairly in the justice system.  They do not say that blacks are better than whites, or that whites should be purged from the country.  Alt right groups are white nationalists and neo-Nazis.  It isn't just about being proud of their heritage - these are white supremacist organizations.  It's like talking to a wall that you can't see the difference.

       Because being proud of being white doesn't mean anything other than being proud of an accident of genetics.  There's no "white" culture to be proud of.  I mean, seriously, do you think you have anything in common with a Russian farmer?  Or a Norwegian fisherman?  How about a vintner in France?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody gives a shit if you're proud of your cultural heritage, but when you start talking about being proud of being white, you might as well be proud of an early receding hairline.

       What? Okay answer me this one question. Is Black Lives Matter racist then? How is there no white culture to proud off? Tell me who created this platform we are talking on now? I do have this in common with the Russian farmer and the Norwegian fisherman? This whole thing of hating white people is displaced anger towards the system that has been fair. This is a mis-directed attack lately. Am tired of everyone crying victim, if you live in America you have not been oppressed, overall take a look at the world, you tell me Amercia is not fair? This whole ideology you have is racist, famous quote of WW2 "The fascist of the future well be the anit-facist."  Again people who give in to this ideology you have that white people are evil, are giving into the bully. You created Donald Trump.

       Try this then. White pride is not white supremacy. It is the same a black pride or gay pride of woman's day marches or Cuban pride marches. None of them are about being supremacist to anyone. They are about being proud of who and what you are instead of letting media and college snowflake-babies dictate to you what you should feel ashamed of? If everyone else is allowed to feel pride for their race or culture then so are white people. And white culture and history is more than just one statue.

       But none of white American culture? When you do that it is called an Alt-right Nazi March. Some idiots wearing Nazi garb does not mean the thousands of other who were dressed normally are Nazis or KKK. How about this then, if the only way leftists SJW's can be proud of their shit is to dress up in black balaclavas and scarfs to hide their chickenshit identities and then run through the streets causing massive public destruction and violence then all leftist cunts can fuck off? Or is it wrong to lump  thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people  in with a small group of abusive retards? What is shameful is this:

       You said White American culture. That is the only day White people can celebrate their culture but they have to share it with all the other American races. They don't get their own thing the way everyone else does and when they try for it they are labelled as Nazis and racists.

       I'm trying to figure out what you want.  You don't like the 4th of July because you have to share it with other races.  So give me what you want to be able to do to celebrate white American heritage.

       I never said I don't like the 4th of July. I simply answered your question. i Just told you how the American heritage is celebrated. You have made some wild assumptions here. Everyone else gets their own day to celebrate their race and culture
       <strong>
        <em>
         AS WELL AS
        </em>
       </strong>
       the 4th of July. White Americans only get the 4th of July. Anytime they celebrate their race and white American culture they are called Nazis. And to show you how much you work on un-grounded assumptions, I am Australian. I couldn't give a shit about American or European culture or race. Australia has its own cultural and racial issues to deal with. White people are the only people who are racist by default simply because  of their skin colour and they are the only race that is not allowed to take pride in themselves for it. And their superior culture. Yes, Anglo-Saxon 1st world culture is better than anything else in existence. It is far from perfect. Easy to poke holes in and criticise, but everything else deserves
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       criticism. Now stop making assumptions and read the words on your screen, not the words stomping through your mind that are telling you what you
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       I mean. I say what i mean. My words don't require your interpretation.

       What celebrations of the white race and American culture were called racist?  I'm trying to make you be specific because you are claiming a lot of baseless things.  I keep hearing this trope where "white people are called racist because they are white" which is simply not true.  Maybe some shitty people on twitter say shit like that, but it isn't the majority opinion, nor is it acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this to do in this thread started with removing a confederate statue, and claiming that is erasing "white" history.  I'm a white American - the confederacy has nothing to do with me.  My family didn't even come here until like 1910.  My family is typical Italian American out of NYC metro area.  All our celebrations revolve around that.  That doesn't represent "white" America to you though.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, what type of celebration would make you happy?  Because white people in America
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       share the same heritage.  Concocting some sort of celebration that is completely focused on the fact that we share a certain skin color?

       Right, because they are all 160 years old. None of them were fucking slaves. And that is one hell of an assumption about the millions of black people in thew US. Who are you to say what millions of people you have never met know and don't know about the history of their

       I do understand it, very well in fact. That is why I am calling it puerile nonsense.
It is not their anything. Their skin colour does not give them a right to appropriate the suffering of distant ancestors, many of whom are part white. Lets not try to pretend that every black American is straight off the boat from Africa
       <em>
        black
       </em>
       . Most now have at least 12.5% Caucasoid genes and many have 25 to 50 or much more%. If you want heritage then theirs is also white heritage, but none of that matters because nothing bad happened to them because of white people. Anything bad going on in their lives now is their own fault. There are plenty of white trash people living in poverty and have a hard time of it. It is not a race thing, it is a poverty thing. Poverty is the great equaliser. All this is, is a bunch of people claiming that they deserve pity for shit that happened to other people generations ago. It is not more than that.
       <br/>
       The white people of today did nothing to them. Nor did white people of today do anything to their ancestors. White people are even some of their ancestors.

       . this is not about celebrating heritage, it is about whining about their heritage as though it happened to them and not other people. Celebrate anything you want but yo have no right to reparations or special treatment for having the same skin colour as some people who had it hard in the distant past because they also had dark skin. And they don't have the right to call me a racist for being white just because they are black. White people owe black people nothing. That is all I am saying to them. I am not contradicting myself, you are once again making up assumptions in your own mind rather than actually reading what is written on the screen, and then arguing your inventions as though they are something I said. Stop being a fucking idiot for once, please!

       My point was that they both represent history.  American history is peppered with terrible acts, and removing the evidence of those acts will not erase the history.  The only purpose it can possibly serve is to remove it from the public conscience, which will inevitably lead to a repeat of history.  We need to immortalize our failures every bit as much as our successes so that we cannot ignore them and do not repeat them.

       They aren't erasing it, all the statues are being placed in museums.  The cities that are removing these sculptures are just removing them from public parks.  We can remember the civil war with monuments to Lincoln, civil rights with Martin Luther King.

       I have an idea!  If we ant to influence civil discourse, all you have to do to make pariahs of your competition is equate them with evil.  Let's call everything literally Hitler!

       No you equated my argument (and the civil war) to Nazis and Hitler.  You probably see Hitler around every ideological corner, and that is the problem.  You equate anyone who does not share your opinion with the most evil thing you can imagine.  It is a deceptively Naziesque style of thinking, actually.

       Don't play dumb, you know exactly what I meant. I pointed out a flaw in your argument - that if we don't have statues in public spaces of unsavory historical figures we are bound to repeat past mistakes.  Germany does not approach it this way, and they haven't had a problem with a rise in neo-Nazis because they don't have Hitler statues.  I did not compare anyone to Hitler.

       YOu must be barely literature because the US Civil War is one of the most written about conflicts in history. Why the hell should any city have statues of defeated foes hanging around? Keep them in battlefields, keep then in museums, but they have no fucking business on public AMERICAN soil.

       Fuck you. I bet you'd love a 2nd American civil war. Erasing our history is not okay. Just because their side lost doesn't make the men who fought on that side any less important, or any more "evil" or something. Every person involved in the civil war was an American.

       It isn't erasing history. Have you ever actually visited a civil war memorial or battlefield? Because there aremany of them around with statues.
       <a href="http://gettysburg.stonesentinels.com/confederate-monuments/confederate-state-monuments/virginia/">
        For example, here is some information on Lee's statue at Gettysburg.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statues belong in the places where these men toiled: on the battlefield.

       I don't think that is the case, but glorifyng a nation that lost against the USA only emboldens neo-Confederates, historical revisionism, or those who would want to contunue the "Lost Cause."

        Ever read Confederates in the Attic

       ? It's a very good read that touches upon these issues, which are still problematic today as we saw from Charlottesville, VA.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I grew up south of the Mason-Dixon line, my father is from the South, and we had ancestors that fought on both sides during the war, so I am not just some Damn Yankee trying to oppress Southerners. I love the South in many ways -- its food, music, and climate, for example -- but that doesn't mean I support people waving the Confederate flag all over the place.

       That is true, but Southerners attacked the US and seceded from it because they had a different vision of America while the rest of America was free soil. It's a key issue.

       Yes it was, in what sense is my text against what you just wrote?
I am talking about what is arguably happening in modern times. I am personally not convinced in any direction really, I am just pointing out that what the donald person wrote can be quite confidently argued.
Your analogy is not the greatest either. What happened to the native americans? Didn't go so well for them in the end.

       Yes. However, if you dig deeply on the history of America there are two factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of them wanted to get along with the American Indians, and opposed slavery. The other one, largely led by the British aristocracy, wanted to slaughter the Indians and supported slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, most people aren't aware that slavery was forcefully imposed against the colonists' will by John Locke. And that most of the founders, like Washington, Franklin, and Hamilton, wanted to abolish slavery at the founding, but were opposed by traitors loyal to the British aristocracy.

       Patently retarded m8. What was the name of the country they came too? What was in their bill of rights? There's was no nation before America you mongoloid. Indians didn't own shit. They were nomadic tribes constantly at war with each other and chased the ass end of a buffalo when they got hungry. They weren't some unified society or vast civilization and they had no country. Whites created America, learn some history moron.

       Clearly their countries were shitholes before they "plundered" rich PoC countries. That's why it was so easy. Use your brain.

       Oh yeah remember what a shit hole China was, the oldest civilisation on the planet, before the British came around and pumped it full of opium? And clearly South America and North Americans was much worse than the genocide and enslavement the Europeans brought with them.

       Please show me which white people plundered these other countries, I may be wrong but i think you'll find that they are all dead and that their descendants are all rich fucks who own lots of things. 
As a white person i feel resentment for the guilt that i'm supposed to carry for the colour of my skin because of what others did. If you want to help us get rid of these rich aristocrats and bureaucrats to get that money back and redistribute it fairly then i'm all for that. My opinion is that when people talk about white supremacy they actually mean rich elite supremacy. I'm pretty sure that my ancestors farmed sheep and i'll be very lucky if one day i can own a house. Don't equate the actions of a few to all.

       What's there to expand on? That predominantely white countries are seeing a greater demographic shift from being white than non-white countries are from being non-white. Since white countries are usually far more well off, they don't have the same incentive to move away from a more comfortable setup. The guy made a statement and he wasn't wrong factually.

       I would say that this quote this whole discussion is about is quite ambigous so its hard to say what was meant exactly. I would agree with you though that saying white and confederate history is the same is very off.

       However, the subjugation of white history and pride in culture is uite obviously promoted by parts of the PC,culture marxists.

       Lest we forget the hundreds of years of colonization by various countries and people, one event which might have spawned something called the United States of America, i cant really remember. Or do you mean hes correct if we focus on the last 70 or so years of human history and ignore the rest?

So glad this got stickied.
And to those of you who don't like the Alt-Right well guess what. The left is going to call us (like they've always been) Racist, Homophobic, Antisemetic, Uncle Tom, Alt-Righters anyway might as well War it. I mean what happened we wore the term Deplorable like a badge of honor.

       It's probably the only good thing out of this. Watching them trying to paint it as a false flag or paid protest...that they themselves helped organize and promote. Hilarious if it weren't so disheartening.

       What's the point of bringing that up? All you're doing is trying to blame everyone in this sub for the actions of a few random people on the internet who happened to post something to this sub. Nobody in this sub promoted the nazi car crash. They promoted a stupid rally, that's it. There is no blood on my hands because I am an individual who is not associated with dummies who wanted to promote a rally.

       You are missing both points. Random people on the internet can post pretty much whatever they want anywhere they want any time they want. This is not some huge revelation that we just realized today. Those individuals specifically are the only ones who are to blame for their role in the promotion of a rally. Their blame for the car crash is a separate discussion and arguably the two have nothing to do with one another. The person who drove that car is the only person who is to blame for that crash. It's a wingnut who was too involved in his delusional ideology that he became violent.

       This has nothing to do with the subreddit

        /r/conspiracy

       as a whole. All users who were not involved in the promotion of that rally are a separate population from the ones who did promote it.

       A good question would be are there any users there who were at the rally who can speak on how the events unfolded. Just because it was promoted as a real event doesn't mean that parts of it were not staged for good television.

       I guess I did, but you know that with these race riots and violent protests it's usually a large percentage of people who are curious or just there to show solidarity and a smaller faction of agents provocateurs who are there to foment chaos and stage made-for-television scenes of violence.

       It has nothing to do with how reasonable they are.

       Ah yes, they're all paid actors...I wonder how they get hired? Do they have auditions? Do they sign non-disclosure agreements? If only a former actor would come clean anonymously, it wouldn't be pretty easy with a throwaway. Maybe one day!

       Yea lets ignore the photo of seal team alpha doing a calm as fuck reverse burnout looking nothing like our chubby faced suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the .9 miles he made it before being apprehended by two blacked out suburbans, one of which can be seen parked a few blocks behind the crowd as he reverses straight towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore the weird as hell interview with the mom, the suspect's scant online footprint, and the fact that the few photos that he did post show him posing next to his car like its his pride and joy (he was just itching to destroy it into a group of people, wasn't he?)

       Go ahead now and call me some sort of name, preferably one that identifies my political stance, it's about time for that right?  I voted for Obama twice, I fully support LGBT rights. I believe that the only opinion on abortion a woman should be concerned about is that of her medical professional. Yet somehow I get called an alt-right neo Nazi everytime I try to contribute decent conversation about conspiracies in a conspiracy subreddit...

       His mom just got told that her son ran people over in his car, if she didn't act weird that would be suspect. The FBI and police were there in advance which explains blacked out Suburbans. So your proof he is a false flag is someone caught him?

       that "enhanced" version looks like a fucking joke for real. also, interestingly the actual car has racing stripes and the one where he is leaning on it does not. i dont think those are the same vehicles, but that doesnt mean it isnt him because the picture of him leaning on the car is clearly years old.

       Obviously there are people who genuinely want to investigate, but there are also a lot of people who really want to believe that this was a false flag because there's no way to spin a guy deliberately running people over.

       The road was closed, there was a protest that day, he attended it and knew. Why go forward if attacked, you are in a giant 2 ton steel cage, just turn around. Self defense is a de escalation, not do whatever you want if maybe threatened.

       Self defense is never an escalation, how on Earth are you gonna spin a bat attack into murder by car as a defense. The road wasn't blocked by people, that's why when he sped down it to murder people he hit a car and was stopped. You can't murder people who block a road, if you can get ready for a lot of Nazis to get plowed over at their next rally.

        Went to a gas station in the hood. A didndu was whining about something, hard to understand with all the jigabooing. When he finally left the clerk, some Apu looking motherfucker, was clearly exasperated. I said "niggers right?" he said "the only good thing about India is there was no niggers". We chatted for a while and have been friendly ever since. It's simply universal, everyone hates niggers.

       The difference is that one of those things has actually happened (sort of, I'm not aware of any indication on whether the victims were associated with Antifa or not), and the other hasn't.  Nobody's saying that the attack in Virginia means that identical attacks on racists are now justified.  So fuck off with the false equivalencies.

What is the point you're making, I'm not racist, but people who are glad they aren't racist are just as bad as racist, you're not even making a point your just making poor deflections because you have no point but are being argumentative for the sake of fuck non racists.

       If a white person says the word nigger, they are called a racist.

       Calling for violence in the name of anti racism is self righteous. Everyone is anti racism; thinking you are special because of it is having an inflated ego.  Being anti racism is not virtue signaling. If you are being called out for virtue signaling it is not simply because you are anti racism.

       Divide and conquer is what TPTB do regardless of whether it's black, white, good or bad, or whatever else.  It's about decimating a group so no one gets too much influence.  Some groups, of course, are GOOD to decimate and break apart.  Many others aren't, however.

       It sure is strange how whenever right wingers hold rallies there's little to no violence, yet when leftists show up there's always violence. "Armed to the teeth" patently false. Shields and sticks are not "armed to the teeth". There's a a black dude with a bow and arrow and another black guy who made a mini-flamethrower with a hairspray bottle, why not mention them?

       Those are Oathkeepers, the Alt-Right cant stand them, they call them Oathcucks, Boomer Antifa, Oathfags. They invited themselves. The rally organisers were explicit in telling attendees not to bring weapons, especially guns.

       Because no one wants to mess with the guys who are likely caring at least one gun, if not more. A lot of right wing protests have a good amount of people who are carrying rifles in plain veiw so the right wing protests s e fairly safe as the left know that if they pull something, and try to start a fight they will die.

       That's because they aren't real Nazi's and the Nazi flags are about being an edgelord with the philosophy behind the flag.

       BTW you don't think people going to a rally wouldn't buy some new flags? No, it has to be weathered because they flew it outside next to their American flag... okayyyyyy.

       That's not who's in the alt right. Nazis have changed a lot since your day. Klan and NSM are dinosaurs being replaced by identitarians and others. Look at richard spencer for an idea of what I'm talking about. An alt right protest looks more like a frat party than an old school nazi rally.

       This is what I was thinking.  These guys look like nerds, no offense, not nazis.  When I was younger I used to go to a lot of punk/metal shows in Minneapolis and every now and then there would be some nazis there and these guys looked totally different.   Just my .02

       Well you didn't say anything bigoted so no prob on that one. I've been a part of grassroots political movements for nearly two decades now and I can certify that a brand new generation very well is upon us. Everything is different and the left in particular is still plugging away at its old tactics hoping they'll start working again.

       You haven't really been paying attention have you?  Steve Bannon started recruiting young, white male gamers on the internet years ago. He saw a group of disenfranchised youth that he could prey on with his hateful ideology.

       Did that shooter belong to an organized rally of people talking about "taking the country back"?  Or was he legit a lone wolf who did something terrible?

       It's apples and oranges and the left came out very much against the shooter. Bernie came out and said he was against violence and demonized him.

       Trump blamed both sides and didn't even demonize the guy who drove his car into a group of people.

       Holy cow.  Show me one time Bernie stood on stage and tried to incite violence?  Just fucking one.  Trump did it multiple times and this is his crowd.  There was violence because they preach it.  You can try and point the finger elsewhere but when you're rhetoric is full of hate this is what happens.

       They weren't marching so all people are treated equal.  So everyone has a chance a better life.  That's what the "evil left" wants.

       Only one of those is talking about actual violence against others.  The rest of them are harkening back to the civil right protests.  When people were bloodied in the streets for saying enough is enough.  They weren't the ones doing the bloodying but the ones bloodied.
      </p>

       Or are you saying the alt-right protests are like the civil rights protests?  That taking down a statue of a traitor to our country is the same as not having equal rights of every other citizen?

       And those kids should have done LSD like everyone from the '00s and before, or shrooms. Something to break into adulthood, like many cultures in the world do, although I find the people of Ghana (or Gabon) ballsy as hell to do Ibogaine as an adulthood transcending experience.

       Problem is that millenials, which at first meant people like me, those who graduated in 2000, who many had their lives ruined by 9/11 and the post 9/11 insanity in a way...I mean, I kept going on but it felt like...it felt like 50 times worse inside as when all that PG evidence started to make some sense.

       It's a stretch, but those 20+ gaming sites all with the same new article on the same day calling gamers dead and such. That was done because some reviewer's girlfriends were offended and they all knew each other in a big circle jerk. It's kind of a first shot that something wicked was afoot.

       I love this "well their flags were brand new so it's fake" nonsense.

       Do you
       <em>

       think it's more likely that (((GEORGE666SOROS))) bought flags for everyone, bussed people from all over, and brainwashed/leveraged someone to mow down those people as opposed to, oh I don't know, maybe young impressionable people buying a new flag of their own for a rally like this? White supremacist numbers are surging and it's in part due to denial like this.

       Nazis don't always look like what you think they look like. That's the thing about ideologies: All you have to do is believe it and you're a member.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people you're skeptical of are probably those who secretly believe it and are afraid of the repercussions of being open about it. If they look "soft", then it's only because they believe in white nationalism/supremacy after feeling persecuted, and the only thing that makes them feel empowered is the fact that they're white.

       So they're not nazis.

       And it's just a label you slapped on them which means '

       Seriously, you're 100% correct. This resurgence of Nazi supporters are a whole new breed compared to the classic "neo-nazis." Nazis in America throughout the past few decades have resembled and functioned as gangs for the most part, much different than a political movement. These new nazis are different, they're well spoken, well dressed, and have poltical ideas that extend beyond "white is right." This is the first step towards normalization. The nazis arent scary gang members who sell drugs and wear punk outfits anymore. They could be your neighbor, your co-worker, and even in your family.

       That's because that's thankfully the pathetic state that nazi scum have become. These are angry but very misled people who think that behaving like this is something to be proud of, driven by bullshit they read on breitbart and other cess pits tricking them into thinking they are news. It's very sad.

       Hey guy, this post is now 65% upvoted. Not quite Pizzagate numbers, but still solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem here is that the car attack is only a conspiracy if it's not what it seems on its face, but yeah, it was just an angry young man who was obsessed with Hitler in school who wanted to kill some liberals and due to the internet and right-wing news felt justified in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it funnier that for the past year the biggest conspiracy in American history has been playing out in front of us -- electing a Russian puppet/reality TV star/blithering idiot President -- and that gets seriously downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit's going to get much worse before it gets better, I fear.

       I honestly can't believe it, but probably going to get accused of being brigaded now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe it's going to get worse. We're lucky an actual bloody battle didn't break out with both sides bringing guns. I feel like this may get worse at the next rally. All someone has to do is pay a murderer to bring a gun and shoot at trump cultists to really start something now.

       People who were just serving free breakfast for their fellow black children were led to armed resistance because the cops would arrest them for feeding kids. Drumpsters right now will go in hiding for a while, appear on MSNDC and others to say that they denounce what happenned and etc. while they fully know Trump removed what was the FBI's #1 in the list of domestic terrorists, Christian Identity/White Nationalist movement(s). The Church of Jesus Christ Christian (yeah they thought they had to add Christian after Jesus Christ) is one group that needs looking at, they want a race war since the 50's.

       The establishment are trying to deflect as hard as possible, the MSM are pushing it for views, but the evidence is there if you go looking. Mueller wouldn't go to the Grand Jury if he wasn't sure he could get an indictment. Something doesn't stop being a conspiracy because it gets out on the news.

       still, very easy to find someone willing to say something like that, especially with this toxic political climate. Were he and the boy close? How did he know he held such openly hateful philosophies, and shouldn't we see a lot of this from people in his life then?

       Is that an argument? Yes, we all did learn about WW2 in school. But his history teacher said publicly: "He was very infatuated with the Nazis, with Adolf Hitler,” and that he had "radical ideas on race.” That isn't normal and is valid evidence speaking to motive.

        Went to a gas station in the hood. A didndu was whining about something, hard to understand with all the jigabooing. When he finally left the clerk, some Apu looking motherfucker, was clearly exasperated. I said "niggers right?" he said "the only good thing about India is there was no niggers". We chatted for a while and have been friendly ever since. It's simply universal, everyone hates niggers.

       We don't know the motivations of the driver yet.  If it was murder, he should be punished.

       If he was surrounded by violent Antifa thugs and panicked to escape, then Antifa thugs are to blame.  I'm far more willing to bet on the latter being the case.

       To quote you, bullshit.

       There is no video (that I have seen - and I think I've seen them all) of what instigated this at all.  No one knows what was happening further down the street.

       But what we do see is black masked thugs - either Black Block or Antifa - quickly come at the car from behind.

       Had they been attacking his vehicle down the road?  Given their violent nature, I wouldn't doubt it at all.  The fact is, we don't know.

       The protests were happening down the street where incident happened.  The other end of street looked empty and if he was so scared foe his life, he wouldn't have backed out and reverse in the same direction where he came from.

       Was the driver terrified when he floored it into the back of the crowd and the car in front of him or was it when he reversed over the people he just tried to run over? Or are we thinking he was terrified in both instances?

       Have you watched the video?  His car was surrounded by black masked Antifa thugs with bats.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is - who started it.  If they did, I don't have any sympathy for them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa isn't entitled to threatened drivers without consequence.  They don't get special rights detain and assault just because they're the left's darlings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if the driver just saw Antifa thugs and thought "Time to roll over some Antifa for fun!" then he committed murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Motive matters.

       Yeah I've watched multiple videos. Again, was he terrified as he literally sped down the road and slammed through the crowd originally? Especially since he came from a basically empty road. Or was it when he decided to reverse over the pissed off people who just watched him throw tens of people through the air with his car?

       All we know is that he hit the crowd and was immediately surrounded by masked men with weapons and quickly backed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We still do not know the motivation for driving, or fleeing in that direction to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It clearly was not a planned attack or prosecutors would be charging him with 1st degree murder.  In cases like this you tend to see over charging, not under charging.  That suggests to me they think they can only prove 2nd degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since that is likely to be an over charge, I think they're likely worried they can't even prove that - but a simple manslaughter charge would have caused public outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is any evidence this car was attacked first and he was fleeing, all a defense attorney has to do is show the vast troves of documented video evidence of Antifa and Black Block being violent and convince a single juror that this man was in fear of his safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can even point to photos of the brake lights being on and argue that he tried to stop when he saw he was fleeing into a crowd but that it was too late.  Armed men then show up and surround the car so he backs out and flees another direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really easy for Reddit to delcare a case open and shut before a trial has started.  And then they're inevitably outraged when the verdict isn't what they expected.

       Can, can we wait like a couple more days or something? This is a conspiracy sub. Seems a little premature, no? Usually you take some time to gather the info and follow some leads.

       The right certainly does have some of the 'Civil War' rhetoric, I'll give you that. The rhetoric sounds a little different on the left, but the results are the same. Dead citizens, dead politicians, dead policeman...Both sides knowing and unknowingly provoke the most volatile

       Perhaps the reason your posts are never seen is due to the fact that they rubbish.  You provide HUGE claims, and offer no evidence (outside of anecdotal storytimes).  If you truly believe in this conspiracy, then work towards proving it.

       Yeah, they want a divided citizenry, it benefits the establishment. But guess what? The establishment is on both "sides", and the divisiveness is coming from both sides. The fact you choose not to see this and are here saying, "pay attention to
       <em>

       What is there to say that others already haven't, right and left wing media and activists are both furthering divides in this country and hinting or gearing to civil war. A juxtaposition to what you suggest, would be the incessant branding of Trump by the massmedia and left alt media as the new Hitler, which I would argue is scary, very cheap, unnuanced and for some reason a narrative uniformely adopted across the opposition. It also sort of legitimises his and his followers' disposal, even though most  people are smart enough to have more nuance than that, it is a very dangerous escalation of the narrative that splits the country, waters down actual Hitler/dictator comparisons and distracts from actual constructive debate of relevant issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you only put your energy on the right wing you are missing the actual story.

       Im aware not everyone on "the left" is like that. I dont think youre aware not everyone on "the right" is Nazis. The point is that right wing media pushes nationalistic bullshit for the purpose of radicalizing people just as left wing media
       <a href="https://medium.com/@Zoobahtov/americas-rampant-anti-white-racism-needs-to-stop-e5e61ef54fa0">

       Also, I love how you completely avoided discussing my point, which is that TPTB control both "sides" and that they are pushing civil unrest from
       <em>
        both sides

       You know Trump had white nationalist groups removed from the domestic terrorist list? A cursory search engine search will tell you the date when he exactly did that, which is about 1 month 1/2 ago.

       I was wondering when the brigade was going to areive to change the narrative and make it about T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how all discussion of a conspiracy on
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       conspiracy sub is now gone and replaced with bashing this sub, bashing the users, T_D spam and Trump/Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also notice how all posts going against the narrative are downvote brigaded to the bottom, which usually only happens in these types of posts.

       You are clearly a left wing shill.  You are using an event which is clearly not motivated by "right wing ideology" but rather by fear and panic to push your agenda that the right wing "nazis" are trying to goad the left into starting a civil war.  Frankly, it's pathetic and so are you.

       Fwiw, some of us td folks are unsure whether Soros played us by setting up the rally, enticing is too promote it, maybe even honeypotted some of us into doing ourselves by attending, etc. We are aware that globalist bankers are the real enemy, not Antifa per se. The hard part, for most of us, is how to fight against them effectively. Apparently going to a rally isn't it (as you and I probably could have predicted!)

       This is not clear at all and if anyone is pushing an agenda, it's you making these claims in order to defend a neo-nazi who killed a person and sent 19 others to a hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are dozens of videos showing his car speed up in order to ram into the crowd of people.
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       are pushing the agenda that it was in self-defense, despite the facts saying otherwise.

       Why didn't he hit people all the way down the street. He clearly had opportunities. And I'm pretty sure he could've went faster. Not defending him I'm just saying if he was trying to kill people, then he wasn't very good at it.

       If you watch the video you can see him speed through an empty section of street into the back of an unwitting crowd of people. It was an intentional attack.

       Any partisan cheering/attacks are removed. Granted, we don't cover any of the more esoteric conspiracies that you might find here, and haven't covered this recent event as a conspiracy, but between some of the recent language coming from the NRA and other far right outlets and T_D deleting posts with 5000+ upvotes advertising the unite the right, I do think that discussion of the event would be a good fit if anyone would like to post about it.

       Making this a partisan issue is exactly what they WANT you to do. It is not a matter of left and right. The deep state is pushing not for civil war, but for global war and they control both parties. Left vs right is just a puppet show.

       Liberals sure are excited that a white bot has committed and act of terrorism. They don't get worked up about radical Muslims chopping off heads, blowing shit up, etc. But a white boy drives his car into a crowd, and they're losing their shit. They can barely contain themselves. Why don't they get that worked up over radical islamic terrorism?

       A big time Trump supporter who got promoted out of my division before the election returned to my campus on Friday. I thought he might be disillusioned by Trump's poor performance as president.  He is disillusioned alright...with the whole country! If trump is impeached, he whispered to me, he and his friends will kill the liberals responsible. When I pointed out I am one of those liberals calling for impeachment he told me I may already be on a list.

       I remember when conservatives were talking about secession and civil war over ObamaCare, of all things. So, yes, the right has been pushing for a civil war for quite some time, partially because many of them are neo-Confederates. It's why they hate the US federal system so much. It's why red states are, in all essence, the states of the Confederacy.

       Maybe if the entire entertainment establishment hadn't been dragging us to civil war for the last 2 years things would be different. The media has attempted to pigeon hole America into war with Russia, N. Korea and now itself, all in Trumps first term. Nancy pelosi, loretta lynch, chuck schumer, al franken and many more all call for civil war and attacks againt trump supporters, and you want to blame the Trump supporters? Hmm very interesting.

       This post right here is bullshit propaganda, just like half the posts on the front page today.  The facts are coming out.  Stop using this incident to push agendas.  His car was hit by protesters with bats, he panicked, he went forward, he hit the car in front of him, his car was
       <em>
        rushed
       </em>
       from the back, and he backed up to leave the scene.  Per police reports, there was no malicious intent.

       The protest was due to a statue that doesn't seem bad to white people but it invokes a lot of hostility.  It is propaganda of the right.  Fox news is far worse than CNN would ever be.  I hate both channels.  If your argument on CNN is valid but they don't like it, you will have technical difficulties or a commercial.  Fox News will place music or something entertaining like puppies so that they build up their viewers and then bam, propaganda for Republicans.  Both are not as credible as they used to be but Fox News is in every restaurant, gym, etc and have to see glimpses of them.  CNN not so much.

       Yup thats why you see right wing activists like ben shapiro, milo, and anne coulter trying to speak in berkeley. They arent trying to have a conversation they are going to the heart of liberalism and slapping them in the face. They point fingers at how violent they get when provoked and its all about inciting violence.

       This is a good point that gets lost in the noise. There was a contract flying around from one of Milo's speeches a few months back showing he was under contract with Glittering Steel LLC, which is owned by Robert Mercer - the billionaire Trump supporter and benefactor/co-owner of Breitbart.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9a7nq3/milo-yiannopoulos-college-speaking-tour">
         So who funds this endeavor? Who pays for a team of young men to travel the country in a tour bus? The answer resides in the organization behind the tour. Glittering Steel, LLC is a small production company located at the same address in Beverly Hills as Breitbart News and a number of other companies owned and supported by Trump-supporting Hedge funder Robert Mercer.

        <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9a7nq3/milo-yiannopoulos-college-speaking-tour">
         Glittering Steel reportedly made a few small campaign ads for the Trump and Cruz campaigns and has received $950,090 from the super PAC "Make America Number 1," according to FEC filings compiled by reporter Grant Stern. "Make America Number 1," which employed both Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway at various points during the election cycle, received $15 million of Robert Mercer's disclosed $22 million made in donations during the 2015-2016 primaries and election. Mercer also invested $10 million in Breitbart News, Yiannopoulos's former employer

       Your putting words in my mouth. Anyone has the right to protest, and anyone else has the right to counter that protest with a protest of their own. The events of these protests show the amount of resistance that is present and to be expected against alt right and white nationalism in general.

       Couple of things: The challenger that drove into the crowd was not the same car owned by the that deus vult LARPer. His car had a different paint job with racing stripes and had factory tint. The tint on the attack vehicle has a VLT percentage much lower than what state law permits, so dark that you can’t even see a silhouette of a driver. Here is a link on Ohio window tint laws:
       <a href="http://www.tintcenter.com/laws/OH/">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The one good shot of the driver through the windshield shows the chiseled face of a obvious ex-military type, not the weak jaw of that alt-right half jew. When bodies went flying and his car was getting beaten with bats he would have sharted his pants, not rip down 3 blocks in reverse in order to get a safe spot.

       Don't blame the Right or the Left. They are both being played. Its classic divide and conquer. Elitist are feeding both sides of the team. They keep pushing them untill, one side "cracks", so to speak. Then all  out war, and before you know it big brother comes in and we lose some more rights. One step closer for the elitist to strip are rights, and to fatten there pockets.

       Well, I'm a leftist and I'm not triggered by a Nazi flag. In fact I know some leftists who use the old Soviet Union flag with the hammer and sickle as the same kind of thing, to trigger the other side.

       Others though really find it offensive and want to fight or punch whoever shows whatever flag.

       There's a lot of people truly happy about the violence happening and how everything is proceeding.

       There were literally Nazi flags on American soil in the open. It's just funny to see right wing media because that's all I read. Nazi flags don't disrespect the American troops but black men in the NFL not standing for the anthem is disrespect.

       I actually call out my disgust when right wing people are violent, unlike liberals and the Democratic Party.  Antifa has been active far longer then Trump's run for the presidency.  I never stated that the government is denying free speech, though I can assume that the actions of the Mayors in Charlottesville and Berkeley can suggest this is changing.

      <p>
       I really don't care what you hate, I assume the vise versa is the same, the difference is I am against attacking you for your views.  Like Antifa.  Which I assume you are part of or at least approve of.

       Well, bro, apparently you're not actually understanding or seeing that
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       the secret false flag ingredient working and at play right there.  You have to stop and think a bit more deeply about what a false flag is in the first place:
      </p>
      <p>
       A false flag is an attack that Group A covertly perpetrates on Group B and then blames Group C for...and that is exactly what's going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB make sure and foment the ingredients necessary to cause “this” race to hate “that” race and then blame "this" other race or "that" race for whatever malady they can come up with so that the races can then fight against one another and TPTB can then come in and say:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        ”What?  You guys can't get along?  You don't know how to behave yourselves?  You’re shooting and killing each other and possibly killing some innocent civilians??  Well, don't worry!  WE’RE here!  We'll help everyone out!  We'll take everyone's guns away because Lord knows you guys have shown yourselves to not be able to play nice with them and keep from killing each other - so NO NO NO!  Can’t have them anymore!  And then we’ll simply institute martial law over the entire city/state/nation and keep everyone safe and happy together!  See??  Simple!  It works out great…and you’ll love it too!”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening is actually indeed a classic false flag equation being executed.  It's just being done in a much more complicated and not-so-simple manner, and you actually have to think through it a bit more deeply in order to understand and see what’s happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take the same guise as the types of "Gulf Of Tonkin" false flags that we've become more accustomed to wrapping our minds around.  This is by no means checkers.  Heck, if the Gulf Of Tonkin and the 911 false flags can be looked upon as chess, then what’s going on here with the elevation of racist violence across the nation can be looked upon as "3-D chess" where the false flag path is even more complicated to see and not as easy to discern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake, however, TPTB are absolutely controlling and manipulating the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that their hands are as deeply in what's been going on as they are then, it can absolutely be justifiably said that what's been happening recently is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       a serious type of false flag operation.

       That's a simple one, bro:  Control.  A not very small minority of the population is beginning to wake up more and more to the bullshit around us, and that spells a threat to TPTB's control over the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB, you see, live and subsist off their absolute and utter control over us, over the monetary system, over the slave-paradigm that exists on this planet - a paradigm that an absolutely massive proportion of us don't even know exist.  The movie The Matrix if used and looked at as a metaphor for life on this planet is actually pretty accurate.  Ignorance is a very powerful tool that TPTB have at their disposal and that keeps the people from fighting back against the rule that is over them/us.  The more the populace knows, the less likely it is that TPTB will be able to keep control over us.  Why? because we simply wouldn't stand for what is happening to us if we really KNEW what was happening to us and if we really knew the full extent to which we are being taken advantage of.
      </p>
      <p>
       And TPTB absolutely know this, so they work hard at keeping as many of us in the dark as absolutely possible - at making fun of and marginalizing those members of society actually intelligent enough to question the malign manipulation around us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We humans are in an open, "free-range" prison here on planet Earth.  Make no mistake, we are controlled to a great, great extent here.  That manipulation, so long as it remains intact and TPTB continue to stay in control of everything, will likely continue running smoothly.  However, when the sheep begin realizing that they are being used for nothing but slaughter and start waking up and actually
       <em>
        acting
       </em>
       on that knowledge, then those PTB will begin clamping down the gates of the manipulation in the society and will begin working in a much more obvious and much faster manner to lock everything down.  It's the
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=totalitarian+tiptoe+definition&amp;amp;oq=totalitarian+tip+toe+def&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i13k1.1429.5139.0.6459.24.20.0.0.0.0.514.2628.3j9j1j1j0j1.15.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..9.15.2626...0j0i131k1j0i10k1j0i8i13i30k1.PJ8bVN-JNko">
        Totalitarian Tip Toe
       </a>
       that begins turning into the Totalitarian
       <em>
        Sprint
       </em>
       the closer it gets to actually being finalized.  In other words, the closer the masses get to uncovering the nefarious intentions of TPTB, the more likely we are to absolutely rebel against it and fight it, which means TPTB have to speed up their plans to trap and enclose and enslave the masses, so they find reasons to institute a tighter, more obvious grip of control upon the population - i.e. institute martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems we're at the point in this society where the masses are beginning to wake up to the shit that is TPTB in this civilization, and many people aren't liking it one bit.  TPTB, conversely, are beginning to notice the masses waking up and so they have to enact greater, more obvious measures than before to enslave the population that is slowly but surely waking up to their manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a race between the sleeping giant that is the population, and the enslaving, encroaching liliputians who are TPTB.  TPTB are currently in control, but they are
       <em>
        heavily
       </em>
       in the minority to the 99% on this planet.  So long as the sleeping giant of the "dumb masses" remains asleep, then the liliputians can keep that giant in chains relatively easily.  If the giant awakes, however, then it becomes much more difficult for the liliputians to control it - so the liliputians do everythign they can to make sure that the giant is COMPLETELY enslaved before it fully wakes up.  If the giant wakes up before it's completely enslaved, then it's strong enough to actually break the chains of its manipulation.  If the liliputians actually succeed at really building the cage of enslavement around it, however, then the giant likely won't be able to break out of
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       . Something like
       <a href="http://belfasthills.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/swift.jpg">
        this.
       </a>
       This is where martial law comes in - it's the measure that TPTB figure will be able to much more likely keep the masses in utter control if the 99% continue to wake up more and more to the fact that we've been enslaved and ensnared as a people, a civilization, and a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB are manipulative and greatly in control of the current narrative, but are also vastly in the minority.  They understand and are aware of the dynamic between them and the 99%, and they guard that paradigm fiercely.

       Absolutely fascinating and well-said. The logic behind this idea makes sense, too, which creates an even more terrifying reality for me, personally. It would be much easier for us to topple this kind of regime while we have access to free speech and assembly. Take those away, however, and our task suddenly becomes an entirely different problem to tackle, if not altogether impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just hope that the masses wake up before we are truly enslaved forever. This is why I try to have these kinds of conversations with people. It's such a shame that I usually can't even hold someone's train of thought for more than two minutes before they label me (without saying it to me) as a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy to think that the masses have become so brainwashed that they can't even think critically anymore or, at the very least, keep an open mind to ideas that they have never been exposed to before.

       Those people are brainwashed well by TPTB, unfortunately.  Yes, there are individuals that are indeed unstable and sometimes a bit
       <em>
        too

       overzealous in their perspectives.  Those people
       <em>
        should

       in fact get reeled in.  Yes.  However, those people are in the extremes, and most people who question TPTB actually are quite normal and sane and of sound mind and body.  That those people are ostracized and marginalized if and when they question TPTB simply shows how powerful the manipulation is on this planet against questioning the established narrative of things.

       Those people are brainwashed well by TPTB, unfortunately.  Yes, there are individuals that are indeed unstable and sometimes a bit
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       overzealous in their perspectives.  Those people
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       in fact get reeled in.  Yes.  However, those people are in the extremes, and most people who question TPTB actually are quite normal and sane and of sound mind and body.  That those people are ostracized and marginalized if and when they question TPTB simply shows how powerful the manipulation is on this planet against questioning the established narrative of things.

        Crazy to think that the masses have become so brainwashed that they can't even think critically anymore or, at the very least, keep an open mind to ideas that they have never been exposed to before.

       Months before Trump won I declared that America would be the new Nazi Germany. And here we are headed straight in that direction. Nobody cared about what I posted and most likely thought I was being ridiculous. Also, I'm going to say right now that yes, a civil war is likely inevitable. The talk about it has been going on for a while even since Trump won. I'm just glad I don't live in the south.

       All the evidence you needed was a 5 minute podcast of a researcher....who's findings are all over the internet since a year that Fred Trump, the senior, was arrested at a KKK rally in New York in 1927 (or is it 1929). Been a while since I read that. So his father passed on his "values", you can be certain.

       The globalist media has been inciting race tension for years. They've Imported mass amounts of incompatible people, AND the globalists fund "Anti"fascist violence which will inevitably radicalize the other side. You seem to have forgotten about Congressman Scalisce who was shot by a bernie cuck. The "right wing" is not the one pushing this escalation. The first shot of the civil war has already been fired, and Scalisce, Rand Paul, and other congressman.

       Trust me, when the time comes, all non jewish whites will be enslaved in the USA. You're literally the British (jewish) Empire 2.0, after WW2.

       Europe is freeing itself from its chains - what is the USA doing? Creating a civil war between their own kin only for the people on top to laugh at it while they work their plan for mass enslavement.
Everyone wants the white dead (their own fucking words) yet there are enough whites fighting other whites because 'muh racism'. It's not about killing other races. It's about preserving our own. The fucking numbers don't lie. We're being bred out of extinction. The very race that you should be thankful for creating this fucking civilization in the first place. Stupid beyond all recognition.

       Nice slew of buzzwords you've demonstrated. Your rhetoric alone is a dead giveaway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the car incident yesterday, ignore everything you've read on the internet and just watch the damned video. The car was going down a crowded street (which shouldn't happen in the first place if adequate crowd control were enforced) and a ANTIFA jackass with a white flag swings it into the back of the car. Now if I'm driving down a crowded road and someone hits my car with a flag, I would go into defense mode, especially given the hundreds of people in the alley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the film wasn't great, but you can clearly see the car was attacked FIRST and there were even sounds of impacts before the camera pans to the right. These impacts were not bodies. If you listen closely, you can clearly hear metal-on-metal. This easily could be a scared driver feeling his life was in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, the only death was from when he was reversing out of the alley. After being attacked while driving towards the crowd, do you really think they wouldn't have ripped him apart if he didn't flee? This whole media narrative doesn't hold water and they are pushing the "white supremacist" narrative way too hard.

       Says the 36 day old account which has posted nothing of the sort in it's long life.  This is getting so fucking ridiculous.  All I needed to see was the upvote to comment ratio, age and posts of account with the OP is attempting to get across, screw looking at the comments.

       u/mistigia can nothing be done about this stuff?  OP is demonstrably lying.  You guys are going to start losing a lot more genuine users than you have been if this garbage is allowed to go on.

       Hoax? Definitely not. False flag though, maybe. I'm hearing that the guy who got arrested has a sun roof on his Challenger. The one in the video does not. Also pretty skilled at driving in reverse....almost professional. No airbag, indicative of possible stunt car.

       Two sets of protesters at this event. One gets all the coverage. Not really a conspiracy about a tragic outcome with a life lost and 19 injured. It seems there is an investigation into the cause of it all. Time will tell and many people will not like the outcome when facts come to light

       "You guys are stupid!" Proceeds to link to tariq nasheed. OP tariq nasheed is a hardcore anti-white who says every attack (no matter the perp) is the result of white supremacists. You lose a lot of credit when you link him and it also says quite a bit about you that you linked him here. There has yet to be an ounce of evidence that shows this was a pre-meditated attack so if you have such evidence please present it. If your car was surrounded by violent leftists hitting your car with rocks, bricks, and baseball bats how do you think you'd react? This absolutely wasn't a false flag, but calling it terrorism is a reach.

       I read this sub to get an idea of the broad spectrum of political opinion that's out there...the confirmation bias in this response is amazing. Each side tries to silence the other because they're constantly barraged with media saying people that don't believe what you do aren't human. The only media actually saying civil war is the right.

       The  ones I've seen pushing and wanting to start  a civil war are the left,  the right doesn't want you to be killed because  you have  a different opinion.  But the left on the other hand, calling anyone  who disagrees with them fascists nazi and so forth is just an excuse because  they have no real  argument as to why Conservatives and the "right" are so Damn evil.........
       <br/>
       BTW I'm not speaking  for all on the left and right each has there players however  from some one looking  from the outside I see its mainly the left spewing hate.

       Yeah it's the right pushing war. That's exactly why BLM call for the death of police officers and assault people. That's exactly why antifa have been assaulting people, blocking roads, and starting fires at their political oppositions events. That's exactly why Hillary super pace were caught funding people to go to Trump rallies to start fights and riots to shut down events. You want to talk about pushing civil war look at the left pushing fake race narratives and a fake Russia narrative all to rile people up who then turn to violence.

       Well you're half right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've apparently not noticed the radicalization of the left alongside the right.  If anyone actually wants a civil war its both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left was steaming along full speed with the narrative that Trump followers would refuse to accept Hillary as president and resort to violence.  They dropped the ball though, so they've got to run the same scheme but spun the opposite way.

       Please. I haven't bothered with this sub in years since it started taking itself too seriously, but you're really off the wall. Yes, some voices on the right have mentioned civil war, as a consequence of Trump being assassinated by the Left trying to use bullets when they couldn't win with ballots. 
The Left are the morons talking about seceding California, The Left are the morons proudly violating federal law to make sanctuary cities and even states. They were the ones who rioted in response to Trump winning the election, and rioted all last year during the BLM stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the lead up to the original Civil War, we have Democrat states profiting by shipping in aliens to exploit as cheap labor; only this time I guess the Democrats are the good guys because they they've managed their PR a little better and filled up everyone's heads with stories the suggest that the life of a 19th century slave must have been infinitely worse than the life of a 21st century illegal alien.
      </p>
      <p>
       So stop the projection, you're a moron. "The right" isn't trying to start a civil war. Republicans control the entire federal government, and a huge majority of State governments at every level. There's even talk of having the states trigger a constitutional convention to undo the insanity that leftist activist judges have done to this nation via a century of control. AND Trump is moving to end the Democrats' favorite little rogue state, North Korea, and latest communist revolution, Venezuela to end these threats to America. So naturally, Democrats are doing everything they can to create internal Chaos to prevent Republicans from setting the "progressive" cause back by a century. And yes, the Democrats probably will start a civil war just like they started the original one because they stand to lose so much money and power and they just won't accept losing their elite status, and they'll happily throw a bunch of illegal aliens in the meat grinder to die for their masters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, the Right has no need for a civil war. We already won everything at the ballot box. But if the Left tries to steal that away with bullets by assassinating Trump, we will be happy to return fire. We are history, and we will not be denied.

       I've got a theory, with social media providing a space of intense discussion mere minutes after an event, the events that pass the "critical mass of interest" filter tend to be discussed so thoroughly and divisively (because of social media's echo chamber effect and our time's increasingly calcified division of people into distant ideological corners) that pretty much every idea under the sun is put out there and defended to such a point as to give it at least some credibility, most people then simply latch to the idea that fits their biases the best.
      </p>

       You want to believe this was a false flag because an act of right-wing violence/terrorism would de-legitimize your party/movement/ideology/etc...? Well "CTRL+F false flag" and here you go!

       The identity politics has been pushing folks toward this. We are seeing two worldviews clashing. AJ has never called for violence except when we are met with violence. This racism bullshit has been pushed hard on opposiiton groups. There is a reason for it. Yes there is hinky stuff going on with the stormfront types. The neolibs are trying to alter the narrative.

       The left have started it all. The right even the (alt right) are just getting tired of the antiAmerican shit the left keep dishing out. Thus is why you see what you see. Watch Adam Corrola , Dave Rueben,  Gavin Mcinnes, Joe Rogan and anyone else who is in the middle spectrum of reason or just right side of reality. They are themselves leaning more on the right, just by asking basic questions to people for the purpose of understanding the situations and they all basically say the same thing. (The left have completly lost their shit and dont base their lives off of scientific facts and logic and reason but feelings.) And they are 100% pushing anti American ideals on the people. But the left hate history, hate science and hate God and hate nationalism.  Its going to be bad in the future if the country doesnt put a stop to the leftist communistic agenda.

       Have you watched the video?  His car was surrounded by black masked Antifa thugs with bats.

       The question is - who started it.  If they did, I don't have any sympathy for them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antifa isn't entitled to threatened drivers without consequence.  They don't get special rights detain and assault just because they're the left's darlings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if the driver just saw Antifa thugs and thought "Time to roll over some Antifa for fun!" then he committed murder.

       I think we should get out of all wars. I have no problem with Russia but I do have a slight problem if they are going to hack people's emails. I'd be against it if they hacked repub emails too. It sets a dangerous precedent. Someday a democrat may call China or Israel to hack right wing politicians.

       Not a fan of Israel, I think they are jewish white supremacists. I wonder why we go all out for Zioning that region which is the size of New Jersey.

       Its not exactly the "White Pride", stuff. Its the question, to why its acceptable for other groups to be proud of who they are, but the second a white person is proud to be white, you are a nazi and a racist. Meanwhile BLM groups can do this and its acceptable.

       that "enhanced" version looks like a fucking joke for real. also, interestingly the actual car has racing stripes and the one where he is leaning on it does not. i dont think those are the same vehicles, but that doesnt mean it isnt him because the picture of him leaning on the car is clearly years old.

       What's the point of bringing that up? All you're doing is trying to blame everyone in this sub for the actions of a few random people on the internet who happened to post something to this sub. Nobody in this sub promoted the nazi car crash. They promoted a stupid rally, that's it. There is no blood on my hands because I am an individual who is not associated with dummies who wanted to promote a rally.

       Soon Spoony and Linkara will make come backs, reviewing Nazi Germany era films for Spoony and comics and propaganda posters from Nazi Germany by Linkara. At least they will be back, with their true colors, and in this political climate, make big bucks. Perfect timing for has-been internet stars.

       Try this then. White pride is not white supremacy. It is the same a black pride or gay pride of woman's day marches or Cuban pride marches. None of them are about being supremacist to anyone. They are about being proud of who and what you are instead of letting media and college snowflake-babies dictate to you what you should feel ashamed of? If everyone else is allowed to feel pride for their race or culture then so are white people. And white culture and history is more than just one statue.

       I think the KKK has freemason roots even. O_o
I'm glad people are waking up to this pathetic attempt by the establishment to divide people. Threatening fellow Americans/humans just because of differences in opinion, is absolutely disgusting.
I have zero respect for warmongers like that (and it is warmonger territory because it's reminiscent of civil war).
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't even attack a full fascist. Much evil comes from ignorance.
Education is the future. People don't realize lib VS con a scam in itself. Because the parties/corporate media indoctrination is actually NEOlib VS NEOcon, which is basically fighting over corporate brands Pepsi VS Coca Cola....it's just sick corporate propaganda. Our whole two party system is corporate far right authoritarian (NEOlib/NEOcon) and people are so brainwashed and filled with hate that they want to kill fellow Americans because of some bullshit on the media? I'm really repulsed by this. I hope people don't fall for this vile divisive propaganda.

       Absolutely fascinating and well-said. The logic behind this idea makes sense, too, which creates an even more terrifying reality for me, personally. It would be much easier for us to topple this kind of regime while we have access to free speech and assembly. Take those away, however, and our task suddenly becomes an entirely different problem to tackle, if not altogether impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just hope that the masses wake up before we are truly enslaved forever. This is why I try to have these kinds of conversations with people. It's such a shame that I usually can't even hold someone's train of thought for more than two minutes before they label me (without saying it to me) as a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy to think that the masses have become so brainwashed that they can't even think critically anymore or, at the very least, keep an open mind to ideas that they have never been exposed to before.
