       First of all, I've literally been a ghost on here for a few years before I made the decision to make an account. I'm 17 so if I say/write something that doesn't make sense please pardon me. What I want to talk about is something that's been bothering me quite a while -how do you deal with knowing that our world is so fucked? I don't even want to live in this world anymore. Like, I can't discover more and more info about how fucked world governments are (pizza gate, MK Ultra) without literally going insane. Whenever I'm outside I literally just look around and look at the people and how oblivious they are to what's going on in the world. It makes me sad, and maybe I'm slightly young but I get so angry and depressed at how shit this world is. I feel like for every good thing that happens in the world (which is like nothing lmao), so much fucked up shit is going on. Even the celebrities I used to like, I just look at them wondering how much disgusting crap they had to do just to get there. Am I rambling?I don't even know. Also, I don't know why but sometimes I wonder if the things we find out like pizzagate etc have been purposely planted in order to distract us from something else? What if EVERYTHING we know has been purposely planted? How do we know if it's true? 
Also, sometimes I think what if countries like North Korea are actually normal and everyone else makes them seem like dangerous/corrupt? I assume this because I come from a place that's also suppose to be seen as a 'danger' and pretty much the worst place to live in and from experience of going there, it was literally harmless?! So what if the USA is making NK seem bad when it's actually not?? And same goes for Russia?
Right now I'm pretty much confused with every single thing in my life but it's not like I'm new to this. I've literally been trying to seek the truth since I was 11 and sometimes I like to forget about all of this just so I can be a sheep for a while (I find being a sheep is much more relaxing). Anyway, as many of you are older, how do you deal with all of these? And what are your tips for not going insane? Do you even enjoy life anymore seeing as we are all pretty much in a world that's being run by baby eating elitist?
Finally (sorry if this was long) does anyone have some good documentaries to watch? I'm up to watch anything! Thanks :)

       There are fewer maladapted women in the world then men. Just think about how many unemployed neckbeards still live in their parents basement. That may indicate a lack of ability to compartmentalize.

       This is the best response you're going to find IMO. I went through the same thing and I'm sure many others have. Not as young as you though and I comend you on being "woke" at such a young age. All I cared about at 17 was baseball, drugs and sex (in that order haha) unplug and go so something you enjoy doing, whatever your hobby is. If it's to late at night or you're stuck home, mix in a few uplifting reads or threads into the mix. Read a book, play some video games...shit like that. When you feel like you're going nuts, try to remember that all this stuff is out of your control for the most part. Keep taking in information and help to inform others, but you won't change it all on your own so don't let it drive you nuts.

       It's easy to see the world as awful if you just see the bad stuff. This is the best time to be alive in history in so many ways. Barely any people die in childbirth, the vast majority survive until adulthood, you can instantly communicate across the world and you have access to more information than pretty much everyone in history

       You are not alone, I promise you.  For me, the deeper I got through the layers of BS, the more my brain got busy trying to get ahead of it, my health and happiness went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then made a realization.  It was amazing, and unsure how it happened but it happened about 6 months ago.  I thought, either the earth is going to end or it is not - but starting today I am going to live this week/month/ season as if it is the last.  So my spring was awesome, my health improved past average and my happiness did too.  Summer hit and the same thing - decided to spend as little time as possible working and worrying - and instead spending it positively with family and friends.  Some days I just go lounge at the beach on a raft when I want to be alone, but I most enjoy being with people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are young but old enough to be aware of the weight of the world.  You are at an age that nearly every grown up wishes they could go back to.  You are so lucky and don't know it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change your mindset, assume it is all going to goto shit, enjoy the ride while it is active, and this is important - do as much as you can reasonably do to improve your life and those around you.  It doesn't have to be big.  One thing I do is when I goto aldi, I buy a cart or two for strangers.  It costs a quarter and it gives people huge dumb smiles.  I always tell them to give it free to the next guy.  I figure my one quarter deed might make dozens of people smile that day.  It is dumb, but small things reap large dividends towards improving this shitty planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is longer than I meant, but your cry for help touched me.  The planet and reality is shit no matter what - so you need to decide if you are going to use your sliver of universal time to enjoy it and help others enjoy it a little more than they did without you.

       You are welcome to believe I am ignorant.  I believe a lot of women feel compartmentalization is something they aren't good at, and I agree with them.  Doesn't diminish them in any way.  I doubt there are women that have identities hinged on how their skill in compartmentalization is perceived.
      </p>

       Ok, you pointed it out.  OP, enjoyed my post as I glorified her, I didn't put her down.  Don't see ill where there is none, the whole point of the thread was to let go and relax and enjoy life.  And look at what you focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to know what sort of generalizations people are making of you right now?  You wouldn't like the bullshit of what kind of pansy you're making yourself look like.  But I judge people on their actions, you judge on their microaggressions.  It's too bad.

       Ha people like you are the worst. Can't defend your own actions without trying to deflect it to someone else. I didn't make any comment about OPs post or your other long reply to her. Simply your 1 single short ignorant comment about generalizing all women in behaving the way you think they do. But thats your problem not mine.

       Go to college, focus on other passions.  The current stuff like... the clintons, trump, pgate, the election, where we are now... definitely a lot of stuff to drive a sane person crazy.  It definitely did a number on me, and i'm a dude in his mid-thirties.  It's a big world, most likely you'll never come across a 'baby eating elitist'.  balance out the craziness with stuff you enjoy.  I'm quite good at shutting stuff off/out because i have so many other things/hobbies/skills that I enjoy spending time on. good luck

       Don't go to college (take it from someone who went). Take heart that you are already aware of this knowledge and help spread it. As far as life goals, truly think deep of what your talents are and what your community needs. Don't focus on fitting in and becoming another corporate peon. Do focus on yourself, your family and your community as those are truly the only things you can and should affect. Be the change you wish to see I the world and Godspeed - we need more people like you :)

       well, my original recommendation was going to be, "go to college and try and bang something".  But in other words get out and live life. 
 Since she's already exposed herself to the dark realities that many will just reject and laugh at, she's ahead of the game.

       You
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to go inward if you want any semblence of peace. You won't find it out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to recommend meditation simply because your brain is still developing - but in the future, checkout tryptamine psychedelics like psilocybin and DMT. I don't mean for recreation, but for internal inquiry and seeking of peace. You'll find what you're looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this - it's real, but only on one level. The suffering is real, but only on one level. And I don't mean that to be dismissive and put my fingers in my ear about it - it's just the truth, and the only way we're getting out of this mess is internal peace.

       I think your sentiments are exactly why many people choose to remain ignorant of dark truths about society.  It shakes their world up too much to entertain ideas that contradict official narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember this the next time you ask yourself why people lap up propaganda so readily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure to find things in life that make you happy and do them regularly.  A hobby or exercise, or reading.  If you only focus on the negative, you'll get sucked in completely.

       Maybe my view is optimistic, but I like to think some people remain ignorant because their passion is something else. They choose to follow a different path and let others deal with the dark truths. I don't consider that a bad thing, we need good people helping to make the world turn.

       Exactly you don't know what is true and what can be verified. All you really get is from a screen, computer or television. You need to take your sovereign power back friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn about mindfulness and practice meditation. Don't waste your energy on convincing those around you of the sham that life is. Lead by example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people will scoff at you if you tell them your believes because they are happy being ignorant, hoping the world is no where near as messed up as it truly is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find what makes you happy, find your passion and pursue it. Make sure it gives back to society in some way and promotes better living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly but surely you will inspire others around you and they'll make their own positive changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing you're awake to world events at 17 is s good thing. Hopefully more will follow. You have places like this to share thoughts and feelings with others. Follow your intuition and keep searching for a better way.

       Girl, I got into this stuff in my teens too. I'm now 25 and the world just gets scarier and scarier.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice is to try not to concentrate on it so much. I dedicate an hour a day to this kind of stuff and the rest of my time I spend doing "normal" things. The world as a whole sucks majorly, but MY world, my family etc is amazing so try to separate the two out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found through personal experience that some people would rather live in ignorant bliss than know the truth so try not to go too deep with these kinda people. It's a sure fire way to lose friends and be seen as "weird". Try not to go too deep down the rabbit hole ❤

       This feeling occurs to everyone who researches these sorts of events, happenings. This is the negative aspect in seeking knowledge. Well the negative feelings will subside as you learn more, but since you're young you shouldn't take it all in at once. When you feel overwhelmed, take a break, and then come back to it later. When you come back to it later, you see things a  little different, and can handle the information better, with a clear head.

       It'll pass as you get older. Maybe you learn to appreciate the truly good things between all the B.S. or just become numb to it all, but it passes. Even if the NWO do succeed in all their plans it's literally not the end of the world.

       One thing that helps is to be skeptical. Most of this conspiracy stuff is bs. It is the stuff that's real that makes you believe it's all true. Believe me, it isn't. Also those who say just go out and have fun are right as well. The real mind-fuck is realizing that despite all the bad stuff going on in the world most everyone lives a healthy happy life. I went through some life threatening health issues and the weird part was that you discover that no matter what, life goes on. And I had surgery and recovered, and looking back at it, I think I over thought it a bit. When you are actually wondering whether you are going to be alive in a few years the political stuff suddenly becomes meaningless.

       A few things. First of all your brain is still developing so I'd pump the brakes on the drugs that folks are encouraging you to do here. Yes in many cases they can be mind expanding, etc. However, there's plenty of time for that once your physical brain chemistry has settled. The fact that you have been aware of and seeking the truth since you were 11 is light years ahead of 98% of the planet. Your mind is already expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, unplug. And don't just unplug and read a book, although that's amazing in and of itself. Unplug and go interact with the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       physical world. Go outside and take a walk, observe the trees, the branches, the leaves, touch the bark. Smile at humans and look them in the eye and say hello when walking past. Get to know your grocery clerks, wait staff at restaurants, cashier at the corner store, police and fire, and on and on. They're all regular folks just like you. And building those relationships make it that much tougher to tear down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, make something. Produce something tangible. The vast majority of what humans "produce" now a days isn't real. It is a facsimile of something. For example I work in human resources. HR is pure bullshit! It is an entire industry invented out of nothing to make people feel certain ways. Make a chair, draw a picture, paint a bowl of fruit, write a poem.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the things I outlined above are natural
       <em>
        human
       </em>
       activities. Engage positively with your fellow man and environment and all the noise dissipates and the poison goes away. The world is not full of evil and demons. Look outside your window and tell me what do you see? That is what the world is full of, and to think any different is allowing TPTB to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're doing great. Stay vigilant and never stop seeking the truth.

       For what it's worth... I've been fairly deep down the rabbit hole myself, trying to make sense of the world we live in. I spent a good amount of time searching for the "meaning of life". The meaning of life, is the meaning YOU attach to it. Life is like a blank book and you're the author. Write whatever the fuck you want... After a few chapters it definitely makes it harder to change the plot, but know, the next page is blank, always. With all that being said, I believe that is why the media is a non stop onslaught of bullshit. They know the page is blank, but would prefer if you kept repeating/rereading the story they had wrote for you. A world full of horrible people that are most definitely out to get you! The more attention you spend on any given subject, the more real it becomes. So while it's good to know what is going on in the world, the trick (as far as I can tell) is to put more energy into a solution than the problem itself. A good metaphor I can think of is you see people standing outside planned parenthood all the time with nasty pictures of dead babies and shaming everybody that walks in and out. All they are doing is adding fuel to the fire they hate so much. But what if all these people that are outside pointing their fingers were to instead stand outside, and offer to adopt any baby that was about to be aborted? They would solve the problem they hate so much. But, it is much easier to stand outside and point the finger than it is to step up and be a part of a proactive solution by offering to adopt these babies.... Went off the rails there and hopefully you can read this without it seeming like a bunch of incoherent babble, which it very well might be....

       I'm just a few years older, but I feel able to talk about this because I went through exactly the same thing as you at exactly the same age as you. ( I think its a generational thing)
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I want you to know that its not unacceptable to be feeling how you are.  It's perfectly reasonable to question everything, and any intelligent person should.  Only sheep blindly believe everything they've been told as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there's a saying I've heard many times over that I want to share with you.  "Help yourself so that you may be able to help others"  Put into different words, "be the change you want to see in the world."  my dad used to say this to me all the time when I was going through what you are a few years ago.  So here's what I recommend. First, Focus on growing as a person.  Learn as much as you can about this world, and don't be afraid to explore topics others may turn their noses up at or laugh off.  Know as much as you can about as many things as you can. Explore all political sides and see what they are saying and what you agree with.  What this does is build a strong foundation of knowledge from which you will begin to develop a more objective picture of reality as a whole.  What it will also do for you is open more doors to different things in the future.  After all, the more you know, the more you can do with that knowledge right?    So getting all of that out of the way, I'm gonna link some youtube videos and channels, and a book which really helped me move myself out of the headspace you are in right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klniTenTtcs&amp;amp;list=PLPKfHwh7SSeUUecRLpOsN3FQ8q4YCjRZD">
        Zeitgeist Trilogy
       </a>
       In case you haven't seen it, these movies are conspiracy classics.  They are what got me into the conspiracy community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first movie starts by identifying many of the things wrong in our world, and the second and third focus on addressing ways we might be able to go about making change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also strongly recommend taking a look at
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KphWsnhZ4Ag">
        Paradise or Oblivion
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb5ivvcTvRQ">
        The Choice is Ours
       </a>
       By the Venus Project.  The Venus project are a little on the Utopian 
side and don't get too much into the nitty gritty specifics of how we can fix our world, but the documentaries still provided me valuable insight which helped me on my path to gaining more objective insight into this world and the one we have the capacity to create.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next for something a lot more esoteric, I'd recommend taking a look at the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw">
        Hidden Human History Movie
       </a>
       by Spirit Science.  Browse their channel a bit, they give a wildly different representation of everything that, keeps me fascinated and coming back for more. See what you think of em.  If you approach with an open mind, which something tells me you will, they might challenge the way you see things.
      </p>
      <p>
       so finally, what can we do to make change, to perhaps make things better on planet earth for this generation and the next?  The one and only thing we can do, is to start seeing things from a different perspective.  So, some ideas to get you started.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would recommend
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0GYwnbFNVc">
        Adam Kokesh
       </a>
       for his views on voluntarism and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtspq5T7B44">
        how government makes you less safe
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Geoff Lawton for his astounding insight into
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keQUqRg2qZ0">
        Permaculture
       </a>
       which is an agricultural method about not just maximizing food production, but also repairing and restoring the local geography through planting "guilds" of different plants whose capabilities complement one another in order to rejuvenate the local landscape.  After all, if we wanna save the world we cant JUST focus on technology, we're gonna have to go back to our roots in agriculture also.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're going to have to fix our financial system too, and for knowledge on that, I would recommend
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKZ83REIkA">
        Andreas Antonopolous
       </a>
       for his lessons on bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and how it can help to fix our broken financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, last but CERTAINLY not least, a book which has helped me overcome a lot of internal struggle, it is called "7 habits of highly effective people" By Stephen R. Covey.  This book helped me to work through a lot, and I recommend you give it a read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I wanna leave you with something.  A feeling of hope.  I know right now things probably seem pretty grim.  Hell, when I was going through what you are right now, I wanted to kill myself.  Like, a lot.  But I started developing a belief that we are all here for a reason, that the struggle I was going through was part of the process of growth.  That the things I was learning about which gave me such sorrow, could be turned around and used as fuel to make change.  To fight the ills of this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I wrote a shit ton of stuff here, but you remind me so much of myself just a few years ago that I wanted to share as much as I could about my own journey going from where you are right now to where I am so I could help in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're only 17 and you're already aware of many of the things that are wrong with this world.  Just knowing that already sets you apart from so many people who are blissfully unaware and go about life as an unsuspecting trout.  Don't take that as a bad thing!  You are a powerful human being with great potential to make positive change!    Keep your head up and realize that you have purpose.  Life isn't meaningless, enjoy yourself!

       I'm about 10 years older than you but I'm just discovering so much of this. i was going through a phase where i felt everything was fake and unreal. i wonder if the people on the news networks know what's really going on but they play along.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the part you said about NK being not so bad... that really struck a chord. i started feeling the same way about Syria. then i started following Instagram accounts from there. it's a beautiful country. Assad seems to be at least somewhat liked over there. i just don't know. i don't think jourmalists travel to Damascus bc of the supposed danger but it just doesn't seem bad.

       I feel you! 
It's an insane world and those of us who succumb to the insanity are, for the most part, the closest to sanity. Some say "ignorance is bliss", but no one really wants to be a sheep, even though the shepherds offer numbing comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's cliché, but it is essential to love yourself. 17 is such a vulnerable time in your life, and negativity, even if it feels enlightening, is heavy. Seek out what makes you feel light, creative, goofy and happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began down my own rabbit hole around your age and soon after felt that isolation which comes with knowing so much depressing truth which no one willfully ignorant wants to hear. This further isolated me and I began living with suicidal thoughts after a friend took his life my sophomore year of highschool. Long story short I met a girl who kept my mind and mood positive and after she left me I found a certain psychedelic which has completely changed my reality for the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found passion in "natural building" or specifically building with cob. I took some workshops and found myself deep in the woods for months focusing on building cottages with lovely people who share so much of the same experiences we are all here relating to. Look at any of us there in the woods and the "sane" person would see an insane person covered in mud. But this was a part of our journey to escape from the insanity that is our twisted twisted society. There are so many means of escape, which is very healthy when you find yourself in a depressing rabbithole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ramble ramble...
My advice is to find an interested in a craft or trade, something where you can create with your hands and use your creations. Seek empowerment. Whatever suits you, growing a small garden, building a small tree house, writing stories or singing to a lover. Growing up I was never taught to value creativity, and the older I get the more valuable it seems to be. It's easy to get into a trance and lose yourself in your reality of creations, which lightens your load and refreshes your focus. If you seek others out who are practicing skills you are interested in, odds are you will share more in common than you would imagine. We are all so very similar in very different ways..
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all reaping what we sew. Seek love and you will be loved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one of my favorite quotes I'll leave you with...
“We have to create culture, don't watch TV, don't read magazines, don't even listen to NPR. Create your own roadshow. The nexus of space and time where you are now is the most immediate sector of your universe, and if you're worrying about Michael Jackson or Bill Clinton or somebody else, then you are disempowered, you're giving it all away to icons, icons which are maintained by an electronic media so that you want to dress like X or have lips like Y. This is shit-brained, this kind of thinking. That is all cultural diversion, and what is real is you and your friends and your associations, your highs, your orgasms, your hopes, your plans, your fears. And we are told 'no', we're unimportant, we're peripheral. 'Get a degree, get a job, get a this, get a that.' And then you're a player, you don't want to even play in that game. You want to reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being manufactured out of the bones of a dying world.” Terence McKenna

       Some have mentioned psychedelics as a way to put things in perspective and reset your brain, and I highly agree. Studies have shown they are very effective in helping with depression, and in my experience a trip will leave me feeling more "awake" then anything else I've experienced. I try to do LSD about once every 6 months or so, even a small dose will help. Another thing to remember is that even though there are terrible things happening, we live in the safest period in human history, with far less violence, disease, rape, slavery, famine, ect than any other period. The fear mongering media would have you believe the opposite---don't give in!

       I know the feeling.  Remember who you are isn't the same as what you know.  Remember not to believe anything as absolute truth - things are more or less likely to be true.  And remember that if you're seeing cracks in the lies that people believe, you're in a better position than most to pick apart true from false.  But above all, remember that, as much as your conscience might be satisfied trying to fight mistruths and oppression and all that, you have to live your own life too - you can't pour from an empty cup.

       Emotions and worries are more sharp and noticeable when you're 17. It sounds depressing, but someone once told me that as you get older you will FEEL less. Everything becomes less impactful on your personal life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't let your life be run by worries and concerns about what you find down the rabbit hole. You have to come to the surface and get a breather every once and a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you chase these things too deep you will go crazy, or get in trouble. Don't let what you read online take away from living a happy life. You are very young, and if I were you I would be satisfied with the fact that you have already gotten a good dose of the dark corners of society.

       I started researching 9/11 when I was your age and it completely destroyed my perspective on the world and politics. I got very deep into that investigation, and part of still wishes I hadn't to this day. There are avenues you can go down in that investigation that could personally put you at risk if you get deep enough.

       If that's not available with your friends at school, I've found intelligence officials, organized crime, militias, street gangs, and Bible prophecy enthusiasts to be the most "woke" people. There are upsides and downsides to associating with all of these.

       You're 17. Even if you were 40 years old it goes without saying that the amount of knowledge you can take in doesn't come close to exposing our reality. If you want to be philosophical you could put it like this. rougly 4% of matter is visible dude! Dark matter and dark energy is incomprehensible! So what is it that we cannot see?? To put it simply, the wisest man knows that he knows nothing.

       You're a kid. You should probably step back from this stuff. The people on this sub may wholeheartedly believe everything here but remember that not every conspiracy is true. Very few of them probably are to be honest. Don't sacrifice your mental health for crackpot theories that sound good. Sometimes a theory is just a theory and there's just as much evidence against it. It's best to take everything on either side with a grain of salt.

       Ok, you pointed it out.  OP, enjoyed my post as I glorified her, I didn't put her down.  Don't see ill where there is none, the whole point of the thread was to let go and relax and enjoy life.  And look at what you focus on.

       You want to know what sort of generalizations people are making of you right now?  You wouldn't like the bullshit of what kind of pansy you're making yourself look like.  But I judge people on their actions, you judge on their microaggressions.  It's too bad.
