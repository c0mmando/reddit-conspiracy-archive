They were a band of truly racist, semi-official thugs who enforced National Socialist Party dogma, even to the point of beating and killing ordinary Germans who did not agree with Hitler&#39;s fanaticism. The modern Democratic Party and it&#39;s ultra-left-wing, sycophantic, cult-like supporters in academia, the media, the federal bureaucracy, the entertainment industry and all of our institutions are responsible for this unrest. They hate American culture, they hate all that we&#39;ve accomplished as a country, they hate our prosperity ( unless it benefits them) and most of all they have a hatred of ordered liberty - at least the kind our founders established. To them they are right and everyone else is wrong, the ends justify the means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re basing your WHOLE VIEW on anarcho-communists on what NEOliberal Soros bank-rolled violent thugs claim to be.
That&#39;s like believing Clinton is &quot;left wing&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;anti-establishment&quot; or &quot;pro-worker&quot;.
She&#39;s a NEOliberal, nothing like Bernie. Don&#39;t trust so called &quot;liberalism&quot; that comes from
the fascist establishment (NEOlib/NEOcon are just a few steps to the left of NWO fascism).</p>

<p>Even if it was 100% an organic event with real brainwashed people, you can&#39;t just generalize &quot;these violent guys are anarcho-communists, therefore all anarcho-communists are like this&quot;.
That&#39;s a scam. &quot;See, it&#39;s these leftist progressive millenials, they&#39;re violent thugs!&quot; 
Character assassination rubbish.</p>

<p>The &quot;molotov man&quot; is a garbage stereotype of anarcho-communists and anarchists, etc.
The real anarchos and anarchists, etc. are freedom loving (hence why they&#39;re very left libertarian, while I&#39;m moderate left libertarian similar-ish to Bernie who is in between authoritarian and libertarian).</p>

<p>I consider the real anarchos like my brothers, we share some beliefs. 
Soros and other NEOliberal/NEOconservative (economically corporately far right, extremely authoritarian socially) establishment scum want to smear all leftists, want to blame &quot;DA COMMIES&quot; &quot;DA SJW LIBERALZ&quot; and so on.
It&#39;s divide and conquer identity politics (stereotypes) garbage.
A long time psyop.
The establishment push crap like so called &quot;SJW&quot; crap (feminism, &quot;check your white privilege&quot; biased ignorance, etc.)
and violence. Some people fall for it themselves and turn aggressive/brainwashed and so on
but these are pushed by the corporate media, owned the by NEOlib/NEOcon establishment.</p>

<p>Anarcho-communists aren&#39;t these anti-free speech people the corporate media portray them to be.
Stalin/USSR/etc. were never real communists, they were extreme authoritarian (not left libertarian)
state capitalist dictators. Workers did not own the means of production.
Plus anarcho-communism (real communism) is a money-less stateless society, while the USSR was an extreme authoritarian state, the extreme opposite of stateless society lol.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t fall for divide/conquer tactics, friend. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a no true scotsman type logical fallacy IMO. I&#39;m just saying that a moneyless, stateless society where the workers control/own the means of production (anarcho-communism) is a world away from an extreme authoritarian (dictatorship) state with money and the beurocrats controlling the means of production, secret police, state totalitarian spying, etc. etc. (beurocratic state capitalist dictatorship calling itself communism)
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/TTSOR5F.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/TTSOR5F.jpg</a></p>

<p>I consider the USSR (70+ year) state capitalist dictatorship to be a controlled movement,
I don&#39;t think they ever cared to really bring real communism, not even socialism which would have been far easier to implement than pretending &quot;let&#39;s go full dictator totalitarian state, we&#39;ll reach communism you guys, TRUST ME&quot; O_o
I think it was a zionist beurocrat scam. I think the elites wanted to get rid of the Tzar and as a bonus controlled the state.
State capitalism seems far more similar to fascism than anarchism and anarcho-communism.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an anarcho-communist, (I symathize with some of it but) I allign more with democratic socialism, and I&#39;m ok with stuff like social democracy and centrism. But I feel the need to defend true communism because the truth always needs to be defended and UNmuddy the waters. I don&#39;t mind anarcho-communism if the population erradicated sociopathy (through better education, medical/psychological research, mental healthcare, better nutrition, less propaganda in hollywood/TV that glorifies gore and stuff, etc.).</p>

<p>But let alone the fact society is nowhere near ready for anarcho-communism (may require like several several generations of democratic socialism to improve ethics and logic in the population, in order to erradicate sociopathy, to get anywhere near anarcho-communism which may not even be necessary by then, don&#39;t fix what&#39;s not broken, and IMO democratic socialism isn&#39;t completely utopian but damn good enough)
but let alone that, I think democratic socialism is a good enough permanent solution.
It&#39;s a faster way of alleviating the suffering of workers worldwide (people are suffering homelessness, poverty, war, etc. this very second, I&#39;d like the suffering to stop ASAP).</p>

<p>If not democratic socialism (similar to Jill Stein I think?), at least the more moderate social democracy (Bernie) or centrism (slightly right of Bernie, although Europe may consider him just centrist).</p>

<p>Democratic socialism is far more tangible and moderate compared to tearing down the system and trying to implement anarcho-communism.
In democratic socialism, there would still be the socialism-capitalism mixed economics.
Just that the ratio is improved (more socialism in the mix compared to NEOliberalism)
and cutting out the NEOliberal crony capitalist component of giving corporate welfare, wasting tax payers&#39; money on corps that keep screwing workers, dodging taxes, etc.
Hope that makes sense.
I just want to get away from NEOliberal economics and NEOconservative warmongering foreign policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I can definitely sympathize with some of those views, but there&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t seem to get around. &#39;Taxation is theft&#39;. I&#39;ve been told it time and time again by conservatives/libertarians, and they make a fairly compelling case, even though I KNOW that us pooling money together as a collective to pay for things like healthcare should technically be better, it&#39;s hard to convince someone that compelling people to do so &#39;at gunpoint&#39; is actually a good idea. Maybe I&#39;m still not even fully convinced myself. What do you say to someone like that? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand your view, I would argue it sort of like this:</p>

<p>I made a presentation but a few things I forgot to add:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The cynical view I hold is that these are Ayn Rand/tea party types who don&#39;t care about anyone else (to help them sleep at night, they claim CHARITY is a replacement for tax....that&#39;s just a joke IMO, being at the mercy of the wealthy? Might as well ask McDonalds for charity....even though they dodge taxes, pay extremely low wages to hard working workers, free subsidies, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>This current crony capitalist NEOliberal (right wing or far right economics I think)
economic system is plagued with problems like money in politics, just imagine
how zero market regulations would make things even worse. Ultimate tax dodging scheme lol.</p></li>
<li><p>TPP is a right libertarian concept. Not all of them agree with it, but
Ron Paul (supposedly anti-TPP) and Gary Johnson (pro-TPP)
still managed to get almost exactly in the same spot. That&#39;s suspicious IMO.</p></li>
<li><p>I used to think NEOliberals were only DNC/GOP types, but political science says it&#39;s just the center right to far right side of the economic axis....therefore far right libertarianism is ALSO NEOliberalism, which is anti-worker (in my pres, I think I mentioned that worker rights, conditions and safety, product quality and safety regulations, environmental regulations, etc. are also in jeapardy or completely removed in far right libertarian economics).</p></li>
<li><p>These far right libertarians (another strain of NEOliberal) are anti-worker (against worker&#39;s rights and workers&#39; unions) and also hoarde wealth just like the crony capitalist authoritarian types of NEOliberals like Clinton/Obama.
Hoarding wealth via the &quot;TAX IS THEFT&quot; excuse, allows them to accumulate wealth and only give out what they want aka &quot;charity&quot;. This stops money circulating in the economy.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So as an analogy: The crony capitalist authoritarian far right libertarians like Clinton/Obama/Bush/Reagan/Trump/etc. are like bleeding wound economics, blood (wealth) escapes the economy (the body) and malnourishes the cells (workers). </p>

<p>Far right libertarian NEOliberal economics are like a blood clot, blood remaining in a certain area of the body, causing blood clots that could cause a heart attack or something. </p>

<p>This analogy is just me saying that wealth doesn&#39;t circulate around the economy well enough.
Being vulnerable to the capitalists an insanely dangerous thing, it&#39;s like old establishment stuff, before unions kicked their asses and gave us the weekend, 8 hour work week, better wages, etc. We&#39;d be so screwed without unions. Far right libertarians are on the establishment&#39;s side.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ron Paul (a far right libertarian) claims
that being a doctor working for the state is equivalent to slavery.....lol.
If this is how they reason, they cannot be trusted to be reasonable with working rights.
I consider NEOliberalism to be the economic ideology of sociopaths.
If Ron Paul isn&#39;t a shill, the best benefit of the doubt I can give him,
is the remote chance that he just wants to end the FED and then drop the far right lbiertarian mask. But I think he is a shill since he pushes appearances too hard and even without
the FED, far right libertarianism still works in favor of the establishment, controlling workers, making it extremely hard for the non-wealthy to have a comfortable life due to the absence of freedom and opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>The super rich tend not to spend their money much, they hoarde it more, there are 13 trillion dollars in tax havens abroad, that&#39;s not including whatever Rothschilds and other elite bankers secretely have (possibly like 300 trillion or something, their 200 year or so debt based banking dynasty probably can easily accumulate that much by now).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Even the more ethical millionaires, may not spend much due to paranoia of losing it, or just simply the fact it may take longer to spend 50 million than $5,000 for example.
We need money to circulate in the economy constantly.
Wealth and labor are generated and should recirculate to ensure everyone gets enough &quot;fruit&quot; from this labor. I.e. you should get at least a reasonable % of the fruits of your labor but I think these type of dark economics would make it easier to scam the working class, like they are right now. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If they think tax is theft, well.....they&#39;re using tax funded roads, schools, etc.
It seems to me, they just don&#39;t want to share, and feel they are entitled to wealth permanently until they spend it slowly.
I feel that the people that fall for these demented far right libertarian leaders do so because
they feel that &quot;this corrupt government is wasting my taxes on war, let&#39;s cut this crap, I wanna keep my taxes, I refuse to give money to warmongers&quot;.
But of course this view is flawed, since tax can be used for more ethical, benevolant things like education. Corruption is not an excuse to cut all taxation. There is good taxation and bad taxation.
Just as there is good and bad government.</p></li>
<li><p>They sometimes say &quot;the invisible hand of the freemarket will fix everything&quot;
but there&#39;s nothing stronger than the &quot;long arm of the law&quot; (regulation).
So I feel it&#39;s just an excuse to let out a pack of wolves, i.e. corporate and super wealthy tyranny.</p></li>
<li><p>They seem pretty desperate to get rid of social programs. They also seem to push charter schools, which select the best graded students....that&#39;s just elitism, pushing out those who are less likely to succeed (socio-economic status correlates with success). Keeping the peasants out of prestige.
It would also mean that they never have pressure to improve, because they always
get &quot;the top X %&quot; which are likely to succeed even with crappy teaching.
Fixing the entire education system is far more logical and ethical than shutting out the poor
like this.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I took the time to go over the entire thing. While the latter half of it gets a bit too deep into the whole freemason thing for me, the majority of it really speaks to me. I don&#39;t know enough about the subject to comment on the validity of everything but you seem to at least have done your research. I can definitely get behind the idea that this is all a big divide and conquer sham, and we don&#39;t really have a true &#39;left&#39; party in the US. I used to support Democrats because they were on the &#39;other side&#39; of what I perceived as the worse party, but even the Dems have been compromised and throw us a bone every now and then with a minimum wage increase or something. Trump/Hillary was the final straw. I hated Trump but I couldn&#39;t vote for Hillary either.</p>

<p>Thanks for making that, it&#39;s at least opened my eyes a little bit more. I&#39;ll have to read more on the subject and I&#39;ll pass this around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you very much!
It&#39;s been difficult getting exposure for this pres.
I did a lot of research but of course can&#39;t 100% verify the accuracy of the pres but I think
it&#39;s far far more accurate than what people currently think
hence I always see comments online like &quot;U LIBTARD!&quot;
from people who don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re saying because all their political knowledge comes from the corporate media who socially engineer peoples&#39; perceptions on politics to divide and play tennis
with peoples&#39; views between &quot;slightly left of extreme right&quot; and &quot;slightly right of extreme right&quot;
until we hit like NWO fascism. I wouldn&#39;t put it past the psycho elite to do something like that.</p>

<p>At the very least, if someone doesn&#39;t believe what I&#39;m showing them in the pres,
they can research from lots of sites and see who is talking
nonsense and who is being more logical.
Asking political scientists, etc. (I&#39;m not a professional political scientist, I just
research stuff online and connect the dots.)</p>

<p>I really appreciate you looking at all of it and commenting back too.
And yes please do share it, if you find anything that&#39;s inaccurate or makes no sense,
let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks. :)</p>

I never hugely believed in the whole &#39;jews are behind everything&#39; thing, but I&#39;m curious to your thought process here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert here but I would say it&#39;s the powerful zionists (rather than normal Jews down the street) 
that are behind these conspiracies.
It&#39;s clear the Rothschild banking family are zionists and these people probably have the greatest power as they control the money supply.</p>

<p>Not all zionists are Jews and not all Jews are zionists.
Then there&#39;s also the argument of some Jews being fake Jews or something. Something about the Khazarian mafia...</p>

<p>In New York I know there were lots of normal Jews protesting against zionism, which has caused the deaths/oppression of many Palestinians, stolen so much Palestinian land, etc.
It&#39;s like blaming Christians for child abuse stuff that probably happens in the Vatican. I used to think the pope was legit because he said the current economics are unfair or something like that, so I thought he was a true left wing Christian, but then he spoke about a one world government and now I see their real colors.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s the part where I&#39;m not clear on,
why is Israel so important to the elites? Is this is some kind of superiority thing?
Khazarian mafia elites? Satanic Jew superiority?
Just know that, the elites don&#39;t even care about normal Jews, I think George Soros helped the nazis find Jews or something....pretty messed up.
But not shocking since the elite bankers fund both sides of virtually all modern wars, whether allies or axis powers. War is just a scam.</p>

<p>Are satanic Jews a type of Jew? Or did Judaism come from the occultic stuff like the satanic kaballah/Jewish mysticism??
I don&#39;t know, but whether or not normal Judaism is ethical or not, normal Jews have nothing to do with the conspiracies. It&#39;s sort of like saying &quot;I found some horrible stuff in the muslim holy book, therefore they&#39;re all ter..ror...ists&quot;
which is of course nonsense.
Religion is not above criticism, and perhaps most mainstream religions have some dodgy stuff in it, (whether due to imperfect humans, ignorance, making stuff up or sabotage, who knows)
but it still doesn&#39;t mean all muslims are like that or all Jews are like that.</p>

<p>Hope I&#39;m making sense?
Some people think the wailing wall is satanic, thrusting your hips at some wall....it looks satanic, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a normal Jew thing or a satanic/Jewish mysticism thing or whatever.</p>

<p>To really get to the bottom, probably requires historical research into freemasonry, jewish mysticism, the occult, ancient egyptian mystery schools, satanism, etc. Can&#39;t get my head around how blurry the line is between normal Judaism and the satanic stuff.
But even then, there&#39;s another angle, ethnicity.
Whether you consider the Jewish race a real race and not just another form of white or middle eastern, judging people by their phenotype e.g. &quot;he looks like a Jew&quot; and assuming something negative purely because of it e.g. &quot;therefore he&#39;s a -insert messed up stereotype-&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re as confused as me lol.
On YouTube, there&#39;s a guy called brother Nathanael, I think he says some
interesting stuff but I still haven&#39;t come to a solid conclusion.
There are images of elites (Rand Paul, Trump, Obama I think, Bush, etc. etc. etc.) at the wailing wall.
Some people argue that the satanic Jews are not real Jews (one possibility is that Judaism is a false wrapper like calling the satanic catholics &quot;Christian&quot;)
and that they&#39;re Khazars/Khazarian. Hence Khazarian mafia.
But that also seems to be a slippery slope to the argument of &quot;all or most Jews are from Khazaria, modern day Turkey or Georgia&quot; (something like that).</p>

<p>One weird thing about normal Jews (I think, although I don&#39;t know how many types there are, do normal Jews do the wailing wall thing?)
is that there&#39;s a cube thing they wear, which is speculated to have relations to the hexagon/4D cube thing on Saturn:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/MGJZp">http://imgur.com/a/MGJZp</a></p>

<p>I left that stuff out because I thought it was way too speculatory and maybe distracting to the more important narrative that normal Jews aren&#39;t involved.</p>

<p>So many debates in this issue but I guess a fast way to answer the question is asking the Bible, which says:</p>

<p>Revelation 3:9 King James Version (KJV)
<strong>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know much more than that.
Real anti-semitism may have started from the satanists pretending to be Jews, or something like that.
Your guess is as good as mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geopolitics I think it definitely a drama show (at least partially) but I&#39;m not sure how black and white it is, when it comes to Kim. YouTube videos of Gaddafi talking show that &quot;he&#39;s a crazy dictator&quot; is either a complete lie or highly exaggerated (I think he was fairly benevolant and cared about his people, whether he was very authoritarian doing it or if that&#39;s exaggerated, I&#39;m not sure, but the UN murdered him and probably it has something to do with currency, oil, health care polities or something along those lines).</p>

<p>I hate it when the establishment tries to brainwashed us like
&quot;look over there, crazy dictator, while we the elite bankers control most things in society, screwing workers and being warmongers, but never mind that! Look at that random dictator! He hates our freedomz!&quot;.
Interventionalist bastards.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a historian (plus history is full of lies, not sure how much, but a lot, written by the victor),
but it disgusts me when I see stuff from the establishment like
&quot;would you kill baby Hitler??&quot; and the movie The Interview having a fictional version of Kim being blown up in a hellicopter like &quot;YAY MURDER, GO USA USA USA NUMBER WWAAAAHN&quot; propaganda.
These psychopaths want us to be like them.
I don&#39;t care who did what, if Hitler killed 1 million or 6 million.
Murder is murder. The axis/allies are ALL GUILTY IMO, with blood on their hands. History is written by the victor, and all wars are scams, all wars are elite bankers&#39; wars. 
How black and white does it go?
Was Hitler actually against the zionist international bankers?
Or a complete warmonger shill?
Somewhere in between, e.g. manipulated??
Both sides being funded by the elite bankers
makes me question the people that go straight to &quot;Hitler was right!!!&quot;
as well as people who go &quot;Hitler was the worst human on Earth, kill baby Hitler, he deserves it!!!&quot;.
Both extremes disgust me.</p>

<p>If I met Hitler, I&#39;d want to hear his side of it, maybe he&#39;d lie, but I wouldn&#39;t kill baby Hitler or any other disgusting establishment propaganda.
No one would have had to die had the elite bankers not started the wars. These secret society pieces of shit have caused virtually all suffering on Earth in modern times. Satanic ass kissing, possessed cretins. -_-
Hate not the puppets, hate the elites pulling the strings.</p>

<p>That said, I currently think Kim is probably neither an angel nor a full devil, maybe like Putin.
(Or it could be they&#39;re sociopaths who care about the people....in a sociopath kind of way? I don&#39;t know.)
For all I know, it could all be a drama show (I&#39;m not sure if Russia actually nationalized their Rothschild controlled central bank or if that&#39;s propaganda and Rothschild still controls it. Requires more research I guess).</p>

<p>But I currently think North Korea is a dictatorship to avoid CIA spies infiltrating it.
It doesn&#39;t excuse any messed up stuff Kim supposedly does, but I&#39;m just saying it could be
like dangerous men protecting people from even worse men like the elite bankers.
(Not that lesser evil vs worse evil crap is legit, but some elites want the NWO globalist fascist dictatorship.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know, I like to keep an open mind.
But never buy into the &quot;die for your country, go to war!&quot;
because all wars are bankers&#39; wars and a profiteering blood sport for the elites, it&#39;s disgusting.</p>

I never thought to question whether Kim controls North Korea.
What makes you question it?
I think it&#39;s good that people like you are asking these outside the box type questions, though. Because you never know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not an expert here but I would say it&#39;s the powerful zionists (rather than normal Jews down the street) 
that are behind these conspiracies.
It&#39;s clear the Rothschild banking family are zionists and these people probably have the greatest power as they control the money supply.</p>

<p>Not all zionists are Jews and not all Jews are zionists.
Then there&#39;s also the argument of some Jews being fake Jews or something. Something about the Khazarian mafia...</p>

<p>In New York I know there were lots of normal Jews protesting against zionism, which has caused the deaths/oppression of many Palestinians, stolen so much Palestinian land, etc.
It&#39;s like blaming Christians for child abuse stuff that probably happens in the Vatican. I used to think the pope was legit because he said the current economics are unfair or something like that, so I thought he was a true left wing Christian, but then he spoke about a one world government and now I see their real colors.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s the part where I&#39;m not clear on,
why is Israel so important to the elites? Is this is some kind of superiority thing?
Khazarian mafia elites? Satanic Jew superiority?
Just know that, the elites don&#39;t even care about normal Jews, I think George Soros helped the nazis find Jews or something....pretty messed up.
But not shocking since the elite bankers fund both sides of virtually all modern wars, whether allies or axis powers. War is just a scam.</p>

<p>Are satanic Jews a type of Jew? Or did Judaism come from the occultic stuff like the satanic kaballah/Jewish mysticism??
I don&#39;t know, but whether or not normal Judaism is ethical or not, normal Jews have nothing to do with the conspiracies. It&#39;s sort of like saying &quot;I found some horrible stuff in the muslim holy book, therefore they&#39;re all ter..ror...ists&quot;
which is of course nonsense.
Religion is not above criticism, and perhaps most mainstream religions have some dodgy stuff in it, (whether due to imperfect humans, ignorance, making stuff up or sabotage, who knows)
but it still doesn&#39;t mean all muslims are like that or all Jews are like that.</p>

<p>Hope I&#39;m making sense?
Some people think the wailing wall is satanic, thrusting your hips at some wall....it looks satanic, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a normal Jew thing or a satanic/Jewish mysticism thing or whatever.</p>

<p>To really get to the bottom, probably requires historical research into freemasonry, jewish mysticism, the occult, ancient egyptian mystery schools, satanism, etc. Can&#39;t get my head around how blurry the line is between normal Judaism and the satanic stuff.
But even then, there&#39;s another angle, ethnicity.
Whether you consider the Jewish race a real race and not just another form of white or middle eastern, judging people by their phenotype e.g. &quot;he looks like a Jew&quot; and assuming something negative purely because of it e.g. &quot;therefore he&#39;s a -insert messed up stereotype-&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re as confused as me lol.
On YouTube, there&#39;s a guy called brother Nathanael, I think he says some
interesting stuff but I still haven&#39;t come to a solid conclusion.
There are images of elites (Rand Paul, Trump, Obama I think, Bush, etc. etc. etc.) at the wailing wall.
Some people argue that the satanic Jews are not real Jews (one possibility is that Judaism is a false wrapper like calling the satanic catholics &quot;Christian&quot;)
and that they&#39;re Khazars/Khazarian. Hence Khazarian mafia.
But that also seems to be a slippery slope to the argument of &quot;all or most Jews are from Khazaria, modern day Turkey or Georgia&quot; (something like that).</p>

<p>One weird thing about normal Jews (I think, although I don&#39;t know how many types there are, do normal Jews do the wailing wall thing?)
is that there&#39;s a cube thing they wear, which is speculated to have relations to the hexagon/4D cube thing on Saturn:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/MGJZp">http://imgur.com/a/MGJZp</a></p>

<p>I left that stuff out because I thought it was way too speculatory and maybe distracting to the more important narrative that normal Jews aren&#39;t involved.</p>

<p>So many debates in this issue but I guess a fast way to answer the question is asking the Bible, which says:</p>

<p>Revelation 3:9 King James Version (KJV)
<strong>Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know much more than that.
Real anti-semitism may have started from the satanists pretending to be Jews, or something like that.
Your guess is as good as mine. </p>
