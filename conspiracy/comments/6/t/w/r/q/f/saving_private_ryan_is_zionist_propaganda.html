The cowardly American soldier is meant to represent America standing by and doing nothing while the Holocaust happened. The message is basically that America waited too long to intervene to stop the Nazis.
This isn&#39;t the first Zionist propaganda film by Spielberg. Munich is an absolutely unapologetic revenge fantasy about the Munich Massacre. The film totally ignores the complexity of the situation and the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinians. Spielberg in my opinion is one of the most shameful directors in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Your first comment, including the trailing periods:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The guy who was stabbed was American...</p>

<p>So either you&#39;re wasting time by reiterating an obvious fact that only someone who didn&#39;t watch the movie wouldn&#39;t know, or you were trying to posit a rebuttal that the person stabbed wasn&#39;t Jewish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know Israel wasn&#39;t around yet, right?</p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t even a concern in this chain of comments. Jewish people also existed before modern-day Israel. Have fun confusing the fuck out of other people on your own.</p>

<p>I think this entire thing is going over your head. The Jewish-American soldier still represents Jewish people even though he&#39;s fighting with U.S. forces in this movie. He&#39;s ethnically Jewish and I think OP is pretty close to being right. The state of Israel was also in planning long before the end of WW2. The Balfour Declaration was written in 1917 so it doesn&#39;t really matter whether modern-day Israel was formally recognized yet.</p>

<p>The guy being Jewish DEFINITELY wasn&#39;t just an interesting plot line, but a more diabolical shot at the United States for not saving the Jews and forming Israel quicker. Got it!</p>

<p>Rocky was a best friend of Apollo, the African-American you&#39;re referring to. He didn&#39;t kill him. There are some theories that the Rocky movies were anti-communist propaganda.</p>

<p>In other news. You were either wrong this whole time and trying to appear like you weren&#39;t, or you&#39;ve never watched Saving Private Ryan and just ran your mouth to try and make a conspiracy theorist (on r/conspiracy) look dumb.

<p>That was because the US declared war on Japan. They were allies at the time. Convenient, huh? Pearl Harbor was a false flag. We instigated it, and then let it happen.</p>

<p>Even if pearl harbour was baited it doesn&#39;t matter. Japan attacked America so of course they declared war (japan did so the next day). Germany wasn&#39;t obliged to also declare war on the US, just as Japan didn&#39;t declare war on the USSR. So yeah Hitler&#39;s stupidity was convenient</p>

<p>They probably would&#39;ve still done that, but it wouldn&#39;t be as hostile. Why did we help them, in order to demonize them? Prior to WWII the US was not a super power. After, we were. Hence the hostilities between the two powers. That was by design. Once again, see Switzerland.</p>

<p>Your answer ignores that the japanese and soviets only went to war in &#39;45, showing they weren&#39;t bound to fight the Soviets. Historians agree there was no real reason to declare war on the US, probably was a mix of Hitler&#39;s antisemitism and ego that led to it.

<p>What do you mean by war propaganda? </p>

<p>Firstly threatening American long term security in the Pacific. Only really need to lose a couple of islands to completely lose control. Also the phillipines was an american satellite/ puppet</p>

<p>Yeah, I already acknowledged that FDR and his crew were expecting a possible attack against the United States at some point. We already knew what side we were on in the war before we were even in it, as did Japan. </p>

<p>I asked for evidence that they specifically knew Pearl Harbor was going to be attacked when it was, and how it was. You seem to believe that Roosevelt knew specifically that Pearl Harbor was going to get hit. I&#39;m asking for that proof.

<p>How are you getting that from what I said? Poland had no choice in the matter regardless of whether the US intervened. They are squished between the two powers (Germany - Russia).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it would&#39;ve been better or worse. There fate really had nothing to do with the US intervention. One could say, the US intervention made it worse, being that it was under Soviet control after the war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well all of the interpretations I could make lead to the same conclusion then. You don&#39;t actually understand history.</p>

<p>You need to read up on nazi racial theory, the soviets were far kinder to poland than the nazis would have been. To the nazis all poles are sub human. Indeed poland was going to be &#39;cleansed&#39; of much of its population to make way for German settlers </p>

<p>Yes English is my first language, I tried to give you benefit of the doubt as I couldn&#39;t imagine someone seriously claiming poland would be better off controlled by the nazis</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they would&#39;ve been better off, it&#39;s subjective. I have horror stories from both sides in my family. The Russians have a longer history of disgust with the Polish than Germany does. Both hated the Polish for some reason, maybe it&#39;s because <em>we are the superior race</em>. <sup>kidding</sup></p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;m well informed about history, being that is what I do (historian). I also have intimate accounts via personal family history. Many documents and as well as verbal accounts. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it is of my opinion that the US should&#39;ve stayed out of the war. By not, is why we are in most of the shit we are today, along with the others we&#39;ve fought. I am of this belief:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read nazi racial theory. The slavs were to be exterminated on qn enormous scale. Of course as a historian I&#39;m sure you understand nazi racial beliefs... and yes I exaggerate but there would be only a tiny number. Mainly slaves of some kind.</p>

<p>Yes. Because historians can&#39;t understand the holocaust solely from survivors. Again I&#39;m sure you understand this as a historian </p>

<p>Ah good, so you understand the racial theory, lebens raum (both of which called for mass murder)? That&#39;s good</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is simply not true. There were ideas circulating for extermination, but assimilation was the chosen one for the Slavic people (Polish being highly desirable). Not saying that is good or anything, but to say Hitler wanted to exterminate Slavs is flat out wrong. They killed Jewish-Poles, sure, but Slavs were seen in high regard to Hitler. There are documents and writings that outline this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incorrect because it assumes that the US entered WW2 and the European theatre in order to stop the Holocaust. Any notion that the US entered WW2 for reasons other than to assert its own geopolitical status on the globe is all lies. Also, the US did not wait to declare war on Germany out of cowardice but as a strategic move to allow the Soviet Union to be weakened by the Nazis.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Israel&#39;s consul general in Los Angeles, Ehud Danoch, emerged from an advance screening and promptly denounced the film in a series of interviews as &quot;presumptuous&quot; and &quot;superficial&quot;.</p>

<p>Accusing Spielberg and his team of putting Mossad and the Palestinian guerrilla group Black September on the same moral plane, he complained: &quot;This is an incorrect moral equation. We in Israel know this.&quot;</p>

<p>Yesterday, after several days of doubt over whether he was speaking officially or merely giving his personal reaction, Mr Danoch&#39;s remarks were fully backed up by the Israeli foreign ministry, according to a report in the entertainment newspaper Variety. </p>
