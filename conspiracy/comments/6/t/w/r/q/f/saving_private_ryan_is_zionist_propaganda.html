       Consider one of the final scenes in the movie (spoiler) where the Jewish guy is slowly stabbed in the heart by the Nazi, while the cowardly American stands by and does nothing. The cowardly American soldier is meant to represent America standing by and doing nothing while the Holocaust happened. The message is basically that America waited too long to intervene to stop the Nazis.
This isn't the first Zionist propaganda film by Spielberg. Munich is an absolutely unapologetic revenge fantasy about the Munich Massacre. The film totally ignores the complexity of the situation and the crimes committed by Israel against Palestinians. Spielberg in my opinion is one of the most shameful directors in Hollywood.

        Private Stanley Mellish was a supporting character in the film, Saving Private Ryan. He was a

       He was speaking English and fighting with U.S. forces alongside the protagonist. Unless OP hasn't ever watched the movie that doesn't make any sense. I'm not doing a back and forth with your ego here. Sometimes you need to grow a pair and admit when you're wrong.

       Your first comment, including the trailing periods:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The guy who was stabbed was American...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So either you're wasting time by reiterating an obvious fact that only someone who didn't watch the movie wouldn't know, or you were trying to posit a rebuttal that the person stabbed wasn't Jewish.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You know Israel wasn't around yet, right?
       </p>

      <p>
       That wasn't even a concern in this chain of comments. Jewish people also existed before modern-day Israel. Have fun confusing the fuck out of other people on your own.

      <p>
       I think this entire thing is going over your head. The Jewish-American soldier still represents Jewish people even though he's fighting with U.S. forces in this movie. He's ethnically Jewish and I think OP is pretty close to being right. The state of Israel was also in planning long before the end of WW2. The Balfour Declaration was written in 1917 so it doesn't really matter whether modern-day Israel was formally recognized yet.

       Rocky was Italian. He must represent Italy. Does that mean all of his movies were about Italy destroying black people and Russians? Hmm, you and OP might be on to something.

      <p>
       The guy being Jewish DEFINITELY wasn't just an interesting plot line, but a more diabolical shot at the United States for not saving the Jews and forming Israel quicker. Got it!

       Rocky was a best friend of Apollo, the African-American you're referring to. He didn't kill him. There are some theories that the Rocky movies were anti-communist propaganda.

       In other news. You were either wrong this whole time and trying to appear like you weren't, or you've never watched Saving Private Ryan and just ran your mouth to try and make a conspiracy theorist (on r/conspiracy) look dumb. Either way you're incredibly difficult to converse with and I'm done here.

       This whole thing just went over your head dude. OP never implied Stanley Mellish wasn't an American and only someone who hasn't watched the movie would say something absurd like that. He was a Jewish American not being helped by a Caucasian American. It doesn't matter that they're both fighting with U.S. forces. Stanley Mellish still represents the Jews in OP's theory.

       It didn't go over my head. I think he's making something out to be nothing. That Nazi soldier then walked down the stairs past the American. Does that mean we were secretly friends with the Nazis? Theories can be made up about anything.

       That was because the US declared war on Japan. They were allies at the time. Convenient, huh? Pearl Harbor was a false flag. We instigated it, and then let it happen.

       Even if pearl harbour was baited it doesn't matter. Japan attacked America so of course they declared war (japan did so the next day). Germany wasn't obliged to also declare war on the US, just as Japan didn't declare war on the USSR. So yeah Hitler's stupidity was convenient

       They probably would've still done that, but it wouldn't be as hostile. Why did we help them, in order to demonize them? Prior to WWII the US was not a super power. After, we were. Hence the hostilities between the two powers. That was by design. Once again, see Switzerland.

       Nazism was the bigger threat than communism. America would have become a superpower in anycase I believe. The public didn't like communism at all, look back to the red scare. By design?
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan invaded Britain, their rapid expansion into the pacific threatened America. To stop even more expansion the US put in place an oil embargo
      </p>
      <p>
       Your answer ignores that the japanese and soviets only went to war in '45, showing they weren't bound to fight the Soviets. Historians agree there was no real reason to declare war on the US, probably was a mix of Hitler's antisemitism and ego that led to it. Especially since the declaration was at the same fime as the germans failed to capture moscow.

       Nazism has mass murder built into its ideology. Plus it wasn't communism but nazism which had nearly totally destroyed all of the democracies in europe.

       Agreed it is debatable but no need I can see to get distracted by it for this discussion.

      <p>
       What do you mean by war propaganda?

      <p>
       Firstly threatening American long term security in the Pacific. Only really need to lose a couple of islands to completely lose control. Also the phillipines was an american satellite/ puppet
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet is still the norm. Do you admit then that germany had no more duties to declare on the US as Japan had to declare on the USSR?

       I'm doubtful really. The US didn't do much to squash Germany, but it
       <em>

       keep Japan busy, which made a big difference in Russia's strategic situation.

       Well first of all the arctic convoys supplied from 4-10% of the USSR's equipment, mainly American. Maybe Britain could have done something in the style of DDay but I'm not sure it would have been in time and would have been far easier to repel. Also without America sitting on their border with nukes there wouldn't be that much stopping the red army marching to the Atlantic

       There is no evidence that Russia or Germany would've taken over the US if we didn't intervene. Complete propaganda to further justify a needless war founded on lies. There was no Holocaust, it was all about money and Western hegemony, and the creation of Israel. That was one of the last nails in the coffin for the Republic.

       The US instigated Japan via sanctions (among other things). The US knew that Japan was going to attack via intelligence, and allowed it to happened. This of course, was at the highest of ranks. As for the Nazis, up until that point, the majority of the US didn't want another world war. They felt Europe should handle their own problems, being that we were isolated from Europe on another continent. People were far more anti-war back then, believe it or not.
      </p>

       As for my ancestors, yes. Poland was raped by both sides. Sadly, either way the Polish usually get the shit deal throughout history. They've fought for their independence for thousands of years, in one form or another. Poland was a hell hole under the Soviets rule, so staying out of the war would've probably been better for them, imo.

       Evidence. Yes, there was information that leaked that Japan was focused on our West coast, but how can you prove he KNEW (like you said) that Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor when they did? FDR and his cabinet considered declaring war on Japan the night before Pearl Harbor as well.

       After the war we were under Communist rule. Not sure if you're from the East or West, but my family in the East were being genocided by the Soviets. That fact that you do not know that, makes me ashamed to share common ancestry

       I have ancestors that were assassinated, raped, and murdered

       That section of the Wikipedia article that you believe is evidence contradicts itself many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I already acknowledged that FDR and his crew were expecting a possible attack against the United States at some point. We already knew what side we were on in the war before we were even in it, as did Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked for evidence that they specifically knew Pearl Harbor was going to be attacked when it was, and how it was. You seem to believe that Roosevelt knew specifically that Pearl Harbor was going to get hit. I'm asking for that proof. There is more legitimacy to the argument that Britain knew more specifics about the attack in advance than Roosevelt.

       I'm not saying it would've been better or worse. There fate really had nothing to do with the US intervention. One could say, the US intervention made it worse, being that it was under Soviet control after the war.

       You need to read up on nazi racial theory, the soviets were far kinder to poland than the nazis would have been. To the nazis all poles are sub human. Indeed poland was going to be 'cleansed' of much of its population to make way for German settlers

       I never said they would've been better off, it's subjective. I have horror stories from both sides in my family. The Russians have a longer history of disgust with the Polish than Germany does. Both hated the Polish for some reason, maybe it's because
       <em>
        we are the superior race

       Anyways, I'm well informed about history, being that is what I do (historian). I also have intimate accounts via personal family history. Many documents and as well as verbal accounts.

       At the end of the day, it is of my opinion that the US should've stayed out of the war. By not, is why we are in most of the shit we are today, along with the others we've fought. I am of this belief:

       Read nazi racial theory. The slavs were to be exterminated on qn enormous scale. Of course as a historian I'm sure you understand nazi racial beliefs... and yes I exaggerate but there would be only a tiny number. Mainly slaves of some kind.
      </p>

       Yes. Because historians can't understand the holocaust solely from survivors. Again I'm sure you understand this as a historian

      <p>
       That is simply not true. There were ideas circulating for extermination, but assimilation was the chosen one for the Slavic people (Polish being highly desirable). Not saying that is good or anything, but to say Hitler wanted to exterminate Slavs is flat out wrong. They killed Jewish-Poles, sure, but Slavs were seen in high regard to Hitler. There are documents and writings that outline this.

       It's incorrect because it assumes that the US entered WW2 and the European theatre in order to stop the Holocaust. Any notion that the US entered WW2 for reasons other than to assert its own geopolitical status on the globe is all lies. Also, the US did not wait to declare war on Germany out of cowardice but as a strategic move to allow the Soviet Union to be weakened by the Nazis.

       <p>
        Two weeks ago, Israel's consul general in Los Angeles, Ehud Danoch, emerged from an advance screening and promptly denounced the film in a series of interviews as "presumptuous" and "superficial".
       </p>
       <p>
        Accusing Spielberg and his team of putting Mossad and the Palestinian guerrilla group Black September on the same moral plane, he complained: "This is an incorrect moral equation. We in Israel know this."
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, after several days of doubt over whether he was speaking officially or merely giving his personal reaction, Mr Danoch's remarks were fully backed up by the Israeli foreign ministry, according to a report in the entertainment newspaper Variety.

       How are you getting that from what I said? Poland had no choice in the matter regardless of whether the US intervened. They are squished between the two powers (Germany - Russia).

       I'm not saying it would've been better or worse. There fate really had nothing to do with the US intervention. One could say, the US intervention made it worse, being that it was under Soviet control after the war.
