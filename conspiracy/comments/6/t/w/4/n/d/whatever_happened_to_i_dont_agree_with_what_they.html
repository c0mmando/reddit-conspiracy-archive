       I'm not saying that what some people say is correct or right or wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       just making the casual observation that censorship will increase rather than decrease potential audience and inherently, like the drug war or prohibition, will not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       censorship is just the prohibition of ideas, and trying to prohibit thought, for good or bad reasons, will usually have the inverse effect on society better to just leave it alone, and let it take care of itself through example. if the ideas really are inherently bad and wrong, they usually will not succeed

       people's attitudes about it. I see black people with white hate on FB, I see white people with anti-Nazi Hate on FB, all clamoring collectively for and end to the first amendment, and direct persecution of these people for speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think this huge polarization caused by censorship could be avoided, and also that it serves to further divide and conquer and cement these groups into the ground as 'martyrs' in a sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really think the most effective course of action is often NO course of action at all.

      <p>
       terrorist attacks? show them they don't phase us as we sing hymns about our valiant dead entering Valhalla or some shit. make it ridiculous. it will have no effect.

      <p>
       in a lot of senses, turning the other cheek makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is a point where action must be taken, but over the shit its happened over, it wasn't that point yet.

       You're entitled to your opinion but that doesn't mean others have to listen to your bullshit. Private people and businesses can choose to ignore you if they wish. What you're referring to is not censorship, it's censure and that's exactly how these things should be handled. The government can't lock you up for saying what you want but the people can decide that your opinions are not welcome.

       If a muslim cleric was preaching hate and extremism against American interests, would you allow him to have a open platform to address the nation to continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you said 'yes' to this, then what if every month, you witness thousands of people converting to Islam and carrying out attacks as a result of his preaching. Would you still allow him to continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tolerance and freedom are very important, but there has to be a line where you say that someone's speech is a genuine danger to others and must be curtailed - exactly the same as why we can't yell "Fire!" as a prank in a cinema.

       It will always attract a nutter or two.  Same with any other group.  Let them speak, though, so people can hear how distasteful the message is.  Same with religious messages.  I encourage people to read from the Bible and Quran, as long as they do not omit the batshit insane passages.

       Shit I grew up in a tiny predominantly white Midwest town and we just had a guy a year older then me, who self-radicalized (even gave himself a Muslim name) and was busted trying to buy machine guns and hand grenades for an "alleged attack" he was planning in support of Isis....

       I am assuming you mean in the US.  That would not be Constitutionally protected Free Speech because it would be inciting violence.  However, go ahead and let him speak.  People will see him for what he is, and he will be exposed.
      </p>

       Yes, you are right.  Yelling "Fire" in a cinema is also not protected Free Speech.  There is case law regarding that.

       So then how is a group, that preaches that I'm subhuman and my life is worthless, that idolizes a group that murdered millions through deliberate genocide, and comes to rallies armed, not inciting violence? They're not only inciting violence they are prepared in inflict it.

       The argument I have against that, is saying it and doing it are two different things. I understand how odd that sounds, I really do. But if we try to stop something horrible by not allowing people to talk about it, it's borderline Minority Report. That's a dangerous road to go down.

       Thanks. Times seems to have changed. Wasn't that during the times when the the south was mostly democratic? Over time groups change and currently I don't see a lot of effort on part of the nra supporting blacks rights to own guns.

       I haven't looked up the history of the nra either. Need to remember that groups change their views over time. Teddy Roosevelt and the republicans were in favor of national parks and monuments. They also controlled the congress and President (I think) when the income tax was passed primarily because it was felt that under current laws the rich were not paying their share if taxes.

       They've gone to bat for legal gun owners literally hundreds of times. The guy was a lawful gun owner with a license to carry - something the NRA themselves have helped pass legislation in favor of in many states.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your entire organization is built around advocating for gun rights and a lawful gun owner is killed while legally carrying, it would make sense for that organization to defend that person. Would it not?

       No, he wasn't. As part of obtaining a firearms permit they ask if you use illegal drugs.  He had thc in his sustem at the time of death, and his girlfriend admitted they had been smoking and had weed in the car. So to make this extra clear, gun + drugs = illegal.

       They don't, but when the cops shoot someone who was legally carrying a firearm and the cop said he thought the guy was going for his gun, I would expect them to defend him regardless of race (as they have many times in the past). They didn't.

       It is the norm, but the NRA does not follow the norm.  Who is the #1 donor to the NRA and where does the money come from?  It's a simple question with a complicated answer that does NOT involve plutocrats.

       The punchline is that the NRA is grassroots funded by pass through donations.  MidwayUSA has a program to round up purchases and have it passed through to the NRA, and many other firearms companies have copied the program.  So, even the donations that appear to be from corporations are really just passed through from customers.

       They tend not to comment on political events, mass shootings, and individual shootings.  When they do comment, it is usually quite a while afterwards, and the comments are reserved.  They did not stand up for Philando, but that is not their purpose nor anything unusual for them.

       Nevertheless, the NRA was one of the first organizations to recognize black equality, they remain one of the most diverse conservative organizations, and their support of minority rights continues.

       Seriously, where the fuck was that guy during Obama's presidency where the NRA isn't getting political? They were blasting ad's all over the country saying Obama was coming for your guns. They've been pumping out propaganda and fear-mongering for years now.

       I paid attention very closely.  That's why I used the example I used.  Weimar Germany had strict hate speech laws, which were applied quite aggressively against the Nazis.  It didn't work.  Instead, once the Nazis came into power, they used the existing hate speech laws to consolidate their power and social control.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you deny speech to Nazis, (a) it doesn't work and (b) the muzzle will be in your own mouth before you know it.  That is why the ACLU is defending the Unite the Right rally, and you should be, too.

       Well your point is moot because we don't have hate speech laws. The government isn't denying their right to assemble. Society and private citizens need to show them that their views are disgusting they don't feel embolden by the president. No one should feel like they have to defend Nazis and the intolerant. The only people that feel that way are Nazi sympathizers. Private citizens aren't the ACLU, and the ACLU speaks out against racists just like they did today regarding ex-sheriff arpaio.

       Actually, the government DID deny their right to assemble, which is why the ACLU is defending them.

       That doesn't justify violence, nor incitement of violence.

       Is it the media's fault that the typical human does not want to change its mind on anything? Or that the typical human does not want to search for

       Turning the other cheek is actually a Biblical saying. Jesus, in a parable (can't recall which one) mentioned turning your face and presenting your other cheek to expose the master's cruelty. Most people take that phrase out of context, like it's some sort of "peaceful" thing. In actuality, it's an act of non-violent defiance against oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when I heard that explanation in my early 20's, it changed the way I viewed Jesus and other Biblical teaching. Made me despise the religion and how they twisted these radical and inspiring concepts from Christ into something so toothless and safe. Stupid christians...ruinin shit just for the sake of it.

       Yep. All the money changers and thieving businessmen that setup shop in the Temple. IIRC the Jewish leadership of the time were taking cuts from them, and paying off the Roman tax collectors to keep the peace. Jesus saw it, got pissed, and rained Holy Hell upon them.

       I hear ya man. So many people look at these qualites as a weekness now. Its been happening for awhile but it really ramped up after 911. We didnt want to be weak, we wanted a Jon Wayne to shoot first and ask questions later. To see nuance was for pansies, we wanted someone decisive, no matter if it was the right decision or not.

       yes...your points dovetail perfectly with my post yesterday about humble hunters versus duplicitous storytellers; a dynamic dating back to prehistory. 99% gun owners are too honorable to threaten anyone with their arsenal, and leftzis running their mouth (because their chicken arms are too weak for real firepower) know they can use this virtue against gunowners. They squawk absolute nonsense because theyre psychotic, and incite braindead henchman to harass gunowners, who are their most powerful "opponents"

       That sounds like something a NATZI would say!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       The poison in our national discourse is pretty disturbing.  People are losing their friggin minds over fairly unimportant shit.  Seeing a video of the "Nazi" march in the city...  holy hell.  It's pretty sad when an angry mob of violent SJW's makes stupid Nazi racists look calm and civilized.  What is the world coming to?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a small group of Muslims did a small rally in the city, and were surrounded by mobs of angry violent white people, waving weapons at them, threatening and attacking them, then the framing would be a whole lot different.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's "natzis", so let's all lose our shit.

       Yep.  And as you can see yourself, it's a pretty predictable reaction.  People have an instinct to defend someone they feel is being wronged, and it works on both sides.

       Give people an enemy.  Give them weapons.  Let the rest take care of itself.  I hope this nonsense blows over, but it feels like we could be at a boiling point.  But then again... it always does, so who knows.

       Ironically, most of the ISIS supporters in America live in Washington D.C.  They even pay these guys, and give them supplies and air support, to spread their mercenary terror wherever they're needed.  So a mob of angry people going after
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       ISIS supporters would be a great step for all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But equating ISIS with these modern "neo-nazi" morons is hopelessly misguided.  One is currently wreaking havoc in the middle East, murdering, displacing, and terrorizing anyone the CIA tells them to.  The other is a group of small minded racists with no political or military clout whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       These aren't your grandfather Nazis (who mostly moved into the U.S. government after the war, anyway).  These are just dumb hicks who think their skin color gives them some special place in the world.

       I saw a video someone in the antifa crowd took, showing them stalking a group of neonatz, waving clubs and sticks at them up close, feigning hitting them.  Yelling threatening shit the whole way.  After a few minutes, they picked one off who was at the end of the group, started beating him, then a scuffle broke out.

       A whole lot of that wasn't violence. If that's the video I'm thinking of, it's the one that ends up with 6 white supremacists knocking an unarmed black guy on the ground and beating him with pipes/bats/planks in a parking deck, right?

       That's my natural reaction, to be honest.  Shutting down someone's speech through disruption and violence and strawman depictions?  They must have some uncomfortable yet logically sound things to say.  If not, it would be simple to show how foolish their ideas are through debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't let a group speak normally, the only times someone is typically introduced to their ideas will be without context for added perspective or the opposing points which can be used to poke large holes in their controversial arguments.

       part of keeping things civil is allowing people to be debate, and to be THRASHED in debates.

       the minute you make the debate itself illegal or censored in any way, you lend it more strength than it ever had on its own.

       private companies actions are complete irrelevant to this suggestion. forcing them to host them would be infringing on those companies rights to free speech and who they are willing to support with their services.

       look at how traffic tickets and law enforcement have become glorified tax collectors. at first, the laws were there for good reason -- stop crime, protect people.

       eventually it became about using those laws to feed the state income.

       It's said many people tend to vote with their pocketbooks.  I believe society would be better if people treated voting as a way to help optimize society at large, like a real world cooperative sim game.  But that's probably just speaking philosophically from a position of privilege to be able to even entertain that thought, let alone put it into practice.

       There's a relevant quote that comes to mind.  Something like, "It's the mark of a civilized mind to entertain an idea without believing it."  Unfortunately so many people nowadays are taking arguments they disagree with as personal attacks on their core self.  Though to be fair, I seem to have a few hot button issues myself.

       Social Media happened, and now everyone is offended by fucking everything. It's so frustrating to see how many people on facebook are arguing over the dumbest shit, and jumping down each others throats when someone says something "you" dont agree with. When thats exactly what the people in power want, to keep the population distracted from the real issues at hand.

       Being a neonazi means you support Hitler's rule and ideals. His rule was totalitarian. It was a dictatorship. During a dictatorship you don't have freedom of speech. So defending neonazi's right to speak whatever they want is counterproductive and frankly insanely stupid.

       Its perfect. The hypocrisy is on display and understood by every intellect in society. Look what happen this weekend. How many people have brought a disapproving light to their approval and cause. These people aren't  just going to wake up and change there ideology, i would rather have them protesting and demonstrating in public view then. Behind closed doors or in secret. The amount of the protestors is also important. It demonstrates the amount of members who find their  ideas socially acceptable, which create counter protests. It is imperative and essential in a free society to allow people to speak and demonstrate, without fear of violance and retaliation.

       As for immigration it's actually surprisingly hard to get in actually although that seems to be changing fast thanks to our fearless leader and his father before him (and I don't mean castro). He is like the posterboy for the NWO or whatever your preferred noun for the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The immigration issue doesn't play well with me not because I am against immigration actually I feel quite the opposite on that particular topic. I think immigration isn't such a bad thing but that's a whole other argument.

       It totally and 100% agree with ya.  There are various groups and organizations i detest. Watching then on tv protest stupid ideas or hold disturbing and unethical visuals just increases my dislike for them. I would rather have them out front in plain view then hiding in the shadows. Its there right, to demonstrate and organize and its our freedom to do so that so important here. 
If we stop allowing people to speak and assemble freely without the threat of violence or retribution for doing so we are on our way to losing those freedoms.

       I very much agree with you. if things are out in the open people know when a real danger can occur and can watch out for themselves.

       I bet you a cornered, desperate grouping of actual neo-Nazi and clansmen in secret is far more destructive than anything that is done in the open.

       same with shit like soros and BLM at the same time. all he does is take people who already feel cornered, offer them a paycheck a ride and a hot meal, and incite them into similar behavior.

       in history I remember being told about people debating actions and so on, at this point it feels like we are all along for the ride with no clue where this train is heading.
      </p>
      <p>
       all debates, really, seem to be handled behind closed doors by small groups of independent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       really, I'm unsure people even know how to debate in the mainstream anymore, or are willing to argue and take the passion and emotion and personal interest out of it enough to have a logical, coherent debate between sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really believe this was by design, and is a major problem in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       we simply cannot setup public forums and debate anything without torching each other over what basically amount to 'petty religious squabbles' in a fancy modern new dress

       the whole "slippery slope" argument is bullshit here. The line is not hard to draw. Free speech is protected, until you start advocating for violence against your fellow citizens - when that happens, it is your fellow citizens who deserve the protection.

       That's not what you said. You said Nazis have no right to speak. And you actually don't understand the first amendment. They have a right to say anything they want EXCEPT an eminent and credible threat of violence. It is not illegal to say "I want all black people to die" but it is illegal to say, to black people while holding a gun, "I'm gonna shoot you now".
      </p>
      <p>
       And I love how you say it is bullshit. Go look at Europe. They're loaded with hate speech and speech codes. It's illegal to misgender someone in Canada.

       So you don't agree Europe has expanded their hate speech laws and speech codes? You don't agree Google and FB are cracking down on speech
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       deem "offensive"? Are you denying facts, because that's what these are -- verifiable facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you saying what they're doing is okay because you agree with them? And what happens when you don't agree with them? Should I mention all the people suspended from FB for saying "Kill All Men" and shit who are now outraged it happened even though those are the rules them, and you, seem to be advocating for? But that's not something that will happen, though, because it's a "hard line".. you know, the line
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about American campuses? What about public universities, getting tax dollars, no platforming people who have a
       <em>
        legal
       </em>
       right to speak? What about public campuses making "free speech" zones, saying free speech can only happen in
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       zones? Are these things that are not happening or are these things you agree with because you happen to side with the current elites? Would you have felt the same way about these same laws 100 years ago when the bible thumpers were in charge?
      </p>
      <p>
       The minute you say someone else can't have free speech, then nobody has it. It's really not that hard, and it's something that has been proven -- time and again -- throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       On that note, I find your use of cussing towards me to be a form of violence. Looks like you don't get your speech rights... whoops!

       Also, maybe you should research what happens to ideas when you force them underground. You don't stamp out by ideas by making them unspeakable, you stamp them out by forcing them to be spoken.

       But hey, if you truly believe you'll end bigotry by just making it all illegal and shutting up the bigots .. go for it. I'll reserve my right to say I told you so.

       And, for the record, you misunderstand freedom of speech in America. I absolutely have a protected right to say I believe women are lesser, that we should beat our wives, that non whites should die, etc. I only don't have a right to a clear and eminent threat.

       You are defending racism, not freedom of speech, asswipe. Can someone threaten the president? No. Can someone yell "Fire!" in a crowded building and get away with it? Can a football player kneel down during the National Anthem and lose his job because of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech in this country has never been free and outlawing racism in all its forms has shit to do with tampering with freedom of speech. Point. Blank. Period.

       I'm not saying Nazis are made up Boogeyman, I'm saying your argument is a straw man. You being from the south doesn't  make you an authority on this subject. You're attacking an argument that I'm not making and will never make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inciting a panic by yelling "bomb" or "fire" or making a credible threat towards a public figure is in no way, shape, or form comparable to having racist opinions and voicing them in a public forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing I'm claiming is that racist opinions are protected by free speech (they are, this is a demonstrable fact) and that we must protect free speech. Once you ban the speech of a group because of it's hateful content, it paves the way for the banning of any speech for
       <em>
        insert reason here

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Jusr because I'm defending the right of free speech does not mean I'm defending the thoughts of fucking Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, really? My mom? Ever hear of ad hominem? Ironically I was reading this thread on long commute and asked her opinion on the matter. Guess what, she, as well as most logical individuals, especially Americans, agree that free speech, even racist speech, should not a punishable offence under the law.
      </p>

       But oh wait, you're from the south! I guess I'm wrong!

       Yes, but here's the point.  The fascists want you to see
       <strong>
        <em>
         them
        </em>
       </strong>
       as the exception.  They want you to see

        <em>
         them
        </em>
       </strong>
       as the enemy.  They don't care if you fight them or hang some of them; they know damn well that the moment they can get you to
       <strong>
        <em>
         think like them
        </em>
       </strong>
       , even if it is
       <strong>
        <em>
         against them
        </em>
       </strong>
       , then they have won.  You are now one of them yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why self-defense can never be a valid argument.  Fascists want a scenario where war is a central element of society; so again, they don't care who you are fighting, just as long as you are fighting
       <strong>
        <em>
         someone,
        </em>
       </strong>
       because as long as you are fighting
       <strong>
        <em>
         someone
        </em>
       </strong>
       , then you are like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They desperately want to convert you, and they are sufficiently desperate about it, that they don't care what it costs them to do so, even if you end up killing them.  If they can't do that by speaking to you directly, then they will do it by using the negative characteristics of your own psychology against you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember:-  If you advocate killing
       <strong>
        <em>
         anyone
        </em>
       </strong>
       , for
       <strong>
        <em>
         any
        </em>
       </strong>
       reason, then you are already a fascist.  You are already one of them.  They have already won.

       I'd like to suggest that you conduct an experiment.  Find a powerful form of antidepressant, (one which is known to neutralise virtually all emotion) take a dose of it, and then wait until you are under its' effects.  Once you've done that, rethink your position here; and do so from the basis of asking whether or not you would want someone else to grant the right of free expression to you.  See what you come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to try and tell you that I am right and you are wrong.  I am not going to scream at you.  I know that the only way anyone can ever prove anything, is by proving it to themselves; so if you're willing, do it.  Strip yourself of your emotion as much as you can, and then look at the issue purely in terms of what outcome B would be, if action A were taken.

       Personally, I appreciate it when racists tell me that they are racists. It's good to know that about people. I don't want to take away their free speech. I want everyone to know how they want to express themselves. In my experience, the most effective way to get people behind racism is when they don't realize it's racist. When the racism is unapologetic, people will recognize it for the evil it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I hear people trying to silence racists, it makes me think that they're either bad actors or idiots. Only good reason I could think to suppress a racists' free speech is if you think they make a compelling argument. Only reason to silence a racist is if you have no faith in people understanding that bigotry is wrong.

       It's gone. We now live in a society where defending someone's constitutional right is seen as a defense of the ideas they're spewing. It's a product of the all-or-nothing, with-me-or-against-me society we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also fucking stupid. Study after study after study have shown that when you push an idea underground it only gets stronger. It shows the ones who subscribe to the idea that they must be right because why else would they be silenced? It also allows them to recruit a fuck ton easier because, if you can't talk about it, nobody can challenge it.

      <p>
       It started with Franco overthrowing the Spanish government while being financially backed by Nazi Germany and Italy. Great Britain, the Soviets and, to a lesser extent, the US were funding the socialists in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       This bled over into greater Europe when the Nazis started encroaching East toward Russia. Britain immediately got involved, but it took the US 5 years to join in because they weren't sure whether to back the socialists or the Nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They correctly helped eradicate the Nazis, but the US was and is the largest advocate of capitalism, so they spent the next 3.5 decades after WW2 working to defeat socialism.

       I was referring to how Nazi tanks used standard oil from rockefella, and the trains used IBM equipment, which they wouldn't have been able to just easily source in Europe during that time.

       I don't trust that capitalism and communism weren't always a Hegelian dialectic, with some portions of populace, more rural and less educated (like in Russia) being left with less self-defenses than others (like those in concentration camps... gulags...)

       sure, it may not have flown here, yet, but what if people were
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more privy to what was happening and even encouraging it behind the scenes? enabling the masks to change over the same faces as regimes rise and fall...
      </p>
      <p>
       what if the real reason was intentionally to decimate economies, then allow for the wealthier groups to buy up more control while also profiteering off the war industry and intentionally ballooning global credit? a lot of shit happened, like Britain being told they 'lost the war' before the war was over in early false news, causing stocks to crumble and be bought up for nothing...
      </p>
      <p>
       what if there had already been a scam that caused the great depression, and that scam has been ongoing ever since, with little bits of patches and duct tape thrown on to prevent it from bursting until the last second and to hide its true causes?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if no side was right, and everyone was equally evil?

       To be honest I don't see a solution to this radicalisation that's going on. Comments like this get upvoted. I've gotten nothing but downvotes for trying to bring attention to them.

       in the end its a tough decision for me, if shit hits the fan I have no choice but to attempt to ally with the white nationalists and simply lie about my heritage to them (and possibly betray them down the line before they kill me)
      </p>

       it isn't even like I personally want that, but if it ends up with someone trying to genocide me, they better be ready for chemical warfare.

       I have empathy, for anyone whom is my ally, but anyone who isn't is a raw demon unworthy of life without a soul in my eyes. I feel the same they do, in that if I get attacked, I will defend myself beyond what is considered reasonable force.

       It's hard to say what it will come to. If there's some kind of civil war, I think the victors will end up being whichever side the PTB think will be easiest to control.

       The way each side absorbs propoganda so readily makes it a pretty close race, imo.

       shrooms can be done rather easily, all you really have to do is watch for black mold and throw away anything that isn't covered in fully white mold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive done this too lol. drying them is actually the difficult part (as sitting them out will ruin them you need sterile dessicant)
      </p>
      <p>
       a pressure cooker is preferred, but you can just use mason jars and boil them like a double boiler, with the caps loosely on to allow in steam.
      </p>
      <p>
       the thing is, it does affect your yield, since that way, more specimens end up being contaminated...
      </p>
      <p>
       at that point, you just, like I said, watch for the black mold, or ANY color other than the white mold.
      </p>
      <p>
       other colors will not necessarily be toxic (black will every time), but they COULD be, doesn't matter if red, green, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       the mold that grows the shrooms themselves, is solid white

       well, its easier to say what I haven't done. I haven't done PCP, or ketamine. almost everything else, I have tried, barring some research chemicals and obscure semi-legal substances.
      </p>
      <p>
       from crack to dope (and both at the same time!), to everything else. I only ever really got hooked on dope.
      </p>
      <p>
       in a little bit I'm gonna be whacked out of it on DXM. I just drank like, 250mg. I really cant be sticking around the conspiracy sub though because I should keep myself in a positive mood once I come up.
      </p>
      <p>
       getting all psychotically pissed at stuff isn't really a great experience lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       itd be easier if you had any questions in specific drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes, the precursors to LSD are all watched, which is why I would never try to make LSD. if your trying to make that, usually its a bunch of college professor buddies whom each start a research project using one of those precursors, and each get a tiny bit extra, then they link up and share them all..
      </p>
      <p>
       its still really hard, you can even order them all online, but they keep you on a list, and I don't think when you order it matters, you could order them months apart and still get a knock on your door.
      </p>
      <p>
       what people who aren't doctors/professors have to do, is to use potentially dangerous household chemicals in order to refine them into what they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned DEET because DEET bugspray contains a peptide coupler which is but one of the precursors used in a variety of substances, including but not limited to LSD.

       its legal to talk and read about chemistry in the united states, its just not legal to practice or perform anything that you aren't supposed to obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have a whole classroom lecture on the synthesis of LSD-25 if your professor wanted to. its just not legal to actually do it, and I seriously, highly would not recommend that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would never ever personally recommend performing any extractions upon plants which you know contain scheduled substances, because in the event you do it is highly illegal.

      <p>
       but you can easily read all about it online.

       you know man, I don't really hate anyone. honestly, I hate myself. I'm quite depressed most times, and I'm kinda losing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its been especially mentally rough for me, because ive tried to quit doing drugs, and my minds all fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kinda have a moment of clarity here, fucked up on DXM, personally, I overreact when I'm 'sober' because my brains all fucked from years of abuse. I'm trying to get better, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really hate anyone personally. I just get scared with so many people hating so much. I mean like fuck. I'm just here, and I kind of don't even want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm definitely going to lose my mind, a lot of bad shit Is happening in my life. I keep trying to stop myself from going off the deep end personally. but I don't know. I'm just kinda tired of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I impose this dark, grim, terrifying view on everything, because I'm reflecting the hatred of myself. I stopped caring a long time ago, because too late, came and went, and somewhere, deep inside, I already knew that.
      </p>
      <p>
       there was no path back to sanity, only the eternal now. only in moments like this, dissociated from my own mind can I really look at it for what it is, at least in myself, that sparks me to say crazy ass shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       really, I just want to get better, id like to wake up and be able to handle my own mind, and emotions, without constantly drugging myself to cope with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       such talent and intellect I've wasted, probably many will never understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find myself constantly living in a past that's dead, reliving my past. pretending I'm still there, where it seems.. somewhat safer, and to me, more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even know who I am, or what exactly I am anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I mean, yeah, I know right now I'm fucked out of my mind,
      </p>
      <p>
       but even when I come down, I'm not sure what I'm coming down to anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       and a real recovery is going to be quite the long and grueling process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why I gave the rant,
      </p>
      <p>
       but to be honest, its the true explanation of my, personal behavior lately. Ive burnt a few burner accounts on here,
      </p>
      <p>
       but really, I'm just a sad person, trying to find a way to sanity in insane times, that tend to aggravate my already poor mental stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I'm pretty smart, for a complete psycho failure of a human being. You really could kinda think of me as a real life version of rick, from rick and morty.
      </p>
      <p>
       except for the fact, that there is no interdimensional travel, or superintelligence. I'm just some wasted asshole :p

       free speech and hate speech are different things. nazis who promote the killing, discriminating of others like jews, "niggers", muslims etc. does ATTACK others. you can say whatever you want - all day long - and noone cares, but attacking others is NOT free speech.

       No, they are not.

       You can scream at me in response as much as you like; it won't prove anything.  The only practical use of the term "hate speech," is to prevent someone from saying something; and it is a purely emotional and subjective term.  It has no proveable definition, and I don't care what psychopathic legislation you want to quote back to me in response to that, either.  Hitler made Germany's laws say whatever he wanted them to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will not tolerate a single exception to the right of free speech.  Not a single one.  Not "terrorism," not "hate speech," not "racism," not child porn.
       <strong>
        <em>
         Nothing.
        </em>
       </strong>
       The reason why is because I know that totalitarianism relies on such exceptions for its' very existence.  Totalitarianism can not exist in a scenario where no exceptions are granted to rules.  Totalitarianism relies on the acceptance of different people being treated in different ways, rather than the central rule that you do not treat anyone else in any manner in which you would not want to be treated yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no compromise here.  There can be none.  We will either have freedom or we will not; and if we have "hate speech," then we will not.  If you care more about being in a scenario where no one has their feelings hurt than being in a provably free society, then that is your perogative, but I do not share it.

       I totally respect your ideas, but this shit has happened before and the results were disastrous and led to the deaths of millions of people. There is nothing innocent or acceptable about hate speech and the outcome of not speaking back and having people understand that this is wrong and any modern society should not accept this. We have standards for a reason and this is like any other health or safety issue. We cannot have people gathering to spread the hate and destruction of other people in our communities. Would we allow a group of hitmen to gather and plan the deaths of millions of people? Then why should we allow people with the singular vision of eradicating other human beings gather together and propagate these ideas. I'm sorry but this isn't a freedom of speech issue. This is a stand up against the tyranny of men and freedom issue.

       if your willing to murder and or silence all these groups I am all for it but it has to be ALL OF THEM OR NONE OF THEM:
      </p>
      <p>
       white supremacists, black supremacists (Malcom X should be considered a nazi), muslim supremacists, Asian supremacists, tranny supremacists, feminist supremacists, masculinist supremicists, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       as you see, this never fucking ends. if you silence one group, you merely grant the others unlimited power to stomp on them before continuing the fight amongst themselves when there is no longer anyone in the first disenfranchised group, to take status and position away from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree, in a sense... if we could murder the entire support base of all these groups in one day, and leave the rest of mankind to be gods of their domain in some sense of true egalitarian equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be all for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but silencing only "Approved" groups, does absolutely nothing in the long run, and only hurts innocent people in the short run.

       if any one of these groups, as it is, sees significant dissatisfaction on any side, or a significant loss, there will be blood and there is absolutely no avoiding it anymore. people would see a betrayal from on high as a call to
       <em>
        WAR
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       none of these groups is willing to accept less.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is why I constant point at the elite who have far too fucking much, we could possibly at least lengthen our time here if we focused anger on them instead of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe even long enough to actually create some semblance of egalitarianism -- you know, since the first generation of elites will be happy with benefits such as great normal mate selection (no sex slaves), less mansions, loyalty to one's roots, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       sure, it'll probably just descend into hedonism again eventually, but that time of an elite accepting less could allow us to educate ourselves, rebuild, and actually work on socioeconomic capabilities without it being such a dogfight and so unfair for awhile.

       as someone with few chances in life, yes, I do want to open everyone up to brutal competition. because to someone with nothing, a chance is something. and if I actually succeeded at it, maybe I deserved someone elses 'pre-approved' spot in society. if they were such a prodigy, they should've been better than me, if they were truly genetically superior?

       Maybe it's because US finances apathy and genocide that the people are confused and don't know what to say anymore in their cognitive dissonance, finding only satisfaction when they can lash out to the latest circlejerk, discussing one event in a bubble and not care about the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latest nazi discussions are pathetic. Maybe start with getting the nazis out of government first and stop financially supporting them before you start talking about any ideologies. Events are coming and going and you idiots still talk why some "-ism" you support is okay.

And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

       This is important to keep alive! Always fight the good fight!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many people who have the talent to bring people from extreme views to a more middle area but how often do you see this on the internet or on the street? You have people with extreme, very unreflected views and discussions turn into a pissing contest. People don't want to understand your or the other view, for some unknown reason. There are hardly questions asked and when it happens they get rarely answered, because of the fear, when answered truthfully, it could be used as an argument against you and you lost being RIGHT and WINNING the "discussion".
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussion culture on reddit with the up/downvote dynamic is one of the poorest things I've ever witnessed on the internet as it always leads to extremism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the funneled extremism has reached critical mass in society as nearly everyone is connected. And only those, truly angry, mobilize to go on the streets, finding their place in a group with some kind of extreme view. As long as the sheeps flock to the wolves who cry of some better world with hatespeech in either side there is nothing to win.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still wait for change in your country but it's not happening. There is no interest in reducing the military budget, playing less world police, reducing overall debt, regulate wallstreet, regulate the federal reserve, etc... Those are things to go on the street. These are discussions worth having. If you just scream about whose ideology is right, it's just the worst kind of circle jerk and our ancestors didn't die for the freedom of speech to enable these kind of idiotic views. They would have expected the general public to "calm" those masses and naturally counter-act them with our freedom of speech. But that is not what is happening as extremist groups are gathering but the general public has no time for them. They oppose them, but they don't
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       oppose them on the streets or in discussions. Most are passive.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this works with only a handful of people that completely derail ANYTHING imaginable! As long as those few individuals can do as they please and they are not opposed by the general public they will
       <em>
        feel
       </em>

       I've never believed in the concept of "hate speech," personally.  I also don't believe in any exception whatsoever to the right of freedom of expression; and I tend to think that the only people who behave in ways which encourage said exceptions (such as shouting "fire" or hitting fire alarms in theaters) are doing so precisely because they want the right of free expression to be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, I am not opposed to calling neo-Nazis hypocrites, and reminding them of the fact that, while they might be screaming about the right of free expression when they are prevented from speaking, there is no way whatsoever that they would grant the same right to their own opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democracy is morally extremely fragile.  The reason why is because it relies on neutrality and the idea that people consciously agree to grant other people the same rights which they want themselves.  We live in a period of time where this idea of universal reciprocity has completely broken down.  Both sides will condone anything if it is their own side engaging in it, and condemn anything if it is the other side doing it.  Moral consistency is not a priority; total destruction of the perceived enemy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not consider myself on anyone's side.  The Left claim that there is no moral equivalency between themselves and white supremacists, while the Right likewise claim that there is no moral equivalency between themselves and Muslims.  The only way we are going to resolve anything, is if we let go of our craving to utterly dehumanise whoever we view as the enemy, and create rationalisations as to how it is supposedly morally legitimate for said enemy to be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, we need to stop
       <strong>
        <em>
         wanting
        </em>
       </strong>
       to view ourselves as holy and the other side as monsters, and the egoic payoff which we derive from doing that.  If we want the conflict to end,
       <strong>
        <em>
         someone
        </em>
       </strong>
       is going to have to be willing to consciously look out over No Man's Land at the people on the other side; and someone on said other side is going to have to be willing to look back.

       It is perfectly fine to be both against violent extremists on either side, and also agree that they have the same rights to free speech without violence as anyone else.  Fascist regimes silence dissenters.  Taking away constitutional rights from people you don't agree with is a slippery slope, because eventually it will be used against a cause you care about.

       GOOD QUESTION
      </p>
      <p>
       for anyone who grew up in this country and wasn't born yesterday, this guy running his car through people and the media spectacle are the functional reason why nazis are now being censored and called 'terrorists' all over the country just for their ideas
      </p>
      <p>
       if i had to choose between israel and the klan, I would have to think very hard, because the two are different forms of the same thing
      </p>
      <p>
       yet at this moment, israel can do whatever it wants including getting this idiotic BDS censorship bill, TO THE TOP OF CONGRESSES DOCKET

       I was under the impression that being a war mongering islamophobe (like most of our politicians) did not equal Nazi.  Maybe I missed something.  Because if that's one of our definitions, we've got
       <em>
        aloooot

       of Nazis in Washington.  If that's the case, maybe we
       <em>

       start a new anti-nazi movement :)

       I'd like to suggest that you conduct an experiment.  Find a powerful form of antidepressant, (one which is known to neutralise virtually all emotion) take a dose of it, and then wait until you are under its' effects.  Once you've done that, rethink your position here; and do so from the basis of asking whether or not you would want someone else to grant the right of free expression to you.  See what you come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to try and tell you that I am right and you are wrong.  I am not going to scream at you.  I know that the only way anyone can ever prove anything, is by proving it to themselves; so if you're willing, do it.  Strip yourself of your emotion as much as you can, and then look at the issue purely in terms of what outcome B would be, if action A were taken.

       if your willing to murder and or silence all these groups I am all for it but it has to be ALL OF THEM OR NONE OF THEM:
      </p>
      <p>
       white supremacists, black supremacists (Malcom X should be considered a nazi), muslim supremacists, Asian supremacists, tranny supremacists, feminist supremacists, masculinist supremicists, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       as you see, this never fucking ends. if you silence one group, you merely grant the others unlimited power to stomp on them before continuing the fight amongst themselves when there is no longer anyone in the first disenfranchised group, to take status and position away from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree, in a sense... if we could murder the entire support base of all these groups in one day, and leave the rest of mankind to be gods of their domain in some sense of true egalitarian equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be all for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but silencing only "Approved" groups, does absolutely nothing in the long run, and only hurts innocent people in the short run.
