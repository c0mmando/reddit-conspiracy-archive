<p>Financial: Student loan bubble, tech bubble, housing bubble, auto loan bubble, and I&#39;ve heard bonds are having issues as well.</p>

<p>Planetary: Eclipse happening in the US August 21 which could disrupt power, cell service, and Internet across the US. Very strange extreme weather patterns all over the world really.</p>

<p>Spiritually: People are waking up at an unprecedented level. It isn&#39;t a religious awakening necessarily either, but rather more of an universal awakening against systems of control.</p>

<p>Politics: Deep State is clearly at war with the Trump admin.</p>

<p>Divide a conquer: Race war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is really hard to quantify spirituality, but there seems to be a movement of people who are awakening to new universal possibilities for the reality we all live in.</p>

<p>It can be as simple as someone who realizes the news is propaganda, and stops watching or believing what they see on the news. Or as complicated as a CEO selling his company, and traveling to India to study Buddhism and yoga and completely changing their way of life.</p>

<p>People are waking up to the fact that the systems that dictate our reality do not serve us, and that we&#39;re all being manipulated by corporations, governments, and the media. People are becoming aware of things like our finance system being rigged, false flags, divide and conquer techniques, rigged search results, etc.</p>

<p>Despite all the insanity you see online, much of it designed to make the world appear chaotic and scary to keep us in a state of fear, but despite that people are starting to awaken to universal truths. For example, we live in a quantum universe, everything is made up of either frequency, vibration, or energy. This includes all people, animals, and things observable in the greater universe. We are all one, but not the same at the same time. The only real mystery is what the source of individual consciousness is, and why consciousness has a direct impact on reality. Also, why collective consciousness has such a compounded effect on reality as well.</p>

<p>For most people, they probably don&#39;t understand what they are experiencing, or the intricacy of quantum mechanics, but they do feel a connection to some form of unity or collective consciousness. Becoming aware of this sense of unity is a temporary glimpse into a state of awakening, and even a glimpse of this universal experience can be enough to radically change someones life even if they never experience another moment of awakening again. </p>

<p>This may be antidotal, but personally I&#39;ve seen more people waking up in the past 1-2 years then I&#39;ve seen awaken in the past 2-10. There seems to be some kind of shift taking place, theories range from the earth raising its vibration as it passes through a different area of the universe, to end of days prophecies, star seeds, and indigo children.</p>

<p>Then theres people like me who are trying to remain in an awakened state at all times, and actually function from a state of awakening continually. Which ultimately comes down to living a clean and healthy life free from conditioning, and managed external stress. It sounds pretty simple, but its actually very difficult to accomplish routinely. I get glimpses sometimes every day for a few days, but then can go entire months without one of these experiences. It&#39;s almost like a battle to try and stay connected to whatever it is I&#39;m connecting to, and all the crap that is happening in the world are mostly distractions from these experiences and universal truths. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is unusual about this eclipse is its direct path over the United States. These kinds of eclipses happen about every 40 years, but their  path isn&#39;t usually across the entire country like this. This type of eclipse will create about 2-minutes of no sunlight across the majority of the country.</p>

<p>Emergency services are preparing for possible power outages not due to the event itself directly, but because of the loss of power from solar panels and other forms of renewable energy that can create a potential power surge when they are re-exposed to sunlight again.</p>

<p>Cellphone service may be effected because of the number of people traveling to be within the direct path of the full eclipse placing additional burden on cell towers that aren&#39;t use to connecting to so many devices.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not worried about it too much. I don&#39;t think planes are going to fall out of the sky, but the migration of people to view the eclipse, and the loss of sunlight to solar panels could make for an interesting day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The eclipse might not &quot;cause&quot; anything, but those in power love to do stuff &quot;when the planets align&quot; in order to give themselves an illusion of universal power, as if the planets themselves were on their side. I don&#39;t discount this possibility</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say because it isn&#39;t like the Deep State walks around wearing name tags. </p>

<p>From what I can tell, the Neo-liberal/cons is one faction and they control the media. These are holdovers from the Bush admin and Obama admin. This is why people like John McCain (a Neo-con), strongly oppose Trump and everything he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump is surrounding himself with traditionally conservative military generals and the military industrial complex. </p>

<p>I would argue the military, and military industrial complex is its own wing of the Deep State. Meanwhile, the CIA seems to have its own agenda, the FBI is caught between all these agencies and factions, and so is the NSA. </p>

<p>We know from Wikileaks that there are dozens of factions and departments under the CIA with different people in positions of power so it&#39;s hard to say who all these people are loyal to. </p>

<p>With all this said, I absolutely believe there is an internal civil war happening in the Deep State which is causing the propaganda war we&#39;re seeing in the media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still, you accuse me of spreading disinfo, please just tell me what I said that is disinfo.  My point is that if the left goes around calling anyone that disagrees with them a Nazi, they are not going to make any progress.  We need to focus on the DNC, it is in shambles.  I dont consider myself &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot;, and my voting record proves that.  I didnt vote for Hillary, I didnt vote for Trump.  If the democrats, progressives, leftists, of whom I know and work with many, want any chance to get back into power they need to stop this Bullshit &quot;Russia hacked the election&quot; narrative and &quot;all Trump supporters are Nazis&quot;.  It didnt work in the election and it wont work now.  You need to get YOUR head out of your ass, grow a pair of balls, and stop playing identity politics.  Trump can be wrong, he can be right, and he can be useless or useful.  Keeping your head in the dirt and screaming Nazi all day long isnt going to solve anything. </p>
