    <div class="md"><p>In the same boat as you.  I&#39;m so disgusted by what &quot;the left&quot; has become, as a whole it&#39;s completely strayed from its anti-war, anti-fascist roots.  Now there is only one thing the left cares about: hating Trump.  Like seriously, how can the left be so blind?  Trump, while imperfect, was simply more liberal than Clinton, sorry.  Just because a candidate has a D by their name doesn&#39;t make them liberal/left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because there&#39;s a full blown civil war on the American left. The Progressive party base is now locked in a death struggle with the Neoliberal Corporatist party bosses, who are still fighting Bernie, the base, and any and all reforms of the party and primary. FFS Hillary and Perez appointed THREE former Goldman CEO&#39;s/CFO&#39;s to the Unity Commission....the PRIMARY unity commission, just to fight the progressive activists Bernie appointed. It&#39;s fucking laughable. The DNC must be purged of its corruption if we are to fight for real change in this country. I&#39;m positive if Bernie is healthy he will run in 2020, which is why they&#39;re already trying to hype up disgusting Neoliberal whores like Kamala Harris and Deval Patrick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take heart my friend. The world is only getting worse if we buy into the MSM narratives. Most people are fundamentally good and kind and generous, and are just trying to live their lives. The majority of people aren&#39;t racist or sexist or any other -ist, and even if some people don&#39;t like people different than them, they are still fine living within the same country as those other people and have the capacity to learn and change in their views as human beings, because this misguided hatred is a cultural and not a natural product. </p>

<p>We can have political differences but we are all people. TPTB want us to believe things are getting worse, and in ways they are, like income inequality, the Corporate Media, and oligarchic control of our government, but humans are still fundamentally, en masse, good, hard working, deep caring people, and we have the numbers. Talk to your family and friends about these happenings and keep posting here and elsewhere regardless of any downvotes or attacks. We can win this war ✊</p>

<p>The right in is in the news because people are trying to figure out where the responsibility for the heated state of public discourse is coming from - and this conversation was amplified by what happened at a right-wing rally.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to take the worst possible and stupidest possible interpretation of what I said then I can&#39;t stop you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you need to disavow a group you never avowed or endorsed in the first place. That would have been like if say hypothetically speaking, ISIS said they supported Obama or Trump during their presidency, and then carried out a terrorist attack. Would you expect them to have to make an entire press conference to saying &quot;I the president of the United States do not support ISIS&quot;. Well of course not, it&#39;s a standard given as a typical American citizen that you do not support ISIS. An actual real example is when Obama said he supported BLM, the Dallas shooting happens from a racist BLM supporter and Obama didn&#39;t condemn the group. The difference there is that Trump never said he supported these groups that support him. In obamas case he actually supported the group committing constant acts of violence and rioting</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understood.  I personally cannot prove it, but I have seen the Craig&#39;s list ads floating around.  There were also paid protesters that were showing up to the Trump rallies during the election.  There have been mentions of companies called Crowds on Demand.  There are probably others.  </p>

<p>From what I can gather, it seems like people are being paid to protest both sides and stir things up.  It is the conflict that drives the agenda that is to be achieved.  Not just in the US, but elsewhere such as Europe, Ukraine, Venezuela.  This is the standard operating procedure, which is why people here are not so quick to believe what they are being told.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will not be successful to any degree that matters. Will they increase their ranks?  Probably. What will that amount to?  I have no facts but I&#39;m speculating that maybe 2-3% of the US population at most would identify as a NaZi and I think that is generous. That is my point though. So many bright minds (yes I just blanket Redditors as bright) are wasting energy on a movement that represents a very small portion of our countries population. This is always where the smoke and mirrors occur. Focus on this widget that will be irrelevant in 3 months and effects very few people, froth about it, rage against it while we fuck you in the ass over here. Before I get blown up for this post, the violence is awful. Citizens harming others is awful, but honestly how is that any different than the issues you outlined in your post? The daily death toll/human suffering caused by the problems outlined in your post are exponentially more horrific. </p>

<p>Being anti semitic does not equal Nazi. If he was being soley called an anti semitic fair enough but he is being called a nazi when clearly not supporting the whole of nazism. Kinda like being a veggie who still eats chicken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally proved my point. Today&#39;s &quot;Nazis&quot; are not actual Nazis. They are just racist hillbilly hicks who are mostly uneducated conservatives who support the constitution and like America  and are just ruled and guided by there hate for others that aren&#39;t like them. </p>

<p>Go look up the ACTUAL ideology of the Nazi party. If you take out the racism it has a lot more in common with today&#39;s left than these people. </p>

<p>&quot;Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric&quot; , &quot;The Nazis sought to improve the stock of the Germanic people through broad social welfare programs, and a collective subordination of individual rights, which could be sacrificed for the good of the state&quot;. </p>

<p>The only reason these hicks use this symbol and call themselves nazis is because they liked the racist ideology of Hitler and are too stupid to realize that none of his political ideology matches up with their beliefs. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be right wing and be an actual Nazi lmao. Right wing conservatives hate socialism, hate social welfare programs, don&#39;t want their rights impeded on etc. The left has way more in common with the Nazi party (minus the racism) than these dumb rednecks even do. They call people fascists yet they are the ones deeming things &quot;hate speech&quot;, shutting down protests and speeches, and basically impeding all over peoples rights because they think it&#39;s for the &quot;common good&quot; aka actual fascism. They call people nazis yet if were pitched the idea of Hitler&#39;s political ideology minus the racism they would think he was a rockstar. Do your research man, both sides in this equation are literally living in fantasyland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  It’s true.  We’ve all been conditioned to have a knee-jerk reaction at “nazi” or “hitler”.  Not the same for Stalin or Mao, who were far worse.  Why?  Propaganda.  Why propaganda?  ....becasue we fought against them.  We had to demonize them to prevent our soldiers from seeing them as human.  The Germans had to become inhuman, worth of death, so that we could kill them without remorse.  WWII is a rabbit hole.  Lie after lie has been taught to us about it.  It’s funny, had the Germans won, something like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HWxKahieBY">“the greatest story never told”</a> is what the world would know to be true.  ...and what is true?  ....I’m still finding that out myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I am Black and have a huge family and dozens of minority friends, and lived in 4 different states and never once met a minority that that gave a shit about White people. I <em>have</em> met White racists and and white people who think a lot minorities are racists for some reason. Like I see this complaint all the time, and most people either get the idea from shit they see on the internet, or tell a story about &quot;this one time&quot; ignoring the millions of minorities that are not racist. It&#39;s going to be shitty evil people in every race creed or religion. Sure you can find crazy people on the internet, and sure it&#39;s minorities that hate white people, but I honestly believe people on the internet, think that it&#39;s a bigger problem then it actually is.. </p>

<p>To put into perspective, replace the word &quot;minorities&quot; with the word &quot;white&quot; in your comment. Of course their are white supremacist that pressure their family to be racist and shit out there, it doesn&#39;t mean that the majority of White people are pressured into being racists. It&#39;s such a small portion of your race, you don&#39;t see them as the mainstream, and most white people would condemn them, just like most minorities would condemn prejudice. </p>

<p>Just know that the vocal minority, aka the racists, feminanzi etc. are the minority. And the only reason they are what you see is because it would be pretty boring to post anything else but the extreme on a site like Tumblr or something. Of course the crazy idiots are going to be the one who make the news or occasional post on Reddit. People wouldn&#39;t get views if they covered a reasonable person living an average life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! You are completely right. Like my mom is in that generation and I&#39;m only 26. I have no clue why people act like that time period has zero effect on Black people today. Or that we should be completely void of any cultural, historic, or economic context that came with it. </p>

<p>Some people in that time period are still raising children or have very young grandchildren. Of course Black people are going to be sensitive to that shit when our moms and dads were sprayed down with hoses and not allowed into schools that taught good curriculum, or not even be considered for careers that White people were(not saying white people are bad for this, just that there were objectively more opportunities for them and their families to have upward mobility or social safety nets) . A lot of Black people also were not allowed in college, the shit is systematic as fuck and the quicker people realize this the quicker we can come together and progress as a society instead of being mad at each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, on top of that people complain about how Black people are less likely to have higher wages and buy houses, well when you have parents that never learned financial literacy or family NEVER owned property where the hell are we supposed to learn it from. Sure I and millions of other Black Americans made it out of the cycle, but there are millions more who have no idea how to survive and it&#39;s not their faults. And yes, if you can lose you job to someone you claim is unqualified, or speaking of minorities in general, that doesn&#39;t even speak English, then that&#39;s a problem with you not the system. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s so hypocritical, these same people argue Black and Brown people are lazy and stealing tax dollars, and then get mad when we are competitive (it literally nothing we can do economically that makes them happy), or picture a White family with Guns on their Facebook picture, to them they are exercising their 2nd Amendment rights(which is true and fine) but the thought of a Black American owning a gun immediately incites fear of them being a &quot;thug&quot; or gangster family, even if it&#39;s owned legally.

    <div class="md"><p>Only thing is, we aren&#39;t the Ukraine. This is the USA and the deep state can&#39;t just oust a democratically elected president if he doesn&#39;t actually do anything wrong. We have too many patriots who know what&#39;s right and who will fight if they need to. But who&#39;s going to win, antifa or the American militias? It&#39;s all a big show, there&#39;s not going to be a civil war, they are just prepping this for when Trump flips the switch, I believe, on Monday. </p>

<p>The msm wants violence in the public&#39;s brains so that when Trump clamps down on the awan/DNC scandal, awan&#39;s hearing is Monday and WH construction is finished Monday, the media can just say the word coup, and people will think Hitler taking over Germany in 2sec with the Nazi shit. But what&#39;s actually happening is the exposure of decades of illegal international drug, organ, guns and depleted uranium bombs, human, child, and sex trafficking, used to compromise and blackmail half of the US Congress and every president since JFK. </p>

<p>Things will get chaotic, but I believe that&#39;s the scenario we are getting ready for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I do is think about the big picture and observe and analyze events, so I like to think that I have a reasonable understanding of it. There&#39;s just so much distraction, they don&#39;t want you to just use simple logic to see the simplicity of what&#39;s going on. There&#39;s just been so many hints from Michael Flynn and his son, Cynthia McKinney and Robert David Steele, and a long time human trafficking reporter, and the insider anons that Trump is going to flip the switch at some point and shine the light on the truth. </p>

<p>Some people just think it&#39;s a larp, and it could be, we could go through another two years of bullshit. But I just think that based on the media reacting all summer stirring up shit trying to get him impeached, I had a feeling it would escalate until the eclipse. Because of the 4chan predictions about the eclipse and what happens 33 days later, while like I say could all be coincidence, but nonetheless something to keep in mind. And as all of this continues to play out, especially this month, the more confident I am that we are going to see big things happen starting next Monday, and the establishment has just been pulling back on the slingshot as hard as possible, and I think Trump is going to come out on top after exposing the awan brothers stuff. </p>

<p>Sorry, I don&#39;t know the big picture 100%, just like everyone, but I&#39;ve done a lot of analyzing and thinking about it all, and the closer to the 21st we get, the more I think something is coming. Just based on how this month and the end of last month have played out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he&#39;s got everyone right where he wants them. </p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing. And read closely. <strong>I am not emotionally attached to what I think is likely.</strong> If what I think is a likely scenario, ends up not being true, that&#39;s okay with me. It doesn&#39;t affect me. I can be wrong, and I can learn. Just like you can be wrong and you can learn. A lot of people voted for Obama, learned it was all bullshit, and voted for Trump because he acknowledged all of the bullshit and said he&#39;d work on getting rid of it. And you can&#39;t decide where Trump is at in 6 months after 8+ years of selling out America to foreign interests. There is a lot of pushback and a lot of distraction. </p>

<p>But we will see what happens, you can believe that Trump is just another Republican, but I think we all should know better by now that Trump plays by his rules, and based on his rhetoric and what he has tried to do so far, he does want to better the country and the average American. Because it really isn&#39;t that hard, there&#39;s so much wealth it&#39;s insane. And the establishment has made sure we can&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>Either way, we will see what happens and whatever happens happens. All we can do now is speculate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying I have definitive proof, but based on what I&#39;ve seen happening, that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen. And I know i might be disappointed, but I know that in the end, it also just doesn&#39;t matter anyway. We&#39;ve been stuck in a 1984 like scenario of upside downness for decades. The elite are protecting themselves. They&#39;re protecting their power and their elite status. Our scarcity based economy is a sham. There is a bounty of energy and resources that most of us are too scared to even think about. Even if we all came together with the amount of resources we have that are public, no one would starve and everyone could be happy. So it&#39;s very obvious that what we&#39;ve been watching the last decades was nothing but bullshit. Why did we have the same old argument about abortion and gay rights every election? Everyone should just fucking agree about fundamental human rights. But no, we have to deal with trivializing all of it in order to not see the bigger picture. The elite don&#39;t want you to see the bigger picture. They control the government, the president has been nothing but a puppet of a larger and more secret and sinister group of individuals for a very very long time. If you&#39;ve been here before the election, you&#39;d know that. </p>

<p>We had JFK but you see what happened. Now we have trump. But we also have the internet. Now we see the most blatant propaganda and censorship in history in order to subdue a movement that started with wikileaks and was escalated with pizzagate, and there is plenty of evidence that Trump has been taking down pedophilia rings, and is likely to expose the vast swamp of pedo blackmailed government officials, among the other crimes surrounding the Clinton foundation. </p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of evidence, and you can&#39;t expect it to have been done without playing games all summer. Imran Awan&#39;s hearing is next week. The consensus is that he just might be guilty of a little more than bank fraud. Try running a spy ring in Congress and illegally shipping stolen cars, depleted uranium and guns to terrorists. </p>

<p>Do some research my friend, I think it would help you. </p>

Gary Cohn- former Goldman CEO is trumps senior economic advisor with growing influence in the WH, and is being considered for the Fed chair. He was advocated for by Kushner and Ivanka, who also got 2 other former Goldman CEO&#39;s/CFO&#39;s appointed to the West Wing. Goldman also had 3 former CEO&#39;s/CFO&#39;s appointed to the DNC unity commission by Hillary and Perez to counter Bernie&#39;s progressive picks just a couple months ago.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a tie if you consider <em>why</em> the body counts are what they are.</p>

<p>Thing is that the body count due to communism is mostly due to mismanagement and incompetent administration.</p>

<p>The body count due to Nazism is inherent to their ideology which advocates <em>both</em> the purging of internal racial impurity <em>and</em> wars of conquest as being fundamental duties.</p>

<p>Also important to point out is that nobody keeps a body count for Capitalism. When someone starves to death or dies in the street, it&#39;s blamed on them. When someone gets bombed in an imperialist oil war, it&#39;s &quot;just politics&quot;. When an entire continent is purged in a genocide, that&#39;s not chalked up for some reason. Nor are the millions who lived and died under slavery. It&#39;s a very interesting trick that Capitalist ideology manages to displace blame for <em>literally all deaths</em> that occur under it.</p>

<p>Plenty of people do that. It was very popular to do so during Bush&#39;s time in office, and not so much after Obama was elected. They lost interest, I suppose. I&#39;m sure it will make a comeback now though, if it hasn&#39;t already.</p>

<p>Your point about the &quot;why&quot; of the body counts between Nazism and communism is better. Although I&#39;m sure the dead and their families wouldn&#39;t make much of a distinction.</p>

<p>Probably not, because attacking an entire major religion for the actions of one terrorist would be bigoted, which most people on Reddit are not.</p>

<p>Attacking Nazis in general because of the actions of one white-supremacist terrorist makes more sense, because white-supremacy is a freely-chosen ideology of racism, with a long record of violence in the United States and in the world.</p>

<li>Has called for violence upon protesters</li>

<p>Kind of, yeah.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the perception that our current President sympathizes with these odious white-supremacists, and that they represent a rising influence in the USA. That&#39;s not the case for radical Islamism, and so the sense of urgency is not nearly as intense.</p>

<p>Which comment was that?</p>

<p>It also does not make his statement irrelevant.  It just might mean he agrees with the perception.  Which does not make his statement false.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So are you saying that you don&#39;t think Trump sympathizes with Nazis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he is correct that the perception is definitely out there that Trump supports white supremacists.  I personally don&#39;t believe he does, I believe he treats them like any one else that would vote for him, he&#39;s hesitant to call them out on stuff because of that.  Which leads to a perception of support for white supremacists.  It is a base of voters that Trump seems unwilling to give up on and lose their votes.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s in this thread, man.</p>

<p>I never said his statement was false. I was responding to the conversation he was having with the other guy. After his initial statement, he was asked, &quot;And people are scared that the Nazis are going to rise up and take over or something?&quot;</p>

<p>Notice how it said <em>and people</em>. </p>

<p>His response was that that wasn&#39;t what he said. The reply to that was, that was his reasoning. Again, he claimed it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So I asked him what he was implying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but you arent saying <strong>people</strong> are afraid of a takeover... then what are you saying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how I mentioned that he was saying <em>people</em> believe that.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re accusing me of. You think I cropped a relevant part of his statement out, but i didn&#39;t. It in no way shape or form affected the ensuing conversation I had with him. You didnt even follow any of the rest of this thread, hence your unawareness of the full context of both relevant threads and your asking me where he said he wanted trumps destruction</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain it to you. You and several others immediately straw manned me.

<p>Is what he said.  In the context of why this is such a hot topic right now versus say the Russian narrative.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You literally said that Trump sympathizes with Nazis, and they are rising in influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is what you said in regards to that statement.  You even put in the designation of literally.  So I literally pointed out that he literally didn&#39;t say that.  It is a pretty blatant bullshit statement that was not close to his actual statement or meaning of his statement.</p>

<p>Now here we are.  You continuously ignore that he did not say what you stated, and that he was talking about the perception existing and being a reason for why this topic is so popular at the moment.  Then you go around asking people if they agree with the perception, which doesn&#39;t matter at all in context, and then your latest reply to me just confuses me even more because I have no idea what strawman you are talking about.  I honestly feel like I&#39;m talking with a drunk person right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus dude...I don&#39;t even know what you are arguing so I&#39;m just going to lay this out.  </p>

<p>GeneralTonic quotes this in his first comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now imagine if it was a Muslim who ran some people over. Do you think there would be as many anti Muslim posts all over Reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just so we are clear on the context this is what he is discussing and not anything else you are trying to force into the argument.  He then makes a statement that he doesn&#39;t think there would be many posts and explains his reasoning.  Then fuster_cluq carries on the conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would you say the same for Sharia law and radicalized Muslims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which GeneralTonic basically says yes and reiterates why he thinks Nazis and white supremacists are getting so much news right now.  Then fuster_cluq asks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So your argument is that people are bored with hating Muslims so now they are hating Nazis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which GeneralTonic replies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kind of, yeah.
There&#39;s also the perception that our current President sympathizes with these odious white-supremacists, and that they represent a rising influence in the USA. That&#39;s not the case for radical Islamism, and so the sense of urgency is not nearly as intense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then out of no where fuster_cluq completely misrepresents what GeneralTonic was stating:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, people are mad at Nazis because they think trump is a Nazi? And people are scared that the Nazis are going to rise up and take over or something? That&#39;s completely irrational. How many Americans are self described Nazis? I would have to assume very few given the fact that Nazis are almost universally hated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>GeneralTonic then states that is a deflecting oversimplification.  <em>Here is my opinion on this, because it is the key point.</em>  He did not say people are mad at Nazis because they think Trump is one like fuster_cluq was trying to claim GeneralTonic was saying, they are mad at Nazis because they are fucking Nazis.  GeneralTonic&#39;s point was that the reason for the current frenzy about them is the <strong>perception</strong> of Trump supporting them.  They think they are getting more influence then they should have with this president, and he never stated they would take over anything.  Versus radical Islam where there is no perception that the president supports them.</p>

<p>Then fuster_cluq double downs and tries to tell GeneralTonic that&#39;s what was stated when GeneralTonic very clearly didn&#39;t.  Then GeneralTonic very clearly states fuster_cluq is not understanding what he wrote.  That&#39;s when you jump in with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You literally said that Trump sympathizes with Nazis, and they are rising in influence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A very clear misrepresentation of what GeneralTonic stated and was not literal by any definition of the word.  That&#39;s when I responded.  Pointing out you used literal wrong and that isn&#39;t what GeneralTonic was saying.  You then misquote him in replying to me and here we are again.  </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know what context you think I&#39;m missing, or what straw man argument you think is being used (still trying to figure out where that is), but you are either ignorantly misrepresenting what GeneralTonic was saying or willfully misrepresenting what he&#39;s saying.  I don&#39;t know why exactly either as I can&#39;t really even figure out your argument because it is based on shit that someone wasn&#39;t saying to begin with.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s also the perception that our current President sympathizes with these odious white-supremacists, and that they represent a rising influence in the USA. That&#39;s not the case for radical Islamism[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that was the case, when Obama was in office. People though Obama was a &quot;secret Muslim&quot; working to advance Sharia in the US and whatnot. People were wrong then, and they were called out for it.</p>

<p>I think Turkish president Erdoğan&#39;s statement about word games to do with &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;radical&quot; Islam is appropriate here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These descriptions are very ugly, it is offensive and an insult to our religion. There is no moderate or immoderate Islam. Islam is Islam and that’s it.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s just his opinion, basically saying that Islam is what&#39;s in the book, and not just the parts that are polite to say in current times.</p>

<p>The majority of Muslims outside of the US and Europe agree (literal interpretation of Quran including punishments such as death penalty for converting from / leaving Islam, adulterers stoned to death, and so on). But the fact that it&#39;s not 100% goes to your point that it&#39;s not all or nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wouldnt have a clue seeing I never watch US TV. But I know there are a couple of loud government figures, news sites, right wing MSM that screech about islam all the time. Not to mention certain sites, social media, including this sub that go on and on about islam. Especially a couple of subreddits. </p>

<p>Tbh, if you&#39;d look about all the negative articles about islam and nazis, then I&#39;m pretty sure negative articles about islam will faaaaaaar outway negative nazi articles. Rightfully so though.</p>

<p>Moreover, maybe you would do the same if you were surrounded by a crowd of people that hate you and want to kill you, and they have weapons to do it and indeed started to attack the vehicle you were in.  There&#39;s so few &quot;nazis&quot; in the US it&#39;s laughable.  And the few that are, are practically role-playing.  It is the crowds of crazy people that think they are morally superior and can shut down free speech that I fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>everything you just said is opinion, hateful, and not helpful to others.  I will pray for you, as I think you probably suffer from mental retardation.  I have spoken with mentally retarded people in the past, and I don&#39;t mind doing it, so long as they are nice.  Some of them are mean though, like you, even though they can&#39;t help it (because they are retarted).  Because it is unintentional, and likely inherited or caused by fetal alcohol syndrome, or any other number of possibilities, I&#39;ll try not to hold it against you.  But you should know, that being retarted isn&#39;t an excuse for being mean.  We&#39;re all on here to try to learn, and figure things out.  In that regard, I do value other&#39;s opinions.  Opinion&#39;s are basically people&#39;s various conclusions based on their experiences, or their observations of evidence.  So to say &quot;opinions don&#39;t matter&quot;, I think, is false.  But again, you may be retarted, after all, I don&#39;t know you, and you seem to be exhibiting some, tendencies. If I am mistaken about your tardation, I beg your pardon.</p>

That&#39;s like saying, &quot;well during an ISIS beheading video all of the terrorists were referencing the Quran and had ISIS flags and were wearing ISIS shit, therefore all Muslims are terrorists based on my generalization of an entire people from one event.

<p>You got proof that the MSM is trying to say all conservatives are nazi&#39;s? I think this is just your shitty opinion as OP mentions none of this at all. </p>

<p>Not everything thinks like you and believes the issue is black and white. Not everyone believes that a single person is a representation of half the voters in the country. I know some right wingers base their belief that each side is a monolithic structure that can be represented easily, but that just isnt true for everyone. </p>

<p>Like <a href="/u/blackhawkbolly">/u/blackhawkbolly</a> said, people wearing nazi regalia are the nazi douchebags. Right wingers are not being pushed as nazi&#39;s, in fact most are being lauded for condemning the rally. I have seen the news(CNN too) state, as fact, that the white supremacists are a very small portion of the electorate that voted for Trump. </p>

<p>The only people being called nazi&#39;s are the nazis and the apologists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. Yea they are because he is. Trump does not = all conservatives. The media calling trump an apologist doesnt mean conservatives are being called apologists. My point isnt that the media is not calling trump an apologist, they are and I agree. My point is that all conservatives are not being branded as such, just the nazis and their apologists. Trump isnt even a conservative to top that off. </p>

<p>Hes a closet nazi like most. You aren&#39;t overtly nazi, unless of course DJT normalizes it. PERIOD! EXCLAMATORY STATEMENT!</p>

<p>Nazi is not a synonym for racist. A nazi is a nazi. I dont see why you would suggest that I see it that way. A nazi believes in white/aryan superiority, which is repugnant. America, at its core, is the anti-thesis of that. </p>

<p>A nazi is someone who should be reviled by all sides in this country. Unfortunately, your president brings a moral equivalence to nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They were <em>implying</em> he is an incompetent leader (which may or may not be true), not that he&#39;s a Nazi apologist. The cynics and partisans of the MSM claimed Trump didn&#39;t speak up more about it because he didn&#39;t want to upset a significant portion of his base, who are not racists or white supremacists, but are upset that the media isn&#39;t covering this continuing national media story on race (Trayvon, BLM, Charlottesville, etc.) in a balanced and unbiased way. For example, much of the media is calling out the Hitler wannabes for violence in Charlottesville and not equally condemning violence committed by counter-protesters, which they should be doing. Many people, particularly on the right, are upset by this, and many of <em>those</em> people are Republican voters. Trump doesn&#39;t want to upset those people. Anyone with a brain already understands that the numbers of American voters associated with white supremacist organizations is <em>infinitesimal</em>.  Trump doesn&#39;t give two shits about David Duke. It&#39;s his base of support that demands he give equal condemnation to both sides of the clusterfuck in Charlottesville. And for the record, I agree with them.</p>

<p>To me this is about racism and how wrong it is. We&#39;re all human, that&#39;s what matters. And white nationalists, while not the same as white supremacists and often well-intentioned, are by their nature racist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure some people want to push the angle that all Trump supporters are Nazis, but those are people that were doing that well before Charlottesville. </p>

<p>Anyone who is telling you that the newspapers or evening news are pushing that angle is selling you something. The closest thing to a &quot;narrative&quot; (apparently the worst thing possible in modern America) is that Trump is fine with Nazis, and that started with his totally lame attempt at condemning the weekend&#39;s violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its generalizations and created hysteria that made me turn off the news.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I can&#39;t blame you there. The news is a business and they want to get the most attention they can, so they talk about the most polarizing stuff they can. </p>

<p>But I will say that I think this entire thread is really missing the point. Literal nazis, like actual flag waving Nazis, had a huge gathering this weekend which culminated in one of them driving his car into a crowd of people with the obvious intent of harming them. </p>

<p>There is a legitimate concern in this country that white supremacists feel like they have a friend in Trump. Whether Trump reciprocates that is really besides the point. There are enough people in this country that truly believe this is <strong>THEIR</strong> country, that all the bad stuff that happens to them was caused by minorities or race traitors. And that disgusting ideology should&#39;ve been destroyed long ago, but it seems to be experiencing a resurgence.</p>

<p>Sorry, my comment was way longer than I intended.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> I think the angle being pushed is that Trump is kind of ok with Nazis, not that all Trump supporters are Nazis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the attempt to associate trump and his supporters with nazis inevitably doesn&#39;t stick, I predict they will come back to sexism. And honestly I am excited for it, because it merits some followup.  </p>

<p>How many was it, 10 women that came forward and claimed to have been sexually assaulted by Trump? Plus that lawsuit that alleged he diddled a 14 year old? And they all conveniently came to the press separately, each week, around the same days that wilileaks released their weekly email dump?  </p>

<p>I really, really think that stuff needs to be followed up on. Those are HUGE accusations. The democrats are going to run a lot of female candidates in 2018 so maybe they are sitting on it for now.  </p>

<p>I want to know if political smear campaigns can actially get so extreme that a party can recruit women to volunteer as sexual assault victims. And to actually accuse him of pedophile stuff, and take it to court. It seems fucking insane to me that so many women came forward, absolutely nothing came from it, and everyone has basically forgot about the whole thing! Was it seriously just a smear campaign and a distraction? Does politics get THAT dirty?  </p>

<p>To be quite honest, the entire election was so intriguing to me. It&#39;s a shame that an honest account will never be written about it. The only thing that I was disappointed with was Bernie losing the primary, because seeing him and Trump debate would be awesome. Two outsiders of their respective parties, beating out establishment folks and debating two completely different platforms - both with huge support behind them. I think Trump got the presidency handed to him when Hillary won the primary. And honestly I have no horse in the race, it could have went either way for me. This politics stuff is really interesting if you can manage to keep your emotions out of it.</p>

<p>They stole it from him honestly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is my analysis as well. Hillary ran a terrible campaign and was sick the whole time and they couldn&#39;t hide it any more. The truth came out in the wash at the polls.</p>

And on every picture with soviets there was a mandatory &quot;better dead than red&quot; comment by some brainwashed american. I realize that it is &quot;old school&quot; but wouldn&#39;t they have already seen pictures of the surrender of germany and Simon Hayha from the winter war by now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever since Trump&#39;s win in the election, the leftist media has been obsessed with Nazis and white supremacists. It&#39;s completely bizarre, and it&#39;s clear they&#39;re following a script. I&#39;m sure some people smarter than me can figure out what they&#39;re up to. The obvious is that it&#39;s divide and conquer, continue doing what Obama did, pitting whites against blacks, the poor against the middle class, gays against straights, trans against non-mentally ill people. Anything to prevent the masses from turning their attention and anger toward the leaders.</p>
