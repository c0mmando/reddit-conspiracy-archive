       1) In the photos the press have released of the alleged driver James Fields he is wearing glasses in every photo. But in the ONLY photo we've seen of the driver
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       the incident, he is not wearing glasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) From the video footage we've all probably seen by now, you can see a large group of protesters surrounding the vehicle; before, during and after the incident. Does any one else think it's strange that out of the 40 to 50 people surrounding the vehicle, not ONE of them got a clear photograph or video of the drivers face? It seems that someone who was close by and saw what happened would have tried to get a clear image of the driver for evidence.. but there is not one clear image.

       Also: there is supposed to have been a girl killed, but in no videos do we see anyone pinned between the cars, no one looks to have suffered any serious injuries in the aftermath, and certainly the allegedly killed girl is not visible anywhere.

       I saw a girl get squished as he backed up iirc. Didn't look particularly bad though. But that doesn't mean much. Ribs could have been snapped off and punctured her heart or something.

       They got the dead girl... they got multiple videos of the impact... I dunno why no one has pieced together where she was in the crowd and when she got impacted... seems like it would be something someone thru together by now.

       Eh... I'm not sure who in that accident was the one that died. I heard some bystanders yelling about someones leg being torn off... but he mighta just been over reacting. I'd guess it was the one with the smashy club getting smeared that died... but she looks wicked scrawny compared to the chubby face I see plastered everywhere.

       I hadn't seen the picture of the person who died. I have been sorta avoiding this story because of all the controversy surrounding it. I didn't need another frustrating thing saturated with propaganda to care about in my life. It is an emotional dumptruck of bullshit.

       Yeah... I have no emotions so it makes this a tough topic to discuss with those that do have emotions... cause they are all clouded in a fog of feelings and literally can't even read what I write without trying to attach some extreme slant to it.

       I don't exactly have a complicated emotional palette myself haha. When I say "I feel" that is shorthand for "my logical conclusion was:". Just realized I do that the other day, must be hella confusing. Oh well.

       Agreed on that last bit. If people could just take a week off being enraged by things that have absofuckinglutely nothing to do with them...that would be great.

       The most "injured looking" person I see is a large woman in green that honestly looks a bit like a dummy at first glance, but she sprawls all over the roofs of the cars. Is this supposedly the dead girl?

       In a way, yes it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       That picture does not support the conclusion that she sustained fatal injuries. It adds to the suspicion that this lady only sustained light injuries, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we know how she allegedly died? Was it a head injury, internal injury, external bleeding?
      </p>
      <p>
       How long would her legs have to be to get pinned between the cars in that shot? Unless there's a better angle I'd say she is fully on top of the car's hood.

       You mention a good point about the driver images being non-existent. I tend to think the ppl recording with phones or cameras would have tried to get a clear image of the driver by instinct, or at a minimum we would see more images.

       And if you take it one step further: Maybe the reason no clear photos of the driver's face were released or even captured was because staged protesters/operatives new in advance that the attack was going to take place and were instructed not to take photos of the driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other scenario is that clear photos of the driver's face actually were taken, but were confiscated by authorities so that they could selectively choose which photos and videos they would release to the press.

       1) Why would he be wearing his reading glasses at a protest? (There are multiple photos of him at the protest wearing them). Also, why would he choose to wear his reading glasses in the Facebook photo of him trying to look real cool leaning on his Challenger? He probably wouldn't have worn them if they were just reading glasses

       If they were withholding photos due to the investigation, then why would they release
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       photos or videos? Your logic doesn't make sense here. You're saying they're withholding photos and videos, but they already have released photos and videos to the media..
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if this were true, it only furthers the case for this conspiracy. It would make it seem like they only released photos and videos that fit the official narrative while not allowing any others to be seen (because those photos don't fit the narrative).

       Are you kidding me? No one is alleging that the attack didn't happen. What we are questioning is the official media narrative of what happened: "Crazed white supremacist angrily dives car into crowd of peaceful counter-protesters". This was the headline being shoved down everyone's throats almost
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       after the incident. Headlines like these are meant to create a strong emotional response and have worked very well at causing a huge outrage (as was intended). If you are the type of person that blindly accepts what the MSM tells you without question, then you would already be in a heightened emotional state after reading the headlines,
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       looking at the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is about not accepting authority, thinking critically, and using observation skills to assess what may have happened (instead of just believing what they say on TV). I personally do not believe ANYTHING I see or read from the MSM. If anything, it's only useful purpose is to give us a glimpse of what TPTB want you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often times when tragedies like this occur, it is not a completely
       <em>
        organic
       </em>
       event. What I mean by this is that there could be and more than likely actually is more to the story than what we are being told. There are multiple inconsistencies within the MSM narrative of what happened. The purpose of my post was to highlight what are in my opinion the most glaring inconsistencies that damage the official narrative.

       Yes. I think that's the most likely option. He would be what's referred to as a "patsy" or a "fall-guy". The purpose of all of this being to create further division and social unrest, to instill a fear of protesting in citizens, and to once again, prevent people from uniting and identifying the real enemy.

       He's not wearing his glasses in the mugshot because they are tinted and the arresting officers would have had him remove them so the color of his eyes could be determined.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I said "surrounding the vehicle", what I meant was "in close proximity to". There are people on the sidewalks on both sides of the vehicle, only a few feet away. They were not in the car's path and could have easily gotten a clear photo of the driver.

       I would like to see an image of his front windshield before he hits anything or anyone. Some have implied his front windshield was damaged before
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_orKYk_Q28E">
        this video starts
       </a>
       . @ the start of that video a screech, a possible flaring of weary type screaming &amp; a slight possibility of smacking sound can be heard. I would need to see evidence to verify such claims of the windshield being smashed pre~rampage to add weight to such claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know as he was already seemingly dangerously heading into the crowd
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XueTOhZ.jpg">
        a person unwisely in an illegal manner slammed a bat like object into the rear bumper
       </a>
       that could have sounded like a gunshot to the driver just before hitting the crowd. I do feel he was already about to hit the crowd @ that point though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it odd that if he was wanting to kill the opposite side with a super extreme malice mindset he did not seemingly fully gun that hot rod after the screech @ the beginning of the video. It seems like a small rev after the screech then a steady rate but not a continue of the rev pedal to the metal flooring forth as he continues into the crowd.

       While what you're saying is possible, it seems pretty unlikely. Also, don't you think it would have been kind of difficult to exit the scene the way he did if his glasses had fallen off? He reverses his vehicle at about 15 to 20mph, completely straight, for two blocks, without hitting any parked vehicles.. seems like he might need to have his glasses on to pull that off.
