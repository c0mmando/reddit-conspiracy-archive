       Well between the fact that media is creating a hostile environment in the us, and the daily call to arms on Reddit. Look at r/videos, their top post at the time is the ending of inglorious bastards (great movie) but it is the scene where they carve a swastika into a nazi's forehead. They are litterally trying to paint a picture where it's ok to do this. And that's fucked up. I don't like the idea of nazi's either but I don't think anything going on now a days is right, between tearing down statues and beating old people up, you would think antifa would do more productive things. Instead they are just creating civil unrest for fun, or maybe they are getting paid? Who knows

       I think the whole nazi thing is to single a group out and make it seem as if it's ok to dehumanize these people because they are nazi's. Beat them kill them, doesn't matter cuz nazi's.

       Said the same thing. The eclipse poses a real opportunity for something to go down. The dark sky drill after that also seems fishy to me.

       Antifa is in my opinion much more nazi like, everything I have seen has been antifa attacking people and people defending themselves. (((They))) can't warp the media when everyone and their mother has a cellphone with a 4mb camera that takes full hd video.

       I completely agree. It's really unfortunate that ever since Charlottesville, Antifa is now regarded as some sort of superhero squad, when really they are a minor domestic terrorist group

       So its a false flag when white nationalists are being targeted but then you cant sah the same for ppl to make it look like ANTIFA are violent? This sub will keep trying to intellectualize their racism when this shit is meant to be called out in this era while a bunch if trolls are acting victimized because nazis are being called out

       Yes, Antifa contains white people who are ashamed at the color of their skin, and also filled with hate and disdain towards others,, just like these white nationalists and stupid neo nazis. Both of these groups are completely ridiculous, violence will never change someone's mind or make them agree with you.

       First Berkeley, now Charlottesville... In both cases the cops were following orders to stand down and let the extremists fight. One theory is that they are trying to get the public riled up and pit them against each other. Expect more of these brawls in the street with useless cops looking on. Also expect more media hype - NYTimes riling up the liberalz with Trump Russia and Neo Nazi paranoia, Breitbart riling up the Trump supporters with the usual propaganda we're all familiar with by now. The goal is to ratchet up the hate between the two sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why they put in Trump. They did a little Diebold-type action to get this extremely divisive personality to be Tweeter-in-chief (Steve Bannon and Ken Blackwell are both members of the Council for National Policy).
      </p>
      <p>
       End game? Impeachment or assassination, followed by a part-real/part-manufactured "Civil War 2", then as a "last resort" martial law to bring back law and order.

       We found out through WL that the elites are often sadistic pedophiles or sadists who pay money for the rape and torture and consumption of children.
We found a bunch of their key players, made one of them (Pedofantis) lose his mind and threaten someone and their mother (they'd located his creepy refrigerated room from IG), ended Megan Kelly's career over anger at that interview with said creep. In the same emails, it was revealed private corps that cater to the uber-rich were complicit in much of the above (see comments about Hawaii hot dog stands and 60,000 "hot dog" ) parties.
Finally it went to the top with the elite families who pay for it, when we saw Hillary offering penance to Lynn De Rothschild over a fuck-up, in the same email set where a guy sacrifices a chicken to Moloch.
When people looked into this they realized the Russians pulled US adoption rights because they knew of above-mentioned fuckery long before WL. Voat went to work and it was discovered that ICMEC and NCMEC are highly sketchy organizations without oversight, which are likely being use to traffic children.
This is really imperfect and missing many parts, but you can understand why WW3 might seem like a good idea to people who have not destroyed enough trails to their misdeeds as yet. The last time people became this furious at the elites' lechery and spoke about such matters openly was before and during WWII.
Remember, Satan doesn't exist and stop asking questions about all the pedophilia. Don't don't ask yourself in a quiet moment how little you are thought of by the people who run the world. Don't do it, it's scary, not even messing around now.
EDIT: Oh and they're attacking new media because they want to control the narrative. Those charts that show how elites are all professionally intertwined, and also as families, are CANCER to TPTB. We're not supposed to have tools to figure things out. The speed with which people got on to the pizzagate stuff was scary, and the reaction more so. The world stopped in a few days and I saw PR collaboration between the UK, Vatican, Google pretty much all hinting that "no one read the wikileaks, be careful of fake news, and aren't pedos being treated too poorly?"

       The internet of course causes problems for the elites, however they determined that the trade-off was worth it because in return for our increased knowledge they get TOTAL SURVEILLANCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they can track exactly how "woke" people are by crunching the data. They know who's woke and who's not. Their strategy for dealing with the increase in truthers is to heard them towards approved figures like Alex Jones who can spew disinfo, steer the conversation away from certain topics, and bring them back into the two-party dog-and-pony show by supporting politicians such as DJT.

       It's a big media story, OP. It doesn't have to be fabricated. It was a grassroots protest, from what I can tell.

       That said, what is bugging me out a bit is the weird helicopter crash, where two cops died randomly and we haven't been told what happened. No official story yet. It's quite weird. Maybe there is a false flag element here.

       Well, the media is for-profit, not to mention struggling, and nothing draws ratings like violence and a race war. I'm having a hard time seeing a specific media conspiracy here. Obviously, the U.S. mainstream press systematically avoids important stories while propping up fluff....
