       The server was used as a way to circumvent the freedom of information act so that they could avoid requests as well as avoid conversations with Ted Cruz. He tends to email a lot. The downfall was that the server was insecure and they did not protect it as they should have. There is a lot of stuff they don't want everyone seeing for whatever reason. Some of it is actually reasonable. Most of it is not. Clinton was following typical protocol.

       Deliberately insecure so clients could access remotely.  Not all of the supposed intrusions were hacks.  Some were simply back-turned access for cash.  Let's not pretend that Hillary with simply negligent with IT.  She was using the server as a medium for premeditated treason.

       Remember though, she set up the server (actually he - Bill - did) for exactly the purpose it was used for - foreign access veiled as incompetence.  And remember, they did go to someone for illegal work, cough stonetear cough.  This is an embarrassment and until a team of white hat hackers figure out how to reestablish democracy in our world this behavior will continue.

       Though I have to say I'd go private email too with these massive leaks and "hacks" and to top it all off reports he is actually on vacation and remodeling WH because it was FULL of unknown and unofficial listening devices and cameras because Gen Kelly had it swept again last week after a 2 person in room conversation was leaked.

       That number 20 is severely downplaying the gravity of that email. And in the last year there is nothing in any news outlet that has published anything in the english language as explosive as that specific email. To rank that at number 20 tells me either the author of the website doesnt know too much about what they are doing or that the entire thing is as close a limited hangout as they could muster given the circumstance.

       Since Hillary and Obama has not yet received due punishment for their illegal activities we are not done talking about them.

       There needs to be a proper investigation that is not interfered with by a corrupt AG and FBI head, an investigation that is not smothered by political friends to the persons under investigation.

       You know why that won't happen? Because the FBI and AG won't spend money on an investigation that they know won't prove anything. They're not Congress, they actually have shit to do.

       It's been brought up on multiple occasions, the reason it was never made a big deal is because there's nothing to it. Obama knew she had a personal email, didn't know what her setup was or that she was sneaking past security.

       Saw something about with the reopening of the Benghazi case that he lied about knowledge of what was actually happening-which propelled this massive lie back into the spotlight. Lied about knowing she was committing federal crimes while there were emails they sent back and forth on her unsecured server. They could all be and probably are compromised from independent or foreign governments. Saw Clinton's SoS server was copied entirely to 3 additional foreign governments. With the classified and top secret material on it.

       Lots in the power positions of congress and the white house knew and used illegal offsite servers for communications with zero oversight. This is how tons of requests from lobbyists came. This is how all requests for pay to play came. This is how all money laundering, tumbling and coverups are achieved. The servers replicated the actual government servers and contained classified materials. Access is given for a price.  It's massive, it's been going on a long time and it implicates everyone from all sides of the aisle.

       You would be surprised. If Hillary and the DNC go down, many Bernie Sanders supporters who are still coping with the cheating in 2016 will cheer it up, even if Trump remains utterly despised and needs to go too.

       He's not going to be impeached because 2/3 of Americans don't like him. He's going to be impeached because he's violating the emoluments clause of the constitution. That's assuming he doesn't blunder his way into another crime in the mean time.

       Because he's profiting from foreign states. He (his is the SSN that is attached to his business and he is ultimately in control of it... there is no blind trust aspect to it) is receiving money from foreign officials to stay at hotels and the like that he owns... They are staying there to cozy up to the sitting President. Now could your interpretation of what I just said vary based on your politics? Yes. Impeachment is a political process. So it would require the political will of congress to charge that and that would require the complete decay of his supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that that decay is happening and that his base was small (in numbers) to begin with... I won't point you to polls or to the fact that Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes, because I know you will inherently disagree and I'm not going to debate the facts if we can't agree on a premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the map comparing blue counties to red counties, come on now, that's just silly... far more people live in the blue than in the red and a cursory google search would tell you that fact. But you shouldn't need to be told that fact if you've done any significant traveling throughout the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point it would seem that congress, the judiciary and vast swaths of the American people are against Trump and you can hear the bells of 2018 on the horizon. Good luck, sir. Hey at least you have the business community on your side...

       Member when Trump said he had a line of CEO's to replace the ones who want to leave and they should just leave and then they left and he just shut down the council because no one wanted to be on it. Cause I remember.

       Anything Trump's family is receiving in profits from guests staying at their hotels is pittance in comparison to the donations of millions of $$$ from foreign political powers and groups to the Clinton Foundation.

       What's silly about it? Exactly why the electoral college exists - to prevent 1 or 2 cities from having control over who gets elected. The POTUS represents all of America, not just New York and California. Do you realize how the election process actually works? It's not a popular vote contest.

       How is the investigation into the Clinton's going? It's almost as if there is no investigation going on at all!
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you think polls are always wrong, that's why I said I didn't want to discuss that. Because. We. Couldn't. Agree. On. The. Premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting though that in Trump's mind all polls are fake except the one's that are favorable to him... like when he tweeted that Rasmussen poll showing him at 48 (HAHA) percent...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't talking about the validity of the electoral college. You posted a map of 2016 county results, I guess to show how popular Trump is... I was simply pointing out that that is a bad indicator of popularity because the red counties, while geographically larger, contain less people. I actually support the electoral college, which I acknowledge he legitimately won and thus he is the President.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was being sarcastic about the business community supporting him. Hence the joke about all the CEO's leaving and him and having no one to replace them in T_D slang.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't bring up the economy because it was not directly related to what we were discussing... but since you brought it up, compare the job numbers of the last 24 months of the Obama administration to the last 6 months and you will find we are in the same economy. Why has the stock market continued to rise? Because that is what stocks do in bull markets... You are correct that he has not sent us into a tailspin.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here is my larger point- I believe Trump committed an impeachable offense. You say I am "speculating" ... sure, I guess. Removing a President from office is not a criminal proceeding, it is a political event. The founding fathers wanted to make it EXTREMELY difficult to remove someone from office outside of their electorate voting them out... it couldn't be just the political tide that forced someone from office (outside of an election) it would have to be a hurricane. In the removal of a President, the House of Representatives is the grand jury and the Senate is the jury... as with grand juries, the house has broad leeway on what to indict someone on, that is why the language on impeachable offenses is relatively vague- it's intentionally vague. What I addressed could easily result in impeachment IF there was political will for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I argue there will be. You argue... something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you in confidence that you don't know shit about what is going to happen in the next 3 years.

       It's been brought up on multiple occasions, the reason it was never made a big deal is because there's nothing to it. Obama knew she had a personal email, didn't know what her setup was or that she was sneaking past security.

       Speculation.

        Now could your interpretation of what I just said vary based on your politics?

      <p>
       Just because I support Trump doesn't mean that your speculation is speculation. There is no interpretation there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything Trump's family is receiving in profits from guests staying at their hotels is pittance in comparison to the donations of millions of $$$ from foreign political powers and groups to the Clinton Foundation.

        I believe that that decay is happening and that his base was small (in numbers) to begin with... I won't point you to polls or to the fact that Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes, because I know you will inherently disagree and I'm not going to debate the facts if we can't agree on a premise.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, because the polls are always wrong, and their sole purpose is to sway public opinion (into thinking Trump had no chance, foe example).

        Hillary Clinton received 3 million more votes

       Not that those votes actually matter, at all.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As for the map comparing blue counties to red counties, come on now, that's just silly... far more people live in the blue than in the red and a cursory google search would tell you that fact. But you shouldn't need to be told that fact if you've done any significant traveling throughout the United States.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What's silly about it? Exactly why the electoral college exists - to prevent 1 or 2 cities from having control over who gets elected. The POTUS represents all of America, not just New York and California. Do you realize how the election process actually works? It's not a popular vote contest.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At this point it would seem that congress, the judiciary and vast swaths of the American people are against Trump and you can hear the bells of 2018 on the horizon. Good luck, sir. Hey at least you have the business community on your side...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can tell you in confidence right now, Trump will remain president until 2020. I'd rather have the business community on my side than communists, anarchists, radical feminists, etc.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Member when Trump said he had a line of CEO's to replace the ones who want to leave and they should just leave and then they left and he just shut down the council because no one wanted to be on it. Cause I remember.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Almost as irrelevant as how well the economy is doing since Trump came into office. Not that you'd bring that up ever
