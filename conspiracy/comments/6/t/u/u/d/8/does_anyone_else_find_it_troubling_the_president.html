<p>Maybe Christianity wants to stay in power because they control the pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christianity is dying out. Most religion is as the internet reaches more minds. This is the one time in history religion might not get a chance to genocide atheists and allow them to grow and spread their own propaganda. Unless something catastrophic happens... which is religion&#39;s Trump card as it were. An excuse to get million&#39;s killed and get the atheists out one way or the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not semantics, at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how it works, at all.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve conspiracy is literally one of the most famous confirmed conspiracies.</p>

<p>The government borrows money from the Federal Reserve and pays it back with interest.</p>

<p>It is super corrupt and you should look into it. The news is organized almost entirely around maintaining the perception of authority for the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>New money is wealth created from scratch. New money makes old money worth less. That is exactly the position of power the Federal Reserve has placed itself in.</p>

<p>It is a collection private banks that will crash the market as soon as they start to lose a little power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the 1000+ years building up to it.  Rome didn&#39;t just appear out of nowhere.  Hyksos have been parasites on empires throughout history.  From Sumer, to Egypt, to southern Canaan, to Persia, back to &quot;Israel&quot;, Greece and Rome.  Christianity was created as a remerging of their Hebrew traditions and their more &quot;Western&quot; counterparts.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care about the religion, or any race, specifically.  They only care about power, and ruling over the world.  The Abrahamic parasite has been a terribly effective form of mind control (government) for thousands of years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s all about power. However, the ones currently ruling will use religion and race as tools to keep that power.</p>

<p>Between 300 CE and 400 CE Rome went from Paganism to Christianity. Prior to that Rome was at war with Egypt and Jerusalem. They used their religion and the race of their enemies to keep that power. Once Rome went to Christianity after a Pagan-Christian battle, they too used religion and the race of their enemies to keep power. </p>

<p>Roman Pagans just turned Christianity into a Pagan-filled tool to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve always been &quot;pagan&quot;, even during their stint as Hebrews.  The Bible was written during the Babylonian Empire, into the Persian, around 600-500 bc, roughly.  They used this absolute, monotheistic entity as a form of mind control and it synergized well with their &quot;divine right to rule&quot; nonsense.  </p>

<p>The next few centuries revealed that this religion created a fanatical mindset in its followers, so they shifted their &quot;pagan&quot; empires into a more monotheistic, easily controlled, but still very fanatical form.  Christianity was phased into the Roman pantheon from ~100 ce, and rose in power and influence, until it was formally institutionalized at almost 400 ce, kicking off the dark ages, and feudalism, quite nicely.</p>

<p>And these rules consider themselves above the common folk, so some wars between empires aren&#39;t exactly devastating to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kinda on the fence, leaning more towards probably not.  There&#39;s history and &quot;going ons&quot; happening in that time which would be hard to fabricate, even in the dark ages.  Plus the eclipses that are supposed to match up with current calendars.  So, I&#39;m not strongly opposed to it, but I doubt it.  With their penchant for rewriting history, though, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me :)</p>
