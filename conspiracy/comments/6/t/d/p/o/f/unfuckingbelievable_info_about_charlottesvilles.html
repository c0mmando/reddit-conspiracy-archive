<p>Also, maybe if we didn&#39;t have such corrupt assholes in charge of things, people would trust them to do the work and not feel the need to do their own investigation, but everything is so corrupt that people don&#39;t trust the authorities.</p>

<p>Are you saying that the authorities should be explicitly trusted and we should never question what their narrative is?</p>

<p>Depends on what you mean, you&#39;ll have to be specific.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll have to show me the police report where the police claim he was acting in self-defense. Seems like an odd thing for the police to decide without a trial.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll have to show me where the police are claiming this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Asking for evidence regarding claims <em>is</em> fighting for the truth. Believing things without evidence, based on feels, is the enemy here.</p>

<p>i&#39;m saying that is what the man offered in self-defense. Later, they upgraded it to 2nd degree murder (since it wasn&#39;t pre-meditated). </p>

<p>Look up the initial police report issued after the attack after he was taken into custody. It&#39;s all there. I&#39;m not saying there was any judgement - that will be in court - but this is what the guy is claiming.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was asking you about what you thought the police report was claiming, since you were making it sound like the police had made a judgment about his motivation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you advocating for a police state where citizens hold no right to investigate crime and corruption? why can&#39;t people look into things? This isn&#39;t gonna stop happening - people have always wanted to help bring justice. Back before the internet they would put open calls out for information or clues, so this isn&#39;t new. What is new is that there is no longer a filter and certain pieces of evidence and narrative are getting through to the public before those in charge can filter out the ones they don&#39;t want to be shown. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You only post disparaging comments.  What&#39;s so hateful about looking into political connections?  This is a conspiracy sub.  I&#39;ll give you that pointing out he&#39;s Jewish may be irrelevant, but wondering if it was self defense, a false flag, or if the cars were different is par for the course for this sub and conflating it with &quot;hate&quot; is such a tired tactic.  &quot;Don&#39;t question Sandy Hook, you are so insensitive blah, blah, blah,&quot; that is what you sound like.  It doesn&#39;t work.  There is fuckery afoot.  Post constructive information or stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The self-defense line literally came from the Daily Stormer. The false flag stuff is so thin and hurried that it seems to me like a deliberate effort to gin up a conspiracy theory, perhaps to distract from people discussing the significance of a deadly attack.</p>

<p>Oh, and pointing out that the mayor is Jewish <em>&quot;may&quot;</em> be irrelevant? You don&#39;t think you&#39;re being too negative there, do you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normal people will only discuss the attack.  This is a conspiracy sub, so we will discuss political events through that lens.  Okay, the self-defense line came from &quot;Daily-Stormer,&quot; it&#39;s still a possibility as we do not have all the information (plus, prove that that is the origin with citations), shooting the messenger does not work well in this sub. </p>

<p>&quot;May&quot; because we know there are Jews and there are Zionists.  Kind of like Mike Pence is a Christian, but he MAY be a zealot based on his statements, affilitations, actions.  These concerns can exist in a logical, tempered way.  I don&#39;t feel comfortable with religious fundamentalists of any kind in power, it&#39;s dangerous.  Zionism is dangerous.  ISIS is dangerous.  The Westboro Baptist Church and their ilk, are dangerous.  </p>

Blacks own more business and hold more executive positions there than anywhere else. Lawyers, Doctors, etc. Go visit Atlanta someday. It&#39;s unfortunate people still believe the stereo type that the south is full of nothing but racist whites keeping  blacks poor, uneducated and marginalized.
