        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, by this definition, Muammar was indeed a dictator. I won&#39;t say that he was a very good person because he did things that were bad but under him, Libyans had a 10 times better life than they have post 2011. Why is that?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see some facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Electricity bills in Libya didn&#39;t exist and for all Libyans, electricity was free</li>
<li>If a Libyan citizen couldn&#39;t find a job after he finishes his university education, the country would pay the average salary for that profession until he finds a job</li>
<li>Gaddafi worked on the biggest irrigation project just to be sure that every citizen can get water (the Man-Made river project)</li>
<li>All newly married Libyans would receive 60,000 Dinar (about 50,000 $) by the government to buy their first apartment/house so they can start a family</li>
<li>Small but significant portions of Libyan oil sales were credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyans</li>
<li>A mother who gives birth to a child would receive $5,000</li>
<li>Education and medical treatments were free in Libya</li>
<li>25% of Libyans have a university degree today. Before Gaddafi only 25% of the population was literate. That number now is 87%
So, as much as a dictator Muammar was, life in Libya was better even under him than it is now with no functional government, the country is in chaos and most of the things that Muammar gave Libyans doesn&#39;t exist anymore. Don&#39;t forget that ISIS is a problem as well. </li>
</ol>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is, they had universal basic income and a system where college graduates were guaranteed living wages even if they couldn&#39;t get work? Why can&#39;t we have those things? Not like the US is going to invade itself and then rape our president to death with a bayonet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oil, of course, has been mentioned frequently — Libya is Africa‘s largest oil producer. But one possible reason in particular for Gadhafi’s fall from grace has gained significant traction among analysts and segments of the non-Western media: central banking and the global monetary system.</p>

<p>According to more than a few observers, Gadhafi’s plan to quit selling Libyan oil in U.S. dollars — demanding payment instead in gold-backed “dinars” (a single African currency made from gold) — was the real cause. The regime, sitting on massive amounts of gold, estimated at close to 150 tons, was also pushing other African and Middle Eastern governments to follow suit.And it literally had the potential to bring down the dollar and the world monetary system by extension, according to analysts. French President Nicolas Sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call Libya a “threat” to the financial security of the world. The “Insiders” were apparently panicking over Gadhafi’s plan.</p>

<p>&quot;Any move such as that would certainly not be welcomed by the power elite today, who are responsible for controlling the world&#39;s central banks,” noted financial analyst Anthony Wile, editor of the free market-oriented Daily Bell, in an interview with RT. “So yes, that would certainly be something that would cause his immediate dismissal and the need for other reasons to be brought forward [for] removing him from power.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Wile, Gadhafi’s plan would have strengthened the whole continent of Africa in the eyes of economists backing sound money — not to mention investors. But it would have been especially devastating for the U.S. economy, the American dollar, and particularly the elite in charge of the system.</p>

<p>“The central banking Ponzi scheme requires an ever-increasing base of demand and the immediate silencing of those who would threaten its existence,” Wile noted in a piece entitled “Gaddafi Planned Gold Dinar, Now Under Attack” earlier this year. “Perhaps that is what the hurry [was] in removing Gaddafi in particular and those who might have been sympathetic to his monetary idea.”</p>

<p>Investor newsletters and commentaries have been buzzing for months with speculation about the link between Gadhafi’s gold dinar and the NATO-backed overthrow of the Libyan regime. Conservative analysts pounced on the potential relationship, too.</p>

<p>“In 2009 — in his capacity as head of the African Union — Libya&#39;s Moammar Gadhafi had proposed that the economically crippled continent adopt the ‘Gold Dinar,’” noted Ilana Mercer in an August opinion piece for WorldNetDaily. “I do not know if Col. Gadhafi continued to agitate for ditching the dollar and adopting the Gold Dinar — or if the Agitator from Chicago got wind of Gadhafi&#39;s (uncharacteristic) sanity about things monetary.”</p>

<p>But if Arab and African nations had begun adopting a gold-backed currency, it would have had major repercussions for debt-laden Western governments that would be far more significant than the purported “democratic” uprisings sweeping the region this year. And it would have spelled big trouble for the elite who benefit from “freshly counterfeited funny-money,” Mercer pointed out.</p>

<p>“Had Gadhafi sparked a gold-driven monetary revolution, he would have done well for his own people, and for the world at large,” she concluded. “A Gadhafi-driven gold revolution would have, however, imperiled the positions of central bankers and their political and media power-brokers.”</p>
