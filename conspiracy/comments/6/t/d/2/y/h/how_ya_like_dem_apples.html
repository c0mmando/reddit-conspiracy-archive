Then add in insults and slander and I just want to scream and quit...</p>

<p>I take walks and try not to let users bother me. But the fact everyone suggested I do this more. And when I did they responded so negatively kinda hurt :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats my problem really...
A. No formal education...</p>

<p>I&#39;m more forward minded. I see a logical device which is explainable and ive done well to elaborate it from an engineering perspective. </p>

<p>Yet this requires skillsets I don&#39;t have. I.e. developers, modeling specialists, coders / programmers...
(probably more specialists fron various fields). </p>

<p>I assume its easily a million doller concept with a billion dollar potential return. Imo a poc is anywhere between 0.00 and maybe 2 million. The question is how much time will the data take to analyze? Will it work? </p>

<p>Just drives me crazy. Programmers are like. Just pick up a book on (name xxx platform)... </p>

<p>Ive tried to think of ways to prove the concept as far as recording activity live on the australian radio array?
This to show speed increases in flux tubes during a solar emission. </p>

<p>So, any route I go coming from a poverse perspective is a challenge. Yet the more challenging part is continually giving away the concept for free in hopes I will ever be credited for it. Hence the fast tracking crowd sourcing attempt :/</p>

I&#39;m literally a self taught helio armchair physicist. Ive taken some courses on seismology, geology, and volcanism. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been monitoring these since 3/11 japanese 9.0
As I saw the solar data live and accurately assessed the event in advanced. I began posting tests on the multiple aftershocks. Slowly refining my process since then. 
(in public forum). </p>

<p>After several life tragedys I simply took a leave of absence, burying my past handle. Stress was too high, and while I was off I merely put my concepts on hold. </p>

<p>Im doing my best to fast track myself through electro magnetic induction, physics, and thermo dynamics. </p>

<p>Learning advanced mathematics, calculus, algebra. Attempting to learn the values of each field and its role in the processes I am failing to elaborate upon. </p>

<p>I merely see a system and cause and effect via solar intrusions and escalations of seismic intervals. </p>

<p>I gather we can and will extract this data via a simple system of monitoring. In hopes to achieve something ground breaking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot to learn, no doubt. Something to maybe keep in mind is how you would show success to others. That&#39;s what control groups are for. You could, for instance, define something like 10 geographic areas in which to predict earthquakes. For ease of the example, let&#39;s say each group has an identical past history of earthquake rates. If each of your predictions identified 1 of those 10 areas, and if, after a significant number of predictions, your success rate greatly exceeds the random success chances, then your model can be easily shown to others as having merit. That&#39;s a massive simplification of the process, but that&#39;s the general idea. Anyway, again, it&#39;s your project and not mind, but something like that would help you gain momentum in working with others.</p>

<p>I have proven differently, I&#39;ve demonstrated that within the zone you outlined, there were over 70 earthquakes over 6 magnitude in the past year, one every 5 days.  Your claims are as accurate as basic statistical analysis would indicate they should be.

<p>That&#39;s the thing about science, it&#39;s usually very pedantic ...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, it fell outside of the predicted window, it doesn&#39;t matter by how much, the prediction was actually incorrect.</p>

<p>The place where it actually happened according to his words had a &quot;lesser Chance&quot; of it happening.  In his own post he bolded <strong>&quot;6.5 warning newzealand</strong>&quot;, which never happened.</p>

<p>He is also linking to the China earthquake as if it somehow validates this &quot;prediction&quot;, a location over 10,000km away from his &quot;prediction&quot; ...</p>

<p>I&#39;ll believe it when it&#39;s demonstrated to be anything more than statistical coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was given as a &quot;warning&quot; implying increased likelihood not certainty that it would happen. Most significantly though, he listed two specific locations for the event &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and the event occurred at location &quot;B&quot; as named. </p>

<p>The China quake was well outside his parameters so I certainly can not in any way defend his claim that that event was confirmation of his prediction. In fact, if he himself thought about that for a moment he&#39;d realise he can&#39;t have it both ways; Either the China quake was the event he predicted or the Indonesia quake was the event but it can&#39;t be both. Also China was neither lcoation A or B. Again, much of the &quot;science&quot; he states is provably false highlighting his lack of understanding in many relevant fields, but, he appears to be more accurate than random guessing. </p>

<p>Statistically a &gt;6MM earthquake occurs somewhere on Earth every 3 days (on average) so random guesses <em>would</em> seem to have a pretty decent chance, but being able to name the specific location <em>and</em> time in advance as he has is somewhat remarkable. He&#39;s been right on enough occasions to indicate it is not random chance.</p>

<p><em>Anyone</em> can access the USGS and NOAA data. If you look at many major quake and then refer to NOAA data and you will notice increased solar activity in the days prior. This is a consistent recurring phenomenon. It&#39;s not a guarantee of a quake but does seem to indicate that interactions are at play that may trigger a quake on an already stressed faultline. Quakes can and do occur outside of these parameters due to other factors though and solar events do not always trigger fault ruptures. </p>

<p>Also interesting but not neceassrily related, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter_(satellite">French &quot;Demeter&quot; satellite</a>) measured a significant increase in ULF emissions over Haiti prior to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">2010 Haiti quake</a>. Now, that doesn&#39;t neccessarily relate <em>at all</em> to <a href="/u/ParsingSol">/u/ParsingSol</a> &#39;s theory, however it does indicate that our understanding of seismic mechanisms is not complete.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting theory and he&#39;s certainly not the first or only person to notice a correlation. It certainly warrants investigating. </p>

If probability performs worse than solar data, then it shows merit.

<p>I doubt a 6.0, but hey what do I know. 4.0 and 5.0 isnt relevant as these would be standard aftershocks to the area activity following this event... </p>

<p>I dont say 4.5 chile 3.0 mammoth lake ca. 1.2 washington. Thats probability. Not solar data-and plotting;</p>

<p>Thats the difference in what I do and what your doing. </p>

<p>You just are delimiting the difficulty in what I do. </p>
