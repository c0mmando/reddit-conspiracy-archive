<p>Is it normal that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; spam talking points of the US government? There&#39;s been a concerted effort to label Trump an &quot;outsider&quot; even though he&#39;s the POTUS and the most powerful man in the world. It&#39;s hilarious. </p>

<p>Trump IS the government, and the people who defend him 100% while posting bullshit like &quot;Podesta is a spirit cooker&quot; and &quot;Hillary assassinated DNC leakers&quot; couldn&#39;t be any more transparent in their shilling.</p>

<p>Then there is a special secret meeting with the Press where they all take turns gently massaging trump&#39;s cock while receiving the New GovernmentÂ® talking points and marching orders.</p>

<p>Trump did something a little funny here though, taking them all by surprise. Some wept and the scale of the task, at how hard it would be to work for their fearless leader. He said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are going to play some YUGE 5G super behind the back chinese checkers here. I need you guys to go even further than you did during the election, ridiculing every smallest thing I say and do. My staff will work with you, leaking every thought and decision that enters my glorious head. We are going to convince the entire world that I am completely inept, even small pink babies will revile my name and question the origin of my parentage. The entire things needs to grind to a halt. I want my office so paralyzed my ass turns into a diamond extruding playdoh machine. Yessss, Pinky, it will be grand. No one will see me coming!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve just gone and undermined yourself completely though.</p>

<p>I was called a shill by a few people like you a few days ago for pointing out that what you just said is bullshit.</p>

<p>You&#39;re one of the people who pretends George Soros is an all-powerful boogeyman; a comic-book villian, 100% evil from conception. &quot;George Soros is a human being&quot; would be downplaying it to you because &quot;evil&quot; is omitted.</p>

<p>You&#39;re like these people:</p>

<p>The vast majority of people aren&#39;t part of your circle-jerk. Many are critics of the man but they don&#39;t go around blaming him every time they can&#39;t find a clean fork.</p>

<p>If it is just establishments, that is legit work. I err on the side of torrent all the things, but if someone is generating revenue off of the media, that is clearly not ok.</p>

<p>You said this, which is why I commented.  You&#39;re comment seems like YOU think it&#39;s black and white, that cops are the epitome of corruption.  NO! Cops are people, some are good some are bad and most are sitting in the middle somewhere.</p>

<p>So what is a society without cops? Without laws?</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of hearing this anarchist bullshit spread around by young people who immediately start screaming for the cops to help when some racist fucking prick drives his car into the crowd holding BLM signs and shouting fuck the police.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pathetic and dumb.  If they think cops are so bad then don&#39;t scream for them when you need them.</p>

<p>Cops are people, right wingers are people, left wingers are people, white people are people, black people are people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m specifically addressing this in the context of the conspiracy community. They are the enforcers, the comply or die squad, and it&#39;s getting much worse, not better. They are worshipped as heros , and their lives are magically worth more in the eyes of many. Often the same people who SAY they would never give up their guns. The same ones who back comply or die. </p>

<p>Just following orders, and just doing my job. I feared for my life, but the citizens are not allowed to fear for theirs or fight back in any manner. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually call the police. I&#39;d would in a heartbeat if it was the proper response and helped people, but they dispatch everything with most 911 calls, as I&#39;m much more likely to need fire or met services, both professions I highly respect, as they are responsible for saving more lives than most police. </p>

<p>Personally, even though it would not end well at first, and the irresponsible would cause much harm, I&#39;m down for arming everyone as a possible solution for the gun issue, since we sure can&#39;t undo their existence. </p>

<p>I honestly believe there will be a major forfeiture operation in the near future, and a lot of weapons will be among the seized items. The reasons will be flimsy, but it won&#39;t matter, as the populace is primed. Respect is one thing, elevation to hero status for wearing a badge is another, And it&#39;s VERY VERY real in our society. 
Remove the profit, the motivation to enslave and steal from the populace, remove immunity that makes them exempt from the very laws they are supposed to enforce. Perementaly ban any officers involved in FATAL shootings from armed duty. Encourage non violent solutions, and penalize officers who hold &quot;constitutionalists&quot; in disdain, like it&#39;s wrong of you to know your rights. </p>

<p>When the entire system is corrupted, it&#39;s really difficult for an officer to change it alone. It&#39;s very well documented that the blue line is real, and many did NOT start out that way. </p>

<p>Have you ever started working a new job for a big company and seen improvements that NEED made? Bring up violations to management? Sometimes, maybe some will listen, but most of the time peop,e will keep doing what&#39;s been working so far. And as long as they stack juries, push for pleas, and have blanket excuses when they fear and people give them passes, the assumption that their lives are the most important ones that need to go home at night... I&#39;ll have issues with the system. </p>

<p>Propaganda that contributes to authoritarian worship is most surely a topic of merit where we are supposed to question authority. </p>

<p>i do in NO way advocate violence , be it against officers OR criminals. Most of all not against the innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the majority has been silent for too long, and the active mods display very clear bias.  It&#39;s not surprising to see the pendulum start to swing the other way as word gets out that yet another subreddit has been corrupted into one-sided politics.  Hell right now there&#39;s a thread that&#39;s blatant partisan politics with no relation to conspiracies on the front page of the sub yet the mods haven&#39;t touched it.</p>

<p>Considering threads like this one that are negative reactions to this sub moving back towards neutrality or at least stepping back from politicization, the &quot;never partisan&quot; majority has a lot of work left to do.  On top of that the thread is full of posts with a very clear political bias that isn&#39;t what the thread is claiming are a problem.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> should be neutral and separate from politics.  At the moment, it is not.  It&#39;s telling that the OP claims to only recently notice something that makes the sub feel &quot;very off.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m a <em>huge</em> advocate of what Trump campaigned on, and still am. I want a wall, lower taxes, and constitutional judges. Got no problem admitting that. Remember, he was the anti-establishment candidate, more so than the others at least.</p>

<p>Considering that the web was only consumerised under Clinton&#39;s Presidency, and only became very popular under Bush Jr.&#39;s Presidency, that isn&#39;t much of a sample size.</p>

<p>Or are you too young to remember how toxic political discourse was during Bush Jr.&#39;s 8 years? The difference under Obama is, criticism of the President shifted from &quot;He&#39;s a war criminal for faking WMD evidence and killing 1 million Iraqis&quot; to &quot;He&#39;s a Kenyan Marxist&quot; and &quot;He&#39;s a Muslim&quot;.</p>

<p>It went from actual criticism of a President&#39;s actions, to racist conspiracy theories because the new President happened to be black.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I was expecting a reasonable response and instead got a rant about how Obama is indeed a Marxist (a neoliberal Marxist? ha...) and total denial over the fact Obama was relentlessly targeted with racist conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>If you thought Obama was a Kenyan, or a Muslim, then yes, you&#39;re a racist. If you think Obama&#39;s a Marxist, you&#39;re fundamentally ignorant of economics and world affairs. Obama is a neoliberal, economically aligned to the major European centre-right parties (UK Conservative Party, German CDU/CSU alliance, French UMP/Republicans, etc.).</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious you don&#39;t even know what a Marxist is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes I was a Ron Paulbot.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the biggest kicker of all. Ron Paul, the man who claimed to be a libertarian, but pushed the We the People Act: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislation_sponsored_by_Ron_Paul#We_the_People_Act">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislation_sponsored_by_Ron_Paul#We_the_People_Act</a></p>

<p>This was legislation which would&#39;ve prevented the SCOTUS from overturning unconstitutional state laws, if they fell within the following domains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forbids all federal courts from hearing cases on abortion, same-sex unions, sexual practices, and establishment of religion, unless such a case were a challenge to the Constitutionality of federal law. Makes federal court decisions on those subjects nonbinding as precedent in state courts,[58] and forbids federal courts from spending money to enforce their judgments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty amusing that a libertarian would fight so hard to protect state laws which bar atheists from holding office or criminalise sodomy...</p>

Regardless of the issue, the federal government, if it does not have the authority given by the constitution,  has no say per the 10th amendment.
The danger is in giving or wanting the federal government to enact policy in which it does not have authority, no matter how racist or sexist or whatever it is. They use these issues in their march towards absolute totalitarianism, the opposite of libertarianism. Ron Paul recognizes this.  </p>

<p>No it&#39;s not. Obama sucked corporate cock with the best of &#39;em. You aren&#39;t a very smart leftist if you don&#39;t know what Marxism is (even the so-called cultural Marxism of the Frankfurt school which really prefigures Debord&#39;s <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>, which honestly, is still one of the best analyses of how power operates in late-stage capitalism. Debord was a Situationist, by the bye).</p>

<p>Ah, really, you aren&#39;t left-wing at all, but a &quot;liberal&quot; and a confused and muddled-thinking one at that. You&#39;re shut down because while you have a right to &quot;free speech&quot; you also are free to be criticized for what you say.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to tell you now, what you are saying is problematic, because is you being defensive about your cultivated ignorance. You think that you are right and good-thinking, but the reality is that you are just another tool of oppression. You would actually benefit in your life from reading Marxist type thinkers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote <em>Self-Reliance</em>, which on one level is about owning and controlling the means of production for the actual benefit of the community.</p>

<p>Rad some books, and get better at explicating your ideas, rather than whining about your so-called allies find you to be a crypto-racist. Get some fucking perspective beyond your limited one.</p>

<p>I called you a crypto-racist because of that comment. I&#39;m sure you can unpack it for me (and illogically defend every point), but this sounds like the way a certain group of people talk who can&#39;t embrace the racism that&#39;s in there subterranean thoughts. You have no empathy for PoC and no awareness of their long history of struggle. </p>

<p>MLK explains it better than I ever will</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. </p>

<p>I have a whole board here. </p>

<p>Then I won&#39;t see every post in a thread.</p>

<p>That&#39;s bitch shit. </p>

<p>No, what you&#39;re doing now is bitch shit. Literally bitching. </p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer no mods except to remove shilly posts and prevent brigading and threats. </p>

<p>How can I do this without user reports?</p>

<p>Be part of the problem or part of the solution. If you don&#39;t want to help us - you won&#39;t get help from us. But don&#39;t come crying for us when the mean interney bullies hurt your feelings and the moderators leave things up (because I don&#39;t read every thread here).</p>

They are employed by various groups to help spread their message but these companies existence and purpose is no conspiracy, it is public record. Sadly there is nothing that can be done about it. Any individuals comments that go against their narrative will either be downvoted out of sight or attacked on other platforms by handfuls of fake profiles in an attempt to discredit whatever you are saying. The two partys saw how close they were getting to losing their control over americans to independents and realized the free infomation of the internet was what was leading the charge. They cant control what we say, but with these companies they can control the narrative and steer the way you think. The internet has began a slow death of what it once was </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The pendulum swings, a Republican is in office so yes you will see more disagreement if you align with there views.
 Fuck some of y&#39;all are losing it thinking everything is a conspiracy if it doesn&#39;t flow with your narrative. Republicans fucking suck at governing and they are getting blasted because they suck. The last time they were in power we were attacked by a man in a cave(narrative), and the economy fell apart.</p>

<p>The worst conspiracy theory against the dems were drone wars and Obamas flimsy birth certificate. That&#39;s it.

<p>Yeah you&#39;re right.  Who cares about Fast &amp; Furious, IRS targeting an opposition political movement, his use of the IC against political opponents, his massive hike in questionable drone usage, Lybia, Iraq, Syria, Bo Bergdhal, $1.6 billion US dollars in cold hard cash to Iran, and all of those other nothingburgers that totally weren&#39;t scandals.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> problems Obama had were those stupid racists talking about his fake birth certificate and the serious possibility of him not being born in the US.  Can&#39;t wait for you to ignore all of that other stuff and home in on the birther bs.</p>

<p>Massive hike in drone usage (no shit). You can use drones in lieu of humans during conflicts.</p>

<p>Fuck it I&#39;m not going through the rest because these are some weak sauce accusations compared to Weapons of mass destruction  , and 9/11 and using black water agents in Lousiana after Katrina  and again I&#39;m not trying to normalize this shit but come on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! Only a few months, and people have forgotten Hillary complaining about the libertarian dominance of Youtube and the internet, whereupon she took a widely-reported meeting with the heads of Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit.</p>

<p>And then voila! The next day you started to see the algorithm manipulation to tamp down on actual posters and the ascendancy of the ShareBlue paid astroturfers. </p>

<p>Basically, the Clintons ruined Reddit. Just like the ruined the banking industry when they gutted Glass-Steagall (and allowed Goldman Sachs to buy up commercial banks, ushering in the era of Too Big To Fail). The same way they destroyed the mainstream media by opening it up to foreign ownership with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Up until then, it was a national security matter NOT to have foreigners flooding our airwaves with their propaganda. After Bill Clinton changed that, Australian Rupert Murdoch created Fox News (just months after the Act was signed into law). Israeli Haim Saban created Univision. Mexican plutocrat Carlos Slim bought the New York Times and turned it into his personal open borders/pro-drug cartel blog.</p>

<p>Now our media looks like North Korean-style Third World yellow journalism.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re watching is something phenomenal. Trump is NOT being attacked by his own nation&#39;s media. He&#39;s being attacked by foreigners who got to hijack our media after Bill Clinton opened the doors to them. (It&#39;s why Bill Clinton is given god-treatment.)</p>

<p>The gutting of Glass-Steagall is also why Hillary was giving speeches at Goldman Sachs (which she hid) where insiders said, &quot;She talked like she was a managing partner there!&quot;</p>

<p>(She was.)</p>

<p>Without Bill&#39;s gutting of Glass-Steagall, investment banks wouldn&#39;t have been legally able to buy up commercial banks (and use the money from the depositors to cover their reckless speculative activity . . . that culminated in the 2008 financial crash).</p>

<p>It&#39;s why Hillary received 99.8% of all Goldman Sachs donations during the election.</p>

<p>Everything the Clintons touch turns to shit. </p>

<p>And now we&#39;re seeing their &quot;magic&quot; as it affects Reddit (and the wider internet).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Uniparty. I know.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why the neocons and DNC enjoy the cozy relationship they have now.</p>

<p>Basically, the Uniparty happened under Clinton. One has to remember the history. Clinton emerged from under the shadow of Reagan. America had veered to the Right. The very term &quot;liberal&quot; became toxic (which is why they started calling themselves &quot;Progressives&quot;). They had to re-brand.</p>

<p>Clinton ran by calling himself a &quot;New Democrat&quot;. Well, what <em>was</em> a &quot;New Democrat?&quot; It was a conservative Democrat, who ran on Republican issues. Remember: Clinton ran on cutting government waste, reforming welfare, shutting down illegal immigration, and championing the Defense of Marriage Act.</p>

<p>He was <em>not</em> a liberal Democrat.</p>

<p>But Clinton&#39;s biggest paradigm shift was turning the Democratic Party away from its original union/pro-working family platform and appealing to money from Wall Street. He saw the war chest that Republicans were commanding from places like Goldman Sachs, so he ditched the unions and went to Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Thus the creation of the Uniparty . . . where both Republicans and Democrats were pro-NAFTA, pro-Goldman Sachs, pro-neocon wars, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why the Democratic Party shifted from being anti-illegal immigration to pro-illegal immigration. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You really don&#39;t know what veto proof means do you?  And Gramm-Leach-Bliley had almost nothing to do with the  crash.  None of the big banks (Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that failed were affected by it.</p>

<p>Also, first you say &quot;Clinton ran on...shutting down illegal immigration&quot; and then you say &quot;It&#39;s why the Democratic Party shifted from being anti-illegal immigration to pro-illegal immigration. &quot;</p>

<p>Clinton also ran on raising taxes on the rich, and cutting defense spending,  and by doing so reduced the federal deficit which brought in 8 years of broad based growth.  He was not a supply side &quot;trickle downer&quot; like Bush and Reagan.</p>

<p>He may not have been as progressive as you, or even he, wanted to be but a president can only do as much as the people, via congress,  allow him to do.  It&#39;s called democracy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s Clinton sounding <em>exactly</em> like Donald Trump on the subject of illegal immigration lowering wages and hurting American workers, and the necessity for beefed-up border security: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auZRVqrCLY8&amp;amp;t=13s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auZRVqrCLY8&amp;amp;t=13s</a></p>

<p>Clinton&#39;s original position was the traditional Democratic position of being pro-worker (and anti-scab). &quot;Illegal immigrants&quot; are merely scabs being used by the corporations to destroy unions and drive down wages. This is why union organizers like Mexican-America Cesar Chavez were vehemently against illegal immigration. It&#39;s why Democratic President John F. Kennedy ended the Bracero worker program which pipelined in Mexicans in the 1940s and 50s. </p>

<p>Clinton, back in Arkansas, had no tolerance for illegal immigration and was in fact attacked by the ACLU for his strict adherence to immigration law, vis-a-vis the foreigners he found in the country illegally. </p>

<p>But Clinton&#39;s rock-ribbed Democratic position of protecting the American worker underwent a change when he went to Washington and turned to financing from Wall Street. Wall Street wanted wages artificially depressed. In fact, NAFTA specifically addresses this point. One of its key features was &quot;normalizing&quot; the pay differential between the United States, Canada and Mexico. By &quot;normalizing,&quot; they meant raising Mexican wages and lowering America wages. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Basically, since the &quot;financialization of the U.S. economy&quot; started in the 1970s, the crony-capitalist class has been desperately trying to hide rampant inflation (caused by obscene amounts of money-printing). In any normal economy, we&#39;d be experiencing massive price increases from the declining purchasing power of the U.S. dollar. But they struck upon a strategy of &quot;outsourcing our inflation&quot; by sending Treasury bonds to the Central Banks of foreign nations. Another method of praise-manipulation was widespread, industrial-scale illegal immigration. </p>

<p>If the United States had its original labor market setup, workers today would be pulling in six figures a year, on average. But through the magic of illegal immigration, the average American worker hasn&#39;t had a raise (in real dollars) since 1979.</p>

<p>(To understand the difference between &quot;real wages&quot; and &quot;nominal wages,&quot; see John Maynard Keynes&#39; <em>The General Theory</em>.)</p>

<p>Long story short, Clinton basically ditched his old constituency (working families) and went over to the Dark Side. The Democratic Party went from the group that respected and advocated for workers, to what they are today: elitists who manifest nothing but contempt for the unwashed, knuckle-dragging, high school-educated working class. (And it&#39;s even worse if they happen to be the <em>white</em> working class!) They harbor nothing but open contempt for them, calling them lazy, backward and less-than-foreigners (who are held up to be more industrious, stoic and worthy).</p>

<p>Odd, because almost all of these foreigners come from shitholes. One would think logically that (with such superior, hardworking stock) Honduras must be a paradise. Contrariwise, with all those lazy, good-for-nothing Americans, the United States makes no sense in having its civil engineering wonders, skyscrapers and space programs. </p>

<p>For &quot;lazy, inferior, ne&#39;er-do-wells,&quot; it&#39;s amazing what a country Americans built.</p>

<p>But the modern Democrat doesn&#39;t allow facts to intrude on their globalist contempt for the American worker (or the culture and prosperity that he built). They celebrate replacing him with the Pakistani, Mexican or Somali.</p>

<p>This new elitist contempt for the American worker is the antithesis of Progressive-ism. Because it&#39;s good to remember that the Progressive movement started with William Jennings Bryan advocating on behalf of the American worker in the 1880s. Progressive-ism had nothing to do with transgender rights, or abortion, or foreigners in the country illegally. It was all about the American worker.</p>

<p>But the modern Democratic Party (as changed under Clinton) shifted away from William Jennings Bryan and the American worker, and tried to pull a switcheroo, where &quot;the new Progressive-ism&quot; is supposed to be about transgender toilets or some shit.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re going to make a <em>huge</em> deal about the rights of albino dwarves in wheelchairs . . . meanwhile fuck you about your declining wages and lowered standard of living. You racist!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I was expecting a reasonable response and instead got a rant about how Obama is indeed a Marxist (a neoliberal Marxist? ha...) and total denial over the fact Obama was relentlessly targeted with racist conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>If you thought Obama was a Kenyan, or a Muslim, then yes, you&#39;re a racist. If you think Obama&#39;s a Marxist, you&#39;re fundamentally ignorant of economics and world affairs. Obama is a neoliberal, economically aligned to the major European centre-right parties (UK Conservative Party, German CDU/CSU alliance, French UMP/Republicans, etc.).</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious you don&#39;t even know what a Marxist is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes I was a Ron Paulbot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the biggest kicker of all. Ron Paul, the man who claimed to be a libertarian, but pushed the We the People Act: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislation_sponsored_by_Ron_Paul#We_the_People_Act">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislation_sponsored_by_Ron_Paul#We_the_People_Act</a></p>

<p>This was legislation which would&#39;ve prevented the SCOTUS from overturning unconstitutional state laws, if they fell within the following domains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forbids all federal courts from hearing cases on abortion, same-sex unions, sexual practices, and establishment of religion, unless such a case were a challenge to the Constitutionality of federal law. Makes federal court decisions on those subjects nonbinding as precedent in state courts,[58] and forbids federal courts from spending money to enforce their judgments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty amusing that a libertarian would fight so hard to protect state laws which bar atheists from holding office or criminalise sodomy...</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not. Obama sucked corporate cock with the best of &#39;em. You aren&#39;t a very smart leftist if you don&#39;t know what Marxism is (even the so-called cultural Marxism of the Frankfurt school which really prefigures Debord&#39;s <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>, which honestly, is still one of the best analyses of how power operates in late-stage capitalism. Debord was a Situationist, by the bye).</p>

<p>Ah, really, you aren&#39;t left-wing at all, but a &quot;liberal&quot; and a confused and muddled-thinking one at that. You&#39;re shut down because while you have a right to &quot;free speech&quot; you also are free to be criticized for what you say.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to tell you now, what you are saying is problematic, because is you being defensive about your cultivated ignorance. You think that you are right and good-thinking, but the reality is that you are just another tool of oppression. You would actually benefit in your life from reading Marxist type thinkers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote <em>Self-Reliance</em>, which on one level is about owning and controlling the means of production for the actual benefit of the community.</p>

<p>Rad some books, and get better at explicating your ideas, rather than whining about your so-called allies find you to be a crypto-racist. Get some fucking perspective beyond your limited one.</p>

<p>So, during a 2014 book tour of silicon valley she got four of the biggest internet companies to agree to agree to help her win the election two years later?</p>

<p>He&#39;s questioned 9/11, normalized references to the &quot;Deep State,&quot; called for an audit of the Federal Reserve, and pointed out media and voter manipulation (like no former President dared to).</p>

<p>He says that shit because he knows it will get idiots like you to vote for him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, yes, the actual posters on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who&#39;ve been here for years aren&#39;t rabidly anti-Trump (no more than they were anti-Ron Paul).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was pro-Ron Paul, but am anti-Trump just like Ron Paul himself is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump isn&#39;t even a real Republican. (Most of his platform is JFK&#39;s from 1960.) In fact, he was attacked precisely for NOT being a &quot;real Republican&quot;. So this isn&#39;t a Republican versus Democrat issue. (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> likes truth-tellers from both sides. And face it: Trump is a conspiracy theorist, like us. He probably has an account on this subreddit.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was attacked for being a vile, crass &quot;human being&quot;.  If he has an account here it&#39;s so he can occasionally make vague references about  conspiracies to make you think he is one of us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You . . . you . . . you hate Ron Paul! You must marginalize anyone who questions the TV! Trump&#39;s fans . . . er . . . uh . . . are all Russian bots!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that the_donald is a botnet has been proven over, and over again.  It&#39;s kind of a running joke at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Silence dissent!&quot;
Ban people! Censor! </p>

<p>No one is saying any of that.</p>
