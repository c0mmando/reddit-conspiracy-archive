<p>Anybody hip to a guy named Peter Joseph? Believe he produced the Zietgiest series as well as started the &quot;Zeitgiest movement&quot;, which is a global anti NWO movement.</p>

<p>Everybody should check out this amazing series he did a few years back called &quot;Culture in Decline.&quot; Short, highly informative, well edited (and he sprinkles in comedy as well, a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down).</p>

<p>The first episode in particular though, covers this topic. This is a crash course ok how the social engineers operate, and how they created our false left right paradigm, and how our democracy is a sham.</p>

<p>Give it a watch, and share it on your social media pages. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bTbLslkIR2k">https://youtu.be/bTbLslkIR2k</a></p>

<p>Peter is highly underrated. He is honestly probably the furthest thing from a shill I have seen. I see no &quot;shillery&quot; within him. Self funded, middle class, has a degree in percussion, produces all the music for his films. This guy is the real fucking deal folks, I promise you. check him out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They make it so you ignore every vote you have except for one. The one they do, they make it like your vote makes a difference, and the person you are voting for can make everything better. They then control who exactly you can vote for with a duopoly to pre-select these people. They then focus on the most irrelevant aspects of these people to make them as equally bad, and because they are bad you don&#39;t wanna vote because &#39;both sides are the same&#39;. Then whoever gets voted in, they don&#39;t do everything they said they would because they it gets block by the people they made you ignore.</p>

<p>Voting does make a difference if you care about more than the top leaders who are never gonna actually change anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;m not sure I agree on this one. I wrote a long post in October 2016 about how I was absolutely convinced voting was futile. I said it was so clearly rigged, from the voting machines to the media. </p>

<p>Even today, the only way I can describe the election and its disconnect between what I saw as the truth (with all the Wikileaks and primary rigging), and what was being presented (&quot;Clinton is the clear and obvious winner with Trump not standing a chance)&quot;, is to call it the Truman Show. I know others felt the same. It was this feeling of being inexorably battered with disinfo and wondering if you were the only sane person in this funhouse of insanity. </p>

<p>Well, Clinton lost. Regardless of what one thinks of Trump, I am firmly convinced she was the candidate of the deep state. But she lost, because she didn&#39;t get enough votes. As such, I think our vote counts. Maybe not with all the full force that it should (vote fuckery still goes on), but it does. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry but this is way off the mark.  Where are all the cities with their own fiber networks?  Why did Obama allow unfettered and largely unregulated expansion of fracking if he was so concerned with the environment?  As far as Citizens United, that&#39;s a huge win for both parties since they each accept zillions of corporate dollars and open their cabinets to crony billionaires.  Obama was a huge friend to Wall Street and Big Pharma, as well as several other oligopoly/monopoly oriented industries.  </p>

<p>What has practically changed between the two administrations?  We still have endless, expanding war.  Wealth inequality continues unabated.  Healthcare is a complete mess.  Corporate America gets it&#39;s way on every issue, surveillance capitalism continues, pollution grows, human health and well-being deteriorate, wealth continues to concentrate and the 1% write policy in their own interests and remain above the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Donald was chosen by the deep state because he&#39;d be easier to control and would have fewer favors to pay back than Hillary.</p>

<p>Voting in this country is a ruse.  We know that 3 letter agencies have tampered with foreign elections.  Is it too far fetched that they&#39;d tamper with their own?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The person to fucking vote for to be president is not the 2 people who end up being elected by our 2 party scam system. The type of person to vote for is the guy who is off to the corner that can&#39;t even get to answer a debate question.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe a president really controls much but they&#39;re not just going to let someone who doesn&#39;t fit as their puppet in there.</p>
