       I have gone back and forth on Trump and now I'm back on the Trump train because I believe he has been running theatrics for a few months for 14d chess purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not 100% on this but it seems that there is a white hat vs black hat war going on and the white hats are winning. He had to fake it for a while though.

       Because Trump ran for president for like 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 29 he just planted seeds in our collective consciousness. Rumors he may want to run, interviews on political and daytime talk shows for no real reason, and periodic updates on his financial prowess.(including rebounding from bankruptcy and branding himself the king of debt)
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, at last possible chance to run for president, he runs, and he goes fucking insane. For no real reason. And it works because he already subconsciously convinced half of us he's as good a candidate as any, his opponent was the worst candidate there has ever been, and the conservative/blue collar crowd loves them some wild and crazy TV shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no doubt he's a charlatan. But there is still a lot of doubt about his motives. That's why some people are still on board or still in lets see what he does before I judge him mode.

       He's a time traveler and prepared several smoke bombs for himself to use in case of emergencies. Maybe he's holding this card for a reason.

       Never forget 7/26 - trans tweet confirms he's using twitter and the msm to drown out what's actually going on.

       I used to be a top contributer on The_Donald.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted literally over 100 posts a day on there, and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that. I made 900,000 post karma in only 3 months. I had no life.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the shitty mods over there perm-banned me for non-bannable offenses, such as "insulting Jesus Christ". Yes, seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to a mod who I knew on there personally and asked to get unbanned.
      </p>
      <p>
       This process happened over and over and over again over the weeks until finally, the mod who unbanned me every time was kicked from the mod team, regardless of the fact that he was a top moderator.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I am currently perm-banned from the subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The users there are great, but the mods suck serious dick. They are, quite frankly, a pack of fucking assholes. Every last one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My last and final ban on The_Donald was for "being a karma-whore". No, I'm not joking.

       Because he has "bought" Politicians in the past.  He flat out stated it during one of the Republican Primary Debates.  If you "buy" a politician, you are investing in them.  You guard your investments and try to help them grow and succeed so you, in turn, have gains.

       Nothing overtly crazy about this.  He bought, used, and endorsed the Clinton's as long as they served his interests.  When he ran for office, they didn't serve his interests, so he threw them under the bus.

       The debates were amazing political theater.  You watched career liars get completely stumped when Trump admitted and explained how the system worked, and what we've all thought for a long time now.  It was both refreshing and delightful to watch the politicians stammer and shift uncomfortably.

       Trump has no integrity when it comes to making statements in front of cameras.
      </p>

       It's masterful gas-lighting. You never know what he truly means because of all his contradictions, but at the end of the day you have to believe he won't screw you.
