<p>I hope I can help bring more information about the organization to the sub.</p>

<p>I am not giving my personal information because I am not speaking on behalf of any elected officials or Aipac itself and want to protect myself from embarrassment, but I will speak with honesty and with as much detail as I can!</p>

<p>I will post as quick as I can and answer as much as I can!</p>

<p>Edit- well that seems to be it- thank you for your questions, sorry if I could not meet the burden of proof for some of you</p>

<p>Feel free message if you want to do another or if there is specific proof I can provide </p>

<p>Shalom!</p>

<p>Edit edit- I will keep answering as long as people post, I am happy so many people have been excited to talk</p>

<p>Edit edit edit- ok now it really seems the questions have wrapped up</p>

<p>My question would be Michael Oren called Hillary a friend to israel yet documented how she made Bibi keep a line always open so she could dictate policy to him. How do you see that relationship in todays politics? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow ðŸ˜³ </p>

<p>I do not agree with that at all</p>

<p>Aipac is a lobbyist organization. We prepare policy proposals related to the Israel America relationship and introduce them to congressman, then we discuss there merits and why we feel they would help both countries. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even directly endorse candidates or fund them directly, that&#39;s through private people like me or separate pacs running ads</p>

<p>We dont hire assassins or black mail people, that&#39;s crazy, that&#39;s like saying the aarp has ninjas </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aipac does not give money to your congressman </p>

<p>I give money to your congressman </p>

<p>I am the person who is anti BDS because I don&#39;t like it, I support the anti BDS bill because it&#39;s based on the preexisting law from 1974 that America would not support future embargoes against Israel after it supported the global arms embargo that led to that invasion </p>

<p>That law all ready exists, we are just adding the BDS label to it- it&#39;s all ready illegal for America to embargo Israel and has been for 30 years! </p>

<p>The law does not regulate citizens, just organizations and NGOs </p>

<p>You can not buy hummus as much as you want </p>

<p>Regardless, if your congressman supports Israel because of effective lobbying by people like me then yeah, good, your wrong</p>

<p>Israel is good </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calling for a boycott against nations or states condemned by the UN Human Rights Council doesn&#39;t boycott &quot;based on mere affiliation with the state of Israel;&quot; the requirement according to the anti BDS law.</p>

<p>The UN provided evidence to support the allegations. Burden of proof would then fall on those nations on the list of human rights violators to provide evidence refuting the UN&#39;s claims, no? Then it&#39;s a human rights matter, not specifically an anti Israel matter. I don&#39;t think anyone would say no to a genuine democracy and an ally in the middle east. That&#39;s not the part everyone gets hung up on, but it&#39;s the go-to line of defense for lobbyists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have met on off probably they past 8 years. Not a huge fan of her work at DNC. My number one problem with her has been her refusal to make county positions in the Democratic Party PAID- this probably more then anything has killed the party. Even a small salary of $10,000 a year would attract talent to the county chairs to make sure democrats ran in races, but NOPE, nothing.</p>

<p>Volunteers only, which is stupid, which is why we lose to republicans.</p>

<p>Aside from that she is a typical party hack and not really in my crowd since I came in during the Obama era and she is a Clintonite </p>

<p>Seriously, Israeli dual citizenship is basically just a Jewish tradition to people in politics, no one is trying to subvert anything, I personally think Aipac benefits America because our policy is good and Israel has been doing a good job of using diplomacy to avoid giant wars in the region which used to be common </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad things are getting better, and I really do hope that people don&#39;t have to live a life mired in war and conflict.  We believe in life, liberty, justice, etc.   Not just for our fellow citizens, but for everyone.</p>

<p>I do think you might have a slight conflict of interest at times.  If something you&#39;re pushing doesn&#39;t benefit the average American but it benefits the average Israeli citizen, how do you proceed?  The media makes it look like you will always side with the Israeli&#39;s, so people tend to think you don&#39;t give a shit about us.  We don&#39;t see a lot of lobbyists pushing for deregulation...  Just more rules and more regulations that slowly erode at our liberty.  Our constitution has been under attack since before it was signed, and we are getting tired of even the appearance of an attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well most people don&#39;t talk about economic policy because if it bleeds it leads </p>

<p>But as I mentioned elsewhere economic zones in the West Bank are the real hotness in policy right now and probably why we will have a Palestine state fairly soon</p>

<p>See, no likes the settlers, and they will be divested, but there are a lot of factories and such constructed in the settlements that arabs work, no one wants those gone, so a solution needed to be made to keep those and make those legal but get rid of the settlers</p>

<p>That&#39;s where this is all heading </p>

<p>And the real source of the boycott law, to protect the new, legal, economic zones and divest the illegal settlers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s adding the BDS label to the present law on ngo&#39;s and organizations </p>

<p>So currently NGOs and organizations that embargo goods from certain parts of Israel in certain ways are able to be sued, if they do it in support of terror they can go to jail </p>

<p>They want to put the BDS label on the civil part for certain products made in certain regions of Israel and occupied Palestine- currently the West Bank has shared industrial zones with Israel that are not considered occupied territories and Israel wants products made in those zones not boycotted </p>

<p>See, it gets technical once you break it down </p>

<p>The ACLU is arguing that there is the potential for criminal liability </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well specifically the last time America engaged in this kind of embargo it was used to funnel illegal money to terror organizations in the Middle East in the disguise of aiding the embargo, this eventually culminated in the 74 invasion </p>

<p>So there is a precedent for these boycotts being used to hide money and just increase political violence </p>

<p>Now if your PRO violence against the state of Israel or seek dissolution this law is probably frustrating</p>

<p>For Americans directly it will continue support the free trade between the two states that makes a lot of money, also it protects the economic zones that was created by the PA for the purpose of helping make money in the West Bank </p>

<p>Basically it&#39;s a money maker for everyone involved in Middle East trade and peace </p>

Just let that be known.  Anyways, could you explain how I could support an embargo by sending money to terror groups?   Not that I want to or support that in any way, but is a law like this the only way to stop what you are trying to stop happening, and would it actually work?  In our experience the laws don&#39;t stop the lawless from breaking the law, and our law abiding citizens pay the price by having their rights eroded.  Feel me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I get you, again it&#39;s technical and YOU are not its target which is why there is a lot of confusion </p>

<p>This is more about say, you make the &quot;Israel is bad&quot; ngo which is dedicated to BDS. You start using it to raise money to fund what you might actually think are BDS groups ect, you get the money from online sources that are not properly vetted, you then give the money to organizations to &quot;help&quot; Palestine and support the BDS movement </p>

<p>Boom, you took terror money and moved it through your ngo to assist a terror organization </p>

<p>This was a really stupid version but a completely common way this happens, radical groups hide their money like this constantly. So when you remove a label it makes it harder </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel sad for people like you, in denial of the state that Israel has devolved into. These are facts.</p>

<p>Israel is an theocratic apartheid state that glorifies its soldiers to the point of absurdity. </p>

<p>An IDF soldier murders an incapacitated Palestinian in cold blood and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/israeli-soldier-guilty-manslaughter-shooting-palestinian-elor-azaria-abdel-fattah-al-sharif">Prime Minister Netanyahu argues for the murderer to be pardoned.</a>

Several such incident have occurred where innocents (children and adults alike) have been murdered and IDF meters out minimal or no punishments.</p>

<p>Illegal settlements continue to expand year in and year out with the backing of the Israeli state, denounced by the majority of the developed world. Settlements are illegal according to international law.</p>

<p>For every dead Israeli there is now almost 10 dead Palestinians.</p>

<p>Do you feel no shame?</p>

<p>How is AIPAC financed? Do members pay a fee? How are members selected? Do you get paid/compensated in some way (directly/indirectly)?</p>

<p>Why did you decide to join and push for policies benefiting Israel? Do you have a dual pass? If yes, since when do you and your parents live in the USA(roughly to stay anonymous)?</p>

<p>I do not agree with that at all</p>

<p>Aipac is a lobbyist organization. We prepare policy proposals related to the Israel America relationship and introduce them to congressman, then we discuss there merits and why we feel they would help both countries. </p>

<p>That&#39;s it</p>

<p>We don&#39;t even directly endorse candidates or fund them directly, that&#39;s through private people like me or separate pacs running ads</p>

<p>So currently NGOs and organizations that embargo goods from certain parts of Israel in certain ways are able to be sued, if they do it in support of terror they can go to jail </p>

<p>They want to put the BDS label on the civil part for certain products made in certain regions of Israel and occupied Palestine- currently the West Bank has shared industrial zones with Israel that are not considered occupied territories and Israel wants products made in those zones not boycotted </p>
