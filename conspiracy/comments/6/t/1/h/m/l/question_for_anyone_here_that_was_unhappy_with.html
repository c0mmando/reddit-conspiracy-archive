        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I asked this to several people in the thread about it here yesterday, and not one person replied. So I&#39;m legitimately interested in what a better response would have been.</p>

<p>Personally, I think he handled it well. He not only trivialized Putin&#39;s decision, but he also avoided escalating the situation by using humor and sarcasm over threats and condemnation. I&#39;d go so far as to say that I&#39;d bet a guy like Putin would actually respect a response like that. </p>

<p>Granted, I understand there are a lot of people who think that Trump is incapable of criticizing Putin. But that then brings up the question of why is it a bad thing that Trump and Putin show respect for each other? Getting along with our biggest enemies should be seen as a good thing for the American/Russian people right? </p>

<p>I really wish he would have handled the situation with North Korea in the same manner. Just laughed off Kim&#39;s comments with some sarcastic response and let it be. </p>

<p>Anything that moves us away from war = Good</p>

<p>Anything that moves us closer to war = Bad</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not a supporter of either party, just looking to further understand the POV of each side better. If you&#39;re not interested in having an open, honest, and civil discussion about this, then please do not participate.</p>

<p>Edit: God damn, 36% upvoted? Seriously? You&#39;d think this post would FLY to the top with how &quot;infested&quot; this place is with T_D trolls... /s</p>

<p>Edit 2: Really surprised to see how many rational and reasonable responses I got. Happy to see there&#39;s still people here that don&#39;t buy into this two party BS, nor MSM hysteria over nonsense.</p>

<p>Because cases of this magnitude take time? And this is also a case of collusion and the trump campaigns possible involvement in it? Seems like they&#39;re dialing in on the Trump tower meeting.</p>

<p>Ill spin that question around. If the Russia thing is a hoax and its all bullshit. Why is Mueller still investigating? Why is he ramping up the investigation, hiring more people who are giving up millions. </p>

<p>Why is Trump constantly deflecting and distracting if he&#39;s innocent? </p>

<p>Which is how you tie trump to russia? Are you honestly that dumb? Do you think Trump doesn&#39;t have tons of money tied there, whether it be his family or his business? His own sons are quoted as saying as such. Did you honestly think Mueller wasn&#39;t going to look at Trumps Financials? Something he has kept from the public for so long?</p>

<p>Trump has been corrupt for years. Has also denied he had any money tied in russia till he was forced to disclose that. Just like everyone in his administration. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>So what you&#39;re saying is Mueller has connections with Russia? Is that what you&#39;re saying? How does that help your argument? Not to mention this was an independent counsel and he was confirmed to have no conflicts of interest. Even gave up MILLIONS to work this case.</p>

<p>Well respected by anyone who&#39;s not paying attention, maybe. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read every scrap of &quot;evidence&quot; produced on the matter, and as I said above, it&#39;s STILL all speculative and not conclusive proof of anything. </p>

<p>What&#39;s QUITE pathetic, is people like you, who come here to do exactly what you&#39;re doing; derail the conversation and be complete dickhead to anyone that you disagree with. </p>

<p>If no one&#39;s paying you, and you&#39;re not a bot, then I really feel sorry for you. Do you truly have nothing better to do with your life than sit on reddit just to shout about how your side is better, your more right, other people are stupid, and shit on Trump? Because that&#39;s a pretty sad existence. You could at least TRY to have some form of productive conversation.</p>

<p>I seriously thought we were passed this. Are people really still trying to push this narrative?? Unbelievable. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been almost a year, and the BEST evidence they have for it is still incredibly shaky and essentially speculative. Any hacker knows how to not only cover their trail, but also leave false trails to other people/countries/organizations. So the fact that this is the only evidence that they are relying on for all of this, seems very much like the tension is 100% a creation of the US.</p>

<p>Ever consider that he shit talks everyone in Washington because they are all compromised by the same people that Putin has been battling for the last decade? I mean, I&#39;m in no way saying this is right/true/provable/etc., all I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s an interesting theory that would make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Trump didn&#39;t put sanctions on Russia, Congress did, and then strong-armed him to sign it. That doesn&#39;t seem at all suspicious to you?</p>
