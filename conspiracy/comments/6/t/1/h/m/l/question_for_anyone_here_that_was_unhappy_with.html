       I asked this to several people in the thread about it here yesterday, and not one person replied. So I'm legitimately interested in what a better response would have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think he handled it well. He not only trivialized Putin's decision, but he also avoided escalating the situation by using humor and sarcasm over threats and condemnation. I'd go so far as to say that I'd bet a guy like Putin would actually respect a response like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, I understand there are a lot of people who think that Trump is incapable of criticizing Putin. But that then brings up the question of why is it a bad thing that Trump and Putin show respect for each other? Getting along with our biggest enemies should be seen as a good thing for the American/Russian people right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish he would have handled the situation with North Korea in the same manner. Just laughed off Kim's comments with some sarcastic response and let it be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that moves us away from war = Good

      <p>
       Anything that moves us closer to war = Bad

       Disclaimer: I'm not a supporter of either party, just looking to further understand the POV of each side better. If you're not interested in having an open, honest, and civil discussion about this, then please do not participate.

       Edit: God damn, 36% upvoted? Seriously? You'd think this post would FLY to the top with how "infested" this place is with T_D trolls... /s
      </p>

       Edit 2: Really surprised to see how many rational and reasonable responses I got. Happy to see there's still people here that don't buy into this two party BS, nor MSM hysteria over nonsense.

       Touche, that would have definitely been the more "Presidential" way to handle it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time though, I feel like that might have pissed off the left even more. Imagine how quickly this would turn to "Trump admits that he RESPECTS Putin and Moscow!!"

       He didn't expel all US diplomats, just about half. And about the response doesn't matter. The US is so divided that regardless what Trump does half the people will defend it and half will attack it.

       It's so sad to see the country like this. How is anything supposed to get done with that kind of mindset?? Trump does good things and bad things. Unquestioningly supporting him or unquestioningly opposing (and even viscerally hating) him seems like a recipe for disaster.

       But, ultimately, I guess that is exactly how TPTB like it.

       Wasn't Moscow's decision a result of the new sanctions bill that Trump was forced to sign by the House and Senate? If so, then Trump's response was a perfect de-escalation of concocted tension by Congress.

       Because cases of this magnitude take time? And this is also a case of collusion and the trump campaigns possible involvement in it? Seems like they're dialing in on the Trump tower meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill spin that question around. If the Russia thing is a hoax and its all bullshit. Why is Mueller still investigating? Why is he ramping up the investigation, hiring more people who are giving up millions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Trump constantly deflecting and distracting if he's innocent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not offer up those tax returns he's been so keen about hiding ?

       Mueller is still investigating because it's the only chance you have at doing anything to Trump. Last I heard, Mueller is no longer directly investigating Russia collusion, but is going for Trump's financial records and family history. It looks like a desperate over-reach and the public is tired of hearing the MSM cry wolf.

       Which is how you tie trump to russia? Are you honestly that dumb? Do you think Trump doesn't have tons of money tied there, whether it be his family or his business? His own sons are quoted as saying as such. Did you honestly think Mueller wasn't going to look at Trumps Financials? Something he has kept from the public for so long?

       Trump is a businessman elected President. Of course I expect him to have some (legal) financial dealings with foreign countries, especially Russia who is the #2 world superpower. What's your opinion on Mueller being involved with the uranium that was sold to Russia?

       Trump has been corrupt for years. Has also denied he had any money tied in russia till he was forced to disclose that. Just like everyone in his administration.

       So what you're saying is Mueller has connections with Russia? Is that what you're saying? How does that help your argument? Not to mention this was an independent counsel and he was confirmed to have no conflicts of interest. Even gave up MILLIONS to work this case.
      </p>

       See you're attacking mueller, you have to attack credibility to make yours make sense and just like trump, you're failing at that.

       It's been almost a year, and the BEST evidence they have for it is still incredibly shaky and essentially speculative. Any hacker knows how to not only cover their trail, but also leave false trails to other people/countries/organizations. So the fact that this is the only evidence that they are relying on for all of this, seems very much like the tension is 100% a creation of the US.

       That doesn't make any sense.  Our personnel are gone, we now have a materially worse ability to keep tabs on political and intelligence developments in Russia.  If I steal your lunch, and you say "Haha that sandwich sucked anyway," it doesn't make
