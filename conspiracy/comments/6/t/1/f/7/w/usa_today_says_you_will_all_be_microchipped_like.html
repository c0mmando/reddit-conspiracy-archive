<p>Why isn&#39;t this top of the sub? Or bring discussed on other subs? What the fuck? Everyone I know is going crazy over this. (here in the United Kingdom.)</p>

<p>Edit. Wow! I know it&#39;s not many but this is the most upvotes and comments I&#39;ve ever had and my goal of creating a discussion was achieved. </p>

<p>Thank you all so much for participating!</p>

<p>They managed somehow to convince the mass that despite all the satellites and radars and probes and tracking devices and stuff listening 24/7, a 747 plane was &quot;lost&quot;. </p>

<p>Despite all the technology to track financial transactions, there still are trillions of dollars flying to tax havens, and &quot;they can&#39;t do anything about it&quot;.</p>

<p>The day the whole population is chipped and have all their moves recorded and stored, there will still be &quot;crimes&quot; and &quot;attacks&quot;, and they will use their MSM to say the technology was not working in these specific cases and that they &quot;can&#39;t explain&quot; what happened.</p>

Its a matter of making the people think that those features are in the best interest of each citizen and the better good of &#39;Murrica.

    <div class="md"><p>People&#39;s beliefs are hardly about any form of rational conviction. People believe what they believe because they are punished for believing anything else. The idea that the government somehow needs the people&#39;s consent is kind of a modern fairy tale. They could introduce such chips tomorrow and what would happen? Nothing. A few people would revolt maybe but most would just accept it and bitch about it. Sadly. Freedom is all but an illusion in this human existence. An illusion that in itself is likely useful to tptb (less resistance/trouble).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with <a href="/u/Reality_is_a_scam">/u/Reality_is_a_scam</a> in the sense that the mark of the beast is already around us. The wording is that &quot;no one can buy or sell&quot; without it. Social security numbers and/or government currency already accomplish this without having anything physical. So I think it&#39;s a mistake to expect it to materialize only in the right hand or forehead. I mean what if it&#39;s in the left hand or the foot, yet everything else fits the prophecy?</p>

<p>exactly my thinking. if you refuse to get chipped, they will treat you like a criminal. plus 95% of people will be saying how wonderful the chip is, so between the people saying it&#39;s good and the people submitting out of fear, there will be a very few resistors left for the state to deal with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where did the multiple translations thing come from anyway? Most of them were written in Hebrew, Greek, or(I&#39;ve heard anyway) arabic. We still have all of them and in their original language. The only ones that have been translated from a translation would be either translated versions of the Latin Vulgate (Original --&gt; Latin --&gt; translation) or foreign language translations of English translations (Original --&gt; English --&gt; translation).</p>

<p>That said, I know that a fair amount of translations compare themselves to other translations and revise according to them, but it&#39;s far from some sort of game of gossip where it&#39;s translated again and again till no one is sure of it&#39;s original meaning as every <em>good</em> translation is always compared to the original language books.</p>

<p>As for pi, Could you state where in the bible it says that? I tried to find it, but I&#39;m afraid I couldn&#39;t find anything except for this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, when thought out would come to a ratio of 3:1. Now, first off, 3 and 3.14 are both pi, or, technically, neither is pi. One is just closer than the other. Also, cubits are in <em>no way</em> exact measurements, cubits being based on the width of human hands rather than a standard and regulated unit of measurement. Considering that, I&#39;d say it&#39;s quite accurate for what it.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s true...?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version#Translation">Like Tyndale&#39;s translation and the Geneva Bible, the Authorized Version was translated primarily from Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic texts, although with secondary reference both to the Latin Vulgate, and to more recent scholarly Latin versions; two books of the Apocrypha were translated from a Latin source. Following the example of the Geneva Bible, words implied but not actually in the original source were distinguished by being printed in distinct type (albeit inconsistently), but otherwise the translators explicitly rejected word-for-word equivalence.[122] F.F Bruce gives an example from Romans Chapter 5:[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even translating from one language to another is enough to lose meaning. Let alone multiple. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We still have all of them and in their original language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And almost no one will read them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>A cubit is ~1.5 feet. That&#39;s more of a margin of error than can be written off. </p>

<p>And regardless, other stories like Noah&#39;s ark are completely impossible on multiple fronts. </p>

<p>Either the bible is completely right, or it can, and will, be wrong. You cannot pick and choose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m not too worried about it. even the ones in the future. i work around enough microcontrollers and similar equipment that i&#39;m confident they will be vulnerable to hacking and/or masking. a metal mesh in a glove would render this thing (and any other antenna containing chips in your hand) useless, even if it did try track you in some way. a transmitter with enough power to be picked up at any decent distance would more than likely cause tissue damage and wouldn&#39;t be allowed. </p>

<p>there are huge benefits to having your data handy on an internal storage module. benefits to you, not to Big Brother.</p>

<p>imagine diabetics or other chronic disease sufferers having data that can just be hit with a reader by EMS personnel, or even chips that do active monitoring of health stats that can control future pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. not to mention all the day to day interactions that can be streamlined using this tech like doing away with keys of all types, meshing with home sensors to turn on lighting or heat when you enter a room, or similar things. </p>

<p>honestly the only people i&#39;ve spoken with who have issues with this type of tech are people scared of the line in Revelations, and people paranoid about tracking. tracking can be defeated in so many ways, even if it&#39;s a relatively high power transmitter. the religious argument...well, it&#39;s difficult to argue against someone&#39;s beliefs. especially when you think they&#39;re goofy. </p>

My concern is what&#39;s stopping the ones with power using the devices for more negative purposes? Say this chip can monitor your oxygen, blood sugar levels, heart rate.....

    <div class="md"><p>but the people in need of that kind of thing (those with pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc) are ALREADY vulnerable to electrical issues that effect their equipment. nothing changes there.</p>

<p>if it&#39;s just monitoring, it wouldn&#39;t have the ability to harm you. maybe if it <em>controlled</em> a pacemaker or insulin pump it could be hacked to kill, but that&#39;s not any worse than the current tech where badly shielded microwaves can disrupt a pacemaker or any more vulnerable to hacking than the new smart insulin pumps that talk to smartphones via bluetooth. </p>

<p>if all the chip is doing is ID&#39;ing a person (keyless entry or user identification for cars/homes/computers/smartweapons/etc) or holding data (medical info for EMS/doctors) then there&#39;s nothing that a nefarious actor could do to hurt you with it. </p>

<p>think of how useful an embedded, encrypted, flash storage module could be (think Johnny Mnemonic)? maybe add bluetooth or whatever the new flavor of wireless comm would be. it&#39;d be dead most of the time, and powered up via an RFID reader type of thing when you needed it.  </p>

<p>i see a vast potential for good in this kind of tech. </p>

<p>all new tech has the potential to cause harm in the wrong hands, but if you go into it aware of that, then you can mitigate the majority of it. </p>

So many people will be on board. What&#39;s stopping someone from manufacturing them to control population? Not hacking ,making it easier to eliminate people? 
For instance 100 people die daily due to overdose. As Americans if it&#39;s even noticed it gets the response of &quot; how sad&quot; or &quot;we should do something&quot; and we go back to our entertainment. No one would notice if it rose to 125 or 150. Effectively eliminating after a time a problem. No more people under the bridges. No one getting their panties in a twist over being inhumane. They did it to themselves. Right? Whistleblower making waves? Gone. Disability cases. Gone. Done with even a halfway logical plan noone would notice for a few generations if ever. 
I&#39;m also going to point out that it doesn&#39;t have to be a stopped heart. Binaural waves are already a studiable thing. Why not equip the chips to affect brain waves? 
Yes most of what I have written could be done now but not as quietly. I can lay down my phone, hike into the woods effectively disappear if I want.  I wouldn&#39;t be able to with a chip.</p>

<p>uh, the population. the market itself. pass a law that forces implant soft/firm/hardware to be open source. study the devices and see what they do before agreeing to get the implant. blindly trusting them and accepting whatever they want to inject is just being stupid. but i guess the majority of people do that now with vaccines so i guess there&#39;s that argument...but the info for vaccines is out there and some people DO care and only choose to get the ones proven safe...so that does show promise for implanted hardware too. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>yeah, you would, though. there would be an entire new market for &quot;Faraday clothing&quot; (which could also make stun guns and tasers pretty useless if done right). </p>

<p>people hack microcontrollers all the time. we retro-engineer them at work on a weekly basis. people would be able to monitor them and see what they do. you KNOW that some hacking group would get hold of the cool new tech and disassemble it to see what it can do. </p>

<p>you could force them to be open source before allowing them into the market. </p>

<p>you can protect the people from the stuff you&#39;re worried about and still have the benefits. just don&#39;t accept the &quot;hidden&quot; BS in them. make them open source and user accessible. don&#39;t give them the ability to do nefarious shit. you don&#39;t have to blindly accept whatever they want to implant. before it gets to the point where it&#39;s &quot;mandatory&quot; to get chipped, make sure all the protections are in place. </p>

<p>i totally believe that the potential for positive uses of implanted devices far outweigh a theoretical negative use. </p>

<p>also, it doesn&#39;t have to be a single implant that does everything. you could have one to replace your keys/keycards. maybe another with flash storage to store medical records or whatever. another to help monitor your high blood pressure or blood sugar levels. maybe a cop has one tied to his smartgun so a thug can&#39;t take his gun from him and shoot him. </p>

<p>50 years is a LONG time in tech. In 1967, who thought everyone in America would carry a device that let&#39;s the police track their every move (smartphone)? Voluntarily put a device on their car that makes it simple to track your travel (EZ-pass)? Volunteer enormous amounts of personal information to public corporations to resale (Facebook/Instagram/Internet)?</p>

<p>This is it right here. Give it time and the Apple I-chip will be a status symbol, ala the rollout of the i-phone. Remember how trendy ir was to have a smartphone in &#39;07? Now nearly everyone is carrying one in their pocket. Imagine having to wait in line like some sort of heathen, while the &quot;upper class&quot; cruises on by with their chip. From then on it will get yearly upgrades,  GPS will be added, tracking will be functional and it will simply be the norm. It will turn into an accessory that you can&#39;t live without (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard people ask how they ever got by without their smartphone,lol), and by then it will be too late. </p>

<p>No I say it in a short manner because there are a vast multitude of ways to do it which vary based on environment, and I&#39;m not interested in writing a fucking book on reddit. </p>

<p>What a ridiculous assumption.  And an incorrect one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Really depends.  It certainly can be at times.  I&#39;d argue not to stress on individuals but on providing the space for them to move in and out of but it is w/e.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not at being discussed because it&#39;s a bunch of university researchers insisting that we will <em>definitely</em> all be chipped, <em>eventually</em>. Not next year, maybe not even in our generation, but in 50 years, <em>absolutely</em>.</p>

<p>This is horeshit, plain and simple.</p>

<p>First of all, there will always be people with medical conditions that don&#39;t allow for this type of implant. Then there&#39;s religious exemptions (JW&#39;s can&#39;t take blood tranfusions... I&#39;m sure someone will object to this on religious grounds). And finally, with at least two legitimate exemptions, normal people like yourself will also refuse.</p>

<p>This is clickbait. It&#39;s not going to happen, because people like you and me will kick up a fucking storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my issue with microchipping:</p>

<p>Most of the critics of chipping are worried about government tracking, or the chip&#39;s ability to effect behavior, or the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; </p>

<p>But most adults in first world countries are already carrying GPS enables smartphones with us everywhere, we post our personal information online, companies track our activity to put certain types of ads and media in our faces (social programming)</p>

<p>Why the worry about chips? We&#39;ve already chipped ourselves by inviting web enabled tech into every facet of our lives.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating for microchips, I&#39;m merely pointing out that the same people who say &quot;I would rather die than have a chip implated&quot; are already driving teslas, carrying iphones, using a smart television, ording from amazon, etc.</p>

<p>Old people will feel safe knowing they can never be scammed and proper med are always given.</p>

<p>The working man/woman will love the ease of opening doors and security measures with a finger or hand wave.  They will love to pay by hand and know hackers can&#39;t hack without thier chip (BS since RFID can be copied through sognal collecyion)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>USA Today says a lot of stupid things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fine with them trying to ram this down our throats for the simple reason that it won&#39;t work. I believe the article states there are laws in individual states preventing chipping, and it a company even wants to think of opening branches elsewhere then this is a large impediment. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also not practical to mandate chipping for commerce when there are too many foreigners in the US with no such laws in their home country requiring it. There HAS to be the option for cash and card. While some may state that this progression is inevitable I disagree--the population isn&#39;t as aware or compliant as it used to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brother, your worry is with access to money, I get that. But implantable microchips have nothing to do with access to money. If a country goes &quot;cashless&quot; they will be able to cut your access 100% with or without a microchip. And let me ask you now, if the government froze your assets right now (bank account and credit cards), how long do you think you&#39;d do on cash?</p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you, your greatest fear already arrived years ago.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there&#39;s always going to be a black market. And there&#39;s always going to be people willing to barter. My advice is to get into crypto and hydroponics if access to food is what you are worried about most.</p>
