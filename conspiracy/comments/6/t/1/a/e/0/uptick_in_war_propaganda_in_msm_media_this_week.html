<p>So youre fine damaging our economy? You would shoot a toddler who threatened you with a stick?</p>

<p>Thats what this is. NK cant hurt anyone even if they tried so why would we destabilize an entire area of the world and dramatically affect our allies?</p>

<p>You do realize how big of a hit the economies of China and SK will take if NK is violently overthrown? We are talking millions of refugees flooding over borders and you can bet China and SK will try to recoup that money by affecting trade with us. </p>

<p>My favorite thing about Trump is even before he ran he was one of the few guys going on TV and saying what we all know. That Saudi Arabia was responsible for 9/11 he said it over and over again, even during the election. </p>

<p>Then as soon as he is in office he sells billions in weapons to the people who he has said were responsible for the worst terror attack in American history. </p>

<p>Real good leadership lol. You know what his excuse was? Obama did it too! Follow the leader lol</p>

<p>I doubt it. Israel doesn&#39;t give up so easily. Russia keeps messing with their game, and when they do, Israel uses its tricks to fuck with Russia.</p>

<p>Remember when Russia spoiled their plan to have the US dive in head first aftre the false flag sarin incident in 2013? Well, Russia suddenly got distracted in Ukraine, didn&#39;t they? </p>

<p>When Russia came back to Syria and helped Assad kick ISIS ass, they were accused of meddling in the US election,  and were painted as US enemy #1, weren&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Israel hates NK because they cooperate with Iran and sell arms to Hezbollah, and if shit starts getting hot in Korea, it will be a major distraction, not only for Russia, but for China and the Western  media, allowing Israel to do their dirty shit without attracting attention.</p>

<p>The Zionists prefer to work in the dark.</p>

<p>China just said they would uphold their defense treaty with NK if they are attacked with the intent to overthrow Kim. That right there spells out that America will not use first strike. </p>

<p>China has also said they will not defend NK if they hit American allies or interests. So if Kim decided to lash out and make an actual attack NK no longer exists and he will most likely be killed. I guarantee you he doesnt want to suicide his entire country to accomplish nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oil. </p>

<p>Oil future prices are at a critical stage close to a main fibonacci support and at the top of the downtrend channel. All this coupled with a prevailing negative sentiment, oil futures are poised for a significant collapse in price to continue the downtrend which would destroy alot of wealth and cripple an already vulnerable us shale industry. </p>

<p>This war rhetoric is to hopefully push oils prices up above the critical down trend resistance in order to stabilize and maintain speculation amid the fundamental negative direction. </p>

<p>It&#39;s painfully obvious when you realize the last few resistance bounces were clean and this latest one has some insane volatility</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neat words, would you care to explain their relevance to this exchange, because i just don&#39;t see it. It seems neither shallow nor pedantic to point out that it is a whole lot more significant and worrisome for the establishment propaganda apparatus to support the push for war than some random mook off the street. And how odd it is that you&#39;d really like to paint both with the same brush. </p>
