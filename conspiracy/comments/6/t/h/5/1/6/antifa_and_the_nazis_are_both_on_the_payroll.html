       It is just something I have noticed. Personally I believe it is a color scheme used as a camera directing tool for the news media videographers. For cable news production though, they match said color schemes with their digital graphics and tv personalities to enhance propaganda penetration. Ebola, anyone?

       Also remember that sock puppet software exists that allows one government agent to easily control many accounts at once. These brigaded posts with hundreds of comments could literally be one or two gov agents supporting their own comments.

       What you state about sock puppets controlling multiple accounts is correct. I have been having my Clarity of Signal posts revealing western support for terrorists constantly jumped on by concern trolls who then alert mods who then acts upon the post. Earlier this year, I was receiving thousands of views from Reddit but now it has slowed to a trickle due to the sock puppets and ghost banning.

       Yep, I've been subscribed to "AlternativeViewTV" (one word) on YouTube for a couple years.  I was delighted when I found them.   I don't know if Frank Morrow and Douglas Kellner are still living, but their wondrous work lives on.  Like you said, they were real journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their YouTube channel has interviews with lots of people like anti-CIA activists John Stockwell, Philip Agee, and many others.  They were based in Austin, TX.  Love them!
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, although their televised program was called "Alternative Views" (with an "s"), the YouTube channel does not have the "s" and is spelled  "AlternativeViewTV" (no "s").  Hope you enjoy it too.

       Also,  a chance to strip away freedom of speech and peaceful protest.  I'm not a nazi, or even a Trump voter,  but the anti -protest should never have been held at the same time.  That's why it's obvious,  they have a constitutional right to march,  and the anti protest has a right also,  but not at the same time. Obviously instigating violence. Meanwhile,  Goldman Sachs still wins the white house no matter who holds office.

       Bingo. One of the big thoughts being put out there now by progressives and "marginalized groups" is: "When you've weaponized your free speech to make me feel terrorized, maybe we need to reconsider ....".  Thats pretty serious shit.

       I reject your notion that the thousands of neo-nazis (not "so-called nazis" like you try to softly portray them as) are all paid by Soros. It is an absurd claim and shifts the blame away from them.

       The truth needs to be preserved. Thousands of these neo-nazis showed up under their own free will and accordance in order to preach their hate in Charlottesville.

       Funny you mention antifa being bussed in. There is an entire twitter feed out there showing the identities of some the neo-nazis that have been ID'd from the 'unite the right rally' and the overwhelming majority are from out-of-state.

       What he's saying is that there are countless numbers of dumb people who willingly align themselves with these ideologies without being paid shills who are "part of the conspiracy". Sure there may be relative handfuls of people who understand how to manipulate the masses for their own benefit, but let's not act like there aren't also a bunch of actual idiot racists/bigots/ideologues on all sides at all times.

       Exactly right.  I work with dozens of black, working class guys; many of them self-employed.  These guys simply do not connect to leftist politics and they're in no rush to support the Dems in any way, much less antifa or Nazi's.  By September-October of 2016 I was like "the polls arent seeing what I'm seeing. There are A LOT of black men voting for Trump." And after the election they werent being swayed by the media's constant drum beat to oust him. I dont mean this to be a pro-Trump comment. I'm saying it to point out that there was some American solidarity and pride and brotherhood stuff taking place out here. By out here I mean off of CNN-MSNBC-FOX-ABC-REDDIT-TWITTER, and in the building trades.  Shit was feeling good man.  But perhaps unity among the working and middle class isnt in the best interests of those who seek power over us.   ....  So now what? The country is obsessed by fake ass Nazi's?  Of which there are probably no more 2 or 3 thousand nationwide? 10% of which are probably undercover FBI?  And media talking heads are accusing Trump of fomenting Nazi violence?  Fucking please!

       I truly didn't mean that to be a pro-Trump comment.  I was trying to provide a real-life example of how some of the things that have divided us in the past, and some of the ways we were divided (in this case, all blacks always voting Dem) are melting away. And so "those that would seek to control us" need another way to keep us divided.  I thought my example was "on topic," but I can see how someone could be skeptical since I do support many Trump policies and I do think he deserves to be defended against many of the more outrageous slurs. I guess you're free to discount my opinion because truth be told I roll my eyes anytime someone says something that attempts to cast Hillary or others like her in any light other than negative.

       I'm not discounting your opinion it's just so biased against left politics, if you're talking about divide and conquer then just talking about leftist politics plays right into that. Maybe you think the right does it too and was just using an example, in which case my apologies.

       I assume this is not reflective of the real views of the sub, because I don't hate Soros just because he is Jewish and rich. Maybe if you showed examples of a terrorist group he supports or something, rather than those groups that "agitate for political violence", like the ACLU, American Library Association, and Amnesty international. I looked through the list you linked for actually violent groups, and gave up around "Campaign for Better Healthcare".

       The fallacy here is that because he supports some groups with innocuous names, he can't also be supporting terrorism.

       Wrong . Especially in Greece the anarchist movement is pretty organized and a threat to the government in compare with other countries. Also in Europe even though the bad circumstances  and the repression of many sides(same in UK or Germany) people  appreciate the work theyve done

       That's not a sound conclusion from your premise. Politics is fake, but that doesn't mean the world is lost. In fact, it's really quite saveable, and will be saved in short order.

       Occupy wallstreet was nonpartisan in the sense that it completely circumnavigated the left/right divide. This terrified them. And yet they deconstructed the movement by infiltrating it with agitators.

       Good post. Sensationalist corporate media will jump at the chance for trying to divide the people.
People need to stop screaming "LIBTARD" and "CONTARD" and start reading up on political science to see how much they've been scammed. We are ruled by NEOliberals and NEOconservatives, both far right authoritarian corporate whores. (Elite bankers control most corporations.)
Violent type of protest is a trap anyway.
