       You believe everything is fake. Lol. Nothing productive comes from conversations with people who believe in absolutes. You think every car attack has been faked, despite the hundreds, if not thousands of live witnesses there. Lol. You wouldn't believe it if you were the one hit by the car. You'd probably think "Was I a paid stuntman and forgot I was supposed to be here? Did they just hit me with a CGI car?"

       There's a difference between believing "everything is fake" and calling into question the extraordinary claims made by MSM outlets whom we
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       lie to us and whom we

       As for that photo, there are several questions one could raise about it, but only now for the first time I've noticed that of course there are many shoes on the ground, a classic sign of Masonic rituals that is present at all of the aforementioned fake car attacks. As if you get hit by a car and your sneakers just fly off.

       Missing shoes or people with one shoe off neatly lying next to them have been common in recent terror/car attacks.

       Someone commented here last night that they thought it was strange as well.  Until they got a job in EMS and realized that it was quite common for shoes to fly off when hit by a car.  If you google, you'll see this question has been asked for years - with rational explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's much more likely than Freemasons carrying a bag of shoes around to sprinkle at the scene in some kind of ritual, no?

       If I'm being honest then the likeliest of all scenarios is that the commenter you reference is simply here to voice the ubiquitous sentiment of "nah it's totally normal, nothing to see here."

       You don't have to be in EMS to know that shoes don't just jump off your feet and reappear neatly lying next to your head.

       Did you bother to google the phenomenon?  Again, this isn't a new thing, nor is it only happening at scenes that would be considered a "false flag".

       But hey, if it seems more likely that Freemasons are sprinkling shoes, keep on keeping on.

       Heavy handed modding is surely a bad thing. The shills have to be defeated by exposing their arguements for what they really are which is defense for the cabal.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I might post Bush Jr is crap and a shill will say "Show me 1 sliver of evidence showing Bush Jr is a bad guy" knowing that smoking gun proof is hard to come by. A good response to this is "You seem to be very defensive of the Bush family. Do you have a stake in the family?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This strategy unmasks the shill on the spot because they usually come back with a weak arguement or they simply don't respond plus, being that it's a public post, everyone else gets to see it and identify the shill as well.

       It's all about getting the evidence together. For example, it is best to start by looking at the age of the account. Shill accounts are typically every new. They also defend the deep state at all costs and try to debunk the OPs conspiracy posts at every turn. There's a lot to it but those are a few examples of it works.

       There's no proof that shills exists on an anonymous platform where anyone can create any amount of accounts as they wish without verification.

      <p>
       You're asking for proof that can only be administered by the admins of this  entire site.

       We can however, look at circumstantial evidence surrounding the issue such as McDonalds Threads with "bmac" in the image file getting upvoted to the front page, and the addictive nature  of Elgin air force base has with reddit etc etc.

      <p>
       Personally, I think this is a bad way to handle that type of question. All that does is try to discredit someone who is asking a question any good theory is supposed to answer anyway. It instantly ends any kind of deliberative discourse on the subject and just turns into you trying to label them as shills. It undermines academic honesty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they were shills, you should still be able to address their questions. If your theory can't hold up to even modest scrutiny it's probably not a good theory to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would prefer people stick to ideas and not try to assign labels. Trying to discredit your opponent without addressing their point reeks really badly of disinformation tactics. This sub should be above that.

       I like debating conspiracy theories and asking people for evidence regarding what they believe. I think it's a necessary function for a conspiracy theory to withstand basic empirical skepticism.

       When you stop using critical thinking skills just because you want to believe something, you're no better than the enemies you perceive.

       Debate is great, but you aren't debating to have a winning "idea". You are just debating to see that everyone else's idea "loses" the debate

       (check where all the douchebags are most active, you will find they are from there), ShareBlue and brigading from places like

       . A large amount of their posts are currently linking over to here now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of info on the astroturfing organizations Correct the Record, ShareBlue and Media Matters. Their official mission statements that are publicly available state their intent to use propaganda for the DNC on the web and on social media such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. This implies the use of social community opinion management software and other tools.

        Troops, Trolls and Troublemakers: A Global Inventory of Organized Social Media Manipulation
       </a>

      <p>
       From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        ... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.

       this subs reliably disgusting response to every major tragedy attracts the negative attention of the rest of the community. the reason the sub is getting pushback right now is because the people who would otherwise ignore the denial of reality that fuels this place are repellent to most people.
