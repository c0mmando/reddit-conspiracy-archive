        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know all the details so correct if I&#39;m wrong about the facts.</p>

<p>-Unite the right got a permit to hold a rally.</p>

<p>-Progressives shut it down through protest.</p>

<p>-Progressives then blocked the streets where people were leaving from.</p>

<p>-People got run over, at least one died.</p>

<p>One group wanted to gather peacefully, and went through the legal requirements to do so.</p>

<p>Another group didn&#39;t like what they had to say, so they shut down their free speech.</p>

<p>When the first group said &quot;alright screw it&quot; and tried to leave, the other group wouldn&#39;t let them (by illegally blocking traffic).</p>

<p>In the ensuing chaos someone died.</p>

<p>Shutting down free speach = nazi</p>

<p>Physically not allowing people to leave an area = nazi</p>

<p>Trying to make your way out of chaos =/= nazi</p>

<p>The conspiracy here is to keep people talking about evil nazis so they don&#39;t talk about how &quot;progressives&quot; shut down free speech again.  </p>

<p>Did the guy have a swastika painted on his car?  Did the guy give the nazi salute before he was put in cuffs?  Has anyone found a link to his social profiles where he espouses nazi propaganda?  Has anyone found any proof whatsoever that he was a nazi?  Probably not, but that&#39;s not going to stop people from calling the entire right just a bunch of nazis.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say, hypothetically, that this guy is a 100% neo-nazi.  He did a stupid thing that he will pay for.  How do the actions of a single man equate to the entire right being nazis?  Point me to the 30 other instances of this happening for you to blame an entire group.</p>

<p>When acid attacks, gang rapes, car attacks, bombings, knife attacks, beheadings, and on and on come from one group, then you get to label them.</p>

<p>When people who bring sticks, rocks, bricks, urine, fireworks, bikelocks, masks, and on and on to peaceful rallies all come from one group, then you can label them.</p>

<p>When people who call for death to all cops, assassinate police officers sitting in their cars, demand that other races lose their voice, destroy private property, set their own city on fire, and on and on all come from one group, then you can label them.</p>

<p>When one singular dumbass does something after being provoked by those other groups, no, you can not label an entire group.</p>

<p>This is not about nazis, it is about the continued destruction of free speech and differing opinions in this country.  It&#39;s about the normalization of violence against the right and ignorance to the violence perpetrated by the left.  Did this one guy do something horrendous?  Yeah, he did.  Does he represent the actions of every single other person there?  Of course not.  But if you ask all of the &quot;totally normal&quot; /conspiracy users they&#39;ll tell you that every last one of them ran those people over.</p>

<p>This is about freedom of speech, and the fight against it.  Speaking of which, this account is tagged and under double secret probation so it won&#39;t get anywhere but, this needed to be said. </p>

<p>Spez:  Yes, he was a white supremacist who meant to do it.  Yes, they were all white supremacists.  Yes, a legal rally got shut down by fanatics who can&#39;t stand that others have free speach.  No, I don&#39;t agree with pretty much anything they said.  Yes, they still have a right to say it and not have &quot;progressives&quot; march on them.</p>

<p>To you have proof that it was clearly a nazi gathering, or did a couple nazis attend?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This appears as though</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there you go pushing a narrative.  Completely ignore me saying that what happened was horrendous and that he will pay, so you can accuse more people of being nazis or nazi sympathizers without addressing the shuting down of a legal rally by protesters.</p>

<p>But go ahead, ignore more of what I said and provide no proof of your claims so that you can accuse others in an attempt to make yourself feel morally superior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is the first reaction to a sensational story reported by the MSM to debate the political implications of it? Should we not instead be investigating the claim itself, seeing if it holds up to scrutiny; if there is adequate evidence to believe that a fatal car attack even took place?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a shaky cell phone video that shows nothing. I mean it shows a car hitting another car, then unbelievably having an empty lane to exit in reverse. No graphic content and no real injuries, just the obligatory &quot;oh my god! oh my god!&quot; and a guy who instantly starts blaming &quot;some racist asshole.&quot; In one of the clips I saw a girl&#39;s voice says something like &quot;So many people got hit, this does not look good,&quot; and meanwhile the video is showing nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does &quot;faked&quot; even mean in this hypothetical? A car clearly hit a bunch of people. Are you saying it&#39;s a CGI car, or that it&#39;s all stunt people and a stunt driver?

<p>This car is clearly hitting a stunt person. CNN could show this footage and say a Nazi was driving the car and then what on earth would we do? Just believe whatever we see on television, I guess.</p>

<p>Most people seem to be unaware that there have been many faked vehicular attacks over the past year or so.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, yes I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a stunt driver and stunt people and those in this video are in on this scene. I don&#39;t think anyone can blame me for being a bit skeptical of the sensational claims made by the mainstream media outlets, which we know to be infested by intelligence agencies, and would gladly see any convincing evidence that a bona fide deadly car attack really has occurred this time. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. You&#39;re claiming something didn&#39;t happen and using stuff from a movie, completely unrelated, as evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like if I claimed Columbine never happened and then cited The Matrix as evidence.</p>

<p>Uh, there&#39;s a ton of photos, independent reports from individuals and journalists, there&#39;s a suspect, a car, video.</p>

<p>Are you saying that immediately after an attack like this that we should somehow magically have a bunch of detailed recordings of the perpetrator? You know it takes actual investigation to find that kind of thing, right? It&#39;s not waving a wand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually back on the fence now, at first it seemed very straightforward, but with the video interview of the mother having a very similar license plate to the car the suspect drove into the crowd I don&#39;t know what to believe anymore. There was a picture circulating yesterday of someone tracing the car back to the guy who originally owned the car. It had the same license plate, not sure how that works exactly. I can&#39;t find the picture anymore, they were all removed for doxxing. I&#39;d like to know 1) how that information was gathered 2) why the old license plate showed the previous owner 3) If it was the same license plate number when he had it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You apparently miss the point of free speech. These assholes have the right to hold a gathering and try to promote their hate speech. And we have the right - as well as a moral duty - to organize against them.</p>

<p>No rights were being trampled on here. This is a beautiful thing, because what we saw here was Americans responding to hate and refusing to just let it be. When Nazis gather in broad daylight it means they are winning because they should be too afraid to do that.</p>

<p>If you want to grab a nazi flag and march down the street you can do that. But don&#39;t be surprised when someone comes up and punches you in the mouth. It&#39;s their civil duty to do so. And I&#39;m sure they will gladly take the legal consequences for doing so.</p>

<p>So go fuck yourself with your sympathy towards these cucks and their nazi gathering. </p>
