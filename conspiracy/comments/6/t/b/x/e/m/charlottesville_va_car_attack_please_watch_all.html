    <div class="md"><p>Over and over again as fake car attack after fake truck attack has happened over the past year or so, I told the &quot;white nationalists&quot; over at Voat who loved to circlejerk about Islam and Muslims every time one of these hoaxes would happen, just wait guys: they&#39;re going to recreate one of these car attack hoaxes and just say it was a neo-nazi/white nationalist/ Trump supporter behind the wheel.</p>

<p>And here we are. </p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised at the number of people who still think that any of these stunts have been legitimate, the Nice truck attack was the first one I can think of and was totally fake for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, there&#39;s no real injuries or medical response visible. People standing around with little bandages on their boo-boos per usual. The fire crew performing CPR on an obese woman who wasn&#39;t even near the crash in the first place while other emergency personnel just stand around. No sense of urgency, just people milling around and saying &quot;oh my gawd.&quot; The first fake vehicular assault was in Nice France on Bastille Day and there have been many since then, most blamed on ISIS. I have predicted before that the tables would turn and a &quot;white nationalist&quot; Trump supporter would become the culprit eventually so this is not surprising at all. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost been 24 hours since the event and as more time goes by we will see more evidence of shenanigans and no evidence of a real attack. If it were real there would be multiple video angles to confirm it and the only video angles we have are indistinguishable from the numerous stunt scene fake car hits that I&#39;ve been posting for comparison. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they are here. And they&#39;re the only ones that get &quot;unverified&quot; tags. The only ones that get removed or put into contest mode for vague allegations of brigading (or was it just an experiment, hard to keep track of the excuses), never mind the many crossposts with T_D or your own invitation to it&#39;s members.</p>

<p>You know exactly what my point is. Do you think you&#39;re being clever or do you just not care how obvious you make it look?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve removed about 3 or 4 posts that were cross-linked to the_donald, and the_donald also removed them on their side.  It really doesn&#39;t happen that often.</p>

<p>And when it did happen the effect on our community was barely noticeable because Reddit isn&#39;t exactly a pro-trump space.  However when it happens with anti-trump stuff and there are like 50 anti-trump subs they come here and totally disregard our rules.  It&#39;s disruptive to the community and they just don&#39;t care about /Conspiracy.  Why should we tolerate that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you haven&#39;t been here long enough.</p>

<p>There is only one conspiracy, my friend, and it spans across the world, throughout all of human history and revolves around the suppression of consciousness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a conspiracy to most people as they have accepted it as just the way things are, but it needn&#39;t be this way. People go mad because of this. People take their own lives and the lives of others over this (think Columbine). Even if this turned out to be a &quot;lone wolf&quot; attack, which I have my doubts about, it can be directly tied back to a deliberate conspiracy of public mind control and a strategy of chaos and tension.</p>

<p>There&#39;s always more to it than meets the eye, and we&#39;re just scratching the surface here.</p>

<p>Its a simple concept dude, There were a hundred people livestreaming,  A car crashed into a crowd killing people and maybe someone has a video angle that shows the driver&#39;s face.</p>
