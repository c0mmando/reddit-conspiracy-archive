        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some points that give the scam away:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Operation in Terry McAuliffe&#39;s state. No reason for this other than to give McAuliffe national attention for opposing it, launching him into the 2020 Dem primary. He even tries to Streisand more useful idiots into showing up by ordering everyone to stay away.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of Confederate flag imagery. Republicans have no use for the Confederate flag (we never did, we crushed the Democrat rebellion that created the flag). We control the government for the vast majority of states at every level, the entire federal government, and we own practically everything except a few tech companies. The only states we don&#39;t control are the ones that will always be cosmopolitan simply because they are coastal states whose economies run on imports and exports.</p></li>
<li><p>Ridiculously obvious propaganda shots that follow MSM and Democrats&#39; operating procedures of making a small group of 20 people appear to be a crowd of thousands.</p></li>
<li><p>Reports of violence against &quot;counter-protesters&quot; at an &quot;impromptu&quot; rally. No one spontaneously organizes to counter-protest an impromptu rally unless they are associated with the organizers of the rally themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>The name. &quot;Unite the Right&quot;. This is so obviously a &quot;Pied Piper&quot; op that I can&#39;t even. It is supposed to make the organization appear to represent the views of the entire Right Wing, so of course they go around giving Roman salutes and waving confederate flags and shouting &quot;White Power!&quot; while wearing Trump hats. And then of course these same leftists load up their other twitter accounts and attack Trump for not denouncing them hard enough. Standard divide and conquer nonsense. They are going after what they perceive to be his base of Nazis while tarnishing the Republican brand.</p></li>
<li><p>I follow tons of actual right wing news sources and I didn&#39;t hear a word about this nonsense until the day of. Meaning it was never meant to attract actual right wingers. It was just supposed to be their little group of antifa actors with hair cuts and collared shirts, all paid for and organized by Soros and directed by guys like Bob Creamer who staged the violent protests at Trump&#39;s rallies a year ago.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;Unite the Right&quot; is fake. All the people associated with it at a leadership level are controlled opposition. Don&#39;t fall for this scam. Don&#39;t give the Left anymore ammo to attack us as Nazis. But in the end don&#39;t be too concerned, because the Left will label you a Nazi and attack you for supporting Trump no matter what else you do. Just stay strong and do the right thing and ignore the insanity of the Left. Don&#39;t believe their lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I hate someone who would take the oppurtunity to blame Soros for this. A white racist piece of shit trys to kill many and did kill one. And Op&#39;s first thought is to call out Soros. The truth of the matter is that I don&#39;t agree with the removal of the statue. I want to make sure this country remembers it history good and bad. We need to remember so we may not repeat. Unfortunately there a growing number of people are willing to repeat evil.</p>

<p>Stop apologizing for this jackass.
