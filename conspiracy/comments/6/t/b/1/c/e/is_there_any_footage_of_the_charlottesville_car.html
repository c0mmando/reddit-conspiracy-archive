       Basically, all the footage out there either starts right when he zooms in, or may even be cut to that point. What I wish to see is the moment before he revs up, and a frontal angle on the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key question is: did the driver panic? Was there a confrontation moments before with the driver? Was there any damage done to the vehicle before impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real footage of the car starts from driver side to the rear. We need anything from the front to the passenger side.

       But he wasn't surrounded, the street when he started speeding up was quite empty all things considered. He could of reversed, but no, he drove and sped up to hit a group of people, killing one person, come on man.

       The video starts when he has already accelerated and is moving past where the person recording is standing. We only see down the street after the incident. We have no idea what happened before the choice was made to go ramming speed. Obviously the person recording the video was recording before the incident, so why the cut footage?

       We have to rule out panic and stupidity, but everyone wants to jump on the white terrorism or false flag bandwagon first.

       Jesus, ok... here is the other angle that clearly shows that where the Challenger came from was relatively empty, and if they were really frightened of the crowd it would've made way more sense to reverse:

       No, it really doesn't.  This is the main video everyone has already seen, and doesn't begin until the suspect has accelerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't tell if anyone yelled out threats, or threw anything at the passenger side. The video literally starts at the moment of acceleration, which in itself is odd. Something made that person hit record at that moment (which would have happened seconds earlier), or they were already recording and that footage has been cut.

       Ok, so let's entertain your idea, even though you can see nobody is doing anything to the car, there are very few people even close to it. Let's assume people were yelling at the car, or hell, even threw something at it... that's justification for speeding up and smashing into a crowd of people several yards away from them? Come on.

       A) we can't tell anything about what happened behind the person recording.

       B) violent protests all over the city, with neo Nazis and antifa all over the place, shit probably being hyped up even more on the radio as you drive.

       I wish people would stop trying to say that I am looking for "justification". Nothing justifies such violence. However, there might be an explanation that does not involve e terrorism or false flags.

       There is barely anyone around when he is just sitting there working up his fucking nerves to plow into a crowd? I'm so confused on what you are fishing for man. I realize it's the conspiracy thread but fuck dude usually people have some good info when they come in. This is beyond reaching. Overall, yeah these fucking elitists breed this Shit, that's the cause for this person driving into a crowd, but this is definitely not an "accident" they are skewing.

       Maybe the person started recording when a car got close to him? I mean come on, he wasn't really accelerating until just after the recording started (imo).
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is that people seems hellbent on finding an excuse when the issue is simple: the road when he started accelerating wasn't that busy, he could of reversed, he accelerated into a crowd of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was already surrounded by people, then I would get why extra footage is needed, but that isn't what happened.

       I've watched the video a few times now, and you can see people walking on either sides of the street, not banging on either of the cars that end up being rear-ended. So while I can't say with 100% certainty, it seems pretty clear people weren't fucking with the cars. Maybe this guy was different, no idea. But it seems a little far-fetched that a driver who is frightened by a group of people would choose to drive deeper into the crowd instead of reversing initially. /2¢

       Justification? You mean if perhaps this was accidental or unintentional? That would be nice, still terribly sad, but comforting in at least the tiniest of ways. However, my guess is it is simply another display of mankind's hatred and disregard for life. Seems farfetched to be an accident. Whether orchestrated by something bigger or a simpleminded fucks way of thinking he could make a difference. Another person filled with rage from a system whose function seems to breed these emotions. Do not confuse my statements as justifications or as vindicating. Free speech is allowed. That's freedom. 99.99/100 you won't change a garbage piece of Shit from thinking some outlandish bullshit their parents ingrained them with or for whatever fucking reason they came to the conclusion they did. Still, hate breeds hate. Violence brings violence. That's what happened.

       HAHA no worries... been following this now for several hours and I'm just kinda flabbergasted at everything that's gone down. Now with the shit post 4chan nonsense spreading with zero proof/connection (that I've seen) to the person they're calling out and claiming that this was the driver and saying they are "a liberal" — it's insanity.

       One thing I do, and I can't say anybody else does it, if I know that there us going to be a protest somewhere I stay away from that area. That way there is no way that I would become involved with whatever might happen.

       Hard to say. If it was a panic mode the vehicle passes several outs first, before heading into the masses it appears? Why chose plow forward? Could have easily been on the phone as well taking pics.

       But what most people fail to grasp, is these events are very similar to war, on the senses for a majority. Most people have no recollect on how to react or cope or deal with test levels like that.

       So you answered your question. So are you able to tell if the video was filming the car or just had the car in it? If someone was specifically filming the car then it would seems that it was pre-planned.

       The main video is likely a cut of someone already recording the protest, who then turned to the vehicle. Even if the vehicle was not in frame before the video starts, even audio from seconds beforehand can contain useful information. It is highly unlikely that the person recording just happened to hit the record button at that exact instant. There is likely footage that has been cut.
