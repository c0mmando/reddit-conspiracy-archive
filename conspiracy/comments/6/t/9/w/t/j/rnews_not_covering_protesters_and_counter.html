    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the state of emergency is quite newsworthy enough to demand a new discussion topic? </p>

<p>Your reply was the first I had heard of the car plowing through counter-protestors, which is certainly more newsworthy. However all that is out there right now seems to be a tweet from the AP about half an hour ago with no details provided? If there is any video of the incident, I would expect it to be all over Reddit by this evening. If no video, stories about this incident and the violence in general will probably get some decent play, once the major outlets that reddit loves have posted new coverage. Right now it seems like it&#39;s mostly continually updated breaking news blogs and tweets out there, not comprehensive recaps. Since this is a weekend, it takes fairly big news to get lots of traction immediately. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus. Well that would explain why I hadn&#39;t heard the breaking news, I generally avoid tv news like the plague. Given that it&#39;s 2017, I&#39;m sure if there is footage out there it is already out there on twitter somewhere. Have to think this will be major news within the hour, driving a car into a crowd crosses the line from politically themed violence to terrorism. Hopefully the large police presence there means the perpetrators were not able to escape. </p>

<p>I usually don&#39;t actively search out news aside from the 6pm-7pm news hours, so I generally get a lot of my stuff from Reddit (so I am pretty disgusted at R/News for not covering this so heavily)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It looks like they are adding the attack to the &quot;state of emergency&quot; thread-- when you said earlier that it didn&#39;t have much traction, you were correct, but it is getting a lot more attention now. Top comment in the thread is now about the attack, and the thread is at the top of the sub. </p>

<p>It does seem noteworthy enough to warrant a new topic, but seeing as there are very few details out now, perhaps they are waiting for whenever the Times or the Post get around to publishing stories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the state of emergency is quite newsworthy enough to demand a new discussion topic? </p>

<p>Your reply was the first I had heard of the car plowing through counter-protestors, which is certainly more newsworthy. However all that is out there right now seems to be a tweet from the AP about half an hour ago with no details provided? If there is any video of the incident, I would expect it to be all over Reddit by this evening. If no video, stories about this incident and the violence in general will probably get some decent play, once the major outlets that reddit loves have posted new coverage. Right now it seems like it&#39;s mostly continually updated breaking news blogs and tweets out there, not comprehensive recaps. Since this is a weekend, it takes fairly big news to get lots of traction immediately. </p>
