    <div class="md"><p>The Democrats have very few politicians on our side,
while the Republicans have virtually none (even Ron Paul is extreme).</p>

<p>This difference between Dems/Repubs is fairly negligible.
I.e. neither party will reform, EVER. It&#39;s too compromized. It&#39;s a dead man&#39;s game.
Considering the Clinton body count, even this negligible amount of credibility dissipates.</p>

<p>There is no power struggle, the corporations have full or near full power over the parties,
congress is a systematic shithole of corrupt fuckers,
there&#39;s no point keeping the two party corporate chains on.
DNC rigged primaries against Bernie, GOP/Trump aren&#39;t fixing shit.
It&#39;s a corporate scam.</p>

<p>Any exaggerating of &quot;Dems are DECENT, Repubs are CRAP&quot;
is just helping the corporate machine turning and divide/conquer.
There is no left wing or centrist/moderate in power in the U.S.</p>

<p>Both parties are far right authoritarian NEOlibs and NEOcons.
They&#39;re almost all corporate anti-worker extremists.</p>

<p>Fake spectrum (the corporate media pushes this false narrative)
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png">http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png</a></p>

<p>The real spectrum:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png">http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png</a></p>

<p>The elites do not care about people/worker poverty.
They like it because it allows their slavery NWO agenda.
Low rank elites = money obsessed sociopaths.
High rank elites = slavery obsessed psychopaths (may also have something to do with freemasonry).</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;conservativism&quot; (conserving a low waged population)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NEOliberal economics&quot; (essentially conservativism 2.0: globalist corporate jobs outsourcing and corporate crony capitalism)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NEOconservative warmonger foreign policy&quot; (military industrial complex profits and deploying a Rothschild owned central bank, 
stealing oil, minerals, etc. basically another form of warmonger imperialism)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-Next stage is NWO fascism. Unless we stop them.
There is also another route to fascism.....state capitalism (fake communism like in the USSR/NK)
and free market Laissez-faire ZERO regulations economics (extreme right wing libertarian B.S.).
All these methods lead to fascism for the workers, by the elite bankers/corps.</p>

<p>It&#39;s working/middle/upper middle class VS ruling bankers/corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it&#39;s just another route to severe worker exploitation, like Victoria era stuff before worker unions reduced some of the damage, introduced the weekend, better wages, working conditions, etc.</p>

<p>In a free market, there are zero regulations, even for health/safety of the products, health/safety of the workers, product quality, worker rights, customer rights, environmental protections, etc.
Survival of the fittest corporations/businesses.
This is like the old establishment. It sounds pretty dangerous to me.</p>

<p>What attracted to you right wing libertarianism, may I ask?
Was it just the idea of voting someone other than the two party puppets?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m going to be cynical, the leaders behind extreme right libertarianism (who know exactly what they&#39;e doing)
are probably cold calculating &quot;Ayn Rand&quot; wealthy types who just can&#39;t wait
to exploit workers for profit and kill regulations, and don&#39;t want to share with the peasants (not
even paying for roads, it&#39;s a different type of wealth hoarding).</p>

<p>They claim a free market will level things out, bad quality products will
leave the market due to poor demand, etc. but
crony capitalism in this NEOliberal system.....we still have shitty products made by corporations,
that explode, cause damage to the environment, more expensive than they need to be,
tax dodging corporations, etc.</p>

<p>If crony capitalism is this bad, just imagine a free for all type market. :/
Besides the &quot;invisible hand of free market capitalism&quot;
is nothing like the &quot;long arm of the law&quot;. So it sounds like an excuse to let out a pack
of wild corporations.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust the ideology.
Least not because Gary Johnson (pro-TPP) and Ron Paul (supposedly anti-TPP)
are almost exactly in the same position......which is pretty damn suspicious.</p>

<p>Ron Paul:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/uLPA2d1.png">http://i.imgur.com/uLPA2d1.png</a></p>

<p>Gary Johnson:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/kopXfZT.png">http://i.imgur.com/kopXfZT.png</a></p>

<p>Another thing that creeps me out about far right libertarians
is that Ron Paul tried to make the argument that
&quot;doctors working for the state is basically slavery&quot;
HOW?? They&#39;re.....getting paid.... (He said this in fron of Bernie and a real doctor who disagreed with Ron.)</p>

<p>If Ron Paul is a good guy, then this can&#39;t be his true ideology that&#39;s in his heart.
If he&#39;s a shill, it makes sense.
If I were to give him the benefit of the doubt, it would
only be thinking &quot;maybe he&#39;s bluffing and just wants to end the FED
and kick the elite&#39;s asses before they kick his and then switch to something moderate like centrism or something&quot;
but this is a dangerous gamble.
Like the Trump gamble.</p>

<p>Charter schools just sounds like a way to keep
the most gifted (aka the richest....I mean, there&#39;s a strong correlation between intelligence and socio-economic status)
which is a bit pointless, because it&#39;s basically shutting out the poor.
Also reduces the need for schools to actually be good, if you&#39;re only letting
the A grade students in..... :/</p>

<p>In a more just society, you wouldn&#39;t have to do this crap,
just fund schools properly lol (and improve teacher training).</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure there are others much better at criticizing extreme right libertarianism.
As for moderate right liberatianism I have no idea.
But Ron Paul is not moderate at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;ve read horrendous things about Ayn Rand&#39;s literature (the lack of morality, I mean).
Apparently the USSR state capitalism (fake communism)
drove her to such selfishness (she THOUGHT the USSR was extreme in that they stole from businesses to give to the poor, but it&#39;s WORSE than that, they didn&#39;t help the poor).</p>

<p>Apparently the USSR beurocrats seized her father&#39;s businesses or something. (True anarcho-communism wouldn&#39;t operate like that, the means of production would be in the hands of workers or benevolant government but the USSR just shut it down....it&#39;s a corporate conspiracy, all of it, state capitalism, far right libertarianism, NEOliberal globalist transnational corporate jobs outsourcing type economics, etc. serves the elites).</p>

<p>Anyway, I know that there are people in the left libertarian zone (Bernie, Jill Stein types, anarchists, etc.)
that want to de-criminalize drugs.
The drug war is a CIA scam, a Nixon administration official admitted that
they smuggled drugs into anti-war and black neighborhoods to incarcerate their opponents
or make them passive.
Everything comes back to politics, and the elite control politics. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, it also pushes divide/conquer and dumb riots.
People wonder why nothing really improves.
Because the elites with the power, don&#39;t want it to.</p>

<p>Also, corporate media pushes stereotypes (identity politics)
like &quot;all left wingers are anti-business, anti white, feminist hypocrites&quot;
which is a load of crap. Even some left wingers fall for it.
I&#39;m neither feminist, nor white-hating, nor anti-business (I want to help small/medium business, but fuck big exploiting corporations)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good criticism of fake libertarians in this thread as well.  They aren&#39;t giving your freedom back so you can be human - their thinktanks work towards government money going into private hands through private prisons paid for by gov, private schools paid for by gov, private armies paid for by gov, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democrats have very few politicians on our side,
while the Republicans have virtually none (even Ron Paul is extreme).</p>

<p>This difference between Dems/Repubs is fairly negligible.
I.e. neither party will reform, EVER. It&#39;s too compromized. It&#39;s a dead man&#39;s game.
Considering the Clinton body count, even this negligible amount of credibility dissipates.</p>

<p>There is no power struggle, the corporations have full or near full power over the parties,
congress is a systematic shithole of corrupt fuckers,
there&#39;s no point keeping the two party corporate chains on.
DNC rigged primaries against Bernie, GOP/Trump aren&#39;t fixing shit.
It&#39;s a corporate scam.</p>

<p>Any exaggerating of &quot;Dems are DECENT, Repubs are CRAP&quot;
is just helping the corporate machine turning and divide/conquer.
There is no left wing or centrist/moderate in power in the U.S.</p>

<p>Both parties are far right authoritarian NEOlibs and NEOcons.
They&#39;re almost all corporate anti-worker extremists.</p>

<p>Fake spectrum (the corporate media pushes this false narrative)
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png">http://i.imgur.com/eyqWtHK.png</a></p>

<p>The real spectrum:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png">http://i.imgur.com/8OzOIj5.png</a></p>

<p>The elites do not care about people/worker poverty.
They like it because it allows their slavery NWO agenda.
Low rank elites = money obsessed sociopaths.
High rank elites = slavery obsessed psychopaths (may also have something to do with freemasonry).</p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is about:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;conservativism&quot; (conserving a low waged population)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NEOliberal economics&quot; (essentially conservativism 2.0: globalist corporate jobs outsourcing and corporate crony capitalism)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;NEOconservative warmonger foreign policy&quot; (military industrial complex profits and deploying a Rothschild owned central bank, 
stealing oil, minerals, etc. basically another form of warmonger imperialism)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-Next stage is NWO fascism. Unless we stop them.
There is also another route to fascism.....state capitalism (fake communism like in the USSR/NK)
and free market Laissez-faire ZERO regulations economics (extreme right wing libertarian B.S.).
All these methods lead to fascism for the workers, by the elite bankers/corps.</p>

<p>It&#39;s working/middle/upper middle class VS ruling bankers/corporations.</p>
