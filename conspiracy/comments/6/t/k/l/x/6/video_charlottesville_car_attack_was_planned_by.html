<a href="https://youtu.be/aHUXV6sdiBo">https://youtu.be/aHUXV6sdiBo</a></p>

<p>Sure.  Maybe these were people who saw the car speeding and chased after it trying to stop it.</p>

<p>But then explain why the videos the media ran with INTENTIONALLY leave out that mob?  </p>

<p>This video is painfully obvious.  As the mob approaches, the person filming covers the lens and blocks them from view.  He/she removes his/her hand as the car reverses.  This is the definitive version that the mainstream media played.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqME_ROtoU&amp;spfreload=10&amp;bpctr=1502692340">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGqME_ROtoU&amp;spfreload=10&amp;bpctr=1502692340</a></p>

<p>Why was there a drone filming when this happened?   And why was the entire crowd confined to this intersection, with roads closed all around?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKIqpUCtEHw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKIqpUCtEHw</a></p>

<p>And this is the only aerial footage we have.  Maybe if there was a helicopter in the area we&#39;d have a different angle.  Oh wait...there was a helicopter monitoring the protests but coincidentally...it crashed and its occupants died.

<p>I obviously do not condone white supremacy or any type of racism.  But to me this looks like a conspiracy to increase racial tension in the US.</p>

<p>Nazis and commies fucking with each other is an age old tradition. This dumb dude driving the car was just a lucky moment for the left. The poked until something happened. That&#39;s it.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the disorganized people planned it.  I think there was more at play.  </p>

<p>And the great fallacy is that Nazis and Commies are on two different sides.  Nazi&#39;s are socialists.  Commies are communists.  They&#39;re very similar and they are both against CAPITALISTS.  The left has done a great job pinning Nazism on the right, while actually attempting to implement the Nazi agenda (Wealth Redistribution, Higher Minimum Wage, Government Healtcare, Free University, Gun Control, Anti-Capitalism, etc.)</p>

<p>I actually think they hoped there would be many more casualties.  Look at the aerial footage, the crowd is turning down the street onto the approaching car.  I think if we chalk this up to &quot;luck&quot; we forfeit our critical thinking...</p>

<p>The drone could be anything. If I had a drone and lived near there, probably would fly it around for lulz.</p>

<p>And that helicopter, waay more to that story. That is the piece that makes this whole thing stink. You know those state police choppers are well maintained, the crew well trained/experienced etc. Way too coincidental.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the answers.  Just asking the questions.  I agree the 20-year old would not have thrown it away to intentionally drive into a crowd.  </p>

<p>I think (and I do not know because we don&#39;t have footage) that his car was corralled into driving down a certain path.  Other streets were closed, and he was going full speed AWAY from whoever was chasing him, not intentionally into the crowd.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The corraling effect seems to be the consensus of the people there. That the two groups were forced into contact with each other by police, the opposite of what they should be doing.</p>

<p>My opinion is that conservatives or what have you were planning to protest the removal of historical statues, Antifa came looking for a fight, and TBTB and MSM looking to drum up more diversion and drama saw this as an opportunity to stir crap up and exploited the whole senario. Still no idea why the chopper crashed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we look at this as a conspiracy:</p>

<p>The chopper&#39;s job was to survey the protests...and the only reason it would have been taken out would be because an aerial surveillance defeats the narrative the conspiracy wants to push.</p>

<p>So you have to ask...what would aerial surveillance tell us that &quot;on the ground&quot; recording wouldn&#39;t?  I think it might have shown an organized shutting down of roads, corralling and a violent mob chasing the car prior to the collision.  I would have destroyed the narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s it. You nailed it. Aerial pictures would have confirmed any suspicion of closed off streets. And as you stated before above, that video we see all over the news is very convenient for them. It doesn&#39;t show the car when it starts to drive, so we can&#39;t see if he is being attacked, and then the fingers perfectly block out the mob chasing him with bats.</p>

<p>They knew from other demonstrations people will drive through crowds when truly afraid, so they set it up fto blow.</p>

<p>Looking into that heli crash. There is no reason being given, an investigation will supposedly take a week. Bogus. I can&#39;t remember the last a state police helicopter crash was in the news (or an actual white supremacist rally for that matter) one article mentioned the senior pilot was on the governers &quot;executive security&quot; team at point, another article mentions &quot;no foul play believed&quot; to have taken place. Weird, who would even think of police heli being sabatoged as a possibility? I wwouldnt, unless there was some heavy scandalousness going down that couldn&#39;t get out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t rule out domestic terrorism.  I for one like to believe people are not inherently racist.  It&#39;s a terrible evil that I cannot fathom.  So to rationalize things like this...I try to give the person every benefit of the doubt before chalking their actions up to pure evil.</p>

<p>Again...I could be very wrong.  But I posted this in r/conspiracy for a reason.  It&#39;s just to ponder...to not take the information as given to us but to challenge it.  If I&#39;m wrong, then this is indeed a very, very sad event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the off chance this wasn&#39;t a false flag it did look like he had been  at a coast/stop before gunning it. We could be putting way more thought into this- which isn&#39;t a bad thing. All I know is being from Chicago if I end up in a side street with a gang full of people who started throwing shit at my car you bet your ass I&#39;m gunning it </p>
