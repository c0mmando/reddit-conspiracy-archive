       And call them out when we see them. The media just didn't randomly start obsessing over black shootings by police, BLM protests, cop killings, ect. The social engineers are pushing this on us. It's so fucking obvious if you have been paying attention since 2012, that they are trying to "stir a pot" of social hysteria.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a soup they are brewing. A dash of Nazi protests, a hint of SJW social media reactions, a pinch of the transgender movement, and just a hair of police brutality. All of this is pushed in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guys. They are getting ready to PTRO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pull The Rug Out. They're orchestrating this collapse of the economy and society simultaneously, so that when the shit hits the fan, we are all divided and can't unite against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, do your research into the history of divide and conquer tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       My idea is to flood the masses with the concept of the "divide and conquer" race war. If they become aware of this, then these provocateured events lose their value to TPTB (The powers that be), and we can subvert their sadistic plans to pit us against one another.

       A nazi just mowed down a crowd of people in a terrorist act and you're mad at the media for reporting it? Get the fuck over yourself. This isn't some bullshit made up by the media to start a race war. They are just reporting on the horrible thing that happened yesterday.

       The problem I see withe the fallout of this attack is, as OP states, the
       <em>
        legalization
       </em>
       of open violence against certain groups, backed by tacit support of MSM. People, from anonymous net users to late show comedians, celebrities and politicians, already have
       <em>
        normalized
       </em>
       threats of physical violence against Trump an his cabinet. Also, twitter and such is filled with
       <em>
        a 100 nazi scalps
       </em>
       comments, that don't cause banning of accounts and are retweeted by
       <em>
        sensible
       </em>
       activists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, after a person died, her death will be a justification for even more extreme actions: a Congressman has already been shot, how long until others are? How long until a mob of
       <em>
        progressive, enlightened, inclusive
       </em>
       people that hate Trump attack someone just for wearing a Trump hat? For saying
       <em>
        the wrong thing
       </em>
       on a checkout line?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I'm not a Trump supporter at all, but the division that was already hurting us before the election has been widened by both sides and as always, the players above moving the strings reap the strategic benefits while us cannon fodder get mowed down, and made to hate each other.

       Must have mixed my timeline here. Madonna wishing to burn the WH, actresses showing fake heads, talk show hosts saying 'fuck you', giving him the finger, calling him cockholster, plays showing him getting stabbed... I'd swear all that happened before yesterday's attack.

       I'm not saying his actions and fumbles don't deserve scorn and critique, he's still the stupid egotist that ran an election based on soundbites and empty promises. But to see MSM united in an all out attack on his every gesture was quite startling to me. Taking the high road indeed.

       I'm not deflecting anything here, btw. The asshole that run down those people with his car is inexcusable. Just stating that the atmosphere is way too charged and MSM has done its part to heighten the tension. Let's hope the thunder doesn't strike more of us.

       The problem here is the media fueled hysteria that is bundling all types of right-leaning groups with the nazi tag. Quite handy for stifling diversity of ideas (at least the ones that might be
       <em>
        incovenient
       </em>
       ), but very likely to alienate and radicalize those that will end up being ostracized and attacked, this time with the blessing of

        public opinion

       Yes, we are obviously being manipulated and we know this, 18 states have already introduced anti-protest laws including ND and KY discussing not charging auto drivers who run into protestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being more of the manipulation is necessary, and stop reacting against each other and push back at the propaganda, not each other.

       The economy all ready collapsed, I get that it's not full on mad max like you wanted but our GDP went from 5% to fucking 1% for 8 fucking years and no one did shit
      </p>
      <p>
       We are still in an economic collapse, it's happening right now, your fucking living through it. This. Is. It. NOW!

      <p>
       The buying power of the dollar is at an 100 year low INSIDE America- ignore its international value
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Big Mac index, a very clear and easy way to gauge buying power- currently a value meal at McDonald's is $3 in most of the world- china, Africa, the Middle East- but inside America it is currently $8-10 or higher!
      </p>
      <p>
       Your dollar is becoming worth less money inside America while your salary is going down at the same fucking time!
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all ready a death spiral! It's happening all around you and you can't even see it because you don't understand it

       A large bit on the news this morning about the removal of several Confederate landmarks around the south. Why not just remove them and not make such a big deal about it on the National news? I couldn't care less if a statue of some guy from the losing side of the civil war is removed, but it is being made into a big deal which will only fuel future incidents as in Charlottesville.

       The problem here is the media fueled hysteria that is bundling all types of right-leaning groups with the nazi tag. Quite handy for stifling diversity of ideas (at least the ones that might be
       <em>
        incovenient
       </em>
       ), but very likely to alienate and radicalize those that will end up being ostracized and attacked, this time with the blessing of
       <em>
        public opinion
       </em>
       .
