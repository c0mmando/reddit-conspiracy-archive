        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These 10 images explain the whole story (make sure to click &quot;load 10 more images):</p>

<p>Edit: They deleted to images to hide the evidence with the link below: <a href="https://m.imgur.com/r/The_Donald/d3sFx">https://m.imgur.com/r/The_Donald/d3sFx</a></p>

<p>Instead, here is another similar picture story about what happens:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.fo/ptJX0">https://archive.fo/ptJX0</a></p>

<p>This man isn&#39;t just some ordinary citizen. He has a long history of higher level government work who has received $380,000 from George Soros. </p>

<p>Earlier today, a bunch of new accounts where defending Soros saying that he would &quot;never use paid protestors for sinister political purposes&quot; although this is exactly what he has been doing for the past year. This is what made me think this was Soros&#39; dirty work. His minions probabaly wanted to impress him on his birthday which was August 12. </p>

<p>This whole thing smells funny but the good news is that the people are doing some amazing work with these investigations since we are forced into doing the FBI&#39;s job for them. </p>

<p>Edit: I was able to save the first 3/10 images that were deleted from yesterday here:</p>

<p>I still here that Ivanka Trump is in the White House! Are you going to start with her?</p>

<p>I have corn and you have fish- in your model we can just ask for them and get as much as we both want-
I say- give me all your fish, now, I want it all, you can&#39;t say no because I want it. You ask for corn and I say NO because I am a fucking khazar and don&#39;t give a shit. You ask a volunteer cop to help you and he says he is on brake.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>Do you just kill me? Is that how quickly you model descends in to anarchy and murder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LBF is always talking about &quot;sacred economics&quot; and Jews, look at his post history, he is a loon and basically just a paid Reddit shill</p>

<p>He just posts nonsense for clicks as a job and when you call him out on it his goons go bananas </p>

<p>People like him are why this sub is trash and the mods supporting it are nuts, it&#39;s basically Alex Jones selling his fake products </p>

<p>Look at some of the crap people are posting telling me about the Future I need to prepare for! The one where we will all live by not having money or jobs and I guess we will all pay for it by getting the money from Soros </p>

<p>It&#39;s shill garbage by poor idiots who want to rob MY money to pay for THEIR failure </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Riiiiiiight</p>

<p>With the volunteer judge</p>

<p>And the volunteer cops</p>

<p>And the volunteer lawyers </p>

<p>All these volunteers enforcing your volunteer laws that work on your volunteer system</p>

<p>You see the thing with volunteer jobs is that it all breaks down when people don&#39;t feel like doing it or get incentives do it differently- you just ASSUME that an entire police and court system will function, LIKE MAGIC, with NO MONEY, to support a VOLUNTEER system </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make sense!</p>

<p>What if I and everyone else who grows corn just says NO, fuck this court, give us your fish, and your women, and your house too! Why not? Aside from you personally stoping us you can&#39;t DO anything because there is no actual system, it&#39;s all volunteer, it&#39;s not based in logic- money is based on a simple concept- we agree that a non expiring item has value for the purpose of trading goods and services- if you have nothing to measure value you against then the value becomes meaningless </p>

<p>How do people LEND money to build homes, start a business or build a god damn oil tanker?! You will say it&#39;s all free! </p>

<p>That&#39;s stupid because we live in this thing called the WORLD full of PEOPLE who are not all white Americans living in trailers like YOU</p>

<p>They are not all giving up their massive international growing economies because YOU FEEL POOR- because that&#39;s the issue! AMERICA IS NOT DOING GREAT!!! The rest of the world is having the greatest economic growth in history, and America sux and it sux to be there in its epic decline. </p>

<p>I left America and moved to china 4 years ago, learned Chinese and got a great job as a lawyer for a giant Chinese bank making tons of money </p>

<p>You have a fake masters degree in nothing and your job seems to be shilling for karma on Reddit </p>

<p>See? That&#39;s why you don&#39;t understand economics!</p>

<p>Right now is a fucking golden age of credit and lending! It just sucks for you because you have no money and don&#39;t understand how to get any</p>

<p>They openly supported a nazi white nationalist rally. The same one where a young white male terrorist drove his car into a group of people. </p>

<p>This is why this sub is filled with them. Out of necessity they have to deny obvious facts in order to reconcile their hatred. Turns out here you can make up whatever facts you like. </p>

<p>They created and spread a movement which resulted in the murders of multiple individuals in their sleep, in their homes, in their beds, and all because they supported Trump. The real tragedy, though, is that rather than addressing this politically inspired hatred, the media amplified it, and ignored the victims. </p>

<p>This sub is currently infested with racists and monsters like this. Out of necessity, now, they have to attack themselves in order to make their own hatred seem like it sits in those who they hate.  Their own kill us, and nothing is done, and then they use their own to kill their own, and the nation stops to blame us. Turns out the shadow government, the deep state, and (((media))) have colluded against the majority of their own people. </p>

Maybe you&#39;ll get them to shoot a committeeman in the head for supporting Trump.

    <div class="md"><p>haha I love how every shill-targeted comment that real users type tend to make it to like +3, +5, sometimes even up to like +10 in the first few minutes before they&#39;re tagged. It&#39;s super obvs, but I guess it&#39;s the only way atm. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get better. </p>

<p>The comment you&#39;re talking about only got to +3 or +4 last time I checked.. And you&#39;re right, I did pause while deciding on the vehicle for the analogy. I wanted to say &quot;if you hit a hornets&#39; nest, don&#39;t be surprised if they sting you&quot;, but that had iffy connotations I&#39;m sure you can appreciate. So, then I was like, ok, no insects, and I should add an element of retaliation for injustice, preferably like some pack animal that defends itself from a pest that has simply grown too annoying. I settled for wolves, but I do think that there is a better version of the idea in there somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control over people seems to me like a decent guess.</p>

<p>When we think about his actions in manipulating political and civil unrest around the globe as a means towards <em>controlling people</em>, rather than simply making money,  I think a certain picture emerges, one where OPs assertion that there is a connection between this man and a global figure who&#39;s goal is <em>control over people</em> isn&#39;t as sketchy as you make it out to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb here and say a guy who destabilizes economies in his free time isn&#39;t giving businesses huge amounts of cash without <em>some kind of return</em>. A return which could very well be <em>control over people</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ya I saw that. It was a good question because if he refuses to reply, he would be ousted as a shill but if he spoke against Soros, it would go against the ShareBlue agenda. Win/win situation. We can counter the shills using the truth. Truth is like kryptonite to them. They are forced into doing hardcore mental gymnastics to maintain all those lies so slamming them with the truth is like throwing a wrench in the system. Trump used this strategy against Hillary often such as the times he called her crooked Hillary in public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>owned... nice work </p>

<p>what i find fascinating is how these incidents happen.</p>

<p>I live near several big cities and every time they have something which involves a lot of public on the streets, they always block the roads off with dump trucks so these types of things don&#39;t happen.  </p>

<p>Every single time Ive been to any of these cities, this is the scenario.  It&#39;s how you know this shit is staged if you are aware of the little things</p>
