        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>He has been trying to trigger a civil war using these groups since Trump got elected. He not only bussed those 2 groups in but he also bussed in the Nazis. He probabaly paid both groups to attack each other. The driver who killed someone was probabaly just some puppet of Soros that will end up being compensated somehow.</p>

<p>Here is the source of the eye witness testimonies of people seeing Antifa and &quot;Black Lives Matter&quot; paid protestors. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-charlottesville-witnesses-20170815-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-charlottesville-witnesses-20170815-story.html</a></p>

<p>It is also probably important to note that Soros was planning on tanking the economy this month (August 2017) as a punishment to the people for voting on Trump. He was going to buy the gold up at dirt cheap prices which he did and then use his power to raise the value of gold by tanking the economy and selling off all that gold for profits so monsterous that it would plunge the country into another Great Recession if not a Great Depression. The source for this was an FBI anon post from late 2016 when Trump was elected. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there are enemy lists for bots and sidechannel discourse about the talking points of the day. There&#39;s a tangled web of truth and deceit in this sub from every angle. And this sub is small fish compared to <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, etc</p>

<p>When I think about what that means for the future of online discourse and narrative shaping, it&#39;s worrisome to say the least. When facts are malleable, what can be believed?  Nothing and everything, right?</p>

<p>As soon as I saw your name on the reply I knew you would be defensive of Soros. Your like famous for it.</p>

<p>Also what does my &quot;grasp of fundamental economic principals&quot; have anything to do with Soros? He pays $25 bucks an hour for paid protestors and huge lump sums to people that do the extreme stuff. It&#39;s not rocket science and has nothing to do with fundamental economic principals. </p>

Then he tanks the economy crashing the value of the dollar and raising the value of gold. Now all that gold he bought for dirt cheap prices are suddenly worth a lot more.

<p>sure it would be fun to look at.... but how long would that fun last when you realize it&#39;s d just be easier to wipe your ass with the money itself instead of taking the wheel barrow full of it to a store to buy actual toilet paper.... </p>

So everything that he says thats wrong is just there to confuse TPTB so he doesn&#39;t get found out and the one thing that he said that was right is just more of an observation and that makes him credible to you guys? What a world we live in where anonymous LARPers are given more credibility than news outlets  </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">/u/LightBringerFlex</a> seems a little dense this time — Don’t take it too seriously. :D </p>

<p>But what <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">/u/LightBringerFlex</a> is saying is technically right: Both Black Lives Matter and AntiFa (Although AntiFa is not an organization, rather it’s a movement operated by an organization called Refuse Fascism) have been funded by George Soros’ organizations.</p>

<p>Leaked documents show Open Society Foundations (George Soros) donated $650,000 to the Black Lives Matter</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170816080956/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216565">https://web.archive.org/web/20170816080956/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/216565</a></p>

<p>The Alliance for Global Justice (George Soros) is listed as an organizer and fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism, which operates AntiFa movement in US.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is actually a good point. Still, we need to consider — well, we’re not going to know why exactly, so we need to guess - why Donald J. Trump Foundation donated money to Clinton Foundation. What for?</p>

<p>However, when George Soros’ organizations funded Black Lives Matter and Refuse Fascism, the motive was clear. In fact they don’t try to hide it. All we have to do is to look up what Open Society Foundations and Alliance for Global Justice strive for — or leaked documents.</p>

<p>Soro organizations’ funding those movements and Trump Foundation’s donation to CF could regarded as identical in terms of the motive? I’m going to go ahead with “probably not.”</p>

<p>We know brewing orchestrated civil movements, or some might say “unrest,” requires united efforts — I would say professional efforts. I’m not saying I can prove Black Lives Matter and Refuse Fascism are not organic ones. All I am saying is that throughout history, whenever there’s a civil turmoil, it’s been proven that there’s always, well most times, a hidden power/hand working its own agenda. And we already know Soros’ agenda.</p>

<p>BTW, I never said Soros’ organizations are running those movements. I would say Soros’ organizations are merely using them, just like tampons. George Soros is notorious for not having a “flag.”</p>
