<p><strong>Societal Promotion of Godlessness</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>Bank of America says there is a 50% chance we are living in a simulation:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9">http://www.businessinsider.com/bank-of-america-thinks-theres-a-50-chance-we-live-in-a-matrix-2016-9</a></p>

<p>When I first read this article, I was intrigued. However, after a while, I started to grow suspicious. Why was Bank of America commenting on something like this? Why was this even important to them?</p>

<p>As somebody who beliefs in the Mandela Effect, and even parallel universes (I mean I least consider them), I definitely do not dismiss this theory. However, I wonder why it is being promoted so heavily these days. Sure, it is a scientific plausibility, but it is not quite yet backed by anything completely concrete.</p>

<p>Yet, we have a big corporation like Bank of America saying that this is likely, and even people like Elon Musk supporting the theory that we live in a simulation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation">https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation</a></p>

<p>Is a simulation any more plausible than God creating the universe? If there is in fact a simulation, <em>somebody</em> has to be in control. So, who is this somebody or something? Any why is it more plausible than a God? Perhaps you can say that is backed by quantum physics or something like that, but I still find it suspicious. As always, I look to pop culture to see what is being promoted, and I always ask <em>why</em>? What do they want us to believe?</p>

<p>Before you read this post, please note that I know not all have the same spiritual viewpoints as me – these posts are meant for discussion, and I have even had atheists comment that they agree with some of my major points, even if they do not agree with my conclusions.</p>

<p><strong>Cartoons for Adults</strong></p>

<p>I am a big fan of cartoons for adults, and I am sure many of the readers here are, too. But before I go into this post any further, let’s question why we even have cartoons for adults. In the past, cartoons were mostly preserved for children, yet today we see more cartoons with adult content. I have two theories here:</p>

<p>1)  They want children to watch these cartoons to digest mature material.
2)  They want adults to watch these cartoons to absorb material more easily.</p>

<p>But there is one important part integrated into cartoons: humor. I have written much about the impact of humor on programming, and I have a post here about modern comedy and indoctrination if you are interested. The emphasis is on humor and humiliation:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nhupx/modern_comedy_and_indoctrination_how_humiliation/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nhupx/modern_comedy_and_indoctrination_how_humiliation/</a></p>

<p>Since I have already written about humor, I do not want to go any further on this topic. Instead, I’d like to look at this specific type of programming. It is clear that many adults watch these adult cartoon shows, but I remember watching the Simpsons as a little girl. Was I really mature enough to understand the concepts? The Simpsons provided humor for adults and children simultaneously, and sometimes I wonder if I was being programmed to digest adult concepts I could not truly understand yet. Anyway, I wanted to focus on a few “adult” cartoon shows that I feel have a very specific agenda. Before I write this, I want to note that I do find these shows hilarious and some of them are truly amazing shows, but that does not mean that I do not think they have an agenda. In fact, the better the show is, the easier the programming works.</p>

<p><strong>Rick and Morty</strong></p>

<p>I have watched this show on and off, so I am not claiming to be a super fan. However, the ultimate theme of this show seems to be nothing really matters. Now before you freak out me and say that all of the characters have episodes where they grow and change and learn, you have to remember that it seems that they can ultimately do anything, and no matter how many times they die, destroy things, or whatever, they continue on as if nothing as happened. An episode that stands out to me is where Morty (the little boy) is trying to comfort his sister. In this episode, he tells his sister to look outside at a grave in the yard. Apparently, he died in another reality, and ultimately, in his speech, he tells her nothing really matters:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watchv=E_qvy82U4RE&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watchv=E_qvy82U4RE&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>This show is fun, but there is something darker here. No matter what they do, there is not ultimately no consequence for their actions. If there really are multiple universes, as this show seems to claim, then perhaps that is true. In the episode shown, Morty claims that what he did before meant nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Futurama</strong></p>

<p>Futurama is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. However, the more I watch the show, the more I feel that there is another agenda. Ultimately, though many of the scenarios are far-fetched, it does seem to have an element of predictive programming: from chips in the arm to robots all around - it does not seem <em>that</em> unrealistic.</p>

<p>Though Futurama does seem to have more of a human element, there still does seem to be an ultimate theme that nothing really matters. With time travel, parallel universes, and even times where characters die and are reborn again, we are led to believe that existence is somehow meaningless.</p>

<p>Again, I understand this is a cartoon, but we digest the themes that these shows exemplify. However, I’m not really sure about the ultimate agenda of this show. For example, I like this scene from Futurama with Bender, where he seems to be communicating with God:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nwvCGLmFEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nwvCGLmFEA</a>
In this scene, though, God seems to be some type of technological element involved.</p>

<p>There still be to be many scenes mocking God and even Christianity. Anyway, Matt Groening always seems to have some foreknowledge, anyway.</p>

<p><strong>The Simpsons</strong></p>

<p>Most of us grew up with this show, so I do not have to say that much. Plus, there are thousands of videos about how the Simpsons has predicted the future:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G02rYAXtJHY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G02rYAXtJHY</a></p>

<p>This is just one video, and, again, there have been thousands of articles and posts on this, and Matt Groening is said to be a freemason. I mean, do you remember the freemason episode?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXtQMz1RGNw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXtQMz1RGNw</a></p>

<p>Anyway, that isn’t even the point of this. The point is the ultimate theme of the Simpsons. While I feel like it used to have some heart and humanity, it appears to have less of that these days. Even in the earlier episodes, though, it is important to note that God and Jesus or anything religious (or spiritual) was always mocked in the Simpsons. Here is an episode where Homer proves God is “wrong”, and Flanders rips up the evidence:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGBxUNaQI1I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGBxUNaQI1I</a></p>

<p>Funny as that may be, you still have to ask yourself, what is the agenda? When we look at a tv show that seems to be able to seriously predict future events (some eerie ones), shouldn’t we question their motives? Whatever your spiritual beliefs, it just feels a little off to me, and I am a Simpsons fan.</p>

<p><strong>Family Guy</strong></p>

<p>If you want to talk about mockery, I think one of the main tenets of Family Guy is that Christianity is a complete joke. There are episodes DEVOTED to mocking Jesus. This is an old one – they have had hundreds since:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpXr-1HQoo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stpXr-1HQoo</a></p>

<p>Even if you ignore all of the shows that mock Jesus (or any religion for that matter), this show disgusts me in so many ways. Every episode seems to validate the theme that life does not really matter. Peter and Lois are abusive to their children, especially Meg, and it is supposed to be funny. Stewie and Brian have a time machine where they, too, can change and mess with reality, and no matter how badly they mess with things, there never seems to be any consequence.</p>

<p>There is no love in this show. Even on episodes that <em>feel</em> loving, there is something lacking. Let’s not forget the propaganda ever present in this show. No matter what you think about vaccines, this episode was strange to me:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFCkBraxyQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFFCkBraxyQ</a></p>

<p>I’m not even “anti-vaccine” but I just saw this episode, and it felt strange to me.</p>

<p>Let’s not forget that Seth Rogan somehow “avoided” death on 9/11:</p>

<p><a href="http://listverse.com/2011/12/12/10-famous-people-who-avoided-death-on-911/">http://listverse.com/2011/12/12/10-famous-people-who-avoided-death-on-911/</a></p>

<p>To me, this show is the epitome of “do what thou wilt.” There seems to be no end to the disgustingness of this show. I apologize if this part is a little biased, but I just cannot seem to see how somehow can sit through this show and not feel at least uncomfortable. To me, this show is the definition of godless.</p>

<p><strong>Bojack Horseman</strong></p>

<p>This is another hilarious show, and I’m telling you I really do like this one, but again, the theme seems to remain the same – nothing really matters. On top of the strangeness of having animal and human relationships, this show seems to show that whatever we do is pointless.</p>

<p>While I do feel there is still heart to this show, and I am not even sure if this is an <em>agenda</em> like the others, this show just feels off (again I like it!) And this clip helps reassures their viewers that life is meaningless:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOtyg7lnrE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOtyg7lnrE</a></p>

<p>While this clip does explain that one must give up everything to be happy (and there may be truth to that), I wonder if it still takes away from the element that there could be meaning to life.
I could probably keep going, and there are many cartoon shows out there aimed toward adults (though children watch them). Are these shows as innocent as they seem? Or do they have something deeper to promote? What shows have I forgotten, or what am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>God is dead</strong></p>

<p>This is nothing new. Nietzsche once wrote,</p>

<p>“Nietzsche recognizes the crisis that the death of God represents for existing moral assumptions: &quot;When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one&#39;s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident... By breaking one main concept out of Christianity, the faith in God, one breaks the whole: nothing necessary remains in one&#39;s hands.&quot;[6] This is why in &quot;The Madman&quot;, a passage which primarily addresses nontheists (especially atheists), the problem is to retain any system of values in the absence of a divine order.
The death of God is a way of saying that humans, and Western Civilization as a whole, could no longer believe in any such order. The death of God will lead, Nietzsche says, not only to the rejection of a belief of cosmic or physical order but also to a rejection of absolute values themselves — to the rejection of belief in an objective and universal moral law, binding upon all individuals. In this manner, the loss of an absolute basis for morality leads to nihilism. This nihilism is that for which Nietzsche worked to find a solution by re-evaluating the foundations of human values. This meant, to Nietzsche, looking for foundations that went deeper than Christian values.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead</a></p>

<p>This always leads back to the same point for me – moral relativism. Without god, morals cannot be grounded. If God is not real, then perhaps moral relativism is the right path.
However, if God is real, there seems to be true, set morals that God promotes.</p>

<p>Can there be values deeper without God? Can there be values without God? Without God, is nihilism the only answer? What really matters if we have nothing beyond our physical bodies?
These are just questions, and I am not saying I know all of the answers.</p>

<p><strong>The Rise of Atheism/Anti-Theism/Satanism</strong></p>

<p>Surprisingly I have never written about this topic. There is no doubt that atheism, anti-theism, an even forms of Satanism are on the rise in society. The world’s biggest religion seems to be leaning toward no religion:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/</a></p>

<p>I mean there are even after school Satan clubs now:
<a href="https://afterschoolsatan.com/">https://afterschoolsatan.com/</a></p>

<p>(Before you argue that Satanism is just a fight against anti-intellectualism I’ve already written about this on many occasions: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lr0kr/do_what_thou_wilt_why_standards_are_important_in/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lr0kr/do_what_thou_wilt_why_standards_are_important_in/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage</a>)</p>

<p>Is this all just progress? Or is there something more sinister here? I meet so many people who claim to have some level of spirituality, but they never seem to have God in their lives. </p>

<p><strong>Reality is an Illusion</strong></p>

<p>No matter what you really believe, there is no doubt that reality is an illusion. Not only do major religions say that (Buddhism and Christianity), but modern science seems to support this conclusion, too:</p>

<p>You can read about <em>maya</em> in Buddhism:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(illusion)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(illusion)</a></p>

<p>The bible claims that Christ is the reality:</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm">http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-17.htm</a></p>

<p>Quantum physics says that 99% of reality is empty:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/99-9999999-of-your-body-is-empty-space">https://www.sciencealert.com/99-9999999-of-your-body-is-empty-space</a></p>

<p>So what is real? It seems to be that there is a truth, but the truth is not in the physical reality we see. No matter how rich we are in this lifetime, no matter what our successes or material possessions, we will ultimately die. The question is, have we really sought the truth before we died, or we distracted by the “reality” that we live in?</p>

<p>When there seems to be spiritual truths like this (reality is an illusion), then I wonder why people do not question the constant materialism, consumerism, and superficiality promoted by society. More and more, we seem to realize that these things do not really matter, yet they are emphasized more than ever. We rarely hear about anything about ourselves, but instead, it seems trendy to believe that there is no God. It seems trendy to believe in this sort of secular humanism.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>We must always question what is being promoted. In the past ten years or so, I have seen the rise of this idea that all that matters is being “happy” and I call this “Oprah morality.” Oprah is always telling us to just do what makes us happy, and that’s all that really matters. Oprah also really seems to promote some interesting spiritual beliefs:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0iXw3WnRq8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0iXw3WnRq8</a></p>

<p>When I watch television, the same themes pop up. I already wrote about Seinfeld here, the show about “nothingness”:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nbpwo/what_i_learned_from_seinfeld_90s_predictive/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6nbpwo/what_i_learned_from_seinfeld_90s_predictive/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage</a></p>

<p>While the focus of this post was on cartoon tv shows, think about <em>all</em> tv shows. Big Bang Theory? Friends? Cops? I don’t know – are any of these about seeking our higher spiritual selves? Likely not.</p>

<p>Most of these shows emphasize a vapid existence of consumerism and materialism. </p>

<p>Any while many on Reddit may not believe in God, what is your ministry of truth? If God is not the Ministry of truth, then what is?
I wonder if we will fall into the forced prophecies of 1984 or Brave New World. This quote from 1984 is a little eerie to me:</p>

<p>“We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future.” 
― George Orwell, 1984</p>

<p>Or will we realize we are being manipulated, and there is something more?</p>

<p>From Brave New World,</p>

<p>“There was also a thing called God.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are cartoons/animated programmes for adults because many people like the medium. A lot of people growing up in the 80s and 90s grew really fond of animated shows like Transformers, Voltron and The Simpsons. I think it&#39;s because now people like myself who grew up in that time still like animated shows, but obviously now with more mature content. 
And also as a side note Anime in Japan has as far as I know always dealt with adult themes and content and been consumed by adult audiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think these shows are coming from a place where &quot;They&quot; or TPTB put them out there for us to consume and take an intended message in but instead reflect the views of the artists that make them. And some of those artists may indeed be quite nihilistic in their views. And everyone has an agenda right? I&#39;m sure if you created a show it was either have a message you intend to put in there or your views would come out through the characters you created as an unintended consequence/ by product of your creation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly, but the views have to come from somewhere. Those creating the content must naturally have had derived their agenda from somewhere else. I think the main takeaway here is the absolute dominance of these themes in popular entertainment. Either it follows that 1) this is the kind of message people want to hear, or 2) for some reason, messages to the contrary are suppressed (I use the term broadly) for some reason. I think it is predominately 2, with a bit of 1 mixed in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People justify themselves however they want. Just because they make a claim that they follow a particular religion doesn&#39;t mean they actually know what they ascribe to or properly practice it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m astounded by the complete lack of knowledge my fellow believers have regarding our faith. Your point about humanity twisting the real version of God is very true, and part of the reason I can&#39;t stand modern churches. That said, that doesn&#39;t mean we get a free pass to not examine the options and follow the Bible/Koran/etc if we find it to be true. Humanity&#39;s shortcomings don&#39;t allow us to exempt ourselves from following Christ, for example. If the Bible is true (and I&#39;m just using this as an example here), then truly Jesus is the only way to salvation. So, if you don&#39;t accept him, no matter what you cannot be saved. God won&#39;t examine you and say, &quot;Well, he didn&#39;t accept Jesus because many of my followers were flawed, but that&#39;s ok&quot;. Not how it works. </p>

<p>Flip side to that is if you really are truly seeking him, you&#39;ll find Him.</p>

<p>This is the entire point.  The fact that there is no physical evidence for God allows people to subjectively practice their belief in God however they want.  Many of them doing so in heinous and terrible ways.</p>

<p>How do you make this jump? If a Creator made us, and wanted to make himself known to us, no amount of human fallibility could stop that. I think the history of the Bible shows this. To this day, the historical record we continue to unearth proves its veracity. But enough on that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey T4nk. Been asking God for wisdom on how to reach people. What came so far, basically, forums are near impossible. Unless that person is specifically reaching out in a way (need to discern) or looking for answers, most will be completely close-minded. If they are coming in contention, convincing by arguing simply doesn&#39;t work. However, if someone is searching, then they are more open to recieving Christ, but it is up to each man to open the door, it certainly can&#39;t be &quot;reasoned&quot; open. It was the Truth of the Word and the love displayed to me that converted me.</p>

<p><strong>Matthew 16:15 - 17</strong></p>

<p><em>He said unto them, But whom say you that I am?</em></p>

<p><em>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</em></p>

<p><em>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</em></p>

<p>Its the &quot;joy of the Lord that is our strength&quot;, and our witness. Soon, people will see misery all around (if they don&#39;t already), yet the Christian will be joyful (should be!), and it&#39;s my hope that at that time many will seek Him, also wanting this joy in times of fear.</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">http://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm</a></p>

<p>Thank you for bringing your knowledge to this thread BTW. Lets ask God to give us wisdom as much as possible, like Solomon levels of wisdom!</p>

<p><strong>James 1-5</strong></p>

<p><em>Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him.</em></p>

<p>See you around T4nk!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind words, I certainly agree. Even in personal relationships, generally the most you can do is plant seeds, or water them. I don&#39;t reach out too often in the online world, except when I see a situation where I can leave things that someone else (not usually the person I&#39;m talking to) would have something to chew on. Honestly, with the way the internet works, I really just post to share the truth when I feel moved by the Spirit, with logic and science to back it up for those who are truly looking. It is a difficult subject as in the vast majority of cases it is a heart issue, and no amount of logic or reason will win someone over. That said, the Apostles and Paul all used logic and reason to &#39;win over&#39; (you know what I mean) others, and so I consider it an important arrow in our quiver, so to speak.</p>

<p>Sadly, overtaxed isn&#39;t really looking out for God like he/she claims they are, but perhaps someone else might benefit from our discussion. I mainly wanted to provide the logical train of thought and evidence that supports our position, for those that are looking. I long moved passed trying to convince taxed several responses ago.</p>

<p>Keep up the faith, for ultimately ours is the victory in Him who gives us strength. </p>

<p>P.S. you might appreciate the blog I linked to. Lots of good discussion on difficult bible verses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you 100%. However, recall how all the prophets of old - from Moses, to Elijah and Elisha, all the way to Malachi (and indeed, all of the apostles and Paul) - were rejected by the vast majority in favor of the false prophets. It is hard to hear the truth, much easier to swallow want you want to hear.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, with the exception of me, my wife, and a few others, all of the people that were in my high school youth group either renounced Christianity or became big-time &#39;accepting Christians&#39;. Willy has not only accepted homosexuality, but practices and preaches it, and has several articles published nationally in HuffPost. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/protest-party-pray-a-queer-pastors-advice-for-pride_us_593f2568e4b0b65670e56d61">They&#39;re clearly false doctrine</a>, even surface-level satanic, as my wife pointed out, but he got positive responses in droves. It is both infuriating and sad. Infuriating that he can mislead so many people (and that they are so willing to be misled), and sad in the fact that he will have to answer for it (James 3:1). But I had just read a passage where Paul had been run out of a town for preaching the truth to a church that had gone astray, and only a few listened and repented. The rest ran him out, preferring to practice false doctrine rather than follow the truth. If even Paul faced this, we should take it as encouragement we&#39;re on the right path (not to dismiss the idea we can always improve in our presentation, but truth is truth, and in the end you can mince words so as to not hurt the feelings of those who cannot hear an opposing view).</p>

Submitting to my Creator has fixed (and is still fixing) these issues, through my personal relationship with God, not a pew.</p>

<p>How can you stand on the outside looking in, and define something you have never experienced? It&#39;s personal. You can define your experience, but you can&#39;t define mine. You are right, man in his quest for power and the corruption that follows, has used &quot;religion&quot; as a tool, but you are wrong in that its a way to further control and manipulation (at least from where I come in). Other people will do what they will do, I don&#39;t have control over that. What I can control is what I do. And my choices can be used to give love and charity, encouragment and hope, truth and wisdom to those who wish to recieve it. I used to share the same perspective you do, but its much better over here! C&#39;mon over! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. It is hard to fathom, in my mind, how people can ascribe to the idea of our world just being a simulation, but then completely rule out a Creator in the same thought. As far as the cartoons go,  I would argue that it isn&#39;t just them, but all kinds of entertainment. I think the cartoon form is popular for adults simply because we grew up with it, and as you mentioned it is easy to subliminally program kids with cartoons when they don&#39;t know it isn&#39;t appropriate for them.</p>

<p>It has always been baffling and amusing to me that people who dissect entertainment (such as the cartoons listed above, our music industry, etc) and point out all the subliminal messaging get accused of being crazy by literally everyone. Considering the chokehold we in this sub know the &quot;Powers that Be&quot; have on most media outlets, as well as other areas, wouldn&#39;t it be obvious that they&#39;d want to inject messaging anywhere they could? <strong>Especially in the stuff people consume after they shut our brain off after a long hard day. What better time to bypass our normal defenses. We&#39;re being entertained after all, it is just a show!</strong></p>

<p>That brings us to another point. The two main religions (by size anyway, Christianity and Islam) both have a supernatural entity as the main antagonist in the world, continually stirring up trouble and leading the world to its eventual demise (many other religions also have this idea too). If you ascribe to any of these doctrines, you believe that Satan/Mahdi/etc exists, and therefore you MUST expect him to be working throughout the world, stirring up trouble. We often accredit the Illuminati/Masons/etc with the pervasive themes of &#39;evil&#39; that we see routinely throughout history, because they seem unified enough that it isn&#39;t too much of a leap to think we&#39;re all controlled by a single organization. Considering how inept most human beings are, I think the stronger argument is that you have a supernatural entity conducting these things. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21GOSnJc4Mg">Just check out this interview with Beyonce</a>. <a href="https://p2alm.com/2014/04/13/the-islamic-teaching-of-the-final-battle-between-christ-and-the-antichrist/">Also very interesting is that both Christians and Muslims think that the Antichrist is the one described in the other&#39;s sacred texts.</a></p>

<p>Finally, I&#39;ll speak from my perspective. There&#39;s a lot of things about Christianity that are unique to it, such as the saving mechanism, but another thing that is unique is how universally it is hated. Now, I realize all religions face persecution - I get it. That said, if you look over the course of time, two groups face much higher relative amounts of persecution than all others, and that&#39;s Christianity and Judaism. If it is true that there is an entity that opposes God and is actively working to stop him, the logical next step is to see what religion gets the most flak from all other groups. Islam fights itself a lot (Shia vs Sunni) but at other times generally is doing the persecution. When not being persecuted by Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus are well-liked, whereas Christians and Jews generally draw the ire from all those around them. Granted, a vast majority of them live in contrast to the Bible, and Christianity was used as a means of control by the state-run churchs for centuries, but there&#39;s a fundamental theme of antagonism we see against Jews and Christians everywhere, constantly.  You even noted it with every show you listed, though I don&#39;t think that was your main point. It is one of those subtle context clues that should alert you into whether the faith you ascribe to is valid or not. &quot;Am I being persecuted for legitimate reasons? If not, why not? If I oppose evil, should evil be coming after me?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made me happy! You seem to get it at a deeper level than most people can.</p>

<p>Christianity is hated. Is there one popular show that promotes it? Do we ever hear anything positive about Christians? No.</p>

<p>Next, I&#39;m glad you agree with my point about the fact that people can believe there is a simulation but they refuse to consider God...maybe why this post has been downvoted a lot (but not many counterarguments!</p>

<p>Warning: this reply came out to be a lot longer than I had intended...</p>

<p>There comes a point where logic (or oftentimes, the facade of logic)  is abandoned in favor of the heart - of course, no one will admit it, but so it is. This is a perfect example of such a case. My coworker Cody has no problem buying we&#39;re a simulation, but it is only acceptable if the entity running it isn&#39;t God. He&#39;ll try to spin it that this is logical, but it can&#39;t be - if you can arrive to the conclusion we&#39;re in a simulation regardless of who is running it, the only way you can rule out God is simply by choosing to because you don&#39;t like that possibility. </p>

<p>That I think has been one of the biggest lessons I&#39;ve learned dealing with people since starting my career. We (Cody and I) both  enjoy debating each other in advanced physics, but there comes in the inevitable point where the conversation no longer is about logic and reason (as you either reach assumptions or feelings on the topic) and yet generally the person will still try to pretend like they&#39;re being factual. Over time the nuances of such a departure become obvious, but depending on the skill of the individual they can masquerade quite well as being completely fact-based when in reality they are not at all. There&#39;s quite a few instances where I could have steamrolled others into my point of view by treating my assumptions as facts; but I hate intellectual dishonesty, and to that end I always inform people what are fundamental assumptions that lead to a hypothesis or theory. You give an easy way out to someone who isn&#39;t looking for the truth this way, but more solid ground for someone who is. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen my fellow coworkers get completely shut down in the traps Cody sets for them (he loves to debate and is good at it). It is amazing how quickly he stops debating with you once you start calling him out on his inconsistencies tho. We pretty much only discuss video games now, hah!</p>

<p>Anyway, great job with your post. You&#39;re right on the money. </p>

<p>This is also simple but for the hardcore atheists (the ones who claim God is an absurdity), they still can never technically know.</p>

<p>I never could understand how something could be comfortable with saying &quot;God is 100% not real&quot; vs. &quot;God is likely not real, but there is still a possibility.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Popping in here to say fuck The Simpsons and everything it has become. At least when it began it had some semblance of family values and some episodes even had touching messages, like when Homer posts all the pictures of Maggie on top of Burns&#39; plaque that says &quot;Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re here forever&quot; to change it to &quot;Do it for her&quot;.</p>

<p>And in many instances it was actually funny. I stopped watching a long time ago though because around season 10 or even earlier it started turning into pure shit comedy wise. The jokes were less thought provoking, less satirizing, and more slapstick Family Guy-esque nonsense.</p>

<p>But we do put it on at 5pm just for the kids to have a cartoon to watch or whatever before dinner. While it&#39;s not funny anymore, I figured it&#39;s mostly harmless. I don&#39;t try to protect my kids from curse words or fat jokes. But last night the episode &quot;Let&#39;s go fly a coot&quot; came on, and I was pissed.</p>

<p>It started off pretty normal new shitty simpsons style. Homer gets mad because of birthday parties for some reason, some random person pretending to be the &quot;big brother&quot; of birthdays shows up (not even sure what the joke is here), blah blah blah. Not really paying attention. All of the sudden Milhouses cousin appears and she&#39;s smoking an &quot;e cigarette&quot;. My kid is watching intently. Then she gives the E cigarette to Bart who smokes it and hacks it up. OK, i&#39;m slightly annoyed but the scene was short and I thought it was the end of it.</p>

<p>Holy shit, a few minutes later we&#39;re back to Bart and Milhouses cousin smoking E cigarettes, and now even Maggie is doing it. My kid can&#39;t take his eyes off of this. FUCK THIS SHOW. Where have we come as a society? We&#39;ve gone from Joe Camel to cartoon babies smoking? This is the supposed &quot;enlightening&quot; we&#39;ve had about how bad smoking is?</p>

<p>Maybe your argument is that The Simpsons isn&#39;t for kids. Well shit, if they&#39;re showing preteens and babies smoking, then YES OF COURSE IT&#39;S NOT FOR KIDS NOW. Before this fucking degeneracy, the worst was a &quot;damn&quot; or &quot;hell&quot; thrown around and some fat jokes or something. </p>

<p>But fuck this shit in all its forms:</p>

<p>I agree the Simpsons user to have a heart. It even used to be smart. Now it is just stupid.</p>

<p>I honestly can&#39;t find humor in it much anymore. Sure there is the occasional good joke but the characters are completely flat, and their agenda is so constantly obvious that it is just difficult to watch!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think these shows are coming from a place where &quot;They&quot; or TPTB put them out there for us to consume and take an intended message in but instead reflect the views of the artists that make them. And some of those artists may indeed be quite nihilistic in their views. And everyone has an agenda right? I&#39;m sure if you created a show it was either have a message you intend to put in there or your views would come out through the characters you created as an unintended consequence/ by product of your creation.</p>
