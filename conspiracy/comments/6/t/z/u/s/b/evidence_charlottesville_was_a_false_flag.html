<p>3a. His air bags didn&#39;t go off.
3b. His face was perfectly calm after impact, he showed no emotion.
3c. His hand stayed of the staring wheel after impact as if he had  experience with scenarios like this</p>

<p>4 His face looks similar to the man who was arrested, but not exactly the same.
4a. The driver was wearing a a different shirt than the man who was arrested.  The mugshot shows Fields wearing a black and white stripped shirt, the man driver the car is wearing a white shirt.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A helicopter fell from the sky for apparently no reason, two cops died and the msm treats it as a afterthought. </p></li>
<li><p>The talking points seemed pre prepared: this is terrorism, this is Trump fault, Trump won&#39;t disavow, he didn&#39;t disavow fast enough. This the far right. NAZI NAZI NAZI.
6a. The bots and shills were out in force repeating these goddammit TPs for 3 f&#39;n days! The same lines over and over...</p></li>

<p>I&#39;ll agree to that part, but the front page is nothing but NDAA to me, problem,reaction,solution. None of this is by accident, Karl Rove:</p>

<p>&quot;The aide said that guys like me were &quot;in what we call the reality-based community,&quot; which he defined as people who &quot;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.&quot; ... &quot;That&#39;s not the way the world really works anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#39;re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;</p>
