         The police herded the Confederate Monument ralliers into anifa and BLM.

         After the "raycist" drove into the bowling pi- uh, I mean peaceful protesters he backed away with professional skill - I am told that this kind of maneuvering is very difficult.

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       3a. His air bags didn't go off.
3b. His face was perfectly calm after impact, he showed no emotion.
3c. His hand stayed of the staring wheel after impact as if he had  experience with scenarios like this
      </p>
      <p>
       4 His face looks similar to the man who was arrested, but not exactly the same.
4a. The driver was wearing a a different shirt than the man who was arrested.  The mugshot shows Fields wearing a black and white stripped shirt, the man driver the car is wearing a white shirt.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A helicopter fell from the sky for apparently no reason, two cops died and the msm treats it as a afterthought.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The talking points seemed pre prepared: this is terrorism, this is Trump fault, Trump won't disavow, he didn't disavow fast enough. This the far right. NAZI NAZI NAZI.
6a. The bots and shills were out in force repeating these goddammit TPs for 3 f'n days! The same lines over and over...

       The way he drove away immediately after, the force of his impact, and the rhetoric of the people he affiliates with politically all paint a pretty likely picture of a domestic terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't find anyone outside of his niche political group defending him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the alt-right wants to be taken seriously, they should disavow this homicidal extremist immediately and with force. Unless of course, his actions align with thier views.

       If you were in fear of your life would you drive into a smaller crowd with bats or a larger crowd and several vehicles? Well he eventually did the first to get away so he should have just done that in the first place if he truly was scared. Since that therefore can't be it, what other motivation besides maliciousnesses is there?

       It just happened.  Is there any information from the FAA or whomever investigates helicopter crashes?  There are at least two families out there that are suffering right now.  There has to be some researchers on this site that need something new to chew on.  Go after this!

       The FAA will be investigating, they just won't announce anything before they've determined the cause of the crash. Aircraft accident investigations take a lot of time if the cause isn't extremely obvious.

       They're rightly pointing out that this division is just a distractionc from the real problems. Neo-nazis, commies, and anti-fa are not the biggest drags on our quality of life. Its the crony capitalism that's ruining things for us.

       I'll agree to that part, but the front page is nothing but NDAA to me, problem,reaction,solution. None of this is by accident, Karl Rove:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." ... "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."

       Its trying to push the nonsense anti-leftist narrative. This weak stuff doesn't belong on this subreddit. A third of the alt right is praising the guy for murdering people. A third of the alt right is saying he did it in self defencre. A third of the alt right think that he was a shill. If you're cherry pick/falsely analyze evidence, at least try to make the narrative consistent.

       This specific instance was carried out by an alt-righter. Take your nonsense out of this sub. There's more important things to talk about than nazis vs anarchists. Corporate scum wants you to talk about these things so you don't address the real issues that Americans have to deal with.

       these are all great questions that still need answering. I think if true it's also worth mentioning that Fields was a reported schizophrenic who's probably on/been on psych meds as well... spent time with the military as well (do they accept people with schizophrenic tendencies? they did here!)

       The man who shot the video, Brennan Gilmore, is a former "special field agent" for the State Department stationed throughout Africa (aka CIA op), and is also currently the Chief of Staff for lib Dem candidate for VA governor, Tom Pierrello.  Gilmore HIMSELF submitted a column to Politico regarding the accident on Monday - the language used is a whole lotta purple prose prop.  There's been near-zero acknowledgment of this in his interviews, and in fact the State Department itself has quickly started scrubbing references to him online.
