       The first thing I wonder is could this guy look anymore like Israeli Mossad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice he gives an incorrect account twice, where he says that the car reverses and then smashes people a second time, which clearly does not occur in any videos we see. To me, this is a sign that multiple takes or scenes were shot and/or that he is fumbling over the script.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are those who will say that his spastic demeanor is a sign of "true shock," the same people who thought it was totally normal that no Sandy Hook parents ever cried. Of course he does not cry either, even when contorting his face in an attempt to look horrified.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is for those who can spot a bad liar when they see one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice also that he repeats parts of the script, such as "there was a girl on the ground she was tore up she tried to get up." He also stops at the exact same moment in each interview where he presumably becomes "too emotional."
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another witness named Jon Ziegler who gave the same incorrect account of the car backing up and hitting again, but I'm having trouble finding this video and many are indeed already being removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did find this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ewxba5-vdhA">
        video
       </a>
       of Ziegler, who like our bearded friend also happens to be Jewish. He also says there's no license plates on the car which is incorrect, and makes sure to randomly specify that "Unicorn Riot" is not a group of paid protestors, but a not-for-profit media organization. Odd information for a guy who narrowly avoided death and just witnessed such horror.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also seems to be covered inexplicably with leftover baby powder from the Boston Hoaxathon Bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: at
       <a href="https://youtu.be/KCXR0R58KX4?t=50s">
        0:50
       </a>
       in the first video you can see a girl laughing and a guy smirking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So go ahead and enjoy: shills feel free to comment that I'm "defending Nazis" or that this is "totally normal," and people with working brains sit back and have a laugh at this overdone deception.

       I just wish I could find the videos of Ziegler saying the same incorrect account of the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm assuming that people have seen the video of the suspect's mother as well, because it is also odd to say the least. She is told her son basically just murdered someone and continues on almost laughing, unfazed by this news. And they make sure to insert and emphasize the "alt-right" buzz word.

       If you hate an entire group bc of the elite part of that group you think is evil, that's racism. I'm sorry. You may not see it that way but many people do. Either way my granddad fought Nazis in ww2 and he didn't fight them for his country to become them eventually. I just can't defend them but it's cool if you do.

       haha did you see that vid I posted where the ADL went after David Icke because they thought that his "reptilians=the evil manipulating force we can all sense but have a hard time naming" theory
       <em>
        sounded
       </em>
       too close to Jews? lol So, then, with no evidence, they call these meetings where, based on an implicit agreement that Icke is "bad for the community", they threaten radio stations to not have Icke appear, intimidate book stores to get him thrown out, grill him on camera, asking him if lizards=Jews, and he was like "no, look at me, this is not a Jewish conspiracy", and the interviewer was like "it's just that when you say "it's not a Jewish conspiracy", people say it's a metaphor for "it's a Jewish conspiracy". lol And that's not even the best part.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Icke keeps doing his thing, talking about lizards and shit, signing books in the shops that will have him, and this group of Jews gets together and makes shitty lizard costumes, buys some pies, goes to his signing, tries to call him an anti-semite, to which the audience is like "wait wut", and they throw the pies at him and run, most not hitting him and instead landing on the children's book section behind him. It was, like, holy shit, this is how they handle their business, it's not so mystical and occult, it's just a group of conscienceless douchebags deciding to use subversion and shitty politics to fight the battles that they should fight with integrity and honor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno, man. The more I learn about all the political action groups surrounding Jews, the more I see that this stuff is not only something that they might do, but could be argued to be their modus operandi.

       Man, it's so weird how in the little amount of time that I've known you, you've
       <em>
        used
       </em>
       language a lot, but in a lot of the threads I've seen you in, it's like
       <em>
        taking in
       </em>
       language is really difficult for you. How weird. I don't think I've ever met a person irl who has that problem. It's not intentional, is it? I would think that the ability to use language and the ability to understand it would go hand in hand, being pretty much inseparable. Weird.

       You're proceeding from the point that this is automatically a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       You described some stuff to do with Icke that bears no resemblance to what happened in Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking the OP where he gets the information that this guy looks like Mossad.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying Jewish action groups use aggressive protest tactics. Are you saying the counter protestors were Jewish or as OP said, Mossad?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do need to explain yourself because right now you look like you're out to pin anything possible on Jews.

       "Technically?" You're distorting what both these men actually said, which was that the car backed up and slammed into people again. The bearded guy even makes a hand motion as he's saying this to indicate the car going in reverse, then forward again.

       The guy incorrectly remembers exactly what happened after a horribly traumatic and terrifying event.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you say he's a trained actor who was expecting this, so there should be no reason to fumble over this script, especially twice, if he were trained and expecting this whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say his reactions are pretty consistent with someone who just witnessed something so horrifying and is obviously distraught.  But sure, I'm sure you've been in similar situations and have been perfectly level-headed, so who am I to judge.

       I should have explained that better. As in, the hairy man is not at all believable. He was not believable at all, when he was attempting to look sad I rolled my eyes. An obvious actor, and a bad one

       Yeah this sealed the deal for me. The top comment on this thread currently by the way is disinformative bullshit, claiming that "technically" the car reversed into people when clearly what was said by the anchor people on the news and two witnesses was that the car reversed and drove forward into people a second time.

       Are we watching the same videos? You're either delusional or have never been in a chaotic situation where the news media are covering it. It happens in any sort of crowd environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happens all the time that the same person is talked to. One reporter sees the interview and tries to snag the same person for a few reasons. Primarily it is that when one reporter sees the another talking to someone they will snag them as well because they are nearby and have the time or are a least willing to talk. I've had it happen to me in far less chaotic situations than this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely don't draw the same conclusions about their description of events that you do (including your followups in the thread). I don't hear anyone saying the car rammed forwards twice. I could also walk out the door and do a quick roll in the street and have what you perceive to be "baby powder" on my face and hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get off the couch and actually participate in the world like the folks in Charlotteville. I believe there are active and dangerous conspiracies on many levels but this crisis actor stuff is beyond tin foil.

       Uh, what? I can't think of a single time I've been out of my house, for any reason, and came home with what looked to be baby powder on my face and hair. And I've done some hard core frolicking.

       Great post, thanks for the analysis. This event has many hallmarks of a hoax / false flag event, including:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Potato quality video of the crash itself
2) Pink all over the frame of the first crash video, on flags, protestors (seems to be common and prominent colour at suspected false flag events, perhaps a fear programming technique)
3) Missing shoes on the injured (masonic symbolism)
4) Many inconsistencies and questions about vehicle and driver
5) The unexplained police helo crash / fireball - very suspicious
6) Number plate has two '11s' in it, suspect's mother's plate has 1122 - both are significant for numerology)
7) And of course... shitty crisis actors giving unconvincing interviews
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I miss anything?

       I never noticed the pink thing! I'll have to go back and look for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, that bizarre photo that was taken from behind at the exact moment of the crash(?) with the black dude flying through the air, contains many many shoes scattered about. I did notice that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a comparison photo last night where someone shopped the suspect's face right next to the face of the driver in the car, zoomed in and enhanced, and it's clearly not the same guy at all.

       I made a quick album with some examples of the "pink" theme. There are so many more than this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these could be coincidences. However, each example shows a victim, the perpetrator, or a significant prop related to the event. These aren't just background details.

       Wow, very good. I always thought the pink knives from the London thing were bizarre. I had heard purple was a Masonic color but never noticed the pink theme.
