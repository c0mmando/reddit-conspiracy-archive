    <div class="md"><p>&quot;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.&quot;</p>

<p>But adding to that, when the president decides to lambast and publically denounce a CEO who left the advice board rather than the white supremacists who were shouting nazi propaganda, it&#39;s easy to blame his rhetoric because he doesn&#39;t denounce those who use his name to promote white supremacy </p>

<p>This guy ran people over because he&#39;s a psycho, not because of his personally held opinions other than his opinion that it is OK to kill innocent people.  I&#39;m not sticking up for Nazi&#39;s but running over people in a crowd or at all is not part of being Nazi.

<p>This is wrong.  This will happen again and it will be for completely different reasons that we are supposed to rally against.  Crazy psychotic people will be around forever and will continue to do crazy shit whether we want to blame it on guns, ideology, or the weather.

    <div class="md"><p>He isn&#39;t creating racists, that I agree with. I am saying his election has emboldened racists to be more mainstream as now they&#39;re getting more coverage, it&#39;s not manufactured by the media but it&#39;s being propagated by the media instead. And relations were always bad in the US bit these recent events are exposing the cracks in race relations, and political relations </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the answer to your question is, I don&#39;t know the depth of his views. All I know is, he was supporting white supremacy at a white supremacists rally at where he decided to run counter protestors over due to the difference in their beliefs. And that he has been reported to hold nazi ideology in high regard, and even had pictures of nazi imagery on his social media. That says enough about him to be honest </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was a white nationalist movement rally, which was called unite the right. So they bring a lot of right wing people, and the people who identify with the far right are white supremacists and literally nazi&#39;s which again links into the comment I made about the public view of right wing voters/trump voters. </p>

<p>And come on, that&#39;s more than enough to speculate with accuracy his motives, in the same way that anders breivik&#39;s views were enough to speculate why he did what he did, in the same way the perpetrators of 9/11&#39;s views were enough to speculate with accuracy why he did what he did </p>

<p>the crashers created the volitile sitution.</p>

<p>had the crashers requested a permit to counter white nationalist&#39;s rally, it would have been issued some distance away and seperated by barracades, precisely to prevent what gappened.</p>

<p>no one has a right to hurt another person period, however, neither does a person have the right to carrying a sign threatening to kill another person, as rally crashers did (if you carry a large sign with the fist of solidarity above &quot;kill all monsters,&quot; while screaming at people that they are monsters you are threatening to kill them). </p>

<p>at seattle, we were having the shit beat out if us by cops, while protesting the vangaurd of TTP. you guys are getting into rival gang street fights, while &quot;protesting&quot; the fact that some people, a tiny minority, are repulsive, but legally repulsive,  1st amendment protected repulsive. you picked a fight with a gang that is better at fighting, and you got the worst of it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you dare equate the casualities of your street fight with kent state, harlan county, blair mountain. you share much more with crips and bloods.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to recall what happened clearly, and to think rationally in your speculation on any events like these. </p>

<p>If anyone is telling you that you&#39;re on the wrong side for asking questions, be more than suspicious of them. Asking questions and clarifying the truth of an event is a hallmark of being an intelligent human being. </p>

<p>This applies to those on any side of an argument. If someone asks you to think irrationally, or truly, if they try to influence your way of thinking by means other than cogent argument and appeals to reason they are to be ignored or berated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act like hating Nazis hasn&#39;t been the general consensus for decades. No one has ever liked nazis, it didn&#39;t just become a problem yesterday. A bunch of white trash dudes marching around saying hateful shit is blowing everyone&#39;s mind. </p>

<p>Where were all you people when the Westboro Baptist church were picketing service members funerals and saying homosexuals were going to burn in hell? Nazis aren&#39;t cool. They never were. Jumping on this media band wagon is a complete joke. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know any fucking neo nazis. If a bunch of anti nazi protesters didn&#39;t go and mess with these idiots during their march, they would of just disappeared back under the rock they crawled out from. Now it&#39;s a giant media circle jerk and you&#39;re all out on Reddit acting like it&#39;s a big fucking deal. Get over it. Stop giving these people credibility by blowing up social media with all this nonsense. </p>

<p>The way things have been going lately, all this attention they&#39;re getting is only going to make them more powerful. It&#39;s stuff like accusing people of being nazis that&#39;s going to give the people who actually believe that shit more media time and more reason to come out in public and pull this shit again. It&#39;s absolutely absurd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody is sympathizing with a guy who would willingly drive into a crowd of people.  </p>

<p>People, including yourself, are sympathizing with people gathering to commit violent acts, throw bodily fluids, vandalize property. etc etc.  Think about that for a minute.  </p>

<p>These neo nazi losers were not hurting anybody when left alone.  Then enter the agitators, and suddenly it&#39;s a violent melee and some dude with psychological problems drives into a crowd.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no excuse at all for that.  But showing up, in some cases with weapons and violent intentions to an otherwise peaceful event is fucking criminal.  And those people are criminals.  And msm has chosen not to focus on that fact.  If they didn&#39;t show up, those people would not be in the hospital and nobody would be dead.  </p>

<p>&quot;Hospital has sent me to ER, says I may have permanent eye damage&quot;- some social media figure who got assaulted at event.  </p>

<p>Then this fine person responds &quot;I hope your eye falls out, and you die or something&quot;.  </p>

<p>So, do you disavow people like that?  Because so far it seems that you&#39;re defending that stuff.</p>

<p>&#39;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.</p>

<p>&#39;17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can “argue” with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues.</p>

<p>&#39;18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.</p>

<p>&#39;20. <strong>False evidence</strong>. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications.</p>

<p>is it a tragedy that people were hurt and someone got killed? absolutely. was it 100% preventable? absolutely. do the rally crashers bear the lion share for having created volatile and dangerous situation? absolutely. </p>

<p>you know what kills me? these antifa assholes, self righteous bernieites, and radicalized blue dog democrats are all solidly middle and upper middle class. and white. most have had fuck all interaction with black people and illegal immigrants. none have known want or financial insecurity. they reek so strongly of white priveldge that they castigated amaju barraka, a black man, for calling out bernie&#39;s white supremacist imperialism over for his support of the yemeni genocide (at least while obama was manning the drones). way to take black perspectives seriously, you should be proud.</p>

<p>i graduated from UVA law. not one of those fucking priveleged, legacy POS&#39;s care about anything but their own social persona. right now that is &quot;bad ass, fake socialist, defenders of civility.&quot; i&#39;ll let you ponder the oxymoron.</p>

They, like most people, know that every fucking rally in this country will have counter protesters, doesn&#39;t matter what side is demonstrating legally, left and right. And whether their protest was legal or not doesn&#39;t excuse them from the responsibility they bear in this murder; they throw this rally almost entirely to piss people off, intimidated them, and start shit; and look what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;ve never gone to counter protest against White Supremacists. Do you have a fucking point? </p>

<p>Blaming the victims is a classic right wing that comes straight from the bullshit playbook. That tactic has been played out hundreds of times on this sub in the past 24 hours and it never gains ground. People, even counter protestors, have a right to peaceful assembly and have a right to free speech. Just because they&#39;re in the vicinity or white supremacists does not take away their right to free speech. </p>

<p>You claim to have graduated from law school but you seem to know piss all about the law. I&#39;d love for you to try to argue in a court of law that it&#39;s the victims fault she was murdered. Last time I checked the prosecutor charged the man who drove his car through a crowd of counter protestors with murder and not a single counter protestor was arrested. But bad ass anonymous redditor thinks he knows the law better. People went there to protest against the radical dangerous right wing nazis and the right ended up killing one of them and injuring 19 others. Disgusting. And you try to shift the blame away from those who directly carried out the attacks onto those who were innocently and peacefully protesting white supremacists.</p>

<p>A permit to assemble wouldn&#39;t have stopped a man driving a car into a crowd full of people. Are you seriously trying to claim that? You can&#39;t be that stupid</p>

<p>Nope the person who bears the responsibility is the person who the drove the car into the crowd. That&#39;s why he&#39;s arrested and the protestors aren&#39;t. You fail at law, bigly.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some are, some are lower class. They all come from different backgrounds but nice try at demonizing them as being elitist upper class rich folk. That&#39;s another common right tactic and it won&#39;t work here because it&#39;s patently false. You&#39;re drivel of a post is shameful and pathetic.</p>

<p>Do you have any legal precedent for that? Any at all? It is obviously a LOT different than yelling fire in a theater, those situations are so laughably far apart that there is no point in discussing it. I would give it no chance that someone who organized a peaceful protest will be held liable for some murderer driving his car into a crowd, much less the protesters themselves</p>

<p>For the small time fights and scraps? Maybe. For vehicular homicide? Again, give me any precedent for that</p>

<p>Your words speak for themselves. If you aren&#39;t intending to spread disinformation, ask yourself: &quot;why am I using unsound logic described in a disinformation manual?&quot;</p>

<p>Saying &quot;they&#39;re Nazis, don&#39;t listen&quot; is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">basic</a> logical fallacy. To get granular, Hitler was a monster, but he was right about the efficacy of using combined armed tactics in World War II. OP is talking about facts of this incident, they can very well be an outright Nazi and it has no bearing on the truth of their post.</p>

<p>In this case, it&#39;s irrelevant. OP was sharing information from other sources; we don&#39;t need to rely on their credibility, so attacking their credibility is a fallacy of relevance. </p>

<p>Many of us have been saying the NSA lives in your cell phone since before iphones. We were outcasts. People called us crazy. 
Now, all these kids come in and think they can earn some internet points to validate their otherwise boring existence, by posting nonsense.
I&#39;d be glad to see young people questioning authority except that they are here to argue for their side which no way in hell could have THEM brainwashed. </p>

<p>Listen kids. If you think donal gives a rats add about you, grow up. No one cares about you. Not the left or the right. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a big game to them. 
Stop being a fucking pawn. </p>

<p>Stop defending either side.
Make your own side.

<p>Is the guy just a regular freedom fighter that travels the world to fight injustice, and the media noticed their old pal there at the event? And to immediately get such an information scrubbing to make him look like average joe? </p>

<p>In the least sinister scenario, he might have been there as a plant ready for an interview. But then this murder happens, so they needed to clear any links or their psyop might look suspicious. Interesting games being played.</p>

<p>i&#39;m an anarchist, old time 80s punk, as far left as you can get--i don&#39;t believe in property, money, borders, governments, or jobs. i could give a fuck about white nationalists, anymore than i gave a fuck about skinheads, but the fact that these bernites and antifarians can&#39;t see that spoili g for a fight has agent provacteur all over it. at WTO whever some asshole started spoling for a fight, we assumed he was an agent orovacteur and surrounded him arms linked, just like us punks did when skins would try to infiltrate the pit.</p>

<p>these kids jumping are the most useful idiots i&#39;ve ever seen, i just wish they&#39;d stop tarnishing anarchists&#39; good name with their bored upper middle class assholery. they have no clue and are the most credulous people on the face of the planet. &quot;oh that guy with the chain, it&#39;s just self defense. he&#39;s anti facists.&quot;</p>

<p>For one, assuming this is the same guy, there&#39;s no &quot;wiping&quot; of web info on him. The State Department page was deleted in 2011, presumably when he left that position. The quotes attributed to him in a newspaper were simply tossed out in a later revision of the article, as they focused on the immediate aftermath of the attack but the story began to shift to the investigation, etc. Finally, I&#39;d hardly call it a conspiracy that a lifelong politician happened to be at a major political rally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questions: 
Why allow a counter protest? Jeesh anyone could have seen the dominoes falling. </p>

<p>If you approve a counter protest why not draw a blue line and separate them far away from one another?</p>

<p>Why accept a counter protest when you know you don&#39;t have adequate police force to govern it? </p>

<p>Why did the drivers airbag not deploy when he rammed the car? </p>

<p>Is the video edited?  We see him drive up no damage then back out with a bat in the window and front of car in pieces.  I know they may have edited for censoring the death/injuries but somebody has to have video of all the people hitting the car with bats. </p>

<p>The driver drove straight back after getting attacked - if he wanted to take more lives he could have swerved and taken out about 12 more...but didn&#39;t.  Why?</p>

<p>Why is CrowdsOnDemand involved?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was so articulate, not scripted because all diplomats are trained crisis reporters. The written and oral tests they have to take are so difficult they have an admission rate lower than Harvard.   They are trained in mock up cities to keep their heads during explosions, fire and smoke.  They have on the ground training in administering first aid after a bombing, escape driving, how to avoid being followed, to always have an escape route and when to evacuate an embassy. More ambassadors have been killed than generals in the last 50 years This may sound like similar training to agents, but agents can do nothing public.  CIA agents are always under cover of some obscure job, hide from cameras and can do nothing public, including giving interviews after a tragedy</p>

<p>Although a Democrat, Brennan has won the Secretary of State&#39;s award for Public Outreach under a Republican administration. Served proudly under Colin Powell and Condolezza Rice, both Republican.  His interest is human rights and democracy which the current president says the State department will no longer address, so he left to work for the campaign of his last boss.    You can read his human rights and democracy reports if you go to the state department websites for the country during the years he was assigned there if they have not been removed by this administration. Human Rights is paramount in the domestic and foreign safety of our citizens. Every country that is a threat to ours is a country with no respect for human rights and no legitimate democracy.  (Russia, North Korea, WW2 Germany,)
The video swung around because he had to jump out of the way of the car both coming and backing up.  Why don&#39;t you google his actual history and pictures instead imagining crazy stuff.</p>

<p>i&#39;m an anarchist, old time 80s punk, as far left as you can get--i don&#39;t believe in property, money, borders, governments, or jobs. i could give a fuck about white nationalists, anymore than i gave a fuck about skinheads, but the fact that these bernites and antifarians can&#39;t see that spoili g for a fight has agent provacteur all over it. at WTO whever some asshole started spoling for a fight, we assumed he was an agent orovacteur and surrounded him arms linked, just like us punks did when skins would try to infiltrate the pit.</p>

<p>these kids jumping are the most useful idiots i&#39;ve ever seen, i just wish they&#39;d stop tarnishing anarchists&#39; good name with their bored upper middle class assholery. they have no clue and are the most credulous people on the face of the planet. &quot;oh that guy with the chain, it&#39;s just self defense. he&#39;s anti facists.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I posted about it earlier and it was about to hit the front page, but got slammed by vote bots at the last minute.</p>

<p>Basically, the whole narrative has fallen apart within 24 hours. We&#39;ve already got a State Department (which is the most common CIA cover) operative on the scene doing damage control.</p>

<p>Add in Faith Goldy being literally at the scene of the crash to get traumatic footage, although her narrative so far hasn&#39;t been too suspicious.</p>

<p>May be that this is the... I want to say ninth version of this post that has made the front page, and currently one of three that I can see on it with the other two being older than it. So it&#39;s being spammed every few hours and getting rather tiresome.</p>
