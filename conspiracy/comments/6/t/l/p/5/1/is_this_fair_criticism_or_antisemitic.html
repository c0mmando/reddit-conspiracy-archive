Is this not sensitive enough to normal Jews or the oversensitive establishment? Surely this is reasonable? Or should I play it safe and not comment on Judaism at all and just show the Vatican shit?
I think there are satanic Jews and satanic Catholics. It&#39;s not anti semitic but I don&#39;t know if it comes across like that. Maybe it&#39;s too cynical. It&#39;s not meant to be an attack on normal Jews. But I don&#39;t want to ruin the whole presentation if this supposedly &quot;discredits&quot; the whole thing. Maybe it&#39;s just too messy anyway...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, it also seems wise to cut it down
because otherwise I may end up talking about
the Saturn hexagon/4D cube thing which is seriously in &quot;speculative waters&quot;. It seems too strong to be a coincidence to have zero significance to the occult groups, but there isn&#39;t enough to go on, and just makes the whole slide &quot;tin foil hat&quot; level speculation
when my other slides are pretty solid (ok no citations or any of that, but still easily researchable, but this Satan/Saturn stuff is not really as tangible).</p>

<p>What&#39;s your opinion on Santos Bonacci?
And what do you mean the particle/wave duality of a photo being related to this? I think I remember the basics (double slit experiment and all that) but I&#39;m not sure how it relates to Platonic solids or Saturn/Satan/4D cube/hexagon stuff. :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re casting pearls before swine. What this means is that the average person simply hasn&#39;t got enough understanding of esoteric symbolism and secret societies to give meaningful context to what you&#39;re trying to say.</p>

<p>Remember that we live in a pro-Semitic world (because of political correctness). This means the only socially acceptable way to refer to Jewish people is to praise them or condemn anyone who is critical of them... even if the statement is perfectly rational.</p>

<p>I think Jewish people are exactly the same as everyone else. If there is a difference, it&#39;s that they network well with each other and tend to be very well educated. But they are just as easily tempted to benefit themselves at someone else&#39;s expense whenever money is involved. The more money, the greater the temptation. If people are like Superman, money is like kryptonite. </p>

<p>This goes for everyone and Jewish people are just like everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point. It seems to be an unnecessary extra red pill, and it also seems better to at least somewhat play it safe.
The main point of the presentation was politics (it then expanded into other connections)
so I don&#39;t think knowing about kabbalism is going to make a shred of difference to the audience, compared to know
the basics of politics and how the corporate media deliberately gives a false view of politics (e.g. conflating feminism for leftism, conflating Christianity for right wing conservativism, divide and conquer crap, two party corporate system, etc.).</p>

It goes from politics (left, right, divide conquer, NEOlib/NEOcon false dichotomy, political science,)

    <div class="md"><p>The presentation was only meant to be about politics but expanded
into an encylopedia. xD
But seriously, I also didn&#39;t mean to offend Catholics either (although the ideology might have Roman tweaks on original Christianity).
Either way, it was more criticism against the corrupt Vatican/pope.
Essentially saying &quot;some who you think are normal Jews and Catholics....are possibly actually satanic&quot;.
I think maybe it&#39;s an unnecessary red pill, either that or I have to restructure it.</p>

Kabbalism isn&#39;t a priority in my presentation, just
as I only made a brief comment about feminism rather than a full blown explanation. (It&#39;s politics related, but then expanded into connected topics like the oligarchs, warmongers, secret societies, etc.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean?
You think I&#39;m being too soft on the topic?
I tried to strike a balance because what pushed me to
talk about Kabbalism is, I stumbled on a conspiracy website (I think it was just a blog of some sort)
where the guy said &quot;anyone who doesn&#39;t mention the J word is a shill&quot;
which made me think &quot;this guy seems ignorant but then again, Jewish mysticism is probably related to the occult so he has half a point there, but it&#39;s still NOT normal Jews involved in these conspiracies&quot;.</p>

<p>So I thought it would be optimum to find a balance between
&quot;ITS DA JUICE&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s absolutely got nothing to do with Jews&quot;
thing, you know, to be more accurate/objective and give the ignorant people a little more benefit of the doubt.
Reasonable people KNOW normal Jews down the street are not involved in these disgusting conspiracies, but there is somewhat of a Jewish link, whether it&#39;s Jewish mysticism/Kabbalism, or a Satanic strain of Judaism or whatever, I don&#39;t know.
I don&#39;t even know if Judaism itself is satanic or became satanic or if these kabbalists tarnished the original Judaism.</p>

<p>I think due to how little I know on the topic, (how blurry the line is between Kabbalism and Judaism)
and how this one slide could tarnish the whole presentation,
I&#39;m going to play it safe, especially considering it won&#39;t make that much difference compared to the more important slides
(political zionism, banking system, what left vs right ACTUALLY is, corporate media, etc.)</p>

<p>But I do understand your point of view.
But yeah this is unnecessary part of the puzzle,
I&#39;m just trying to wake people up about left vs right first and foremost
so looking back, this slide is at least partially unnecessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The presentation was only meant to be about politics but expanded
into an encylopedia. xD
But seriously, I also didn&#39;t mean to offend Catholics either (although the ideology might have Roman tweaks on original Christianity).
Either way, it was more criticism against the corrupt Vatican/pope.
Essentially saying &quot;some who you think are normal Jews and Catholics....are possibly actually satanic&quot;.
I think maybe it&#39;s an unnecessary red pill, either that or I have to restructure it.</p>
