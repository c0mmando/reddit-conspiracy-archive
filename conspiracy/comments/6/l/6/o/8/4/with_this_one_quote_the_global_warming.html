    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think that is peculiar as well. Now, who paid for that research to be conducted? Does the conclusion reached fit any agendas of anyone involved?

    <div class="md"><p>Random Notes and Questions:</p>

<p>Population Control was the leading concern of the Club of Rome. Since 1972 the world has somehow managed to hit the lowest level of population growth the Club suggested was possible. (Check me on the stats given in Limits to Growth - a data wonk approach to what they predicted and what actually happened would be a great addition).</p>

<p>How did all the many and various environmental concerns get folded into one issue? In the old days (1970&#39;s thru 1990&#39;s), if you professed to be an &quot;environmentalist&quot; (as I did) you had a long list of concerns you could actively support. I will list a few of those I remember below.</p>

<p>Air and Water pollution, Recycling, Wilderness preservation, Species extinction, Food additives, Pesticide and herbicide use, Seed diversity, Monoculture of a few crops vs. plant diversity, Nuclear waste, Asbestos and radon contamination, Municipal wastewater treatment, Fresh water aquifers, Ozone depletion, and many  others (please continue with ones I missed here...)</p>

<p>You could be an environmentalist without having population control and CO2 emissions as your primary focus. I am in that camp - those two issues just don&#39;t convince me, although I am adamant about all the rest. But isn&#39;t it fascinating that all significant environmental action nowadays is co-opted into Climate Change?</p>

<p>Do we ever hear about these specific issues (which are still out there) in any measure as strongly as we get hit with the MSM heavy-handed and scary-as-can-be message about Climate Change?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what strikes me as really funny in a horrible way: Every one of those environmental issues could be addressed somehow. Through public pressure, awareness, grass-roots, old fashioned politics and legislation, every one of them could have been massively improved in the last 20 years, bit by bit. Instead we all got to focus on Global Warming and then Climate Change.</p>

<p>But how do you &quot;massively improve&quot; Climate Change? What does that even mean? Apparently the ONLY SOLUTION is an extensive global redistribution of wealth through some complicated carbon tax system, and an economically painful and difficult scaling back on carbon emissions - also requiring global regulation and oversight.</p>

<p>So where does that leave someone who sincerely wants freedom from oppression (as in the NWO), who wants a pristine environment, a healthy food-chain, and a robust, growing population (after all, who&#39;s going to colonize Mars?) </p>

<p>Out of luck?</p>

<p>...but such carbon tax is beyond silly, it&#39;s a sinister fraud because it would increase the price of energy by some 20%. We should aim for the opposite, that is amazingly cheap and abundant energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it&#39;s clear that this topic has been used as a pawn and used to push things like a carbon tax which really won&#39;t fix the problem, that doesn&#39;t make the underlying changes we&#39;re seeing any less of an issue. Species are dying off at alarming rates, the ocean is acidifying (and being bombarded with garbage and plastics and oil), and we&#39;re seeing extreme weather more frequently than any other time in recorded history. These are facts. Scientists use these facts to extrapolate trends, and it&#39;s worrying where we are headed all in the name of profit.</p>

<p>We know burning fossil fuels pollute, so why doesn&#39;t that knowledge alone push us to find alternative fuel sources as a country (hint: money)? Things that people do on an individual level to reduce their carbon footprint are great, but they are really only helping that individual feel better about things because they aren&#39;t enough to actually make a difference. Until we change policies (not necessarily a tax on carbon) on a corporate level things will just remain as they are.</p>

<p>Also, I saw OP mention subsidies but there was just an article (on here I think) about how <a href="http://billingsgazette.com/news/government-and-politics/hot-mic-records-troubling-conversation-about-solar-regulations/article_8499a49d-e281-5dd7-aae7-aecccfa0394e.html">in Montana those in government were messing with solar regulations in order to make small solar projects challenged to get funding</a>. So it already seems like there are people trying to tip the scales in their favor... again caring more about profit than taking care of the planet we live on. Sad.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m very heavy into growing my own food. I&#39;ve been an expert gardener for some years now. I&#39;m still relatively young at 28, but I learned early. </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve had to do in recent years is hand-pollinate my flowering vegetables because the bees are gone.</p>

<p>I hear you, though I modified your comment slightly. I think you are right in that it&#39;s being used in one way or another.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree, species do come and go. At what point, though, do we stop and say, &quot;Hey I think we&#39;re having an adverse affect, and that might cause a chain reaction, so let&#39;s re-evaluate our methods and consider a different way?&quot; For example, a recent study found that certain pesticides are directly correlated with the bee die-off, and that is certainly a problem for more than just the bees themselves (like how you tied it in with your gardening).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we have to stop using pesticides, but clearly we need to consider if there is a better delivery system or better way to get what we want without fucking up the rest of the world in the process. It just seems that the profit motive will continue to push for the old way until we are absolutely forced to change (e.g. Idiocracy when they had no choice but to switch to water because there was a major food shortage).</p>

<p>Much like someone else mentioned, being an environmentalist isn&#39;t just about CO<sup>2</sup> and climate — there are <strong>so many</strong> issues going on right now on the planet, and carbon emissions is just a piece of the puzzle. I find it interesting though, that it basically always comes back to profit as the motivator for these harmful practices causing environmental problems.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My main concern is that it doesn&#39;t get to the root of the problem and actually change harmful behavior. Honestly it feels like fighting fire with fire (or money with money in this case), especially because of how politicized taxes are in general. I don&#39;t think taxes are inherently bad, but this just seems like an ineffective way to go about it and reminds me of a quote by Einstein.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s like how corporations are allowed to skirt regulations and then are only fined for their reckless behavior and because for them proper procedures would cost more than the fine they know they&#39;ll get, it&#39;s more cost effective for them to keep doing things the harmful way (because it increases their profits). It&#39;s not exactly the same, but the corporate mindset is clearly not always going to do the humane thing or actually change root behavior/thinking simply because they are fined/taxed.</p>

<p>To me, choosing to tax something as a way to get people to stop using it is just causing more problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>A tax doesn&#39;t necessarily encourage a systemic/infrastructure change, which is what we need at this point in terms of switching from fossil fuels to cleaner, sustainable energy, otherwise we&#39;ll just keep going in circles (e.g. if a person doesn&#39;t have access to alternative transportation, they will never be able to reduce the amount of gas/emissions they produce from driving)</li>
<li>People who are already against taxes can dig in their heels and call out the politicization of the situation and thus not ever discuss the actual issues that are currently plaguing our environment.</li>
<li>Generally speaking taxes tend to affect those lower on the totem-pole that those at the top, so with no incentive to actually change, corporations would likely let the tax increases </li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, a carbon tax is only addressing one piece of the environment&#39;s destruction/abuse, but is so overshadowing that many talking heads (especially economists) say that the carbon tax will eventually encourage other industries to &quot;green up&quot; — sounds like they&#39;re proposing trickle down environmentalism. As I mentioned above about pollution through improper disposal/processing (or spills), this is a <strong>huge</strong> problem that isn&#39;t even considered when discussing a carbon tax, which is laughable. And don&#39;t get me started on all the waste (food, packaging, etc) we produce just here in the US. There are so many facets to this topic of pollution/environmental issues that a carbon tax is very reductive and seen as a panacea by many (when it&#39;s clearly not).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/11/03/environmentalists-argue-we-can-do-better-washington-carbon-tax">Here&#39;s an article that I found regarding why the Washington I-732 was defeated</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even Washington&#39;s chapter of the Sierra Club issued a statement against the proposal, arguing that Initiative 732 &quot;fails to affirmatively address any of the stated needs&quot; of communities of color and low-income people, that is, &quot;more investment in green jobs, energy efficiency, transit, housing, and renewable energy infrastructure.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my 2 cents. First, someone needs to fund it. We can&#39;t denounce the study based on who funded it, because who&#39;s ever going to fund important studies? What we should be concerned about however, is the publications of those studies without all data disclosure. We have learned that the studies aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the suppression of specific data that allows them to skew their results. So all studies should have real time disclosure of data as the study progresses, so they can&#39;t suppress any data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just described taxes and government. We already pay money. They already have agencies responsible for oversight of these areas, so one would assume they are studying what they are overseeing.  Though since we can&#39;t trust their results for one reason or another, than your idea may be necessary,  but if it got to that you would also have to conduct the study yourselves, because it can&#39;t be certain where the suppression could take place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, my point was to decentralize it. You&#39;re right that what I described is government and oversight and agency appropriation. But it has become corrupted like anything does over time. Money and special interest creeps in, so we must build a way to combat that. Crony capitalism and regulatory capture have infected out governmental processes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oil industry is by far more profitable and entrenched in the American political system than the green power movement ever could be...and that fact is a direct result of decades of lobbying, subsidies, and out-right suppression of green alternatives in order to benefit Big Oil. </p>

<p>The status quo since the Industrial Revolution has been anti-regulation, anti-worker, anti-environment, pro-business, pro-industry, and pro-Big Oil. Just because climate change has broader cultural appeal than ever before doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the status quo by any means. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take any limited ecosystem, and there is an opportunity to saturate or starve it. Take a water system like a pond, or river, these can be over-fished to where the fish disappear, or so much toxic waste dumped into it consistently that it becomes uninhabitable for animals or plants and all life using it moves away or dies. </p>

<p>Same with land, it can become over-farmed and no longer grow anything, animals can become over-hunted and go extinct. </p>

<p>Part of our heritage as growing human societies was to learn how to A. move around so we&#39;re not constantly using up the same sources, or B. outsource, and even those locations needed breaks from time to time, so outsource to multiple locations.</p>

<p>And yet we&#39;re still growing, still expanding and boosting consumption.</p>

<p>The planet is a closed ecosystem, or rather a huge collection of ecosystems forming the closed biosphere. </p>

<p>Is it so <em>unreasonable</em> to assume the same effects we have on smaller ecosystems would scale up to planet-size eventually? </p>

<p>In the end, everything related to combating global warming whether it&#39;s completely true, or completely false, is an attempt to create cleaner energy that doesn&#39;t rely on exhaustible sources. This is a result we will have to reach eventually. Oil will run out, coal will run out, gas will run out ... the sun on the other hand, I guess technically it will too, but you see what I&#39;m saying: The sun, water, wind ... these don&#39;t disappear just because we&#39;re using them to create energy.</p>
