        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit&#39;s been rough to navigate for a long time now. Well, more like shit. The US election has pretty much ruined the experience for anyone browsing <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> without HEAVY filtering.</p>

<p>(I&#39;m a liberal - I won&#39;t deny it. My experiences are biased.)</p>

<ul>
<li>First I was excited by all the Sanders spam, but worried because I knew it was too good to ever be real (I knew he would get fucked by the system some way). </li>
<li>Then <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> literally only posted about the current election and that was a sign of bad things to come. There was no more local politics, no more obscure things happening, it was just all election. The election is very important but the comments are always the <strong>SAME</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> EXPLODES, using vote manipulation and pretty much gaming the system to be an omnipresent force through <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. I hated that part the most, mostly because all I saw was lots of hatred and less &quot;here&#39;s my stances on x and why Mr. Trump and I align.&quot; The anti-TD subs rise as a result.</li>
<li><a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> censors the Pulse nightclub shooting of 50+ people, all comments removed typically referencing islam or more importantly, any sort of evidence that suggests motives related to the shooting. This pushes all that discussion onto alt-right platforms, giving them a huge boost.</li>
<li>Correct the Record becomes known throughout all of reddit. I personally don&#39;t believe they had nearly as strong of an influence as some expected, but the mere existence of them made a large amount of redditors resort to <strong>shill accusations</strong> instead of presenting arguments. Why argue against a bot? Just call a shill a shill and move on, basically making arguments end at &quot;label a person then decide the worth of continuing.&quot; Shitty practice for healthy discussions.</li>
<li><a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> continues to wage war against reddit and the admins finally get involved in this mess. Algorithm changes take place to make sure those kinds of subreddits can&#39;t game the system anymore, but this just straight up fucks one subreddit. T_D is pissed, somewhat rightfully so. Now the war is on reddit itself.</li>
<li>The admins continue to censor and remove growing alt-right platforms on reddit (sprinkles of liberal ones too), leading up to the grand Spezgiving. Spez edits &quot;FUCK <a href="/u/SPEZ">/u/SPEZ</a>&quot; comments to replace his name with the names of moderators, <strong>destroying reddit&#39;s credibility</strong>.</li>
<li>Leading us up to recent events, where echo-chambers are now the norm. Arguments almost always end in &quot;This is why leftists lose&quot; or &quot;fuck off racist.&quot; People are tired of arguing the same points they believe in 100% and just keep regurgitating the same garbage. I&#39;m guilty of this too sadly.</li>
<li>And now CNN, a highly attacked news source, literally threatens one of us for posting a gif that puts them in a bad light. Reddit doesn&#39;t take this lightly, we fucking rage. Look, the guy&#39;s a racist. No doubt. But doxxing? There&#39;s pretty much no greater injustice one could perform on the internet other than spreading child porn.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see reddit come together for the things that matter most, <strong><em>FREE SPEECH and PRIVACY</em></strong>, makes me smile. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/6lbh08/cnn_discovers_identity_of_reddit_user_behind/">The mods didn&#39;t even remove the thread!</a> I never once today felt like &quot;maybe this is a shill&quot; or &quot;what the fuck dude.&quot; Doxxing, threatening and harassing people is not ok. </p>

<p>Power demands responsibility, CNN. To quote /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/6lbh08/cnn_discovers_identity_of_reddit_user_behind/djsnd27/">Bearcat_Wombat</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Private citizens don&#39;t have the right to directly administer &quot;consequences&quot; to their peers. There is no justice at the hands of an angry mob.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If reddit can put aside their differences again, we may have a light of hope for a unified cause like SOPA once more. Stay informed and keep calling out bullshit.</p>
