    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s simply business. MSM and at this point any journalistic entity survives on clicks and views. Sex, war, fear, etc. have the most universal appeal and bring in the money/ ratings. A side effect may be the lowered state, but the driving force is simply an industry making money with the most &quot;attrative&quot; content possible. </p>

<p>Reddit then is just an aggregation of these stories. I mean making it to front page Reddit, it better be flashy or cool, otherwise it&#39;s not making it there in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the front page of Reddit right now. You see a handful of NSFW gifs of women (sex), and handful about North Korea&#39;s latest missile launch (war/ fear), polarizing politics (not mentioned above, but drives viewership and is obviously used by MSM), etc. </p>

<p>Reddit has a different filter to the front page in that it&#39;s not a news organization, but a group of generally well educated middle class white dudes. <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/">http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/</a></p>

<p>Still, the same type of sensationalist content makes the front page of Reddit easily. MSM understands these base appeals and capitalizes off them. But they are a group of companies out to make money first and foremost. Or I guess it could be a worldwide conspiracy to feature that type of content for an elaborate psychological gain Where the rich thereby remain in power by distracting all of us. It may happen to work in their favor that way, but again that&#39;s because that same content makes $$$$</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you changed the argument again.  And you linked to a news article about users, not the owners or mods.  Also, my frontpage has ZERO NSFW gifs AND nothing about the missile launch either, just one article about Erdogan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not countering any of these arguments by just saying the same thing over and over. I think you&#39;re having to think outside the box and it&#39;s not going well. </p>

<p>Front page ~40 mins ago still had all of that content, try to grasp the concept of time passing between my posting and your reading. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t link the mods? That&#39;s the best you have? Every sub has different mods, so it would be pointless. You&#39;ve had 3 responses at this point and haven&#39;t even constructed an argument. I hate to break it to you, but repeating wrong multiple times doesn&#39;t work in a &quot;logic&quot; based argument. I didn&#39;t contradict myself, and like all your points they come with no support just the accusation. How does it contradict? Try harder lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you say there is NO conspiracy, and say &quot;it works that way&quot;, which means conspiracy. Also, war is not cool.  Let&#39;s hold a poll on the frontpage.  Is war cool???  Zero percent fucking chance on that being above 50%.  I&#39;d guess around 10% or so would say that.  Done here.  Weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think humanity as a whole is in the lowered state. When I try to speak about something out of the box, people just stare at me like I&#39;m an alien. People are just not interested in this information cause: 
 a)They can&#39;t prove it&#39;s real so it&#39;s better not to waste time while you have to worry about earning money and have a social life.<br/>
b) People want to gossip and look at stuff that reassures their way of thinking, so, either they look at successful people to try to get guidance, or look at &quot;losers&quot; to feel better about themselves.</p>
