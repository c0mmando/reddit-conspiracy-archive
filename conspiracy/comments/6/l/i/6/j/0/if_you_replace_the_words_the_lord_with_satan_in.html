       You'd be changing God's word to fit a different narrative. The Bible was written as God's word. Changing it is actually what Satan does, it's how he deceives people into denying God, that's all your doing here.

       I have enough faith in me to know that there is an all knowing, all powerful God, I just don't think we should be following any books that were written by Human beings, Jesus Christ being the exception but Jesus Christ did not write the bible. I think we would all be better off following only Christs words.

       Religion is the end of love and honesty, the beginning of confusion; faith is a colorful hope or fear, the origin of folly. ~ Tao Te Ching
      </p>
      <p>
       Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith ... we need believing people. ~ Adolf Hitler

       A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything. ~ Nietzsche

       Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of awesome mystical power. We know this because they manage to be invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them. ~ Steve Eley

       Faith is belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel. ~ Ambrose Bierce

       Christ said that the old testament was spoken by him.  So if we follow Christ's words, we have to believe that the old testament was spoken by God.

       I believe in Christs commandments, 'Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' There is too many stories in the Bible that are there to confuse. Jesus' words should be the basis for humanity but I believe there are evil forces at work in this world trying to make the human race forget that we all are actually working towards a common goal and that the bottom line is no matter how many physical differences there are between us we are all biologically the same.

       Those laws were both given in the old testament.  To love the LORD thy God is the first of the ten commandments in Exodus 20.  Love thy neighbor as thyself is from Leviticus 19.  Those laws, while perfect, aren't much of a guide when there are people that think raping children is love.  You can't just say "love, love, love" and expect everything to work out because the wicked and depraved have a distorted view of what love is.  The rest of the Bible is needed in order to instruct one on how to love God and how to love one's neighbor.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if we're biologically the same (which the Bible teaches we are, as it is written, God has made of one blood all nations of the earth), it matters whether we're spiritually the same.  It is the spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing.  What fellowship hath Christ with Belial?  One of the purposes of the Bible is to be a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.  If you throw it away, you are going to be blind to the truth.  Unable to discern that which is good from that which is evil.

       If you look at the evil satan did and compare it with what evil god has done, your god is much more evil than your satan.

       I know that your god killed everyone on earth but noah and friends. for some stupid reason that didn't change anything.

       I know that your god killed all the first born in egypt . . . really? all those bad babies!

       What did satan do, oh yeah, offered jesus food and water when jesus was starving himself. OMG how evil is offering water to a thirsty man?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I know your god killed a bunch of children for making fun of a bald man. So loving your god is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say your god is all powerful. If I had much more food and water than I could ever use, and I walked past a starving baby and did not give the baby food, What would you think of me. Your god does that thousands of times daily.
      </p>

       I don't miss god at all, but I sure miss santa claus.

       But that's what Satan wants you to think - that he is the good guy.

       That's essentially the element of secret societies.

       But God is the mainstream religion. What if satan was demonized to protect God's evil reign over man? Satan is a banished fallen angel (declared such by God himself by the way) thats why he can't help with world hunger and such. God was able to defeat satan - though not able to destroy him entirely - so he instead banishes him to another plane, where satan is unable to help save mankind from the tyrant God and his elitist minions. Jesus was the son of satan, imbued with some of satans power (as satan was banished therefore unable to directly affect events) and sent to save us from materialism that is what are world is based on. Jesus, whilst successful in a sense, ultimately failed because the teachings were ignored, interpreted wrongly and Government/Capitalism became the new God.

       You know how I know God is the right choice?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Since I have started following the bible my life is 2000000 times better.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) God has standards. Satan doesn't. Standards usually mean you love someone. I have standards for my students, and I will for my future children. I have standards in relationships. God has loving standards for us. Satan does not.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Jesus is real. Jesus explains how to reach God. God is NOT Satan and Satan cannot be a God.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Look at our society right now. It is satanic and gross and only going to get worse.

       4) Yes and God is mainstream, Satan is considered evil. The proof is in the pudding as they say.

       1) We should neither deny them, nor hold them as truths.

      <p>
       2) I have read the bible multiple times. The God displayed is volatile, unpredictable and above his own sacred laws (Also able to suspend the laws for others). Then a messenger is sent to offer a different version of the OT God, One of forgiveness, compassion and acceptance. That fits into my day dream satan theory as the two Gods are different.

       3)Again I am looking for proof he was the Son of God not that he existed as a person. There are many prophets of jesus' stature in other religions who I am sure existed aswell.

       I can relate to finding religion when in bad circumstances. I became religious at one of my lowest points (Though I'm sure there is room for more

As I was walking along the beach with my Lord.

For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand,
One belonging to me and one to my Lord.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the last scene of my life flashed before me,
I looked back at the footprints in the sand.
I noticed that at many times along the path of my life,
especially at the very lowest and saddest times,
there was only one set of footprints.

       This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it.

You'd walk with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life,
there was only one set of footprints.
I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me."

       You still haven't been very clear on where you stand regarding liquorice allsorts. I could never in good conscious "Bond" with someone who like allsorts.

       Looks like a pep talk for war. A bit later, moses says "we should go into that country over there, take everything, call it Israel, and kill anyone who disagrees, because God just told me that it's OK!"

       Majority of the bible is how to be an obedient servant and fight for your monarch king on earth (because he has been ordained as a ruler by G). The Bible is the literal propaganda that was used by the ruling elites to justify their place as rulers for the past 1500 years. They need to re-write it to be more effectual propaganda for the post-democracy capitalist modern slave to relate to.
