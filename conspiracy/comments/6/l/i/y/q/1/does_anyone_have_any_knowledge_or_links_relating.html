    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the links. It seems like most of them cover only the simulation theory which I am already pretty read up on. I&#39;m really hoping for some something that talks about the rssltionship of modern religion and simulation theory. </p>

<p>It seems like there is not much info on the overlapping areas of religion and simulation. Even though it is argued about in religious comunities at least the one I grew up in. </p>

<p>If I over looked something which I may have let me know. I&#39;m going to reread the sources just to be sure. </p>

<p>The subreddits r/holofractal and r/C_S_T are rich sources of material inspiring the concept. A discussion of the <em>cognitive theoretical model of the universe</em>, which is the most thorough theoretical justification I&#39;ve found for these ideas, can be found in the sub r/CTMU. A great library of &quot;weird&quot; personal experiences can be found in r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix.  The r/DimensionalJumping subreddit has some good exercises to try, if they are understood within the proper context.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only found a handleful of books. All of them claim to be a psychic channeling and each has a big story behind it. </p>

<p>Urantia is probabaly the best book. It&#39;s 2000 pages and covers the way diety and the universe functions, the exact evolution from pre-sun era to now, the social evolution from the first humans until now, information on similar alien planets, information on particles and physics related stuff, and finally the entire life of Jesus from start to finish (the extended cut). The Bible only covers about 10% of Jesus life. This book covers jesus end to end from pre-birth to post-death. This book I see a difficult read but if you can get through it, your whole life will change. </p>

<p>If you want an easy read, conversations with God (9 books set/3200 pages) is the basic version of Urantia but it more focuses on the secrets of the mind, the secrets of society, and the secrets of diety. This book is really fun because it&#39;s  so easy to follow but yet so utterly deep. This book is a life changer too. </p>

<p>Whats amazing is that the few sources I found all say the same thing and the thing said is unknown in our society. These books are incomparable to anything I&#39;ve ever seen in media. Also, people who read these books say it&#39;s like hitting the lotto. The secrets inside are so utterly valuable that they help the readers in every single aspect of life imaginable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The books say that God never created the devil like we think of it meaning there is no negative force whatsoever. What God did was create an ascension system where beings in the lowest levels can become corrupted and insane.  Lucifer, Satan, and calagastia the devil were 3 different low level beings who caused a massive rebellion that blew the earth into darkness. These beings are even higher than man so rebellion has only happened a few times but mankind is so low on the scale and easily influenced by the false promises of dark power. </p>

<p>Moloch might be a separate real rebel under Lucifer but Lucifer was the king of the rebellion. He was the highest ranking being in the political spectrum of the local universe of 400 planets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is 100% correct. The book says knowing and experiencing are 2 separate things. God can easily know but by experiencing, it really stays with him. The human experience has to stay with him. It has to be real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is omniscient but there is a distinct difference from imagining being a homeless person to actually experiencing being a homeless person while not remembering ones own origins. </p>

<p>It seems all about the effect it has in the spirit and mind. For example, God is a homeless man named Mark. Mark suffers for 50 years because he&#39;s not equipped with the knowledge god has. Once Mark dies, he is suddenly thrust into &quot;heaven&quot; where he is suddenly a much high being. This experience from going from homelessness to great glory gives mark an amazing effect. It&#39;s almost like a homeless man winning the lotto but much better than that even. Mark, in the afterlife, isn&#39;t God just like Mark isn&#39;t really God on earth. It will be countless ages before God reforms as the one being. Until then, God descends down to particles and works his way back up to god. That&#39;s the adventure. It&#39;s a slow process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand how you might think that this is a contradiction but you have to understand that God uses causes to product desired effects just like we do here with Cause and Effect. The power of God isn&#39;t magic. There are limitations (not much but they exist). </p>

<p>The general idea is for God to break up like a giant jigsaw puzzle of all kinds of variety. Although the God head still exists in true form, the Eternal Son breaks up like a jigsaw and each of the parts experiences itself individually while exploring the other parts of God simultaneously. This makes life much more interesting than if God just remained as 1 single person. Now ask yourself, &quot;Why would God break up into multiple parts for fun? Why doesn&#39;t he just imagine it?&quot; It is because the experience itself is way better than just imagining. Doesn&#39;t he know what it would feel like to be broken up in many parts? Of course he does. There are no surprises to God. He can see the future in its entirety. But humans can&#39;t see the future. Why? Because some of God&#39;s parts have to live under an unpredictable future since being able to see the entirety of future causes God&#39;s mind to lose power. He solved this problem by having multiple experiences where he can&#39;t see the future. </p>

<p>God can pretend to be homeless but he knows its fake. A real homeless human believes its real when its actually fake. God doesn&#39;t want to be homeless but he had to create a system where he would be able to experience unworthy feelings like pain, suffering, ect.. so that those feelings can later be used to compare to Godly feelings (peace, fun, unity, love, freedom) and by comparing the 2 together, the godly feelings become way better. (When we see the bad, we more appreciate the good). God knows what all these things feel like but God always maximizes on it&#39;s own potential and to maximize on the potential of using the bad to appreciate the good, one has to actually experience the bad. Also, bad comes in many degrees and levels. Earth would be considered almost at the bottom of the bucket. </p>

<p>There&#39;s much more to this. Each person is on their own ascension process climbing themselves back up to God. Every single sentient being would have to climb to the very top for the entire system to absorb into itself and become God again. All those parts are independently experiencing all of this individually on their own evolutionary path. So God takes the role of the Godhead plus the role of the people in a very realistic way so that it seems that more than 1 person exists. Everything both is and isn&#39;t God. Ultimately, everything is God but since humans, for example, as so much weaker and dumber than God, its not really God. Its God experiencing being a human being. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all very complicated. As I was saying, the whole thing would take 15 hours to explain verbally but once its all explained and every detail mapped out to the core, its makes perfect symmetrical sense. If you don&#39;t hear the whole story, each answer I toss at you will only bring up more questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tom Campbell describes a physics delayed choice experiment, long posited but only recently achievable (2015?), that gives evidence to support the &quot;probabilistic&quot; model of physical reality, as opposed to the orthodox &quot;materialistic&quot; model. This model also solves the paradox of the &quot;double slit&quot; experiment.</p>

<p>Briefly, the model says that every point in space exists simply as the probability of being either a wave or a particle as opposed to the current view that basically says it must be one or the other.</p>

<p>Tom sees this as evidence that we&#39;re in some kind of virtual reality universe and uses the video game analogy to make the point. In a video game, when a character is moving through the world, the &quot;particles&quot; (pixels) that make up the character aren&#39;t physically there, moving around. Instead, every point (coordinate) in the game world can be any type of particle/pixel (the character&#39;s limb for example) at any time, depending on the circumstances and rules of the game world (universe). In other words, when the character moves his limb in the game, at the coordinates where the limb is moving toward the correct particles/pixels that make up his limb will spontaneously appear, while the coordinates where the limb used to be will spontaneously disappear (or go back to being &quot;empty&quot; space, or air).</p>

<p>From an observers perspective, it&#39;s logical to think that the characters limb is made up of physical particles/pixels that move within the world, but that&#39;s why the analogy of the video game world is so powerful because we&#39;re able to conceptualize the idea that in such a world, the creator of the game could have every coordinate of the game change to whatever he wants (put in the game cheat code and you can teleport or whatever).</p>

<p>So think about that the next time you move your arm. Your armnis not a physical entity made of particles moving through space, instead as you move your arm the exactly correct particles in the exact positions you would expect spontaneously appear and disappear, according to the rules of our universe, giving you the impression of a physical arm moving.</p>

<p>He goes on to describe and analyze the implications of this model, and how it relates to conciousness, God, CERN being a fraud, etc. I&#39;m definitely not doing it justice so you&#39;ll have to watch, but I found it mind blowing!</p>
