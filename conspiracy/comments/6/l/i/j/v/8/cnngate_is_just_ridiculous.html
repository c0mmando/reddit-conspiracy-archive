<p>Don&#39;t misunderstand me:  HanSolo seems to be a racist asshole and probably deserves whatever meat-space shit is rolling towards him due to his own bad karma.  But CNN should not be, nor should it ever have been, the angel responsible for delivering that karma.  CNN also deserves whatever shit is rolling towards it.  </p>

<p>But if you examine the whole sad affair under a microscope, and then step back and look at it with a telescope, it starts to feel-less than-organic, or at least the right shitstorm in a teacup to exploit to advance a deeper agenda.</p>

<p>to me it simply seems like a good way to keep people off point.  think about it, a major scandal with a catholic priest and the very next day this becomes the next internet sensation.  Fucking pizzagate folks should have been all over that....and in years past, it would have been major news.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like anything is going to happen to CNN over this, although i do like that the mods banned direct links from those pricks.</p>

<p>no I get that.  The deep conspiracy should have stood up against Clinton when it was ousted that she conspired against (or with) Sanders.  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is, you don&#39;t hear to much about the DNC rigging suit in the news, but whoa, look at this drama we can all get behind.</p>

<p>sorry mate, i could give two fucks about this when the real change to the deep state would come from the country focusing on the rigging of the DNC which we all know happens on the other side of the aisle as well.</p>

<p>Are you really surprised that CNN would stoop to this level and it get the greatest media attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s always an issue, however what is happening here is political theater.  We can all agree that CNN will have no repercussions or &#39;real&#39; repercussions about this.</p>

<p>So while everyone has their panties in a bunch about this perhaps our attention should all be focused on stopping the american war machine from decimating another country and another 10-20 trillion dollars.  that money and the end of all the senseless killings would probably stop media giants, like CNN, from working as a propaganda machine for good ol unkie sam.</p>

<p>Now you aren&#39;t wrong with your question and that is not what anyone is saying.  Think about it man, if this is what the media is talking about, then that is exactly what they want.  they don&#39;t want you to hear that trump dropped some bombs on a country that obama and bush dropped a shit load of bombs on. They don&#39;t want you to hear that our country is in desperate financial times and yet we waste money on bombs which the profit goes straight to the elite.  better yet, openly rigging our &#39;democratic elections&#39;.  </p>

<p>just saying mate, this is r/conspiracy.  it&#39;s our job to question the main stream narrative and not join the lynch mobs...yet...and that is what this CNN bullshit feels like, like a major psyop to direct us elsewhere.</p>
