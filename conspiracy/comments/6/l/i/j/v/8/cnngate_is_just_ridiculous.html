       It's a conspiracy sub taking action against a multi-billion dollar news agency conspiring to strong arm a citizen with the threat of doxxing he and his family because he made a post they didn't like. They aren't banned, their content can be posted through archive, we are just refusing to financially support these assholes because that is the power we have to fight corruption. It's a sub reddit boycott. If you disagree with it or are worried about CNNs financial stability, feel free to post thier links to other subs as frequently as possible to make up for the blow.

       Don't misunderstand me:  HanSolo seems to be a racist asshole and probably deserves whatever meat-space shit is rolling towards him due to his own bad karma.  But CNN should not be, nor should it ever have been, the angel responsible for delivering that karma.  CNN also deserves whatever shit is rolling towards it.

       to me it simply seems like a good way to keep people off point.  think about it, a major scandal with a catholic priest and the very next day this becomes the next internet sensation.  Fucking pizzagate folks should have been all over that....and in years past, it would have been major news.

       no I get that.  The deep conspiracy should have stood up against Clinton when it was ousted that she conspired against (or with) Sanders.

       sorry mate, i could give two fucks about this when the real change to the deep state would come from the country focusing on the rigging of the DNC which we all know happens on the other side of the aisle as well.

       The sheep need distraction. Things like this keep the left and right fighting each other over political theater.

       I never said it was. I was referring to CNNgate as a whole and not the underlying constitutional issue it brought up.  Trump made a ridiculous click bate-y tweet and CNN gave an equally ridiculous response and the whole situation is meant to distract and manipulate both sides of the issue.

       it's always an issue, however what is happening here is political theater.  We can all agree that CNN will have no repercussions or 'real' repercussions about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while everyone has their panties in a bunch about this perhaps our attention should all be focused on stopping the american war machine from decimating another country and another 10-20 trillion dollars.  that money and the end of all the senseless killings would probably stop media giants, like CNN, from working as a propaganda machine for good ol unkie sam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you aren't wrong with your question and that is not what anyone is saying.  Think about it man, if this is what the media is talking about, then that is exactly what they want.  they don't want you to hear that trump dropped some bombs on a country that obama and bush dropped a shit load of bombs on. They don't want you to hear that our country is in desperate financial times and yet we waste money on bombs which the profit goes straight to the elite.  better yet, openly rigging our 'democratic elections'.
      </p>
      <p>
       just saying mate, this is r/conspiracy.  it's our job to question the main stream narrative and not join the lynch mobs...yet...and that is what this CNN bullshit feels like, like a major psyop to direct us elsewhere.

       What is happening here is the public having witnessed a threatened "burning at the stake" of an individual because he posted a satirical video meme on a social website that "insulted" a news mogal.
