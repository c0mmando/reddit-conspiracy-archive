        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">15</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-07-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/synchromystic.html">synchromystic</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I just realized that the argument most commonly proposed for mandatory immunizations/vaccinations, i.e. &#39;herd immunity&#39;, is the same argument that is commonly used to justify open/concealed carry (in principle). </p>

<p>You see, the idea behind herd immunity is that if a large amount of the population becomes immunized for x virus, x virus will have a hard time coming into contact with, and therefore infecting, unvaccinated members of the population, who, for medical reasons, could not be vaccinated in the first place. And this works because, theoretically, those who have been immunized create something akin to a &#39;barrier of impermeability&#39; which hinders the propagation of x virus. </p>

<p>Now, the same can be said with the idea of concealed carry or even open carry. If we replace the idea of a &#39;x virus&#39; with the idea of &#39;x mass shooter,&#39; then we can utilize the same principle that we utilized before in the idea of &#39;herd immunity,&#39; i.e. if enough people are armed (vaccinated), it will make it harder for the attacker to make his way to the unarmed (unvaccinated) citizens. Thus, an armed majority will have effectively created a &#39;barrier of impermeability&#39; between the potential gunman and his victims. Therefore in conclusion, the idea of &#39;herd immunity&#39;, or more specifically the <em>blueprint</em> of this idea, is essentially the same reasoning often used justify the idea of open/concealed carry. All you have to do is replace &#39;viruses&#39; with &#39;attackers&#39; and &#39;immunized citizens&#39; with &#39;armed citizens.&#39;</p>

<p>Now the implication: if herd immunity is a scientifically valid concept, and if an armed populace is the same idea in principle, why is herd immunity considered to be good, while at the same time, an armed populace is considered to be bad?</p>

<p>Of course, this idea is merely for discussion&#39;s sake. I just wanted to know your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting perspective! </p>

<p>A few differences jump out at me. The big one is that herd immunity is easier and safer to achieve than &quot;armed populace immunity,&quot; to coin a label. Standardized vaccines get immunity rates up into the 90s easily and with very, very few side effects. (Based on my study of the VICP and post-licensure safety studies conducted by independent researchers.) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many people would have to be armed to achieve some threshold of API, but it would likely entail arming people who frankly I would rather not carry publicly. I don&#39;t go to the range often, but I do shoot sometimes, and damn, some people are more into the idea of carrying/using a gun than they are into the boring details of how to do it safely. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a huge public safety risk for safe, reasonable gun owners to carry, but if we were to ramp up the number of carriers that might change.</p>

<p>Another difference is the reliability of the respective immunities. Herd immunity just plain works--we&#39;ve actually eliminated entire diseases, and made others vanishingly rare. Has comprehensive carry eliminated crime anywhere? I think the effect concealed carry has on crime rates is still disputed, whereas no experts dispute the utility of herd immunity (that I&#39;m aware of). </p>

<p>Interesting analogy though!</p>

<p>Suzanna Hupp  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanna_Hupp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanna_Hupp</a>) and her parents were having lunch at the Luby&#39;s Cafeteria in Killeen in 1991 when a mass shooting took place. The gunman, George Hennard, shot 44 people in all, killing 24 of them, including himself. The fatally wounded included both of Hupp&#39;s parents. Hupp later expressed regret about deciding to remove her gun from her purse and lock it in her car, lest she risk possibly running afoul of the state&#39;s concealed weapons laws; during the shootings, she reached for her weapon but then remembered that it was &quot;a hundred feet away in my car.</p>

<p>I really haven&#39;t studied this question, and don&#39;t have a strong opinion. I&#39;m opposed to gun bans for legal/liberty reasons; I&#39;ve yet to see really good evidence that more guns and/or fewer guns prevent crime to a large degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting comparison!  i&#39;d say you&#39;ve identified a metric.  the &quot;capacity of the cohort to defend itself in a distributed way&quot; metric.  herd immunity is a real thing - it can be predicted using contagious rates - it&#39;s just a math concept relating to transmissibility.  it is a valid concept.  what the contagion rate of someone with a gun is - that&#39;s an interesting number to imagine.  it could model out to provide some predictions as to how many people should carry percentage wise.  </p>

<p>i don&#39;t think it&#39;s completely analogous to the contagion model - that would be more along the lines of &quot;how many times could someone with a gun fabricate another gun to pass along&quot;.   </p>
