       So I just realized that the argument most commonly proposed for mandatory immunizations/vaccinations, i.e. 'herd immunity', is the same argument that is commonly used to justify open/concealed carry (in principle).
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the idea behind herd immunity is that if a large amount of the population becomes immunized for x virus, x virus will have a hard time coming into contact with, and therefore infecting, unvaccinated members of the population, who, for medical reasons, could not be vaccinated in the first place. And this works because, theoretically, those who have been immunized create something akin to a 'barrier of impermeability' which hinders the propagation of x virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the same can be said with the idea of concealed carry or even open carry. If we replace the idea of a 'x virus' with the idea of 'x mass shooter,' then we can utilize the same principle that we utilized before in the idea of 'herd immunity,' i.e. if enough people are armed (vaccinated), it will make it harder for the attacker to make his way to the unarmed (unvaccinated) citizens. Thus, an armed majority will have effectively created a 'barrier of impermeability' between the potential gunman and his victims. Therefore in conclusion, the idea of 'herd immunity', or more specifically the
       <em>
        blueprint
       </em>
       of this idea, is essentially the same reasoning often used justify the idea of open/concealed carry. All you have to do is replace 'viruses' with 'attackers' and 'immunized citizens' with 'armed citizens.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the implication: if herd immunity is a scientifically valid concept, and if an armed populace is the same idea in principle, why is herd immunity considered to be good, while at the same time, an armed populace is considered to be bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this idea is merely for discussion's sake. I just wanted to know your thoughts.

      <p>
       Interesting perspective!
      </p>
      <p>
       A few differences jump out at me. The big one is that herd immunity is easier and safer to achieve than "armed populace immunity," to coin a label. Standardized vaccines get immunity rates up into the 90s easily and with very, very few side effects. (Based on my study of the VICP and post-licensure safety studies conducted by independent researchers.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how many people would have to be armed to achieve some threshold of API, but it would likely entail arming people who frankly I would rather not carry publicly. I don't go to the range often, but I do shoot sometimes, and damn, some people are more into the idea of carrying/using a gun than they are into the boring details of how to do it safely. I don't think it's a huge public safety risk for safe, reasonable gun owners to carry, but if we were to ramp up the number of carriers that might change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another difference is the reliability of the respective immunities. Herd immunity just plain works--we've actually eliminated entire diseases, and made others vanishingly rare. Has comprehensive carry eliminated crime anywhere? I think the effect concealed carry has on crime rates is still disputed, whereas no experts dispute the utility of herd immunity (that I'm aware of).
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting analogy though!

       "Backers of laws that let pretty much all law-abiding people carry concealed guns in public places often argue that these laws will sometimes enable people to stop mass shootings. Opponents occasionally ask: If that’s so, what examples can one give of civilians armed with guns stopping such shootings? Sometimes, I hear people asking if even one such example can be found, or saying that they haven’t heard of even one such example."

       Thanks. The challenge is that we can't detect instances of someone who would have shot someone but didn't because they didn't have/couldn't get a gun.

       ) and her parents were having lunch at the Luby's Cafeteria in Killeen in 1991 when a mass shooting took place. The gunman, George Hennard, shot 44 people in all, killing 24 of them, including himself. The fatally wounded included both of Hupp's parents. Hupp later expressed regret about deciding to remove her gun from her purse and lock it in her car, lest she risk possibly running afoul of the state's concealed weapons laws; during the shootings, she reached for her weapon but then remembered that it was "a hundred feet away in my car.

       People who are genuine serial murderers/Mass shooting candidates will not be detered by a law banning arms.

       Hmmm I was going to shoot a bunch of kids today but the law says I can't own a gun legally... Suppose I will just give it a miss then, let's see whats on the radio.

       I don't think it's about making people change their mind as much as making firearms less available, limiting the capacity to carry out their plans and restricting impulse shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really haven't studied this question, and don't have a strong opinion. I'm opposed to gun bans for legal/liberty reasons; I've yet to see really good evidence that more guns and/or fewer guns prevent crime to a large degree.

       interesting comparison!  i'd say you've identified a metric.  the "capacity of the cohort to defend itself in a distributed way" metric.  herd immunity is a real thing - it can be predicted using contagious rates - it's just a math concept relating to transmissibility.  it is a valid concept.  what the contagion rate of someone with a gun is - that's an interesting number to imagine.  it could model out to provide some predictions as to how many people should carry percentage wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't think it's completely analogous to the contagion model - that would be more along the lines of "how many times could someone with a gun fabricate another gun to pass along".

       i'm not arguing the legitimacy of herd immunity from vax AT ALL.  i'm arguing the mathematical predictive model of transmission and what certain thresholds are.  the vax thing is an entirely different ball of wax, mostly because the herd immunity math thresholds are almost never ever met within the cohort.  if immunity waned that would also fuck with those thresholds.  so yeah, i agree with you.

       Have you actually looked at that paper? It's pointing out that because measles is insanely contagious, and the measles vaccine isn't as effective as other vaccines, measles can't currently be eradicated like polio or smallpox. But herd immunity still works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying it's been "debunked" is pretty bizarre given that not a single epidemiologist agrees with you. Of the people who actually study this question, as far as I can tell 100% of them agree that herd immunity works.

       Nor do they disagree with what I said. The Supreme Court has struck down several blanket bans on ownership and carrying of guns, including DC and Chicago. They've also stated pretty clearly that you have at least a right to
