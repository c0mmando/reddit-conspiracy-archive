       You know, there is some deeper truth there really.  American culture values winning very highly.  We think that if you win, you are right.  Its why we fight and argue about everything.  I think its in our American DNA to think that if we win, were right and if we lose, we are wrong.

       You heave to distinguish two very different things. Does this law imply the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA corporation or the Sovereign Republic that is the United States of America. Because the former is a foreign Corporation unconstitutionally ruling over the latter.

       He himself is not a Free Mason to my knowledge. He has said that he has the protection of someone on the council of 33 though. Which is very interesting to say the least. True or false? I'm not sure. That being said, not all occult societies are "evil". There are white and black majick mystery schools.

       There are very few not directly under Masonic control. I recommend "Scarlet and the Beast" or Bill Cooper's "Mystery Babylon" for good breakdowns on this.

       Almost all of the white magic is either bullshit or under control of the Masons. Groups like Wicca, New Age, etc. are masonic.

       Yes, many of the well know ones are for a reason. However, there are hundreds if not thousands of societies that most people do not even know about. I'm also not talking about Wicca or New Age, those would fall into the black majick schools that we know about. Many of the white majick comes from the Far East.

       What is the Military Officer, a man of WAR, swearing to

       To his superior officers? To the President? To Congress? To the Supreme Court?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, his oath binds him in loyal service to ONE THING:

        <em>
         The Constitution of the United States
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and he is sworn to DEFEND the Constitution and the Principles it represents against ALL ENEMIES - some of which might, in theory, include those who would disregard, undermine or

        This concept traces back to the intentions of the Founding Fathers who created our governing system with a separation of powers and series of checks and balances between the three branches. This ensures no single branch or person gains too much power and becomes corrupted. By swearing allegiance to a set of ideals and laws, our military is not bound by the orders of a single person, but are dedicated to the defense of the people and their way of life.

        , especially at higher ranks, have a unique position of authority and influence within the organization that could be taken advantage of for political gain. Swearing loyalty

          to the Constitution
         </em>

        instead of the president or any other person means that officials cannot manipulate officers in order to gain control over the military and become dictators.

       I think there's a lot of possibility that some brave souls could attempt to not pay their taxes and sue the US gov't on the grounds that the US Gov't has seceded from the Union.  Given that Princeton has scientifically shown that the US Gov't isn't actually a democracy, it's an oligarchy it would then follow that the US Gov't doesn't represent the people of America.  Thus, by continuing to fraudulently hold office these members of government have implicitly stated their intent to exist outside the consititution, and have thus seceded from the Union.  A US government that has seceded from the union is not a real government and thus has no right to tax revenue.

       Q. If the Governing body
       <strong>
        <em>
         now
        </em>
       </strong>
       calling itself United States Government has
       <em>
        overstepped
       </em>
       its Authority by exercising powers that were NOT delegated to it under the US Constitution - the
       <strong>
        <em>
         Supreme Law of the Land
        </em>
       </strong>
       - can said body continue to claim
       <strong>
        <em>
         Legitimate Authority
        </em>
       </strong>
       under the Constitution, or has forfeited its Legitimate Authority?

       Q. Who retains the Power to determine whether the Governing body
       <strong>
        <em>
         now
        </em>
       </strong>
       calling itself United States Government is in fact Legitimate, and if it is found to have fallen into Illegitimacy, who retains the Right and the Power to enact any Corrective Measures that may be required to
       <em>
        restore
       </em>
       Constitutional Legitimacy?

       Have you ever studied, or even
       <strong>
        <em>
         read
        </em>
       </strong>
       the US Constitution and its Amendments? Surprisingly few Americans have, yet they BLINDLY TRUST that the leaders will obey and adhere to the limitations placed on them by this document.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://constitutionus.com/">
        <strong>
         Here a link to the Full US Constitution AND all of the Amendments thereto.
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not long - about 8,000 words (12-15 printed pages) - INCLUDING all Amendments, and the embedded annotations at the above link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read it. You may be surprised to find what is in there -
       <em>
        and perhaps more importantly, what isn't
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Every holder of Federal Office - from President to your local Mail Carrier is required to take an oath, swearing to "
       <strong>
        <em>
         support and defend the Constitution
        </em>
       </strong>
       " when taking office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that our leaders, the President, the Vice President our Senators and Representatives have read and studied the US Constitution and its Amendments? How many of these do you think could pass a simple, high-school level EXAM on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the subsequent Amendments?
      </p>
      <h1>
       Do you think they even care?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Then again, if you don't, why should they?

       They are somewhat correct, but it's not going to change anything. It's not like a judge is going to say "oh, you're right" and throw out your murder rap.
