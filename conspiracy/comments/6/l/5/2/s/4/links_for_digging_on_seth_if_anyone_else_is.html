<p>__________________________<strong><em>Therriault</em></strong>______________________________</p>

<p>Andrew Therriault - Director Of Data Science @ DNC Services Corporation and Democratic National Committee</p>

<p>June 1  “DNC data folks: Hillarys accusations are fucking bullshit, and I hope you understand the good you did despite that nonsense,”
“Private mode be damned, this is too important,” he added. “I’m not willing to let my people be thrown under the bus without a fight.”</p>

<p>Andrew worked at DNC and Greenberg Quinlan Rose with Seth
the day he said he was leaving is the date of the last leaked email
he said that although seth had recently been working as a programmer, that &quot;wasn&#39;t his background&quot;,
and another co-worker said Rich was very upset when he heard that hackers associated with Russian intelligence services 
had broken into the DNC computers and could be interfering with the election.  </p>

<p>Andrew moved to a 6 figure job in Boston in may 2016</p>

<p>real fly:- Kim Dotcom began alluding to Hillary&#39;s downfall in December of 2014, six months after Seth Rich joined the DNC. 
Was Rich feeding Wikileaks information since then - or did Julian Assange have other sources? What made Kim Dotcom so confident? </p>

<p>Dmitri Alperovitch was one of the minor online voices supporting the idea that the 2008 cyber attacks against Georgia were some kind of Russian plot.
Back then, he was in charge of intelligence analysis at Secure Computing Corporation, a cybersecurity company that also made censorship tools 
used by countries like Saudi Arabia. He&#39;s now running his own big shop. Google was a major investor in CrowdStrike</p>

<p>Matt Tait, a former GCHQ analyst and founder of Capital Alpha Security who blogs under the influential Twitter handle @pwnallthethings,
found document leaked by Guccifer 2.0.  he discovered that it had been edited by Felix Edmundovich—a.k.a. Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka. 
CrowdStrike went into frenetic PR mode. The company released a series of cyber-attribution reports </p>

<p>According to Joel Rich, Seth Rich also made a call to another friend that lasted around 12 minutes, this friend also remains anonymous.
joel is a Senior Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman.</p>

<p>Rich&#39;s girlfriend Kelsey Mulka works at the Institute for International Education ... IIE is involved in administering Fulbright program ... and has ties to the Clinton Foundation</p>

<p>Seth Rich wasn&#39;t at all worried about people coming after him if he was the leaker? He just decided to take a stroll through DC </p>

<p>on the condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by cyberbullies a person who was close to Rich said 
He was so upset- &quot;Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’&quot; -That made him so angry.</p>

<p>He wasn’t the biggest drinker</p>

<p>The Clinton Campaign job was in Brooklyn. The girlfriend was in D.C. This was causing friction.
“He was having some problems with his girlfriend,” Capone said. “Mostly about moving away and seeing if they could survive it. He was upset.</p>

<p>Richard sulley &quot;anyone need a roomate in august, asking for a friend&quot; - Andrew &quot;i have some former staff heading to brooklyn, email me?&quot;
There was no lookout issued by Metro DC Police, which is SOP Standard Operating Procedure.. </p>

<p>Cathy Lanier, Washington D.C. Police Chief resigned 30 days after Seth Rich&#39;s Murder. She now makes 7 figures with NFL</p>

<p>the Assistant Police Chief of Metro DC Police resigned a month before Seth Rich&#39;s Murder citing Corruption as his reasons</p>
