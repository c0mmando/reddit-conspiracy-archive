       real fly:- Kim Dotcom began alluding to Hillary's downfall in December of 2014, six months after Seth Rich joined the DNC. 
Was Rich feeding Wikileaks information since then - or did Julian Assange have other sources? What made Kim Dotcom so confident?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dmitri Alperovitch was one of the minor online voices supporting the idea that the 2008 cyber attacks against Georgia were some kind of Russian plot.
Back then, he was in charge of intelligence analysis at Secure Computing Corporation, a cybersecurity company that also made censorship tools 
used by countries like Saudi Arabia. He's now running his own big shop. Google was a major investor in CrowdStrike
      </p>
      <p>
       Matt Tait, a former GCHQ analyst and founder of Capital Alpha Security who blogs under the influential Twitter handle @pwnallthethings,
found document leaked by Guccifer 2.0.  he discovered that it had been edited by Felix Edmundovich—a.k.a. Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka. 
CrowdStrike went into frenetic PR mode. The company released a series of cyber-attribution reports

       Rich's girlfriend Kelsey Mulka works at the Institute for International Education ... IIE is involved in administering Fulbright program ... and has ties to the Clinton Foundation
      </p>
      <p>
       Seth Rich wasn't at all worried about people coming after him if he was the leaker? He just decided to take a stroll through DC
      </p>
      <p>
       on the condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by cyberbullies a person who was close to Rich said 
He was so upset- "Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?’" -That made him so angry.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn’t the biggest drinker
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton Campaign job was in Brooklyn. The girlfriend was in D.C. This was causing friction.
“He was having some problems with his girlfriend,” Capone said. “Mostly about moving away and seeing if they could survive it. He was upset.

       This claim is made by Robbin Young, an actress who engaged in private DM's Guccifer 2.0 :

       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       Robbin claimed Ed Butowsky threatened her with physical harm for her speaking out about the Seth Rich murder and to stay away from from the story. She claimed that this happened over a phone-call that took place between the two of them. She also claims Burkman was working together with them in some regard.
