        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The House of Bonaparte still covertly govern France. They are backed up by Rome and the Italian Nobility which have deep connections to France. Napoleon Bonaparte was really the first political Zionist who proclaimed for all the Jews to settle in Jerusalem while he was in power. Napoleon also established the Legion of Honour which is headed by the President of France who also holds the title of Honorary Canon of the Papal Archbasilica of St. John which is the ecclesiastical seat of the Pope. Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte III was the first President of France. Emmanuel Macron is President of France and was Jesuit educated and worked for the Rothschild bank. Bernard Arnault who is worth over 50 billion is a Knight of the Legion of Honour. Patrick Pouyanne is CEO and Chairman of the major oil company Total and he is also a Knight of Legion of Honour. Alan Greenspan is a Knight of the Legion of Honour and was Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Many members of the European Round Table of Industrialists are French Knights of the Legion of Honour. A &quot;knight&quot; is defined as a military servant. Prince Jean Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte is considered the head of the Imperial House of Bonaparte today and his mother is Princess Beatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. </p>

<p>Jean Christophe has worked for Morgan Stanley and is an associate for Advent International which is a major buy firm with assets estimated at 31 billion. French presidents are the heads of the Bonaparte&#39;s Legion of Honour which has many members that are billionaires and heads of major corporations and banks like Alfred Dreyfus, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus, Benoit Potier, Pierre-Andre de Chalendar, and Rene Obermann. The remaining French branch of the Dreyfus family serve the House of Bonaparte. The Bonaparte family are intermarried with the Aldobrandini papal nobility in Italy. Baron David Rene de Rothschild who is the current head of the French Rothschild family and head of the Rothschild bank is married to Princess Olimpia Aldobrandini who has Bonaparte ancestry through Prince Camillo Borghese (Aldobrandini). The Colonna-Walewski family of Italian and Polish origin are intermarried with the House of Bonaparte. Charles Joseph Bonaparte was a US Attorney General  that helped to established the FBI and was a great nephew of Napoleon I. The Italian Nobility and House of Bonaparte are closely working together like a crime syndicate and working towards dominating and controlling society. Prince Charles Napoleon Bonaparte and his son Prince Jean Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte are the heads of the Bonaparte family today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bold-faced lie, and wouldn&#39;t even be necessary or make sense to do so. You&#39;re only saying that to distract from the fact I called you out on various inconsistencies and literal bullshit in your post.</p>

<p>To clarify, from a previous comment with this person:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to know what I changed, I&#39;ll show you, for the sake of transparency:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which amounts to an unsourced (and unsourceable) rant and wall of text peddling blatant disinformation, with the intent of shifting blame and attention from the Zio-Ango-American alliance (and the elite of the elite among them) to their Italian lackies and subordinates.
It&#39;s a pretty obvious tactic, and a shame to see this sub falling for it, not just once but repeatedly.

</blockquote>

<p>I removed the unnecessary &#39;when&#39; from the last sentence because it made no sense after I read it. I also see I typo&#39;d Anglo, accidentally typing Ango instead. </p>

<p>So why would you falsely claim I removed a remark that I study Hermeticism, which I actually made later in the conversation and did not remove or edit? That makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You claimed the Medici family was &#39;running&#39; the Golden Dawn, excuse me, Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. As someone who has studied this order and related subjects extensively, I asked for proof or a source, to which you responded with more vague unrelated facts that provided no proof or direct or even indirect connection. When you could no longer get away with changing the subject with walls of texts consisting of unrelated or vaguely related topics, you then began to attack my character by blatantly lying about an earlier comment I made, then using an alt account to accuse me of being a &quot;shill&quot; (which is laughable considering my history here) and now by calling me a &quot;snake&quot;. </p>

<p>I was expecting an honest and civil debate, or some kind of verifiable information ideally, or at minimum a questionable source or two to back up your claims, which you have failed to produce, instead resorting to personal attacks and outright lying about what you claim I said which wasn&#39;t even relevant to the discussion, aside from you attempting to use it to further attack my character, which only makes me further question your motives and intentions in doing so, and your posting what appeared on the surface and now moreso after further scrutiny to be a form disinformation.</p>

The Medici family were one of the wealthiest banking families in Europe for centuries. The Medici family produced 3 Popes and 2 Queens of France. The Medici and Bonaparte families are closely related and are still working together. Both of these families still exist. Emilio Garrastazu Medici was a Brazilian military dictator that established the military government in Brazil. The Brazilian Andre Cezar Medici works at the World Bank as a health economist in Washington DC today. The name Medici means medical and they have been linked with practicing sorcery. Pharmacy derives from the Greek word Pharmakeia which means sorcery and poison. The most common symbol used in medicine is the Rod of Asclepius The Medici family are involved in alchemical witchcraft and run the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Hermetic Order of Martinists. They use members to infiltrate the food and drug companies.
The Medici family are tax collectors and they are overseeing the IRS through Rome&#39;s network of power. The Medici family use the IRS to financially  persecute people that Rome has declared as heretics. Not only is income tax immoral but the IRS make up debts out of thin air and persecute people based on these made up debts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prince Julian de Medici of Ottajano is the head of the Cult of Hermes and the Rosicrucian-Freemasonic division called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Hermes is associated with trickery, thieves, sacrifice, sorcery, and initiation. There is a statue of Hermes at the Villa Medici on Pincian Hill in Rome. Hermes was later renamed Hermes Trismegistus and is the basis for Hermeticism which is a popular form of witchcraft and alchemy used by the occult. The name Medici means medical. The Greek word Pharmakeia means medicine, potions, witchcraft, or sorcery. The winged Staff of Hermes of two serpents coiled around a staff is very similar to the Rod of Asclepius. The Rod of Asclepius is the most common symbol used in modern medicine. Serpents are venomous like their vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The Staff of Hermes is used for New Age initiations. Hermes was known as a trickster and a thief. Members of the Cult of Hermes are intellectual thieves that steal knowledge from others and then distort it as a form of false opposition through deceptive imitation. There are computer hackers involved with this cult who steal information from others.
 
The Illuminati steal knowledge, inventions, and imaginations to use for their corrupted interests. Nicola Tesla&#39;s inventions were stolen by the Illuminati who have removed him from the history books to cover up their theft. The Medici family were once the wealthiest bankers in Europe for centuries. They still have a large amount of wealth today which they use for funding their satanic Hermetic cults. The frog is a hidden symbol for Hermes and hermaphrodite frogs have been discovered by biologists. Many members of the Cult of Hermes use &quot;Pepe the frog&quot; avatars on alternative media websites spreading division, mindless violence, and threats in support for Donald Trump as they pretend to be opposed to corruption. They flag YouTube and Facebook profiles of people who are legitimate opposition to corruption. Prince Julian de Medici is extremely wicked and abominable. Prince Julian has sacrificed women and children and stalks me online and then brags about it. Nero was known for burning people alive. Nero was Octavian. Julian de Medici is the Prince of Ottajano. Ottajano translated into Latin is Octavian.</p>

The fact that Hermeticism is specifically a form of alchemy which is chemical sorcery and Medici means medical which uses chemicals or pharmaceuticals is more connection.

<p>Jews and Magic in Medici Florence: The Secret World of Benedetto Blanis (review) </p>

<p>In this outstanding new book, Edward Goldberg examines a wide range of archival materials to offer a nuanced view of Jews and magic in seventeenth-century Florence. Because of the richness of the sources utilized and the broad contextualization furnished, this volume provides a good deal more than the study of an intriguing and infrequently discussed chapter in early modern Jewish history and Jewish and Christian relations. Making careful use of police files, judicial records, legal contracts, government deliberations, and letters found in the Medici Granducal Archive, among other materials, Goldberg investigates the complicated relationship between the Jewish scholar and businessman Benedetto Blanis (ca. 1580–ca. 1647), who resided in the Florentine ghetto, and Don Giovanni dei Medici (1567–1621), a complex and intriguing—and, at times, politically influential—legitimized child of Cosimo I and well-off member of the ruling family. Benedetto served as Don Giovanni’s librarian, exchanging letters about and sharing interest in many esoteric topics, from alchemy to kabbalah. The Benedetto that Goldberg reconstructs is trapped between the worlds of the ghetto and the court, relying frequently on his patron for a host of political favors.
Goldberg profitably situates the study within the context of the Florentine court and Medici rule, revealing a ruling family both autocratic and, at times, accessible. Goldberg narrates Don Giovanni’s rise, his success as a military engineer, and his artistic and literary interests, especially in the “occult,” a passion he shared with his uncle Don Antonio. Goldberg also recounts Don Giovanni’s reckless and boisterous behavior throughout his life, best characterized perhaps by his long-term relationship with Livia Vernazza, the daughter of a Genoese mattress maker, who possessed a tainted and suspect reputation and who Don Giovanni would marry in 1619, much to the chagrin of his family. Benedetto’s initial interaction with Don Giovanni was commercial; in the course of their relations they engaged in a variety of scholarly discussions as well. Benedetto, for his part, offered valuable skills as an individual with some knowledge of both Hebrew and Latin, and some familiarity with Jewish mysticism. [End Page 360]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another wall of text taking vaguely related concepts, a handful of facts and armful of your own opinions to form a narrative that isn&#39;t wholly accurate. Again, a source for this assertion (outside of your own opinions) would be nice.</p>

<p>A retort, based on my years of research into this particular order, as to their origins and practice, easily verifiable with sources and one&#39;s own research:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for the Golden Dawn, it&#39;s also worth noting it was and remains a syncretic amalgamation of various practices originating from a variety of currents and lineages of esotericism, not solely or perhaps even primarily that of Sabbatean or Lurianic Kabbalah, which would be but one among many that have contributed to its ritual and curriculum, but in addition to the following: </p>

<p>Rosicrucianism, Hermeticism, Hermetic Qabalah, Alchemy, Freemasonry, Kemetic / Egyptian Mysteries, Greek Mysteries, Neoplatonism, Theurgy, the Tarot and Enochian magic, among others.</p>

<p>The source of the Sabbatean current would have arisen from one of its concurrent and direct predecessors, the  L’Aurore Naissante (or “Nascent Dawn”), a Rosicrucian lodge descended from the Fratres Lucis (in turn descended from the Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden), which was one of the few lodges at the time to allow Jewish initiates, who by nature of joining such a lodge would have been drawn toward mysticism in general, and due to their heritage would have explored the Kabbalah. Some of those deeply involved with the L’Aurore Naissante lodge were also known to have Sabbatean leanings, hence the influence of that current on the subsequent Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.</p>

<p>A basic overview of the Golden Dawn&#39;s lineage(s):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fratres Rosae Crucis of German (ca. 1450) -&gt; the Fraternitate Rosæ et Aureæ Crucis (R. et A.C.) (1580 or 1517) -&gt; Orden des Gülden und Rosen-Creutzes (1710) -&gt; Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden (1757, 1767 &amp; 1777) -&gt; Asiatic Brethren / Fratres Lucis (“Brotherhood of Light” or “Illuminati”) (1780) -&gt;  L’Aurore Naissante (or “the Nascent Dawn”) / Loge zur aufgehenden Morgenrothe (“Lodge of the Rising Dawn”) (1807) -&gt; Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1888) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fratres Rosae Crucis of Germany (ca. 1450) -&gt;  the Fraternitate Rosæ et Aureæ Crucis (R. et A.C.) (1580 or 1517) -&gt; Orden des Gülden und Rosen-Creutzes (1710) -&gt; Gold und Rosenkreutz Orden (1757, 1767 &amp; 1777) -&gt; S.R.I.A / Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (1865) -&gt; Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1888) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn&#39;s founding members and grade structure were largely derived from the S.R.I.A., while the bulk of their ritual and curriculum was derived from the enigmatic &#39;Cypher Manuscripts&#39; and eventually &#39;Flying Roll&#39; documents of the R.R. et A.C., presumably originating from the &#39;Secret Chiefs&#39; of the L’Aurore Naissante, if not another more secretive order.</p>

<p>In short, there was a fair amount of cross-membership between certain Masonic lodges of the time and the Golden Dawn. The founding members of the G.D. for example had used the degree/grade structure from a lodge of which they were initiates, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societas_Rosicruciana_in_Anglia">SRIA or Societas Rosicruiana in Anglia</a>, a Masonic-Rosicrucian appendant body still associated with Freemasonry to the present day, a lodge descended from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Golden_and_Rosy_Cross">Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross</a>, which the SRIA in turn had borrowed <em>its</em> grade structure, and worth noting while it was primarily a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism">Rosicrucian</a> order the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross had required its initiates to be Master Masons in good standing.</p>

<p>As for the enigmatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Manuscripts">Cipher Manuscripts</a>, from which the ritual and doctrine of the G.D. was formulated, it would appear likely they were originally authored by what the G.D. regarded as their &#39;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Chiefs">Secret Chiefs</a>&#39; or rather the high-grade initiates of the third and inner order of the L’Aurore Naissante (or Nascent Dawn), itself an offshoot of the Asiatic Brethren or Fratres Lucis (Brotherhood of Light or Brotherhood of Illuminati), which had itself also in turn arose from the Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross.</p>

<p>So there you have it. There isn&#39;t a direct link between Freemasonry and the G.D. per se, rather a variety of indirect links consisting of cross-membership between their lodges and partial concurrent lineage or ancestry diverging at certain points in history.</p>

<p>Yes, because that&#39;s what most people tend to call it, and if you&#39;re going to repeat the name of the organization repeatedly it isn&#39;t practical to type out HERMETIC ORDER OF THE GOLDEN DAWN in each sentence. Most people just say HOGD or Golden Dawn for short. </p>

It&#39;s a pretty obvious tactic, and a shame to see this sub falling for it, not just once but repeatedly.

    <div class="md"><p>Hermeticism a form of alchemy is involved with using chemicals and herbs for sorcery and witchcraft. The Medici family established one of the oldest botanical gardens on the planet in Pisa. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orto_botanico_di_Pisa">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orto_botanico_di_Pisa</a></p>

<p>The Orto botanico di Pisa, also known as the Orto Botanico dell&#39;Università di Pisa, is a botanical garden operated by the University of Pisa, and located at via Luca Ghini 5, Pisa, Italy.
The garden was established in 1544 under Cosimo I de&#39; Medici as the first university botanical garden in Europe, and entrusted to the famous botanist Luca Ghini of Imola. In 1563 the garden was relocated from its original riverside location (now the Medicean Arsenal) to one near the convent of Santa Marta, and in 1591 again moved to its third and current location. From these early times, the garden has contained a gallery of natural objects (now Pisa&#39;s Museo di Storia Naturale), a library (now part of the university library), and portraits of its directors throughout the centuries. It also includes one of the earliest iron-framed hothouses built in Italy.
Today the garden is divided into sections containing the botanical school, gardens, ponds, greenhouses, and various buildings. Major collections include herb gardens and arboreta, as well as the old botany institute, built 1591–1595, with a facade ornamented with sea-shells.</p>
