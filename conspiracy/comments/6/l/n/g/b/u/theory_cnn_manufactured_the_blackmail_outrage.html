    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re probably too young to remember but people despised Fox when Bush was in office exactly the way they hate on CNN now.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what you are too dense to understand.  Fox and Cnn become anti-establishment / pro- government depending on which party is in power.  New party?  New dynamic.  Fox becomes the &quot;champions of democracy&quot; and CNN &quot;exposes&quot; the republicans.  A democrat majority 4 years later?  Switch it up.  It keeps morons like you oblivious to the real changes being made in government while you&#39;re busy fighting over whether to be buried or cremated.</p>

<p>And the fact that you have strong opinions is not the problem here - it is your complete refusal to listen and consider other perspectives and arguments - while adding nothing to the conversation.</p>

<p>Buddy, you have to look beyond partisanship. I have you tagged as a shill but I just can&#39;t decide if maybe it&#39;s just that you&#39;re left-leaning and strongly dislike trump. Hopefully that&#39;s the case. If so, the people at the apex of geopolitics want you to be consumed with passionate zeal for and against different aisles because both sides are part of the same team. Would you rather mild salsa or medium? They&#39;re the same product wrapped in different colors to give the shallow illusion of change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okeefe&#39;s reputation is shit. </p>

<p>His videos were not believed and are heavily edited. To my knowledge Okeefe still hasn&#39;t released raw footage of his investigation into DNC. It&#39;s the same shit that MSM does when they interview people. My recent example is Alex Jones, Meghan was with Jones all day. They talked for at least two hours , while Jones says it was around 5 hours. NBC then takes the multi hour interview footage and makes a 12 hour news segment , where two minutes of the actual interview make it into the 12 minute news piece. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost funny if it wasn&#39;t true, 5 hour interview where you use two minutes of interview to make a 12 minute one sided piece. </p>

<p>When will MSM realize that people want podcast style interviews? We don&#39;t want breaks or talking points. We want unedited, uninterrupted, nonagenda  interviews.</p>

<p>Think of how different elections would be if we had real debates. The debates we have now are questions where a candidate gets two minutes to respond. How can anyone know a candidates foreign policy in two minutes. Anyone can make up fluff and use good words to bullshit around any question that they have to address in two minutes. </p>
