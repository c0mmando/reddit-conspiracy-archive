       The Trump Russia connection isn't a false narrative. As long as Manafort and Flynn are under criminal FBI investigation, I don't see why you wouldn't talk about the story if it's good for ratings.

       Nope. The phone calls he made to the Russian ambassador on Dec 29th didn't reveal any incriminating evidence. That didn't end the investigation into Flynn just because he didn't say anything crazy during a couple monitered phone calls on one day.

       I'm not pro or anti CNN. I don't watch it. Not sure why you guys have such a boner about CNN. MSNBC talks shit about Trumo all day and reports on a lot of the same stuff CNN does. I never see posts on here about MSNBC being fake news. So I don't know why there is such an obsession with CNN.

       You're probably too young to remember but people despised Fox when Bush was in office exactly the way they hate on CNN now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what you are too dense to understand.  Fox and Cnn become anti-establishment / pro- government depending on which party is in power.  New party?  New dynamic.  Fox becomes the "champions of democracy" and CNN "exposes" the republicans.  A democrat majority 4 years later?  Switch it up.  It keeps morons like you oblivious to the real changes being made in government while you're busy fighting over whether to be buried or cremated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that you have strong opinions is not the problem here - it is your complete refusal to listen and consider other perspectives and arguments - while adding nothing to the conversation.

        Buddy, you have to look beyond partisanship. I have you tagged as a shill but I just can't decide if maybe it's just that you're left-leaning and strongly dislike trump. Hopefully that's the case. If so, the people at the apex of geopolitics want you to be consumed with passionate zeal for and against different aisles because both sides are part of the same team. Would you rather mild salsa or medium? They're the same product wrapped in different colors to give the shallow illusion of change.

       Thanks for studying my account. 1, 2, and 4 are true. I'm not anti CNN. I've never said once that Hillary made Hillary lose. Russia did hack the DNC. I don't talk about pedogate much but I don't think everyone is a pedophile. Like McCain? Nah.
      </p>
      <p>
       So thanks for lying to everyone instead of actually responding to my comment. I guess you don't actually have anything to say.

       I'm not the guys investigating him. The investigation would already be over if we had all the information. But clearly you have so much more information than our entire government and every intelligence agency. Would you like to show me all your evidence that Seth hacked the DMV instead?

       It's a story I've been greatly interested in but haven't seen a shred of evidence. Not even any evidence it was a hack at all; it could've been a leak from the inside.

       Nobody gave some guy their password. These emails were stolen. Both from the DNC and Podesta. So regardless of who you think hacked them, these emails weren't leaked.

       A fishing scheme is still a hack. So you think someone from the DNC hacked the election. Are you just throwing out ideas here? There's plenty of evidence that Russia hacked the DNC. Our entire government and every intelligence agency acknowledges this, including Trumps people. So it's up to you whether or not you believe them.

       What do you mean by "hacked the election?" A disgruntled employee of the DNC could've certainly leaked the DNC emails; or hacked Podestas emails, if that's what you mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the evidence that it was Russia? The 3 intelligence agencies that you're referring to routinely lie to the American people, and to my knowledge never released any evidence - apparently they didn't even look at the DNC server - so why do you believe them?

       So you think someone from the DNC hacked the DNC. And you have absolutely no evidence for this. And you're sitting here telling me the evidence we do have for Russia hacking us is a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is going no where. You'll never believe anything you don't already believe so it's pointless. Have a good one. Let me know when you get all that evidence that th3 DNC hacked the DNC. Im just gonna wait for this criminal investigation to conclude.

       Two wrongs don't make a right. I don't think for a moment they intended to cover up one scandal by perpetrating a bigger one back to back. They may be clueless and out of touch but I have a hard time believing this was planned. More like a knee jerk reaction done during a wild damage control period that just made things worse.

       Okeefe's reputation is shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       His videos were not believed and are heavily edited. To my knowledge Okeefe still hasn't released raw footage of his investigation into DNC. It's the same shit that MSM does when they interview people. My recent example is Alex Jones, Meghan was with Jones all day. They talked for at least two hours , while Jones says it was around 5 hours. NBC then takes the multi hour interview footage and makes a 12 hour news segment , where two minutes of the actual interview make it into the 12 minute news piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost funny if it wasn't true, 5 hour interview where you use two minutes of interview to make a 12 minute one sided piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       When will MSM realize that people want podcast style interviews? We don't want breaks or talking points. We want unedited, uninterrupted, nonagenda  interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of how different elections would be if we had real debates. The debates we have now are questions where a candidate gets two minutes to respond. How can anyone know a candidates foreign policy in two minutes. Anyone can make up fluff and use good words to bullshit around any question that they have to address in two minutes.

       Do you remember nothing from O'Keefe's past? Planned Parenthood? ACORN? His entire career is built on deceptive editing, removing context from around words to completely change their meaning. The raw footage conveys a completely different meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       "#CNNblackmail intentionally pushing a false narrative for ratings" are absolutely your words, but when I cut out bits I really change what they mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Most of the Russia thing is a nothing burger, just kinda fluff that probably won't go anywhere, but the Flynn thing is huge; that's gonna be what brings him down" has a completely different meaning. If O'Keefe was being honest, he'd release the raw footage so we can see everything that was said in context so there's no question. Until he does that, I'm going to assume he's pulling his same old tricks, distorting people's words for a smear.

       The people said what was in the Planned Parenthood and ACORN videos too. Doesn't change that the raw footage showed a completely different context that completely changed the meaning. O'Keefe is a liar; that's what he does, and you'd be a fool to believe anything that he puts out isn't deceptively edited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you don't care because it confirms what you already wanted to believe, so why bother acknowledging that his career is based around dishonesty? There's no need for critical thought when your own biases could be confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Haha what they said on the video. Fake. His past falls short." See how easy this is? I'm not even taking liberties with the word order.

       This sub was dead since before the election. It's just T_D's slightly quiet cousin anyway. But yes, I'm defending CNN, if only because O'Keefe is yet again lying. If O'Keefe had made a video about Fox, I'd be defending them instead. When your distrust of something is based largely on lies that other people tell about them, it's not unreasonable for someone else to point that out.

       Your comment that this sub is t_d's "slightly quieter cousin"'is repulsive. Maybe now it is, but that hasn't been the case since mid-2015. There are still those of us who see partisan politics as a means of division used to control us.

       Except it's compromised by people like O'Keefe, and people who act like a news agency retracting a story ever proves that they're all fake. The compromised reputation is something almost entirely invented by people who have a vested interest in ruining the credibility of people who report things they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim to be above partisanship, but I find it funny (and frustrating) that so many people who claim they are just so happen to act in a way that's entirely partisan.
