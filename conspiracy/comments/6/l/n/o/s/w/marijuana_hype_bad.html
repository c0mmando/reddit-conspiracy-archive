        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve noticed a SHIT TON of pro marijuana stances from the MSM to every you tuber.</p>

<p>The thing is I feel like there&#39;s a conspiracy behind it, why would the MSM be advocates of it if the big &quot;pharmaceuticals&quot; control the industry. </p>

<p>If you read protocols of Zion it could be to degenerate the generations to come.</p>

<p>Look I know marijuana does not kill etc etc but look at stoners channels on YouTube of them hitting bongs, they all look large lazy and arrogant.</p>

<p>People claim they need marijuana because it makes things more fun just seems like a delusion Addicts tell themselves to feed their addiction.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve smoked weed many many times, but now only once or twice a month or whenever it comes to me but seriously I feel like it&#39;s overhyped.</p>

<p>When you smoke you laugh at something that&#39;s not funny for 2 minutes, then get insecure. I have yet to find someone who&#39;s extremely loud and leading while extremely high, it &quot;couch locks you&quot;</p>

<p>This may seem like an anti marijuana post, but I assure you it&#39;s not, I&#39;m just curious on what everyone&#39;s take on marijuana is. Do you think it&#39;s weakening or strengthening society.</p>

<p>To finalize my point, despite anecdotal, It&#39;s strange that marijuana is so popular all the sudden, from something the pharmaceuticals hate and will never be legal to everyone loving &quot;tha herb&quot;</p>

<p>On a sidenote this is about the use of RECREATIONAL marijuana, and not medicinal use.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You clearly have never smoked a good sativa strain.</p>

<p>I myself am an advocate for &quot;tha herb&quot;, and o have asked myself the same questions you have about the MSM and positive support for marijuana. In my experience smoking marijuana, it is very easy to abuse it. I find myself abusing it every now and then but if your going to partake in the jazz cabbage, you have to find your equilibrium. Like those famous words&quot;everything in moderation&quot;; that moderation is subjective and needs to be sought out. IMO, if you can master that moderation, marijuana can be the key to open your eyes to a lot of the crap going on in the world. I picture it works in a way where it removes a filter from your brain in a sense and places your mind on a different angle of thought.
However, like i said earlier, that moderation must he sought out and will not just finds it&#39;s way to you. Like you said earlier, marijuana can make people very lazy and arrogant, especially when abused.</p>

<p>I believe the MSM is using the fact that marijuana has been forbidden for so long (possibly doe the reasons i mentioned above) and now its making a strong comeback. The MSM is going to use all this positive info to build up the water at the dam and then once weed is legalized and the dam finally breaks, the whole nation will be overjoyed into abusing the shit out of the herb, thus dooming everyone to be lazy and arrogant and easier to control. It&#39;s almost poetic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a legal state and am trying to get into the industry. I have noticed MJ has become more mainstream with legalization. Like the Snoop Dogg/Martha Stewart commercial from the super bowl. They are just making it a social norm by using subtle propaganda just like everything else. </p>

<p>But I think they are going to let the movement continue and grow because the war on drugs and the DEA are running out time to go after weed. So why not make people think its ok then when Monsanto starts producing their cannabis and adding who knows what to it then we get into a new opioid type addiction cycle. We aren&#39;t going to be able to keep big pharma out of the industry but that is the eventual goal IMO. </p>

I like being high and relaxing. Everyone reacts differently to weed. I&#39;ve know people that freak out, relax, space out and pass out. Others it just makes them paranoid and it makes for a bad Time. There is always going to be people that constantly abuse substances to the extreme, that&#39;s where you get your &quot;stoners&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Cannabis is the free thinkers drug. If anything, it encourages us to think more existentially, not less so. You&#39;ve seen cannabis and how it&#39;s used in younger circles. It&#39;s very different among older folks. All of the most intelligent people I have ever known have at least tried cannabis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s not completely anecdotal</p>

<p>Go to r/leaves</p>

<p>I know plentiful of smart people that don&#39;t smoke weed and are philosophical as ever.</p>

<p>I always AMOG stoners with their girlfriends too because their defences are down. Not on purpose but because it comes naturally.</p>

<p>Twice a girl left with me because the &quot;guy they were with&quot; was high</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#39;ll give these a read for a better understanding. You first must be aware of your consciousness before you can aspire to alter it. The more intelligent you are, the deeper ones understanding of perception is, the more likely they are to experiment with altering it. Furthermore, drug education is almost purely propaganda.</p>

<p>Propaganda is more easily recognized by those smart enough to see it, which, naturally, leads to a greater degree of curiosity. Drug education therefore fails to have any impact on our best and brightest students, and often, does more harm, than good.</p>

<p>The second Monsanto gets its hands on its patent, pot will become bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Daily user. The image you associate with stoners is the one you&#39;ve been indoctrinated to have. As a diagnosed sufferer of chronic depression, peripheral neuropathy, and IBM, as well as a host of other undiagnosed ailments, MJ has changed my life for the better.  Before I began using, you would have mistaken me for a stoner based on your description. If you knew me before, you&#39;d be amazed as this optimistic, energetic person with an intense love of life I am today.</p>

<p>I assure you there are more stoners in your life than you know. You don&#39;t even suspect they&#39;re using because you believe in the stereotype taught to you because a of a few silly kids who made videos for YouTube.  Don&#39;t fret though, it&#39;s all good. Most of us are just average people, making our way through life like everyone else.  It&#39;s not always easy though and MJ helps us cope with the every day stresses of asshole bosses, rising inflation, fighting kids, grumpy spouses, and neighborhood drama. We don&#39;t want to hurt anyone, we just want to be able to smoke in peace without being judged as the dunces of society.</p>

<p>The PTB realize they are losing the fight.  The truth is coming to light based on personal experience. Now the narrative will change. They&#39;re admitting in MSM the benefits of natural substances such as weed and mushrooms.  They will regain control over MJ by legalizing it, taxing it, and controlling it.  They will also learn who uses it as visitors to dispensaries are registered to a state database.  Legalization also opens the door for Big Pharma to get in on it as well.</p>

<p>Think not for a moment TPTB have simply given up on the issue. No, this is all by design. </p>
