    <div class="md"><p>I grew up catholic and at a young age, I always felt it seemed reasonable they should be allowed to marry.  Then as a teen I met a friend that was Methodist, and had a married pastor with kids owned a house and a dog...  and I got to say the pastor looked happy and satisfied, unlike the brothers and priests I was familiar with.</p>

<p>You could be right, we will never know...  might be an unspoken acceptance to spill seed in each other behind closed doors.  Guesssing the drug thing was unsanctioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of my father who is an excommunicated priest told me this. Basically, around the Middle Ages, Catholic priests could marry and have families, which they would give all their possessions to after they died. The church was wary of this and instructed from now on that priests were forbidden to have families, thus all their material items were immediately &quot;donated to the Catholic Church. The rest is history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are the same people that profess to hate homosexuality, yet they partake.  Know how many households and families were torn apart due to them holding onto the homo hate?</p>

<p>Funny story to me was a local pastor that was popular.  Southern chap, full of brimstone this and that.  His oldest son left home in sin because he was flaming gay, need up dead doing that choking erotica thing, his oldest daughter was a prolific lover of men, had 3 husbands; younger son is on sex offender list for loving a 15 year old girl.</p>

<p>So this whole hate those that are a little different than you seems to be poisonous to those slinging it.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: pious priests should not be hypocrites.</p>

<p>There&#39;s well-known and factually-supported pedophilia going on in the Catholic church, but I don&#39;t think it pertains specifically to this story/scandal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering when enough people will come around to the fact that this is a truly evil organization that doesn&#39;t believe a word that is said in the bible. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if satan exists or God, and I have no problem with gays and certainly not any problem with drugs. </p>

<p>My issue, is that these people are pure evil, and I&#39;m really sick of it. They hoard insane wealth, they have access to millions of pages of human history and written word that no one is allowed access to, they fuck kids, they fuck each other, genocide including funding the holocaust.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if they are satanic, or just sociopaths, but the amount of evidence against the vatican is absolutely staggering.</p>

<p>If God exists, he&#39;s in no way a part of the vatican.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until good people stop tithing their 10% pretax wages, I don&#39;t see them changing course.  They seem focused, as if following prophecy.  It is always interesting watching those in elite roles act.  You know they know something we don&#39;t, and it seems illogical - yet they must know something right?</p>

<p>But what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for starters they have access to an entire human history that we don&#39;t. Now that doesn&#39;t mean it contains the answers, but it sure contains a lot of information. </p>

<p>I feel like one of two options is the winner:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They have access to the so called &quot;truth&quot; of creation, whether it be aliens, a God or God&#39;s (same thing as advanced aliens in a humans mind) previous advanced civilizations wiped out by cataclysms etc. </p></li>
<li><p>They know it&#39;s all complete fucking bullshit, and no one knows anything. All it is, is power and control, religion was the first advertising aka brainwashing campaign, hence why all religions are similar in origin story and can be traced back to earlier and earlier cultures with their own story. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>For me the Sumarians have always been one of the more fascinating cultures, their understanding of the solar system and stars cannot be explained, nor their knowledge of the 10th planet, that for hundreds of years was laughed at, and only very recently mainstream science has had to admit that it probably exists. </p>

<p>Also pretty surprising that the Vatican spends so much money on powerful telescopes, you&#39;d think that would be completely unnecessary for those who believe the word of God.</p>

<p>Seems they are looking for something very specific, what that is, we don&#39;t know, because they have the books that are telling them what to look for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing points my friend.  Thanks for replying.</p>

<p>Btw, I am not well versed, but was it the sumerians that said 10th planet would return and with it aliens that use us for food?</p>

<p>And about the vatican&#39;s IR telescopes, and to name it Lucifer - seems crazy to this ex catholic boy.  But, then it makes me wonder what they know.  If something is coming, what do they know will happen?  Because if they think they will rapture after being evil just because they invoke the name of Jesus asking to be saved - ugh.  Example: if they know they can do fuck all, but only until a certain set of signs is visible.  Then time to ask to be saved and live cleanly...</p>
