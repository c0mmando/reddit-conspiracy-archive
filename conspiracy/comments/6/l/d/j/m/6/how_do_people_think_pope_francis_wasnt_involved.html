       The thread was interesting.  They flailed it with 'misleading title' yet no one disputes the points that it was a gay orgy of religious people.  Maybe using the 'Vatican rocked' part?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a few comments said, they were relieved to see no children were part of the orgy.

       I think because this a matter of the Vatican the pope is aware of gay orgies with his clergy, this could be a group of frustrated priests but by doing this they go against what they stand for
.. fuck the hypocritical hierarchies of our time

       I grew up catholic and at a young age, I always felt it seemed reasonable they should be allowed to marry.  Then as a teen I met a friend that was Methodist, and had a married pastor with kids owned a house and a dog...  and I got to say the pastor looked happy and satisfied, unlike the brothers and priests I was familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could be right, we will never know...  might be an unspoken acceptance to spill seed in each other behind closed doors.  Guesssing the drug thing was unsanctioned.

       A friend of my father who is an excommunicated priest told me this. Basically, around the Middle Ages, Catholic priests could marry and have families, which they would give all their possessions to after they died. The church was wary of this and instructed from now on that priests were forbidden to have families, thus all their material items were immediately "donated to the Catholic Church. The rest is history.

       If I see "The cardinals apartment" I automatically assume the cardinal lives there, and subsequently it was an orgy in his home. I'm not saying thats everybodies reaction, but I don't think my viewpoint is uncommon

       Excuse my cynicism but all the articles I could find all use one source, an Italian newspaper (
       <a href="http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/">
        http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/
       </a>
       ) and personally don't like to put all my faith into such a serious claim when there's no other sources to back it up. Still early days so maybe we will hear a police report in the coming days.

       Maybe they'll communicate disclosure to take the massive amount of heat off. I mean, things are already getting pretty out of control in the RCC, might as well throw Extra Terrestrials into the mix.

       As it stands, however, it just seems like people are attacking these priests for wanting to get their dicks wet and have a little fun. Personally, I have no problem with that at all.

       Idk man, I don't care at all about arbitrary rules that the catholic church lays down on it's clergy.

       My thought is, why doesn't the church just let priests get their fuck on? Probably be a lot less pedophilia if that were the case.

       These are the same people that profess to hate homosexuality, yet they partake.  Know how many households and families were torn apart due to them holding onto the homo hate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny story to me was a local pastor that was popular.  Southern chap, full of brimstone this and that.  His oldest son left home in sin because he was flaming gay, need up dead doing that choking erotica thing, his oldest daughter was a prolific lover of men, had 3 husbands; younger son is on sex offender list for loving a 15 year old girl.
      </p>

       So this whole hate those that are a little different than you seems to be poisonous to those slinging it.

       I'm wondering when enough people will come around to the fact that this is a truly evil organization that doesn't believe a word that is said in the bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if satan exists or God, and I have no problem with gays and certainly not any problem with drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue, is that these people are pure evil, and I'm really sick of it. They hoard insane wealth, they have access to millions of pages of human history and written word that no one is allowed access to, they fuck kids, they fuck each other, genocide including funding the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they are satanic, or just sociopaths, but the amount of evidence against the vatican is absolutely staggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       If God exists, he's in no way a part of the vatican.

       Until good people stop tithing their 10% pretax wages, I don't see them changing course.  They seem focused, as if following prophecy.  It is always interesting watching those in elite roles act.  You know they know something we don't, and it seems illogical - yet they must know something right?

       Well for starters they have access to an entire human history that we don't. Now that doesn't mean it contains the answers, but it sure contains a lot of information.

      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They have access to the so called "truth" of creation, whether it be aliens, a God or God's (same thing as advanced aliens in a humans mind) previous advanced civilizations wiped out by cataclysms etc.

         They know it's all complete fucking bullshit, and no one knows anything. All it is, is power and control, religion was the first advertising aka brainwashing campaign, hence why all religions are similar in origin story and can be traced back to earlier and earlier cultures with their own story.

       For me the Sumarians have always been one of the more fascinating cultures, their understanding of the solar system and stars cannot be explained, nor their knowledge of the 10th planet, that for hundreds of years was laughed at, and only very recently mainstream science has had to admit that it probably exists.

       Also pretty surprising that the Vatican spends so much money on powerful telescopes, you'd think that would be completely unnecessary for those who believe the word of God.

       Seems they are looking for something very specific, what that is, we don't know, because they have the books that are telling them what to look for.

       Btw, I am not well versed, but was it the sumerians that said 10th planet would return and with it aliens that use us for food?

       And about the vatican's IR telescopes, and to name it Lucifer - seems crazy to this ex catholic boy.  But, then it makes me wonder what they know.  If something is coming, what do they know will happen?  Because if they think they will rapture after being evil just because they invoke the name of Jesus asking to be saved - ugh.  Example: if they know they can do fuck all, but only until a certain set of signs is visible.  Then time to ask to be saved and live cleanly...

       Whats really disturbing about this is the reason priests can't have family is not due to religious notions, but monetary reasons.
