       It's been a long time coming, ever since the invasion and take over by t_d and the drastic change forcing hate and changing narrative to be pro-trump, Despite his huge flaws, all ignored and defended despite being much more "conspiracy" accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we get drowned with shit going over the same facts from Clinton emails. Over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we are given the latest deflection story where people are actively and viciously defending a shit human being racist as hell because it helps the narrative.
All under "freedom of speech" because then they can spin it with "You just hate murica" so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy it's been good, but you no longer hold truth or any value you're mainly a stage for Trump supporters to shit on anything disagreeing with them and no longer about uncovering truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been real. For any who are out there still weathering the storm of shit stay strong but I can't fight brainwashed masses any more. The propaganda is too real the brainwashing is too much, it's clear we have lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least in this sub, and the fight is dying in reality as well the propaganda grows. Dystopian future is eminent. The NWO is coming.

       Because they want proof Bannon is the owner and in the White House with Trump. 
Who's seen t_d take over and make it into an abomination of what it once was.

       Congrats on giving up? I don't know what you expect any of us to say? Uh, miss you bud? Maybe if everyone who cared just ignored all the obv shill and t_d shit, it would just fucking go away? But everyone seems hell bent on defending their own pov to the point that the sub name means nothing or at least something other than it's og purpose? Maybe you should just create a trump conspiracy page and lead all the t_d's to it so they stray away from here? Idk. But regardless, I think very few people came here to start a revolution. I never viewed this as that space. This is just simply a place to try to sort out what your waking mind is trying to grasp. Right? Why leave? Is it that hard to just ignore the front page?? To just ignore the obvious troll or shill? You're a person just like the rest of us (most of us) and I think what you have to say might just be the most important thing that someone here needs to read. Don't give up. Don't let the forces your up against win. Especially over fucking text on the internet. Don't be so weak. We have one another's back in the end right? Can we all agree on that?? Fuck.

       I see your points. But I more see that this sub has been killed.
So derailed it doesn't matter anymore. Even good stuff is filled with bullshit in the comments instead of creating a solid argument for or against and bringing truth to better light.
The sub has a very b/w mission statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There used to be intelligent discussion. Now it's just "fuck you you're wrong" 
Despite that having existed before we knew our lane and stayed in it. Outed legit shills. The 2016 election killed us

       Bullshit. The internet was just fine when everyone used their real name. Hell, you could finger someone's .plan file and see where they were at a given time.

       I've had to do that as well. Certain subs are prickly and downvote happy. Like anything, once a place gets well known it goes downhill. All of reddit fits this description. Was nice when just the few used it. But now everyone is on board and that ruins it.

       Exactly some places need to be purged in order to keep on moving forward.
It's not necessarily walking away from the concept just the isolated community on this one medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was excited when it looked like many of the TD folks started speaking out against Trump. Not because of political reasons but because they broke the chains of bias. Which pushes things forward, they can have their viewpoints politically but they keep those separate and intake fact even if it's counter to their standing to better grasp the world.

       It's funny that there is in fact an infiltration of shills, obfuscating agents, and disinformation stooges in this sub, yet people complain that the problem is that the sub is somehow "pro-Trump."

       Does anyone ever see any positive Trump posts? Because I see about 5 negative ones a day and several like this.

       If you think indignantly pointing at someone and shouting "racist" is a worthwhile use of your time or energy, then you are no doubt triggered by T_D because for all their flaws they do a good job of making fun of spastic shitlibs.

Thats all they are, and it's the conservative presence here. We had conservatives and liberals coexisting around a single enemy.

       There's an immunological kinda response by TPTB to spread nonsense out, true.  But consider that they had already laid the groundwork for many of these narratives well before their use.  That they're having to use them all at once to muddy the water indicates that they've lost control.  As to debunking propaganda, it's like this - once an effective argument has been developed and "wins", it keeps on winning.  Given enough eyes on the subject domain by skeptical people who can articulate their thoughts accurately, cogently such that they can make repeated and testable predictions, then the propaganda loses.  That's actually happening, and has been happening for a while now.  If anything we need more hands on deck promulgating effective rebuttal, not more hands running away.

       Seems like you're getting a little too caught up in the left vs. right illusion. it doesn't matter who the president is. I think I am speaking for most of us on this sub when I say "We do not support Trump". Most of the folks who spend time on this sub realize that Trump and Clinton are on the same team at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has there been an influx of alleged "shills" and a huge increase in the amount of politicized posts on the sub in the last year? The answer is yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some of our fellow conspiracy buffs support Donald Trump? Yes.
Do some of them support Hillary Clinton? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this any reason to give up on trying to have rational and intelligent discussions about what's really going on in our world? HELL NO.

       And u/LarryHolmes is right. The anonymity of the internet is incredibly important. They want you to give up. That is their goal. Don't give up the fight!

       It's not necessarily about that.
It's become what politics once was.
Just bullshit in any thread that is sourced to some very blatantly biased source.
Which RARELY happened pre-TD showing up.

       You're mistaken. Maybe you're projecting. Maybe not, but you are mistaken nevertheless. However, you may just be misreading the idea of making a post which is to rally any of the true OGs of the sub to keep up their fight for truth and not fall into the blanketing of political bs the 2016 election brought.

       I didn't write it in a vague way. I stated my grievances and said goodbye to a community that was once really good.

       Think of it like a closing statement, or final paragraph. 
Maybe slightly more angry and cynical than it should be.

      <p>
       Also projecting doesn't mean you did something...you can project anything maybe you're a dramatic person I don't know. Maybe you're really cool and we just crossed on what you see as upsetting terms who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just asking you not assume or even project a false narrative. 
Even if it isn't projecting your personal stuff you can still project.
