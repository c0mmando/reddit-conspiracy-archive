<p>That actually points <em>more</em> towards it being a simulation. I don&#39;t even think most game designers even create things, they just reinstantiate various peices found in other levels/contexts. There is still creativity in that process, but it&#39;s never completely free, always a variation on the thing itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you treat the proton as a black hole spinning at c it rids the need for the strong nuclear force and in fact models confinement perfectly as simply gravity at.the quantum scale.</p>

<p>This obviously lines up with all observations that protons stick together despite being immensely positively charged.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simply replacing an invented force that we &#39;thought would have to be there&#39; of which we have no solution for (lqcd).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and the mass of a proton is 1.6726219 × 10<sup>-27</sup> kg, which doesn&#39;t make it a black hole considering it&#39;s radius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And where does the force that binds protons together come from?</p>

<p>One of these models can show confinement from first principles. The other is a whacked out attempt to backwards-fit something we have zero evidence for because we assumed that&#39;s how it would work. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder we have no solution to the strong nuclear force. That&#39;s because we invented it.</p>

<p>Let me ask you -</p>

<p>You understand the holographic principle and that you can calculate a black hole&#39;s entropy by dividing it&#39;s surface area by planck areas?</p>

<p>Why can I count # of planck areas on the proton surface (sphere with proton charge radius), divide the volume by planck length diameter sphere volumes, take the corresponding number of planck spheres on the surface and divide the volume and multiply by 2* planck mass for the exact mass of the proton?</p>

<p>10<sup>40</sup> fit on the surface. 10<sup>60</sup> in the volume. Dividing these and multiplying by the planck mass just so happens to yield the proton mass?</p>

<p>Further, if this is &#39;an accident&#39; why does the value get orders of magnitude closer when we substitute the proton&#39;s radius with the latest values from proton accelerator experiments?</p>

<p>Why does working backwards with a mass to deduce a radius practically zero in on these latest charge radius measurements?</p>

<p>The fact that these numbers are getting more accurate as our measurements get more accurate is absolutely evidence that Nassim&#39;s approach as a holographic black hole is correct - not to mention the astronomical chance that these numbers with 40-60 zeroes multiplied by the planck mass happen to yield anything close to the proton rest mass at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of entropic gravity. This is a working entropic gravity model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have zero observational or experimental evidence that a proton is spinning at near the speed of light.  Why not just say that?  I&#39;m not interested in your mathemagical numerology, just point me to an experiment or observation that shows the proton spinning at near the speed of light.</p>

<p>Failing that, I&#39;ll stick to the theory that has given us nuclear energy and (for better or worse) the atomic bomb over the one which is paying it&#39;s founder millions of dollars while simultaneously forcing people to pay thousands to access his supposed &quot;technological breakthroughs&quot;.</p>

<p>There is experimental proof in his prediction of the proton charge radius - which has been confirmed within one sigma.</p>

<p>You want proof protons spin at c, you need to look at the model. I want proof masses become black holes at their Schwarzschild Radius? I look at the model, because we have <em>no experimental proof</em>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we do see this. We simply call it the strong nuclear force, the immense attractive power that protons have to stick together though they are immensely positively charged.</p>

<p>Using a black hole proton spinning at c would provide the perfect mass dilation to keep protons stuck together, while at distances even a planck length away the dilation drops to the regular rest mass of the proton.</p>

<p>We get nowhere close to the planck length when measuring a proton, so we&#39;re not missing any mass Nassim derives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read, Tom Campbell seems to have it figured out, as well as Sylvester James Gates. Tom has his &quot;My Big T.O.E.&quot; (Theory of Everything), which is a fascinating idea as we all know. Essentially that everything is information, as mentioned in this thread. He goes into detail about the double slit experiment and its implications. Sylvester Gates only adds to this in that he mentions in a video online that Claude Shannon invented computer code in the 1940s that is also found in sting theory - basically that there is quite literally computer code, a series of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s, found in string theory. Just like what one would find in a browser online. Google &quot;Theoretical Physicist Finds Computer Code in String Theory&quot; and watch him explain it to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. </p>
