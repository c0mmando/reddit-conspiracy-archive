You&#39;ll see some. But the majority of comments in these threads dont trust a damn thing Putin says either. So I&#39;d love an explanation. </p>

<p>Very pro Trump posts don&#39;t even make the front page. When people post his tweets here, they get downvoted quickly. So let me get this straight, we have a balance here between people who trust Trump and people who dont...but somehow everybody trusts Putin and his state controlled media? Something is up. These votes aren&#39;t organic. </p>

<p>Claiming every single news organization that comes out of Russia is no different than claiming all American MSM is propaganda.</p>

<p>RT puts out some quality content. There&#39;s a reason Larry King and Ron Paul support them... and it&#39;s not because they&#39;re Russian spies.</p>

<p>As a conspiracy sub, it&#39;s important to analyze information from everywhere, and determine the value based on the actual information and not just because someone else deemed an entire organization as propaganda.</p>

<p>If someone starts posting RT articles about Putin&#39;s approval ratings, then sure go ahead and call bull shit bull shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehh I wouldn&#39;t go that far. That sounds like a direct course for confirmation bias. </p>

<p>I get what you mean about if the data is good, but &quot;data&quot; is such an overused term now that it&#39;s lost its meaning. If CNN or Salon writes an article with all their &quot;data&quot;, it really doesn&#39;t mean shit. Just like if a little-known conspiracy website gives &quot;data&quot;, you&#39;ve got to be very critical of it and make sure to trace the source as much as possible before it becomes credible. </p>

<p>In terms of Russia talking shit on the US in any form of media though, those are the stories that a lot of times are well sourced and provide a good amount of supporting data, mainly because the US is pretty easy to shit on. Just like it&#39;s easy for the US to shit on them with all the fucked up things their government does. Why are we to assume that when our government talks shit about Russia it is reliable, but when Russia talks shit about America it&#39;s all propaganda? </p>

<p>Just look at what Wikileaks released. EVEN IF IT WAS the result of Russian hackers, did they alter any emails? Insert falsified ones? No. They just released the actual words of an organization, and everyone lost their shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>good question.  I personally think lots of countries and corporations attempt to influence elections in all countries they have interests in.  The USA does it, and as I think it was Time magazine that published how we had influenced the Russian election to get Boris Yeltsin elected.  So who knows who did what first, doesn&#39;t matter.  </p>

<p>To say Russia mettled doesn&#39;t bother me.  If they are found to have actually hacked machines, or paid people to vote illegally, or something very easily provable illegal - that would make me feel there was a problem and I would definitely switch my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem broski :) Everyone is entitled to their beliefs and opinions and I&#39;ve found there is often good reasons for the way they think about things. I think it&#39;s more important to have civil dialogue with each other than trying to be divisive.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn&#39;t reply to you last night. I have family visiting so commenting and posting is kind of on the back burner right now, haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US State Dept and USAID-funded NGOs influence elections literally everywhere and also help to stage demonstrations, coups and so called &quot;color revolutions&quot;. They&#39;ve been doing this since the cold war and never stopped, only intensified it. They&#39;ve promoted some protests against Putin. Russia has been developing its own capabilities in response to that. Apparently both sides were recently in a meddling contest in Macedonia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a really good Reply All podcast recently about Russia&#39;s relationship with social media</p>

<p><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/100-friends-blasphemers/">https://gimletmedia.com/episode/100-friends-blasphemers/</a></p>

<p>Basically, Russian people were using LiveJournal to be very critical of the Putin government. The government tried to counteract this initially by posting there themselves only to find huge resistance from the general public. </p>

<p>Their solution...buy the company and threaten dissidents with jail.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/10/russian-owned-livejournal-bans-dissenting-speech-to-please-putin/">https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/10/russian-owned-livejournal-bans-dissenting-speech-to-please-putin/</a></p>

<p>The podcast has a great story about a politican wanting to appear as though he was helping put out forest fires in Russia. He posted that he had put out one fire. However, the LiveJournal community were insistent that there were no reported fires in that area at all so he must&#39;ve gone there to set the fire himself and then put it out.</p>

<p>Sounds like something on VEEP or The Thick of It</p>
