        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Backlash against our subreddit <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> from the greater Reddit community is hilarious.</p>

<p>You guys are really going to troll this subreddit and post all your little drama clique circles accusing us of being underhanded while the default mod crew is using tools like <a href="https://layer7.solutions">https://layer7.solutions</a> to have secret blacklists that their communities can&#39;t even know about?</p>

<p>/Conspiracy addressed the community before we made any decision about CNN, and we publish our mod logs for all to see.  So while you folks are coming over here to criticize us because you don&#39;t like how we manage our community, perhaps you should look at your own favorite community first.</p>

<p>If they don&#39;t have public logs then they are doing things you wouldn&#39;t approve of, you just don&#39;t know it.  If they are using meepsters tools, then they are blacklisting domains and you just aren&#39;t allowed to know about it.</p>

<p>Reddit even had to change their policies because of mods who were managing dozens of popular reddit&#39;s and using their position to ban users globally from all their subreddits because they don&#39;t like their speech.  </p>

<p>At least Conspiracy talks to it&#39;s users about what we are doing, we publish our logs and don&#39;t use our community as a launch pad to destructively force ourselves on other communities who don&#39;t want us there.</p>

<p>We didn&#39;t single out CNN for doxxing, we also don&#39;t allow links to voat&#39;s pizzagate community because of all the constant doxxing going on there.  We tried to manage it, we tried to allow voat&#39;s pizzagate links and check them each individually but it proved to be an impossible task.  What CNN did was worse than to dox someone, CNN published an ultimatum to what seemed like one person, but in reality was an ultimatum to everyone on the internet who wishes to remain anonymous.  </p>

<p>/Conspiracy is hardly the example of &quot;censorship&quot; (even though we still allow archives of CNN) on Reddit.  </p>

<p>Look at <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> which disallowed anything political as soon as SJWs started getting documented and embarrassed, yet still let the occasional political post slip through.  They disallowed police abuse videos but you sure as fuck can watch the police slip-n-slide with the neighborhood kids.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> which uses automod to maintain a blacklist of users they don&#39;t like to automatically remove their comments/posts.  </p>

<p>Look at /history which bans anyone who speaks of inconvenient histories for the infamous mod davidreiss666.  A mod who also was organizing the &quot;global ban list&quot; among default mods to keep unsavory users from being able to use hundreds of subs where they never even broke the rules.</p>

<p>Look at the #modtalkleaks where the actual admins of Reddit were rubbing elbows with default mods who were creating fake accounts to post racist material to /Conspiracy just so they could sit back and point at how we allow racist material.</p>

<p>Look at bipolarbear who took over the restorethe4th movement to make sure that it was ineffective.</p>

<p>Look how the admins won&#39;t let the_donald link to /politics but they let dozens of drama subs and &quot;I hate this sub&quot; subs constantly troll subreddits that aren&#39;t as precious to them as their dear /politics.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absurd that you&#39;re wasting your time complaining that we asked our community if they would support a CNN boycott. And then followed through on it.</p>

For example, it was a total lie that they forced to him apolize or else they&#39;d release his name. The records show he apolized first and then reached out to CNN. He wasn&#39;t a teenager. The whole story was breaking and the mods made their decision based on all the right-wing talking points.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not even 100% convinced that CNN didn&#39;t fabricate this Hans guy and his racist account history just for this debacle. Regardless, CNN sent out a pretty broad warning that they can and will doxx you if you say anything bad about them. That should make you very uncomfortable.</p>

Archive links dont change and you are going to have to give them a click to verify that the original matches the archive. Use them as backups but not the main source. So I still dont understand why its banned at all. The other mods have been citing falsehoods as reason for the ban. One cited Junlian Assange as an authority on the US Code. Hell they even went as far as in this thread and the sticky that they got with the community about this when they didnt. It went from a sticky on the top of the main thread on the CNN story saying they were thinking about it to a sticky about how CNN links are now banned. No discussion thread. If you had not clicked on that CNN story and read the sticky you get blind sided by news that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is now banning links to CNN.</p>

<p>A boycott group effort is volunteer, this is not, this is being forced on everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just a hyperbolic statement with no content. It is not being forced nor is it on everyone.   When an organization decides to boycott...say a University decides not to invest in Israel, that decision does not reflect the wishes of every member, but decision is made on an organization level, and is bound on the members of that organization.  That does not stop it from being a boycott. </p>

<p>In other words a collective decision does not change something from being a boycott.   Moreover, you are free to share content.  You think CNN wrote some amazing piece of investigative journalism - by all means share it. Just archive it first and share the archived link. </p>

<p>There is no force. Abiding by norms in any community is not force. Especially ones where participation is voluntary.  You can of course submit links to CNN all you want as no one is forcing you not to, but if you want to share content then archive it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant you don&#39;t need for a ban to be hard-coded for you to be able to individually avoid linking/clicking on CNN domains.</p>

<p>So the ban is meant for people who 1) don&#39;t agree with it 2) are too stupid/lazy to use archive.is despite the numerous and regular posts here explaining why it is always preferable not to link directly to the MSM.</p>

<p>It de-responsibilizes people also. Like laws that force you to wear a helmet on a motorbike, or a seat-belt in the car; rules protecting people from theirnown idiocy.</p>

<p>Also I dislike this collective emotion/outrage about something we don&#39;t know is real, and if it is, which pales in comparison with the war crimes CNN is an accomplice of. It seems trivial and ephemerous, even manufactured. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware that the US regime is the successor to the 19th-century British maritime empire, if you haven&#39;t noticed illegal wars of aggression being started and prosecuted, whether overtly or through proxies, under false pretenses against Afghanistan, Irak (twice), Lybia, Syria, Ukraine, Sudan, Yemen, Pakistan (drone war), Somalia, and others... you have been paying too much attention to the Kardashians.</p>

<p>Also, if you keep regurgitating the preposterous state-peddled conspiracy theory about bearded acrobatic pilots who pulverize 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum airplanes (not without remembering to throw their passports out of the cockpit window)... well in that case you should probably start with the very beggining and go back to elementary school (where I suppose you should have learned about the fundamental laws of nature).</p>

<p>&quot;Muh slippery slope.&quot;</p>

<p>I have heard this same post worded almost exactly the same posted in different threads on this subreddit, all with different user names. Weird!</p>

<p>The subreddit can do what it wants. No information is being censored. If you want CNN to get ad clicks so badly, feel free to go to their website and click on as many clickbait fake news headlines as you want to.</p>

<p>Absolutely nothing is stopping you.</p>

<p>And there is no censorship here. CNN has not been &quot;banned.&quot; You can still post CNN links, just archive them first. If you don&#39;t want to follow the rules or don&#39;t agree with them, make your opinion known and stop posting on this subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I really hope it gets much worse because I see what technologies are being developed for both, public (open source) and private use (I consult a few of them and, ironically, one company is located in Russia and they pay me with bitcoin), that will make censorship obsolete. Right now it seems bad but it really isn&#39;t. Once it becomes literally intolerable, you can be sure as hell these technologies will roll out and take over. There are a few issues that must be ironed out across the board but the concept is there and it&#39;s damn good. I&#39;m currently negotiating with a few companies to let me create a decentralized intranet in their premises and educate on the type of content they must put out and how to structure it. As of right now they seem very open to the idea.</p>

<p>However, technology can only do you so much good and none of them can address the vital issue - social aspect. New generations have been indoctrinated into compliance and you can trust me on one thing - echo chambers will only get worse because they will become even more niche.</p>

<p>Western ideology is dying and people don&#39;t even know it. We are forced to concentrate on petty issues that don&#39;t stand near the systemic problems. Open up a 20+ year plan of your country and compare it to what you read in the news. 2 and 2 don&#39;t add up. We don&#39;t know how to think anymore because everything that doesn&#39;t support the popular narrative is a conspiracy. Our language is being fucked with. Literally the single most important tool that makes all other tools useless is becoming endangered. People are getting worse at long term thinking. If I recall all studies I&#39;ve consumed, the average is 4 days. 4 fucking days!!! But it makes sense because it&#39;s not good to have a nation of people who can say &quot;Stop! How does this help our long term plan?&quot; It&#39;s better to have a nation of useful idiots that will seek confirmation from their authority. Sadly, parents and teachers are one of the main causes of this.</p>

<p>There is a sad story for my last point. I met a few friends from high school and they had their kids with them. They were at the ripe age of 4-6. The age of questioning. Once they started asking questions, they were given incorrect determinate answers. I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and sat down with the kid who seemed to be having a spaz attack because the answer didn&#39;t suit him and he was told to shut up. I asked him, &quot;Tell me what do you think is the correct answer.&quot; He went on to explaining his reasoning with the limited amount of vocabulary he had and he did a good job. Meanwhile the parent made a remark &quot;What does he know? He&#39;s just a child.&quot; Apparently the child had a fucking theory that was quite good. The irony was that he saw the news and asked why did people go and protest. Sure, he struggled and it took him probably 15 minutes to say 4 coherent sentences but that&#39;s because he wasn&#39;t trained to do so. I ended up having a conversation with the child for an hour because his parents seemed preoccupied talking about petty bullshit. Oh, the irony. Right now I try to meet with the parent and the child each month or so not because I like the parent but because the child asked me to. It&#39;s been a year now and the kid seems to be coming up with a philosophy that&#39;s similar to stoicism. He just doesn&#39;t know it yet and I won&#39;t put any words in his mouth. He will be brilliant when he grows up.</p>

<p>A few things you can do?</p>

<p>1) Stop consuming news of any kind. They don&#39;t matter. News will come to you if you are where you need to be. If news are relevant only for a day or two or maybe a week, those aren&#39;t news. Yet we are told from the college years that we must be informed. Why? To hold a meaningless conversation about how you feel about the news that you don&#39;t know anything about. Yes, I reddit and sometimes open up a news article and make a comment but those are rare occasions when I feel bored. Most of the news I get from conversations with people I know to be intelligent. It was a shock to them when I asked them &quot;Tell me in a few sentences what was reported last month across the board.&quot; &quot;But don&#39;t you want to know the details?&quot; &quot;No, because it doesn&#39;t affect the big picture.&quot; Now we&#39;ve taken all industries, divided them up among ourselves, and now we conduct meetings every month about it. It&#39;s damn effective and my mind has never been clearer after distancing myself from the everyday news.</p>

<p>2) Read relevant books on the topic of your interest. Yes, it significantly limits your ability to be informed about other topics but again, why do you care? You shouldn&#39;t. You have no practical application to the consumed information whatsoever so why do you even bother?</p>

<p>3) Talk to people you know you&#39;re going to disagree with initially. If you&#39;ve determined both of you can hold a conversation for longer than 30 minutes, go ahead and pick apart each other. Learn about logical fallacies and abstain from using them. We all do it at some point in time because we all are flawed, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t minimize the usage.</p>

<p>4) Stop following the herd and I&#39;m looking at you college students. Do not get an MBA, for example, right after graduating. Get a fucking job, work for a few years and then see if you really need an MBA. Right now it&#39;s the other way around and it&#39;s especially prevalent in parts of Europe with the highest youth unemployment. Ironically, your chances of getting a job are much better without an MBA because once you have that degree you will be severely limited physically and psychologically when looking for a job.</p>

<p>this is - imho - the best advice there is out there. This will help you to grow a bigger picture, help your debate-skills (not in the sense &quot;ha, i win dis debate!&quot; but more &quot;we actually both gained something out of this, because we could reflect on each others logical mistakes&quot;) and much more. Be tolerant and patient. Don&#39;t just &quot;u suck&quot; and move away, if you disagree. If you heavily disagree with a claim, ask for the reasoning behind the claim. (shills won&#39;t provide reasoning, they will jump to another topic. look up the gentleman&#39;s guide to forum spy&#39;s)</p>

<p>People simply do not think, and are trained from a young age not to. It sickens me to see parents have that attitude with their own kids (and with themselves, honestly). Kids should be treated like the future adults they are, and encouraged to go with their natural inclination to question everything and think things through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It saddens me as well but we can&#39;t do much about it at scale. Yes, I talk to the kid each month for a few hours and we both have a blast. He learns new, complicated words with the correct meaning he came up with and I learned a few new ways to describe actions and processes. The parent recently divorced and is beginning to slip into a depression and his family has a history of alcoholism. I try to help him get his shit together but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s working. If it comes to it, I will adopt the kid right away. Anyway, even if I talk to the kid for a few hours, he spends the rest of his time with his dad who isn&#39;t a role model.</p>

<p>Feel free to disagree with me, in my opinion the only thing you actually can do is find a group of like-minded people, bond with them, have as many children as it&#39;s possible, create a sense of belonging, and for the love of God don&#39;t let outsiders in unless it&#39;s planned. Adopting kids is a tricky thing because genetics play a big role in child development and you might end up with unexpected results unless you spend a lot of time with the child before adopting. Yes, it&#39;s possible your own child would become a monster when he grows up but at least you get to control more aspects of his life. The only way to beat the elite is by becoming the elite. I see no other way.</p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, he agreed to do so in the first place and CNN said if he backs out of the agreement, they would reveal his identity.  This isn&#39;t a &#39;threat&#39;, this is holding somebody accountable for an agreement they entered into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I existed before the_donald and I hated the MSM before the_donald existed.  This is not a subreddit subservient to the_donald.</p>

<p>Secondly, everyone can plainly see that the government is basically in revolt against POTUS Trump, the intelligence agencies, the Republican party, the Democratic party, the deep state, the media etc etc.  So pretending like Trump represents the entire government and everything wrong about it is naive or disingenuous.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to imagine why many people in this sub (regulars) would have some hope about Trump considering that we have been critical of all these groups who are trying to undo Trump.  All this existed before the_donald, so again we aren&#39;t a subreddit subservient to the_donald.</p>

<p>There is an obvious paradox here when supporting the government could mean you Support all these agencies who are rebelling against Trump or that supporting the government could mean you Support the current executive branch.</p>

<p>Denying that this paradox exist is fallacious.  You must speak in more clear terms than &quot;government bad&quot;.  That being said, there is no rule against supporting the government here, in fact I think we all want a government.  We just want a government with much less corruption! Preferably no corruption at all!</p>

How he has pushed to give tax cuts to the ultra rich, has place incompetents and the ultra rich in his administration, has time after time bent over backwards for Putin, who by the way has been doing deep state shit a long time, and who has pushed a white nationalist agenda since day one?

<p>But seriously, you don&#39;t think a sub named &quot;conspiracy&quot; is actually on par with say serious factual information?
Not that there aren&#39;t conspiracies, of course there are, every day, it&#39;s just that the whole &quot;sheep/awake/woke/monsanto/thimersal/ depopulation stuff gets woven into it all and makes it cringe worthy quite often.</p>

<p>Especially the obvious gaffs where people choose youtube as their original source instead of scientific journals etc and also playing the distrust game is kind of lame.</p>

<p>1) It&#39;s a cheap way to just shut down any debate.  Someone disagrees with me SHILL, someone has an unpopular (or popular) opinion SHILL, someone is skeptical of <em>your</em> narrative SHILL, etc....the list goes on and on.  Just engage (or don&#39;t) on the argument or disagreement.  If you don&#39;t have the ability to point out obvious inconsistencies or made-up talking points, that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>2) You don&#39;t know if they are a shill or if they just have strong beliefs in something you dislike or think is stupid</p>

<p>3) everyone can look at a users posting history, it&#39;s not secret stuff</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t what I was told when I posted a document showing that the tactics used against the CFC ban are the exact same tactics used when talking about global warming.  It was removed and when I appealed the ban was upheld.  The reason for the ban - too political.</p>

<p>The rules we have to follow are not fully documented, enforced in a totally opaque fashion, and are not fairly enforced.</p>

<p>Side note.  I have received two private messages saying they are going to downvote your response to make it look like it was me.  It isn&#39;t.  This sub is getting worse every day and nothing is being done to stop it.</p>

<p>As I explained to you here, you can easily question or criticize a mod without calling them names and they will probably be more than happy to talk to you about it.  </p>

<p>Some people seem to think they only way to respond to something they don&#39;t like is to go full scorched Earth and call them every name in the book and basically start a witch hunt.</p>

<p><strong>But let&#39;s play, you have my explicit permission to say what&#39;s on your mind, I ask that all other mods do not take any punitive action based on this user&#39;s next reply.</strong></p>

Whether it&#39;s an individual not speaking out due to fear of social repercussions or, in this case, individuals protecting their world view at all costs.  I will tell you, as an individual probably older than most on here, self policing is much less prevalent than it was 20 years ago. Keep up the good fight everyone!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I apologize for calling you &quot;fuckface.&quot; You&#39;re not a fuckface, whatever that is. But my original criticism still stands:</p>

<p>When there is an army of posters who are attempting to pull emotional strings about people who are of little or no consequence in the American or international power structure, one thing is clear: there&#39;s an agenda. Who sets this agenda? I couldn&#39;t say, but it&#39;s telling that members of the current WH are nowhere to be found in the r/conspiracy sub. This is especially alarming when we have continuing corroboration of extremely suspicious contacts. </p>

<p>Where is General Mike Flynn on the board? Nowhere in sight. It&#39;s not even in dispute that he had to retroactively register as an agent of a foreign country. Nor is it possible to deny Flynn was in fact in contact with Russian hackers through intermediaries. This stinks to high heaven as the biggest political scandal in US history, yet here it&#39;s brushed away as if it&#39;s unsubstantiated or inconsequential. There are serious amounts of money exchanging hands in efforts to undermine democracy in many Western nations by what appears to be a group of rich assholes. At the same time, cryptocurrencies are making waves in the banking world, massive pedophile rings are being uncovered in Europe, the biomarkers of fascism are everywhere in the political organism, and the sub here supposedly dedicated to uncovering nefarious/illegal power plays has nothing better to do than flood the board with irrelevant nonsense about Clinton. Give me fucking break.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say what the top posts <strong>should</strong> be, but I can say what a concerted effort at distraction looks like. It&#39;s happening here. This strategy of distraction may work against some people, but it&#39;s clearly a strategy of coverup by red herring us to death.</p>

<p>Then use archive.org. If both are down, we have a <em>far</em> more serious problem on our hands then banning CNN links, but if it makes you happy, I&#39;ll vote to unban it then. </p>

<p>There is no force. Abiding by norms in any community is not force. Especially ones where participation is voluntary.  You can of course submit links to CNN all you want as no one is forcing you not to, but if you want to share content then archive it. </p>

<p>No they didn&#39;t, he agreed to do so in the first place and CNN said if he backs out of the agreement, they would reveal his identity.  This isn&#39;t a &#39;threat&#39;, this is holding somebody accountable for an agreement they entered into.</p>
