       The rape accusation was "privately verified" by mods before being deleted.
O'Neal also posted proof of contact with Alefantis in other YouTube videos on his channel.

       He goes on to prove that the number was in fact Alefantis' and that he filed a report with the FBI.
Do your research.

       I created the Antinous sub to serve as a reference for some materials I found in my searches, nothing more. You should read them, you might learn Antinous is not actually held in high esteem by pedophiles but is actually held in high esteem by the gay community because a Roman emperor deified (that means "made into a God") him after his death - because he loved him, not because he was a teenager.

       It's sad that you're going to be called a shill by default because people are so entrenched in their viewpoints and "protecting morality" that they're incapable of engaging in conversation anymore. It's reassuring to see someone talk around someone in such nice concentric circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember back when the right-wing insult of choice was mocking "feels over reals," but it seems that's where all this unsubstantiated appeal to morality is going. I have yet to see
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       fact that connects CPP to pedophilia beyond a reasonable doubt. ONE. If that's so difficult then maybe you're wasting time drawing lines in the sand.

       As a classical history guy, do some research. Shit was common place then, and was not the same thing as pedophilia. The Spartan army was founded on it. It was viewed as more normal than love between a man and woman in some instances.

       It seems like a larp because
       <a href="/u/AbortionBurger">
        /u/AbortionBurger
       </a>
       was intimately involved in the AMA. There is also the question of the mysterious account called
       <a href="/u/JamesAlefantis">
        /u/JamesAlefantis
       </a>
       which showed up shortly after the thread was created seen here

        http://archive.is/u4cXv
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy never made a complaint to police therefore Alefantis has nothing to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also be aware
       <a href="/u/SVMESSEFVIFVTVRVS">
        /u/SVMESSEFVIFVTVRVS
       </a>
       doesn't appear in these threads to back up your story perhaps because AbortionBurger doxxed him in her steemit article so he very possibly is afraid of being charged with libel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some sound logic in the link you posted
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First off, a screenshot with someone's face is not proof of anything. It's a proof that he is a human, and that he controls the reddit account. It doesn't prove he worked at CPP, it doesn't prove that Alefantis sexually assaulted him. I could post a screenshot of my face and username and claim that I was raped by Jesus himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, you're going to have to bring way more reliable evidence than a screencap of a facebook conversation with the faces blacked out. Those are stupidly easy to fake, and we have no confirmation of anything that man is saying. Absolutely no way to verify anything independently.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know this is a conspiracy sub and a lot of it is theory, but please have some form of standards with what you call evidence.

       Alefantis said Bucks fishing and camping has a basment - not Comet Ping Pong.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Last year, Alefantis estimates, he bought 12 tons of Toigo tomatoes, which Stello turned into sauce and canned before trucking the jars to the basement at Buck's Fishing &amp; Camping, Alefantis' other restaurant nearby.

       The article is from 2013 and as far as I can see has always referred to a basment in Buck's. It's also not a Washington Post article.

       Wtf part of your “evidence” is that he makes is own pizza sauce from fresh local tomatoes? You’ve clearly never worked in a restaurant because nothing about that at all is odd. We used canned Mariano’s at my work all the time. But when we can get in fresh local tomatoes for cheap guess what we make our own sauce.

       Workplace sexual abuse accusations that aren't followed up by law enforcement are generally spurious complaints from disgruntled or jilted employees, unless there is some credible claim or conspiracy in addition to the accusation I don't think it means much.

       Not OP, so hard to answer. But I work at a higher education institution and things like this happen from time to time. If it happens within employment (ie, and employee to another employee) it is usually swept under the rug and the accused will be sent to some sort of rehabilitation seminar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police usually only get involved if it has to do with students and other students, or students and faculty.

       Just pointing out your hypocrisy. You think Alefantis got away with one instance of sexual harassment that was never even brought to police because of his position of power/influence. Yet for Trump the same rules seem not to apply.

       You aren't pointing out hypocrisy.  You are changing the subject so that we talk about Trump.  I assume you get double the money if you defend your boss' ex boyfriend while at the same time saying something negative about Trump.  Kudos.

       Somehow they've worked it in their narrative that if you are researching Pedogate, Seth Rich or Wikileaks, it's pro-Trump. Now It's also Pro-Trump to be against corporations stifling free speech or questioning the MSM.

       Actually I did see the instagram accounts. Most of the photos of the "kids" was actually of one kid, a girl, Alefantis' god daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should be alarming for you is the fact that the photo in which Pizzagaters claimed was a "chicken lovers" pederast insinuation was not. It wasn't a boy in the man's arms but a girl—again, Aelfantis' god daughter. See how they twist things?

       Look up the documentary "chickenhawks" - It's an original NAMBLA documentary released years before pizzagate, which proves Alefantis knew the pedophile terminology and was referencing children.

       I know about chickenhawks as pederast lingo. You haven't thought about what I just told. I repeat: the child in the photo with the "chicken lovers" depiction is not a boy. It's a girl. If the man is a chicken hawk lover, it would mean he loves little boys, so why is a little girl in his arm? Makes no sense.

       There's no proof that's his god daughter other than Alefantis' word. For a "truther" such as yourself you think you'd provide some proof of relation and gender (other than an interview where Alefantis says it's his god daughter) or maybe refute the actual claims in this post.

       Hmmm, maybe the comment at the end could be described as an ad hominem, but the first part of my comment certainly could not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its purely semantics to go into whether the photo is of a boy or girl.  An objective and rational person would simply say what the fuck is someone using pedo code in the comments of photos containing children.  Many other photos posted where highly questionable as well.  The subject is absolutely putrid, and I would be highly suspicious of anyone posting this kind of material.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact the Dr defends this disgusting shit so passionately is highly suspicious as well.

       If what the photo depicts is semantics why is it presented as proof of wrongdoing further up the thread? It's only proof until something very obviously doesn't add up about the evidence then it's just "semantics." Pretty obvious your mind is made up regardless of what the evidence says.

       I addressed the content of your message so no absolutely not ad hominem, I swear you people just reuse the last thing said about you to counter-accuse. You've got a great role model for that. The only thing I'm defending are logical defensible positions, which PG does not have. The evidence vanishes to the slightest scrutiny see this comment thread for more info.

       Instagram is creepy but so benign its laughable. To call that "evidence" beyond rational thought. I find the witch hunt of pizzagate far more disturbing than any "evidence" I have been shown.

       You should defend people who seemingly committed no crime from being harassed. Hasn't this been going on for nearly a year? How many times does a "theory" about this need to be disproven and the goal posts moved? I don't get it.

       And
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is precisely why Podesta, Alefantis, Luzatto, et al are 100% percent in their strategy to not give you greasy fuckholes the steam off of their shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched pizzagate shitbags whine and cry for over 6 months now....
       <em>
        "oooohhhh, why doesn't Podesta just answer these questions?  Why doesn't Alefantis just address his instagram photos?"
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is obvious... it's because fucktards like yourself will NEVER be satisfied with any explanation.  You demand honesty from these people, while simultaneously claiming that they are the biggest liars and scumbags on the planet.  What would they possibly have to gain by engaging with stupid?
      </p>
      <p>

       Actually, most of that "sexualized imagery" was on another Instagram account, but the pictures were tagged with Comet Ping Pong.

       No, that was yet another Instagram account and the "coffin" was a

       Maybe you'll think about how you might have been misled by hundreds of internet stalkers following links to friends of friends of Podesta, then taking things out of context to make them seem sinister, when they're not.

       The most disturbing images too me are the ones tagged cum panda.

      <p>
       A cum panda being the practice of punching someone in the face after they have just made you cum giving them two black eyes like a panda.

       But no concerns about someone with this fetish tying children too tables and sharing the images with his perverse buddies.

       There are thousands of people who think the Earth is flat, and no amount of overwhelming evidence or proof that will convince them otherwise. And why the fuck would "pizza boy" bother to respond to your ludicrous claims? Responding to them would only further fan the flames; anything this guy says or does is going to garner your immediate paranoia. Instead of actually doing something productive, such as helping law enforcement with
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       pedophilia cases or contributing to a charity, you sit behind your computer and bring down contributing members of society simply because...
       <em>
        I don't even know why

       So once again, this goes back to Doxxing a minor. How do you not realize that is fucked up? Why should these people have their privacy broken any further because of you? If he showed the girl, you'd say the picture was old. If he proved it were recent, you'd say it wasn't the same girl because her hair is just slightly the wrong color. Once again, I reiterate that
       <em>
        there is no amount of evidence that would convince you otherwise
       </em>
       . You've already swallowed the Kool-Aid.

       These people have been victimized by delusional conspiracy warriors like yourself for long enough. Leave them the fuck alone, if they did something wrong then the FBI will be all over it.

       The funny thing about this is we have a sitting President who is

       No, we go back to the fact that you have proven

        nothing

       In my experience, someone who goes right to that point is often projecting their feelings onto others.  Unless he is a psychologist, which I don't think he is.  He created the sexualization himself, his mind went there, no one elses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that is not "literally just" anything.  If I meant that, I would have literally said that.  I think you need to get a dictionary.

        <em>

       people who cry projection are projecting their projection issues onto the person the projector is accusing of being the projector. Or in short "I know you are but what am I?"

       So there's no sexualization on the guys instagram account and you're all crazy? So pizzagate is really just a bunch of broken sad dorks whipping their dicks out and shouting over nothing? Or is their something sexual in nature going on here that you guys noticed and found yourselves meaning... oh no! That means you guys are the broken sexual deviants! The real pizzagate was calling from inside the house!

       Yes it is. Maybe you shouldn't let yourself be fooled by big dictionary. Or maybe you shouldn't be a pedantic dweeb who makes his argument look worse by getting pouty over a contestable use of the word "literally".

       How do you know my experience? That's a neat trick. Your word salad and insane justifications aren't helping you. What you wrote was complete and utter bullshit and shows that you don't really understand how projection works in the first place. But you can break it down to a simplified completely incorrect statement if that makes you feel better, or smarter.
 I'll say it, pizzagate is bullshit.  Yes, you are a bunch of sad dorks shouting over nothing.  The leaps you guys make skirt the edges of sanity. A bunch of sad 20 somethings with hero complexes that come from too many pokemon and naruto cartoons.  Proof is in the pudding, and you don't have any.
      </p>
      <p>
       No its not.  You can make up whatever definition you want but that doesn't make it true.  It's kind of funny that you think your argument is stronger because you used a word incorrectly.  Communication matters.

       You ask that she be identified, and paraded around to disprove your completely lacking in evidence claim that she's dead.  S'funny.  People only know about his instagram (for the most part) because you guys decided pizzagate was the realist thing that was ever real, and decided to take apart every thing related to the guy in an attempt to prove he's a pervert.  So, we go back to the start: doxxing a little girl is fine.  Doxxing  racist is a horrific invasion of privacy.

       Til: no evidence of being a pedophile means you're 100% a pedophile, and that person should have every aspect of his life exposed (despite being a private citizen).  Doxxing a racist is beyond the pale, and should never be done for any reason.

       In that case I wish CNN had revealed his name. I assumed it was because they found some extenuating circumstance that convinced them it wasn't worth it. Instead, they're shielding some middle-aged assbag because he doesn't want his family to know he's a racist, homophobic piece of shit.

       I'm not sure why you think it's a non-issue. The President retweeted this guy's content. This guy is a seriously bigoted person. It's a huge story to know whether the President was aware of the long history of racism and discrimination from this guy and the online Trump community writ large, and whether he agrees with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you found out that Trump frequented Stormfront, wouldn't you want to know to what extent that reflects their beliefs? Cause T_D isn't far from that.

       Wait, what? The President's campaign chair was retweeting "muh holocaust" memes during the campaign. The President himself has been sued for racial discrimination, has a long history of expressed racist attitudes, and just retweeted a meme that either he or a staffer found by following a person on a reddit sub with his and its own long history of racism and discrimination. The whole fucking thing points strongly to Trump's attitudes towards race and religion
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       being highly suspect. All the right people? Like who? People are quitting the Trump white house left and right because he doesn't listen to them. For fuck's sake, his ethics chair just resigned because he couldn't work with Trump. Not to mention the incredibly damaging behavior around the Russian allegations - even if you don't believe that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the election, Trump's behavior in handling the ongoing investigation has been at least dishonest and authoritarian, if not downright illegal. If Obama or Clinton had done
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of this the right would literally be in the streets calling for them to be impeached
       <em>
        and they would have been right to do so.
       </em>
       So please explain to me how Trump continuing his habit of furthering extreme white nationalist ideas from extreme white nationalist communities is a fucking non issue. You're a sheep or a troll and I personally don't have respect for either.

       If I say millions of people believe the earth is flat or there is quite literally a man in the clouds or above the clouds looking down in them, it doesn't validate shit. Numbers without reasonable premises means nothing. You should understand. You have numbers in beliefs, but no backbone to the their substantiation.

       The same rhetoric is used against any conspiracy; I don't think it's specific to this case. If you believe in one conspiracy, you believe them all; if you entertain one conspiracy, it means you're off the rails and need help and a danger to society. The typical stereotyping the brain does. I usually ignore what people say and just check things out myself, make a decision that way.

       It's not that, it's the desperate rationalisation of every idea they have. Had an idea once about something, never saw a single reason to believe it's true, but because it hasn't been proven wrong to my satisfaction we must go to extreme measures to fix the problem.
      </p>

       If you can rationalise extreme measures based on nothing more than an opinion, you can rationalise other extreme measures.

       Because if you make a joke about a mexican, while playing on sterotypes, that's racist.  What's the difference between "a lazy mexican spends all day not working, except on his tan" and "A lazy guy spends all day not working, except on his tan"  the first one is racist (and very mildly funny, but not because of the racist language) and the second one is just as funny, but doesn't involve racial stereotypes about mexicans.  If you're making a joke about an ethnic minority, you should really try to redo it to remove racist language.  If you can't remove the racist language and still have the joke be "funny", chances are it's a racist joke.

       It's impossible to tell someone's intention on a reddit post that solely contains the racist joke.  I admit that I sometimes make inappropriate jokes (like when I say that Obama committed the crime of being black while presidenting, to highlight the absurdity of people who actually make that claim), but the totality of my posts on this site would hopefully show that I'm not a racist, or that I at least try not to be (there's always some inherent biases due to privilege, which isn't to beat people over the head about it, it's just that you don't always know something's wrong if you never experience it in a negative context.)  If all my posts were "absurdist" takes on racial jokes, then how can you tell the difference between me, and a racist who's posting those joke non-ironically?

       All I'm saying is that making racist jokes is a separate thing from being racist. Sure they can be linked or correlated and you can't tell people's intentions over the internet, but making a joke or intentionally dumb/troll comments doesn't mean somebody is a racist.

       That's not the only place he made those "jokes." He also advocated for doxxing. I personally hope someone leaks his personal information.

       All you have to do is compare the photos. In some of the photos, she is younger, and in others older. But most of them are of her, Caris James, the god daughter of Alefantis. Surely, even an amateur investigator would have compared the photos and seen this obvious fact, yet how come none of the Pizzagaters have done this?

       Have you actually gone to the "chicken lovers" hashtag on Twitter? It's not a pedo hang out, it's a foodie hangout. This is consistent with the Podesta emails.

       Right, and all these accusations are false, along with the Wikileaks dumps, the Instagram posts and all the lies from Alefantis.

       /s
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to really be ahead of the game, as well as ahead of Wikileaks and Alefantis' perverted social media to come up with something like pizzagate, seeing as it literally stemmed from the Podesta emails. Do 20 minutes of reaearch on VOAT or Steemit and you'll know it's more than "fake news".
      </p>
      <p>
       What about Alefantis' buddy who makes children's coffins? What about the fact he attends Rothschild dinners? What about the fact he has NEVER adressed any of the controversial claims against him, like the kill room post, the chickenlover post, the cumpanda post or the other numerous perverted social media posts?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the fact he owns at least 4 properties in DC being a college dropout? Literally no post grad education. He also has a restaurant in Berlin (human trafficking central) called Nalu diner.

       I never said it was all false. I am simply saying that to blindly accept it all is foolish. And to not be suspicious of glaring holes like that one girl was in most of the instragram photos, the fake, forged pedo code, is very alarming. Again, truthers don't behave this way.

       The god daughter of James Alefantis is Caris James. Just search for her, then compare all of the Instagram photos and you will see for yourself that she is in most of the photos. Keep in mind, though, that she appears in the photos at different ages in her life. For example, she sometimes appears as a baby, then at other times as a toddler, like in the "chicken lovers" photo.

       I just got around to seeing this, thanks for the answer, that is damning. I understand if you don't want to reply after two weeks but the main part that I was troubled by and couldn't ignore was the fact there was three stores on one street with pedo symbols in their logos. Not looking to argue, I'd just like to be firmly on one side or the other about this

       Those "pedo" symbols are very commonly used without connections to pedophilia. But the Pizzagaters don't want people to know about it because it doesn't fit their predetermined conclusions.

       I don't think Roger Stone has anything to do with the fact that Luzatto emailed Podesta to pimp her children. Or that she maintains a blog that sells 'raw uncut uncensored!' baby pictures. This is the smoking gun. I just found the blog evies crib. Check it out.

       Let's examine how investigative journalism used to work using Watergate. 
People contacted reporters for the Washington Post. They made accusations that there was a robbery and a coverup. They did not have proof. Because the reporters heard the same information from two sources, so they printed the allegations. However, still nothing was proved. 
The newspaper reports put pressure on members of the government, called Congress, to open an investigation into the executive branch. 
Still no proof.  Someone said their may be taped recordings of conversations in the White House. Finally physical proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the President was impeached. The President's crime was not the original robbery, it was the cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get it?
Step One: Testimony and Circumstantial evidence
Step Two: Investigative make allegations based on more than one source. Based on testimony and circumstantial evidence.
Step Three: A legal authority opens an investigation
Step Four: Find PROOF of crimes and cover-up.
Stop Five: Punish crimes.

       As you can see, there's nothing unusual about the photos
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the father tries to make humorous remarks on nearly every picture. People are trying to insinuate that there's something sinister about the phrase "raw and uncut", but that's just the way he writes.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Well, after looking at the header on the archive.is page, I figured out there are more pages archived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the biggest group of pictures:
       <a href="https://archive.is/2g30Y">
        https://archive.is/2g30Y
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, there's nothing suspicious about
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <a href="https://archive.is/8PZDn">
        here is the first post on the blog:

        another one from that day:

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, it is the father who made the site.

       The "raw and uncut" comment is in the header of the page - it's a joke. Read the blog, the father talks in a jovial tongue in cheek manner throughout.

       Luzatto whatever is a former Clinton aide who sent emails to Podesta. Podesta is good friends with Alefantis who owns comet ping pong. We've spoken b4 so I already know who you are so I think that's good enough reason to not believe what you say. :) anyway toodles.

       My bad can't link anything. But a time mag article reports there were multiple shots that damaged a closet containing computer equipment.

       I also saw somewhere in this thread a picture of what appears to be a hard drive with a bullet hole. Looked like it was a picture from a fox news report

       I'm convinced that sometimes conspirators bank on this happening--"They wouldn't do that...so they probably didn't." Just look at 9/11. You don't need to be a genius to figure most of the corrupt bullshit out, you just need to question authority and do a bit of research.
      </p>

       Just saying... I wouldn't be surprised if they get their jollies off of leaving obvious flaws and banking on the populace just never doing thorough research and never questioning official stories on T.V.

      <p>
       LAPD involvement in the Cecil Hotel Elisa Lam case is also disgustingly obvious, yet all it takes is a mental diagnosis and an official story and the case is closed.

       Um .. that hard drive thing didn't happen. But more importantly, there was no reasons to do it. Owner of the pizzeria could've just thrown the HD away (or hammer it to pieces, then throw away), and say it stopped working.

       He has 7 upvotes. You have 25.
It is always this way when people deny pizzagate. 
Only here though. In real life people see what's going on. 
That's why the shilling is starting to lose it's effect.
It's not realistic.

       How does this prove that the hard drive was hit by the bullet though?
 He would've had to fire directly down into the case to hit it from that entry point, and the closet was locked. I would assume that the bullet passed diagonally through the case from the front to back, which makes it difficult to imagine that it was able to hit the hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going for a conspiracy angle, it seems far more likely that this was a false flag to discredit Pizzagate. There are more reliable and effective ways to destroy hard drives that don't involve attracting a large amount of police and media attention. For all we know, the hard drive is sitting there still in perfect condition- it's not like the police are investigating him.

       I tend to think it was probably a "false flag" to get sympathy for the pizza place)it's owner and therefore link anyone investigating it as hurtful people who are ruining these people's lives, etc. That's not a stretch at all, and it worked to a degree. These people run off the same playbook time and time again and once you familiarize yourself with it it's not that hard to spot things like this.

       Trust me we aren’t shills. We are people with critical thinking skills seeing no evidence whatsoever. Show legitimate evidence and maybe someone would believe this theory, but until then I will continue to treat it like the ramblings of insane people

       But there’s a slight chance the bullet was purposely shot through the door and hit possibly on the right spot on the computer case. Clear evidence they were trying to destroy evidence. Don’t even get me started on how fishy it is that a pizza place sells cheese pizza

       I'm still very skeptical on the whole thing. It wouldn't surprise me whatsoever parts of it were true, but the lack of hard evidence for it makes me think this may just be one of those things the internet just won't let go.

       Someone needs to explain to me how this video "proves" that Pegasus is the "kill room". All this video shows us that JA bought a building and began renovating it, the building is near a playground, and there is faded graffiti on a wall somewhere nearby that says "kids". I almost couldn't continue the video when it pointed out the black truck in the street view picture and claimed it belongs to the guy helping with renovations.... It's a street view shot from god knows when....

       I didn't want to re watch the video to find it, but did find a guy in a red coat on street view from Nov 2016. I assume this is him since the only older SV images are from 2014 or earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you make out that the guy is looking through binoculars? If he is he is only using one hand to do it because to me it looks like his left arm is at his side. I would say he's more likely talking on a cell phone than looking through binoculars.

       No, the person did not accuse Alefantis 8 years ago. He accused Alefantis 5 months ago of raping him 8 years ago. Which is far less credible, given that it happened after Pizzagate had started.

       No, sort of like when people started coming forward after Jimmy Saviles death. Threatening someone is one way to keep them quiet but people will feel safer coming forward when there are other people backing up their claims.

       I didn't say I don't believe in elite pedophilia. In fact, I've been researching the Franklin scandal and related cases (like John Couey and a related South Georgia sex ring) for the past several months. But this particular rape allegation against James Alefantis is especially shaky, and the way the OP refers to it is highly misleading. That was my only contention.

       Yes, that's what I've suspected Pizzagate of being, at least in part. Some of the things in Pizzagate do strike me as odd, and I can't help but feel there's a kernel of truth, but there are also major flaws (like no confirmed victims), and so I believe Pizzagate was intentionally pushed to discredit more well-documented elite child sex rings.

       Dear Mom and Dad,
      </p>
      <p>
       When you read about my confession to being raped by a man in Washington DC 8 years ago, don't worry, I am just pretending to do it so I can get an under the table payment from the Republican Party. Yes, I know that the Republican party is often again gay rights, but I know that Trump will be a great president, so I will accept the public humiliation of being a male rape victim.  Some may laugh at me but don't worry, I made the whole story up for cash.

       Love, 
Your "not-really raped son"

       Ridiculous strawman; you've assumed that I think the person was paid off to do the AMA. That theory never even crossed my mind, and I maintain that the person
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have been telling the truth, but there's nothing particularly credible about their story (could have been a LARP), and the way the OP presents it is misleading.

       Is every piece of evidence in Pizza-gate a LARP?
All the emails are possibly fake?
Do you think Sprit cooking is non-existant?
The Podesta family friendly relations with convicted sex-offender Dennis Hastert. It is all fake right, somebody on 4-chan made it all up?

       I think in law, there is a concept know as a preponderance of evidence. How much of evidence can people sweep under the rug?

       Dude, chill. I already told you I believed in elite pedophilia rings, and only said the AMA "could have been a LARP". If you react this aggressively whenever people question ever a single piece of evidence associated with Pizzagate, you won't get many people on your side.

       Hey, I agree some of the evidence is bullshit and presenting false evidence is not helpful to the cause. For example the "Fatherhood video". The voice in the video cannot be proven to be John Podesta, no matter how much people wish it could be.

       My goal isn't to discredit him, just to say that I haven't seen any evidence he's legitimate, and that the OP's presentation of the AMA ("accused Alefantis of workplace sexual abuse 8 years ago") gives a misleading impression - someone who accused Alefantis only 5 months ago is a lot less notable than it would have been if Alefantis was accused 8 years ago, before Pizzagate existed.

       No, the person did not accuse Alefantis 8 years ago. He accused Alefantis 5 months ago of raping him 8 years ago. Which is far less credible, given that it happened after Pizzagate had started.

       How would anyone know if Comet has a basement or not? Conveniently, the judge that Hillary and Podesta tapped to take Scalia's seat was assigned to the PG shooters case after he pleaded not guilty. With her assignment, the shooter changed his plea to guilty, she accepted the plea and prevented any evidence from being viewed publicly. Not saying it's a cover up, but it's pretty tidy if it is.

       Yeah, that's fine. I'm not saying whether or not there is a basement, only pointing out that the public has been prevented from seeing the evidence.

       I, for one, never bought the "child rape in the dungeon" part of this in the first place. I'm fairly sure the media invented that to discredit anyone trying to uncover an elite pedo ring that involves some of the people that are friends of the owner of Comet.

       Months back when the investigation was at its height somebody found a copy of the building when it was for sale. It was listed as 3 floors iirc and Alefantis in an interview stated it was a single floor. I don't have the archive link, but I'm sure somebody here or on the pizza gate voat might.

       Does anyone remember that case in the 90s where "hypnosis" was used to make kids "remember" being molested in a basement under their preschool? And remember how it was backed up by conspiracy theorists because the school was full of pedophile symbology?
      </p>

       That turned out to be total bullshit. I'm sure this theory which hits all the same notes and is clearly derivative will be true though!

       The big irony of the satanic panic being pushed here is that the satanic panic historically was a method used by Christian elites to try to keep religious masses in control and unified against political enemies. People are trying to rehash a long standing tradition of mass control via religion.

       The Satanic thing is unnerving. It reminds me of the Satanic scare of the late eighties early nineties. It takes a lot of cognitive dissonance to follow the logic behind that narrative. Still hundreds if not thousands of people were accused and dozens were falsely convicted. People are still in prison over that nonsense.

       NONE have been discredited.  Just because you say something doesn't magically make it true. Comments on pizzagate posts are filled with people denying the evidence.  I've yet to see anyone who denies the evidence be able to actually hold their own against anyone who has done research.  I've yet to see anyone who denies the evidence able to actually cite any evidence beyond the ones that they have talking points for (where'd they get those talking points I wonder!)

       It’s all circumstantial bullshit. Guy was an extra in a shitty B list horror movie. Does not make him a paid actor. Half your evidence is sexualizing innocent pictures of children playing. Like wtf is wrong with you?? Show me the evidence that the words in the emails are not to be taken literally and are actually code. You can’t because you’re grasping at straws and trying to make connections where none exist. Show me where a pizza place doesn’t have cheese pizza. For fucks sake is dominos a pedo chain too because they sell cheese pizza??  Pretty funny you bring up “saying things doesn’t make them magically true” when that’s all your evidence is. Bullshit words that you’re trying to magically wish into existence. It’s impossible to cite evidence to something when nothing existed

       I read exactly what you said and clearly responded to what you said. Its funny how anytime you disagree with something you instantly jump to “babysit” or “herp derp no evidence”. It’s your way  of patronizing someone in a conversation in order to make yourself feel better. I’ve seen all the “evidence” posted here tons of times and it all looks like a crock of shit to me because there’s nothing to it

       Hey Waco.  I, for one, don't what any of the pedogate stuff to be true.  It's disgusting and bad for the soul to even consider.  I am hardly an expert on anything, much less on the topic of Comet.  When I first heard the accusations I chuckled to myself and wondered how anyone could believe something so bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, over time you begin to see numerous coincidences and patterns that begin repeating that are all directly related to pizza/pedogate.  You become curious and research for yourself a little bit each day.  Nothing extensive - just enough to answer your own questions for things that seem unusual about the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I'm a pretty normal person with basic interests.  Not a fanatic or crazy as far as I'm aware.  I keep quiet most of the time and respect other people's opinions because often I'm able to learn from them even if not agreeing with the entirety of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you decided to look more into it you'd at least open up to the possibilty of there being more than meets the eye.  Conspiracy is a big sub and there are many fanatics here - it just attracts that type.  Though I can guarantee there are more "normal" people who rarely make themselves known that feel similar to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many oddities about Alefantis and pedogate, from what I have seen at this point, to write it off as coincidence.  And I think a lot of people would also see it that way if they took a little time each day to see what the conspiracy nuts are talking about and try to relate to their views.

       there is no evidence

       Better yet, I've searched the specific emails myself. It's pretty illuminating to add unstable there is not one direct email from Podesta to Alefantis, or vice versa. The word "toaster" appears almost as many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not much contact for the apparent necessity of a code. While we are on the code, searching other food terms is interesting as well. It's almost like people talk about food a lot.

       Exactly. A friend of mine, whose intellect i used to greatly respect, has fallen for the whole pizzagate bs. Apparently due to an increasingly fanatical hatred of the Clintons. When i asked him what evidence he had, he pointed me to the emails first. I wasted a few hours of my life reviewing the pizzagate "evidence". Just amazing how pathetic it was.

       The whole point is that they don't directly communicate.  They use dead drops that link to numerous repositories of encoded messages.  Forum spam and pdfs on infected machines.  I have literally seen it.

       I never said that.  Just because a word is a code word sometimes doesn't mean it's a code word all the time.  That would make it a really shitty code word don't you agree?

       The codewords didn't kick all this off.  FBIAnon kicked all this off.

       Codewords that are always codewords aren't codewords.  These aren't complete idiots we're dealing with.

       I don't know the context you're referring to so I can't say.  You're taking a random string and asking me if it's part of an encrypted message.  You can't know without the whole message.

       The Podesta emails were the "smoking gun" for which 4 chan released the key to the code. That was the start of any semblance of tying it into political figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Along with the code, people cited multiple uses of the "code words" as proof that this is how they were communicating. It didn't hold up, which is why you're pretending to not understand.

       Lol. This tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care when you want to say it started. The Podesta emails were what launched the "omg, look at these emails where they use codes for crimes against children!", as well as bringing people like Alefantis and Silsby into the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "code" emails turned out to be a joke. No direct email contact from Podesta to Alefantis or vice versa, etc. But someone saying "dominos on cheese" must mean some kind of sex crime.

       Answer the question: Why do you insist on spreading lies?
      </p>
      <p>
       FBIAnon on 4chan was the beginning.  Podesta emails were an instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never turned out to be a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of direct communication via email means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "dominos on cheese" also doesn't mean anything and isn't even the correct quote.

       Again: Why are you lying intentionally?

       Sorry to bother you. 
I went back and deleted all the duplicate comments except one.

       But some interesting information did come out of it.

       You may have noticed that I spammed comments on a PG post that seems to have stabilized at around 800 up votes. When I posted my comments, the post itself was only about 1 day old.

      <p>
       The highest rated comments on this posting were PG negative. 
I wanted to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to this thread because another user on conspiracy did a posting complaining about the original posting being a shill controlled post with up votes on comments used to discredit PG research. 
Being that the post is still only 2 days old, it seems odd that no one reacted to my spamming except to report my spamming. 
I think only 2 or 3 person responded to my numerous comments with a comment. Very few people even down-voted my spam comments. Strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that once a post reaches a satisfactory support level for a shill position, as a group they disengage. Is that possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with the professional shills and bots. I don't know how you are going to weed them out. If you look at my comment history, you will see that I am not a Trump RNC shill, so please don't ban me.

       I put the following comment in reaction to any comment that tried to discredit Pizzagate. Anyhow, I thought it was an important idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is possible to discredit pizzagate but, that does not discredit PEDOGATE. Yes, actual crimes were committed, actual victims exist and actual people are in jail."

       Oh I didn’t even realize you were the same commenter! Burden of proof falls on the one making extraordinary claims. I said what I had t say. None of your so called evidence has any hard evidence as proof. Like I said it’s all grasping at straws. “Herp derp but muh evidence is muh beliefs”. I can put dumb shit in quotes as well to try and invalidate your thoughts

       And then Wikileaks released their 3-phase plan.  Phase 1 was a bunch of incriminating emails w/o the incriminating components.  Phase 2 was filler.  Phase 3 was turning the seemingly benign phase 1 and phase 2 emails into child trafficking incriminating emails.

       God I really can’t tell if you’re trying to be ironic with everything you say “so hard to have an intelligent discussion with willfully disinformed people”.   I feel like I’m having a conversation with a brick wall. I point out flaws in your argument, you call me a liar. I say where the bs originated from, you say I’m willfully disinformed. Must be hard having someone challenge your worldview for once

       Nobody who believes PG is true thinks that the shooter was legitimate.  Find me one person who both supports PG and doesn't think the shooter was an actor.  What kind of a fucking moron walks in with a gun and then shoots a hard drive because reasons?

       I'm assuming you're also not well versed in money laundering or other criminal practices.

       So, with this new information in your brain I hope you can understand how cheese pizza sold by a pizza place isn't alway cheese pizza.  Especially when hackers find a way into the secure part of your pizza server (why do you have a password protected members only area for a pizza place? Uber deals?) and find a bunch of encrypted files that look like they're videos (judging by file size w.r.t. encryption)

       Again, for the umpteenth time:

        just because you say something doesn't make it true

       That's "average time on site" but many other cities have many more visitors per capita. Looks like there's nothing to do there other than work and sit on the internet. Or both, as is your implication.

       Is this likely/possible? They are def. elite, kids went to Sidwell and then Georgetown.  But so did a lot of federal workers kids.  Could they really be clueless being neighbors of Comet and knowing JA?

       Since this thread is full of doubt, disinform, and discrediters, I just want to remind everyone that
       <strong>
        NONE

       of the evidence has been discredited.  It has been spurned, misrepresented, and made to look untrue.

       Show me Bill fucking Clinton rescuing child trafficking "filmmakers" from NK in under a week, but leaving numerous other US citizens, most recently Otto the 20-ish year old college kid, to fucking rot and die being discredited -- (Theory: (Before you froth at the mouth about lack of proof, remember you're on a conspiracy sub, theories are what the sub is built on) Child traffickers aka pizzagaters go to places nobody in the western world fucking cares about. Russia recently shut off its US adoption program because they likely suspect fuckery. Haiti got fucked. Africa in general gets fucked. Runaways get fucked. North Korea also gets fucked. US coalition of pizzagate sent traffickers to North Korea under the guise of "making a film." In the process of "researching" the film, they likely asked around about buying a child, "for filmmaking" of course. It's a pretty great cover. What's the difference between a child trafficker and someone making a film about child trafficking? Well I'd assume that the filmmaker doesn't actually buy the child, but once you've set them up with a seller it's not like the seller is going to come out and tell the public "hey this person didn't just interview me, they actually bought a child"

      <p>
       <strong>
        NONE of this has been discredited.
       </strong>
       Just because you say something doesn't magically make it true. Comments on pizzagate posts are filled with people denying the evidence. I've yet to see anyone who denies the evidence be able to actually hold their own against anyone who has done research. I've yet to see anyone who denies the evidence able to actually cite any evidence beyond the ones that they have talking points for (where'd they get those talking points I wonder!)
      </p>
      <p>
       I will get hammered with downvotes but no discrediting.  That's because bot farms can't counter facts, but they can artificially influence the narrative.

       RE: Corneas - This one I agree takes some critical thinking.  But pretend that you're in a place where an earthquake has killed 100000 people.  Imagine how many more are wounded.

       Ok, use your critical thinking, if they were harvesting corneas would they chuck them in a uncooled box under a table, and actually label it "STOLEN ORGANS" , and let a reporter into the area where they're harvesting organs? are they just stealing eyes and nothing else? was there a rash of people who lost corneas? the arguement that they didnt have the equipment to use donor corneas also means they likely couldn't be harvesting them.

       Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as "a gay icon". Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being "at the forefront of the homosexual imagination" in late nineteenth-century Europe. In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance. Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he authored under the pseudonym of "Numa Numantius." In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s. The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both "The Young King" (1891) and "The Sphinx" (1894)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any modern references to him being used as a symbol of pedophilia? And again, its not like he had a picture of Hadrian as his profile. Hell, it could be neither given that antonius is the most common surviving figure in sculpture by a lot.

       I just dont think the corneas are enough to go on, if the box got opened and actually had corneas in it(non plastic ones mind you) itd be harder to explain. You can't prove the corneas mean anything because you have nothing else than that unopened box, so how is it supposed to be disproven

US coalition of pizzagate sent traffickers to North Korea under the guise of "making a film." In the process of "researching" the film, they likely asked around about buying a child, "for filmmaking" of course. It's a pretty great cover. What's the difference between a child trafficker and someone making a film about child trafficking? Well I'd assume that the filmmaker doesn't actually buy the child, but once you've set them up with a seller it's not like the seller is going to come out and tell the public "hey this person didn't just interview me, they actually bought a child"

       "Pedogate" is even easier to discredit. It's the most stupid shifting of goalposts to encompass everything even vaguely connected to pedophilia, even those things that don't involved it directly such as consensual trafficking of adults.

       The teen boys that were raped by Dennis Hastert and the teen girls that were forced into prostitution by Jeffrey Epstein are by legal definition not adults. Both of these men are convicted criminals and both have gotten very light prison sentences for some reason.

        Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as "a gay icon".[99] Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being "at the forefront of the homosexual imagination" in late nineteenth-century Europe.[100] In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance.[101] Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he authored under the pseudonym of "Numa Numantius."[101] In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s.[101] The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both "The Young King" (1891) and "The Sphinx" (1894).[101]

       No, not using logic.  You are making an unsubstantiated logical leap.  The profile picture was literally a sculpture of Antinous.  The quote about pederastic love was specifically about sculptures of Antinous.  You are assuming that this instance of a sculpture was intended as "gay icon" and not "pederastic ideal" when Alefantis's exact sculpture was indeed one of the very sculptures considered "pederastic ideal."

       I don't think its any secret there are very wealthy men around the globe trading in underage girls and I wouldn't be shocked one bit if our current President has participated based on his past statements and his association with guys like Epstein. That being said Pizzagate has been COMPLETELY debunked to the point Jones was forced to post a public apology and to continue to associate it to Podesta and Comet PingPong Pizza and Alefantis are just silly and disingenous. In short there is NOTHING about Pizzagate that was real....period

       holy fuck your cognitive dissonance is off the charts ...let's try this again pizzagate will NEVER and I mean NEVER be investigated because it has been thoroughly debunked. What would be the point of investigating a totally made up conspiracy nut-job piece of bullshit? We might as well investigate Chupacabras or Sandy-Hook truthers. Furthermore, pedogate has nothing to do with Podesta, or Alefanti, so to continue the two names is just your narrative bullshit, but hey I would LOVE to see the current administration investigate Pizzagate, so we can all laugh at another ridiculous gaffe by the president.

       Jeezus fucking christ, I wish we could bottle up all the massive time and energy Americans spend on Pizzagate and Russiagate and apply it instead towards dire domestic issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder the USA is so far behind other countries in terms of single payer healthcare, labor rights, etc. -- The American public is so easily hooked by the mouth and led around to any distraction created/perpetuated by corporate media and/or slimy think tanks.

       It is possible to discredit pizzagate but, that does not discredit PEDOGATE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, actual crimes were committed, actual victims exist and actual people are in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like former speaker of the house Dennis Hastert who is still in jail on his very light prison sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Dennis Hastert are being controlled by sexual blackmail. They will not improve healthcare, they will not give us labor rights, they will not give us anything we really want because they're being controlled. Until we fix the blackmail problem inside the US government, no problems will get fixed.

      <p>
       You think the main reason corporate politicians (Dems and GOP) don't improve healthcare is because they're pedos who're blackmailed not to?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that was the case big pharma, the insurance industry, etc. wouldn't bother bribing them.  Why waste their money?  Dennis Hastert was against single payer because like many others, he's a sociopathic scumbag that's put bribes ahead of lives.  This sociopath also happens to be a pedo, no surprise.

       Good old lobbying money, sure.

       Paid speeches. Known. 
Bribery. Sure we know they all exist. 
That does not mean that some are being sexually blackmailed. 
A man does not need more than two or three vacation homes. 
Bribery has its limits. Threatening a man's life or freedom is the ultimate control mechanism.

       Besides Hillary Clinton, can you name the next democratic politician who was more supportive of the disclosure existence of aliens?

       Still don't know? It was John Podesta. Since the emails, he has said little about disclosure...

       Do you think a multi-millionaire would take the $10,000 to kill a random guy? No way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyone capable of raping a 10 year is going to open to being blackmailed into murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would anyone rape 10-year olds? Well you can ask Jimmy Saville or Edward Heath but you can ask Dennis Hastert and that football coach from Penn State.

       Yeah you aren't crazy. They are so obvious and it's always the same people who get mass upvoted even though they have the unpopular opinion. It doesn't even make sense with the upvotes and you only see the amount they get on threads where these topics need to be discredited by powerful people.

      <p>
       Of course the mods are in on it since they do nothing about the brigading and the obvious shills and just ban their legitimate user base for calling out the share blue talking points that are copy pasted all over Reddit.

       I wouldn't worry too much about the mods, most of them do what they can with what they've got.  It's hard to identify the shills.  The shills are also really good at getting people to break the subreddit rules and get banned.  Sneaky shills.

       I don't know if PG is real or not-it seems a bit like a deflection from the very real issues of missing children and trafficking, and a history of CIA/FBI cover-up-look up "The Finders" in DC.   It's possible the CIA even uses pedophilia as a form of blackmail for politicians-I would not put anything below those in power.

       Til: no evidence of being a pedophile means you're 100% a pedophile, and that person should have every aspect of his life exposed (despite being a private citizen).  Doxxing a racist is beyond the pale, and should never be done for any reason.

       It's impossible to tell someone's intention on a reddit post that solely contains the racist joke.  I admit that I sometimes make inappropriate jokes (like when I say that Obama committed the crime of being black while presidenting, to highlight the absurdity of people who actually make that claim), but the totality of my posts on this site would hopefully show that I'm not a racist, or that I at least try not to be (there's always some inherent biases due to privilege, which isn't to beat people over the head about it, it's just that you don't always know something's wrong if you never experience it in a negative context.)  If all my posts were "absurdist" takes on racial jokes, then how can you tell the difference between me, and a racist who's posting those joke non-ironically?

        Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as "a gay icon".[99] Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being "at the forefront of the homosexual imagination" in late nineteenth-century Europe.[100] In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance.[101] Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he authored under the pseudonym of "Numa Numantius."[101] In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for £3, 10s.[101] The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both "The Young King" (1891) and "The Sphinx" (1894).[101]
