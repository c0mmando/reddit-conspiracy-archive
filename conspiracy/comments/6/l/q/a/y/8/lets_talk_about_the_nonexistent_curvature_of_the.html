        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A copy of the book “The Lighthouses of the World” and a calculator are enough to prove that the Earth is not a globe, but is a flat disk that is rotating upwards at 9.8 meters squared/second. The distance from which various lighthouse lights around the world are visible at sea far exceeds what could be found on a globe Earth 25,000 miles in circumference. For example, the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. Spherical trigonometry dictates that if the Earth was a globe with the given curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, this light should be hidden 190 feet below the horizon!</p>

<p>The Port Nicholson Light in New Zealand is 420 feet above sea-level and visible from 35 miles away which means it should be 220 feet below the horizon. The Egerö Light in Norway is 154 feet above high-water and visible from 28 statute miles where it should be 230 feet below the horizon. The Light at Madras, on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high and visible from 28 miles away, where it should be 250 feet below the line of sight. The Cordonan Light on the west coast of France is 207 feet high and visible from 31 miles away, putting it 280 feet below the line of sight. The light at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea-level and visible at 35 miles, where it should be 491 feet below the horizon. And the lighthouse steeple of St. Botolph’s Parish Church in Boston is 290 feet tall and visible from over 40 miles away, where it should be hidden a full 800 feet below the horizon!</p>

<p>“The distance across St. George&#39;s Channel, between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay. The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet. Hence, if the earth were a globe, the former would always be 316 feet and the latter 340 feet below the horizon!” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Zetetic Astronomy, Earth Not a Globe!” (59)</p>

<p>“The lights which are exhibited in lighthouses are seen by navigators at distances at which, according to the scale of the supposed ‘curvature’ given by astronomers, they ought to be many hundreds of feet, in some cases, down below the line of sight! For instance: the light at Cape Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40 miles) that, according to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to be visible! This is a conclusive proof that there is no ‘curvature,’ on the surface of the sea - ‘the level of the sea,’- ridiculous though it is to be under the necessity of proving it at all: but it is, nevertheless, a conclusive proof that the Earth is not a globe.” -William Carpenter, “100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe” (5)</p>

<p>Round earthers, after reading this, what is the explanation for all of the missing curvature? </p>

<p>Also, why do shooting stars never travel vertically upwards from below the horizon? </p>

<p>Why is &quot;gravity&quot; strong enough to keep a solar system together yet also is weak enough to allows birds to fly? Why is gravity strong enough to hold the oceans to a spinning ball but weak enough to allow balloons to float? </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t architects and structural engineers take into account curvature when designing roads, bridges, or railroads?</p>

<p>Once you start to question the spinning ball earth theory, flat earth makes much more sense. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the curvature?</p>

<p>a couple of experiments to validate flat earth:</p>

<p>shine a laser against a reflective surface that&#39;s sufficiently beyond the projected distance including refraction effects and try to pick the signal up. </p>

<p>using a camera with a high zoom, sufficiently powerful to see things beyond the estimated limits (including refraction), and see how far you could see.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So curvature of earth is 8 inch per mile, so 2/3 a foot per mile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>28 miles x 2/3 ft = 18 and 1/3 feet hidden behind horrizon. 194 tall - 18.33 is 175.66 feet visible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Port Nicholson Light in New Zealand is 420 feet above sea-level and visible from 35 miles away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>35mi x 2/3ft = 23.33ft curvature. 420ft - 23.33ft = 396.66ft visible after accounting for curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Egerö Light in Norway is 154 feet above high-water and visible from 28 statute miles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>28 miles x 2/3 ft = 18 and 1/3 feet hidden behind horrizon. 154 tall - 18.33 is 135.66 feet visible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Light at Madras, on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high and visible from 28 miles away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>28 miles x 2/3 ft = 18 and 1/3 feet hidden behind horrizon. 132 tall - 18.33 is 123.66 feet visible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cordonan Light on the west coast of France is 207 feet high and visible from 31 miles away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>31mi x 2/3ft = 20.66ft hidden. 207ft - 20.66ft = 186.33ft visible at 31mi</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The light at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea-level and visible at 35 miles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>35mi x 2/3ft = 23.33ft curvature. 150ft - 23.33ft = 126.66ft visible after accounting for curvature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the lighthouse steeple of St. Botolph’s Parish Church in Boston is 290 feet tall and visible from over 40 miles away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>40mi x 2/3ft = 26.66ft over 40 miles. 290 - 26.66ft = 263.33ft visible at 40 miles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That proves my point that the spinning ball earth theory is flawed.  the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. You say that 175.66 ft is visible. Even if 175.66 ft is visible, should you really be able to see the Dunkerue Light from 28 miles away? All you did was account for the altitude with your calculations. With that same 8 in squared/mile formula, if you account for distance, that&#39;s 18 2/3 miles, not feet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I mostly used your formula, you are not accounting for changing feet to miles in your calculations. The actually formula uses the Pythagorean theorem to deduce the proper drop. The globe doesn&#39;t just drop by 8 inch per each mile. It drops 8 inch in a mile and then the next mile is dropped an additional 8 inch from the 8 inch dropped position since it&#39;s a curve.</p>

<p>Check out this website which does the math for you, just substitute your target object eight for whats labeled &quot;eye level&quot; and it&#39;ll give you how many feet are visible. By using the eye level for target height it&#39;ll give the answer as your eye level was 0. So just add a few feat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so this is a case of poor phrasing, u/ZiggyAdventures used the unit of <strong>feet</strong> for his calculations.

<p>He should have presented it as...</p>

<p>28 miles x 2/3 <strong>ft/mi</strong> = 18 and 1/3 feet hidden behind horrizon. 194 tall - 18.33 is 175.66 feet visible. </p>

<p>In which case he is correct, it was simply a case of screwed up units. But, otherwise he is entirely correct. Frankly, I don&#39;t understand flat earthers, there are mountains of simple evidence confirming the globe model (my favorite being foucault&#39;s approach).</p>

<p>It actually heavily depends on the eye level. I entice you to play around. You won&#39;t see a lighthouse 28 miles away that is 194 feet high while at sea level. But be on a platform or a ship, lets say 100 ft above sea level and that lighthouse is visible weather permitting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I lived in Mississippi&#39;s delta, there was a rather good example of this.  In one city (Greenwood) there was this massive feed mill, which given the flat nature of the delta, it was possible to see for a good 20 miles around.  In any case, if you were viewing the mill from the edge of the delta (carroll county line to be exact), you could only see about the top two thirds of this feed mill.  The closer you got, however, the more the mill seemed to rise upward out of the ground.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait.....the greeks believed in round earth in the 3rd century BC...it was also proven in the 16th century....AFAIK NASA was not a thing back then, well unless NASA are ancient greeks sent forward in time to fuck with us so that our  alien overlords can still hide and do research on us...</p>

<p>One more thing, if the earth is flat....why is it light all day now...and dark all day during winter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That proves my point that the spinning ball earth theory is flawed.  the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. You say that 175.66 ft is visible. Even if 175.66 ft is visible, should you really be able to see the Dunkerue Light from 28 miles away? All you did was account for the altitude with your calculations. With that same 8 in squared/mile formula, if you account for distance, that&#39;s 18 2/3 miles, not feet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Philadelphia skyline is clearly visible from Apple Pie Hill in the New Jersey Pine Barrens 40 miles away. If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, factoring in the 205 foot elevation of Apple Pie Hill, the Philly skyline should remain well-hidden beyond 335 feet of curvature. Round earthers need to do their research because the earth is obviously flat. </p>

<p>Buoyancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful.  While your equation to estimate the curve of the earth has some merit, it&#39;s a simplification of the real trigonometry.  As a simplification, it hides the fact that it assumes the observer&#39;s altitude is 0.  As in, their eyes are half submerged in water, because you are at exactly sea level.</p>

<p>As soon as you gain even a small amount of altitude (like standing upright, or even standing on the deck of a ship), the numbers your equation produces become far less meaningful.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#/media/File:HorizonDistance.png">Here</a> is a image from the Wikipedia article about the horizon that gives a much better way to estimate how much of an object should be obscured.</p>
