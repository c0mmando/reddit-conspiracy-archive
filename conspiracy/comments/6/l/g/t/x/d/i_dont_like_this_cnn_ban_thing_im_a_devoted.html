       OK, I'll probably get downvoted, but here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I share the collective emotion/outrage regarding CNN's behavior, but please consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         CNN's is abhorrent and criminal, and has been for years. CNN is an accomplice to war criminals and a disgrace to the notion of journalism. This doxxing scandal, all emotions set aside, pales in comparison to the crimes it has facilitated. For all intents and purposes CNN has been a criminal organization since inception (remember the Gulf War 1.0 propaganda, CNN birthed a new era).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As such everyone should be individually responsible not to link directly to CNN when it's not strictly necessary; similarly you are responsible for not clicking if you don't have Ad-Blocker (or use an online web
         <a href="http://hide.me/proxy">
          proxy
         </a>
         with ad-blocker).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         CNN is the
         <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5rnvup/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">
          metaphorical loudspeaker.
         </a>
         The official meta-propaganda. It's not what CNN tells us that's important, it's the fact they're telling us. It doesn't need to be true to be relevant. As such we must be able to reference it (e.g. say it has rich/javascript content that is not parsed/displayed by the archivers and that is critical to share not in a screenshot form, or something that can be reached only after posting a form, etc.). A domain ban is hard-coded, there's no exception (mods am I wrong?)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          But most importantly
         </strong>
         this "list of excluded threaten to doxx sites" creeps me out. I saw how this appeared in the thread. Some Clintonbot "muh we should ban T_D too" showed up, moderators engaged in good faith and said they'd ban anything they could prove is guilty of similar behavior, the shill provided something invalid/lengthy, and now we have this potential list (empty for now except CNN).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is a door open to banning voat, pastebin, cryptome, any hacking dump, heck even why not Wikileaks. Remember doxxing was the pretext to ban r/pizzagate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I doubt not that our moderators' intentions are pure. They are outraged as we should all be. But this is extremely hasty. And now this risks becoming a side-wide movement. I would be sad to see Reddit corp turn against CNN (and not suffocate on its own hypocrisy), r/conspiracy cheer, for the whole fiasco to turn against us when the list grew bigger.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I sympathize with HansSolo, even though I don't share his views. That is, if he's even real. To me he seems a bit baroque, but that's just my impression. If this is indeed a psyop, the central planners must be laughing right now. If not, Hans was careless to let CNN identify him. This should encourage everyone to step-up one's opsec (tor browser) and close whatever faceshit account one might have going on.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That is it. I am hostile to silencing, even if it concerns the enemy. Compromising for what we stand for a (trivial and ephemerous) collective emotion is uninsightful IMHO.

       Much of the justification for the ban was based on lies spread by T_D trolls. The

       Just from my clip tray:
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski had contacted the user behind the HanAssholeSolo account on Tuesday. Kaczynski said the user later called CNN to further apologize for his posts after posting his lengthy apology online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kaczynski wrote in his story that
       <strong>
        CNN was not publishing the user's name "because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same," he continued.
       <strong>
        "CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change."
       </strong>

       Another lie. An investor in WaPo is also an investor in the largest cloud service provider on the Internet, AWS, which won a open bidding contract for the CIA. If you do any online shopping, you likely use this very same service. By your logic, you'd be working with the CIA. That right-wing smear doesn't hold any water if you know the facts.

       Should have just given the official denial instead of attacking the people in the forum:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Washington Post is not funded by the CIA. It’s owned by someone who owns another company that works with the CIA on cloud data storage. There’s a potential conflict of interest; but to directly link these and claim that the WP was funded by the CIA is nothing more than a lie. Shabby journalism – at least your rhetoric fits right in there.
       </p>

       The forum users are analytical and inquisitive. While much Black Propaganda exists there is underlying truths to most memes that travel the conspiracy crowd.

       CNN effectively censored an individual's expression. Pick a side, man. The global conglomerate that controls your information, or the idiot that shit posted and made a harmless meme that hurt the establishment's feels.

       When the president of the United States begins to retweet things that make you look bad, you try and stem the bleeding.

      <p>
       What really happened here? One dude deleted his account? CNN got a ton of shit for what they did?

       So what? Now what?

       This dude made a choice to make something and it bit him in the ass. That was his choice. I'm not saying what CNN did was right... No, I think it's shitty. But it's in no way, at all, beyond what I think would happen if I were get something I made retweeted by the president.

       Banning CNN was a hasty and reactionary decision. Everything around this story makes me feel like we're being played and that the backlash CNN has been getting was the intended purpose of this whole fiasco. It feels like we're being manipulated.

       MTE.  CNN's no shittier than any other national "news" outlet, and better than at least one I think think of.  All of them are useless when it comes to informing one about what matters - and the blame can be placed squarely on the GOP-majority congress of 1966 and Bill Clinton for profitizing it - but to insist on some half-witted link ban is ridiculous.  Especially given some of the bald-faced, unapologetic Russian propaganda spam linked to on the regular.

       Neither do I but it's not like this is the first ethically egregious thing CNN or any other "news" organization has done by a mile.  People can stop watching CNN, fine (I did more than a decade ago), but once you ban one outlet, it's open season on all of them.  And then what's left?  Given the way things are going it'll be infowars, RT and Pravda.

       Think into the future and try to perceive what the end game is for CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cemented themselves as a news institution on the platform of television a little over 30 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       They mastered the art of the 24-hour new cycle and have chased ratings ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many caught on to the propaganda tactics you speak of in your OP. However, there is nothing in place to keep them in check for conducting themselves in a deceitful way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have now been singled out by the President of the United States as an institution that witch hunts and spreads false information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said this a few times before on this sub - there is a war between CNN and the President. The president put his supporters in a difficult position to turn on CNN, but the Network has made it increasingly easy to reject them as an institution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This corners CNN into a position it hasn't been in before. It is now trading shots with the president. It is hunting down his supporters online to try to humiliate the president by trying to guilt him by association. They are still chasing ratings -- clear indicator is that they'd rather lead with some meta drama involving the president to get eyes on their content.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not going out without a fight. The only way they win the war against the POTUS is they can mold the perception for a successful impeachment. That is their end goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you, but I'd rather see the old, money driven institution die on the platform that birthed it rather than grow into an entity that can topple a presidency through propaganda.

       If it's a question of where ad revenue goes, are we really taking the position that we're not providing ad revenue to sites more dubious than CNN?

       Once you really see that there really is a wicked power structure that works behind the scenes, moving in shadows, and you come to understand that they are able to get away with all dirty deeds so long as they make that information known to the public
       <em>
        somehow
       </em>
       , before the deed is done, you lose all respect for their blatant puppets, including the mainstream media. Even the shows we consider 'great work' are, to the eyes of the elite, ironic because they are just telling us what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, I don't have much proof other than the fact that, right now, consciousness is generally inverted, and most people are living within the realm of the self-serving, egoic consciousness, which cannot find meaning because it is, in fact, meaningless. And in order to remain within that realm, you must also remain within the realm of suffering. Suffering is cognitive; it is when we think we're in pain. But the thinker is a self-image. You cannot think what you are; every time you do, you're identifying with a thought. A thought has no basis in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, because the majority of humanity does not know who, as individuals, they are and because we are sensitive to and defensive against the negative truth of reality, we're even ignorant to the fact that our media is so blatantly and so fundamentally against the public. They create and advertise closed-minded ways of thinking. They literally work to keep us separate from the truth of experiential reality. They work to perpetuate 'the self'. The self, some would say, is something the devil would promote. Dirty deeds through ignorance and during sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think it's closed-minded to say that CNN has done 'good work' in the past. I think the institution, in itself, is against the advancement of society as a unified, loving humanity. There is no compassion anywhere, and the shows we're fed and the news we're told is 'great work' is and has been fundamentally against us and our loved ones.

       It's quite simple. 
They have a large audience. That large audience was compelled, with evidence, to view psychotronics as real, not as "tin-foil," hat stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       They went to the pentagon and were told it was, "too sensitive a subject to comment on." They hired an engineer who built an RF mind interference device based on Soviet schematics which successfully transmitted images into a CNN reporter's head.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the above is good, solid, research and reporting. Good work. Objectively.

       If we are at all intellectual, we should not attach ourselves to what we learn. CNN, imo, should be free to post propaganda. Within this reality, we conscious individuals carry the ability to discern, the ability to take information in and not attach ourselves to the bull shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ban one news outlet is to begin the snowball effect. And, now, 'they' can hold over this community's head, "well, you guys did it first. So, were following your lead and banning reddit (extreme example)."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, on the surface level, that banning CNN is an easily embraced concept --
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       -- but I feel that, down the line, it will be a hugely regretful action to take. To ban a news outlet is to open ourselves up to the game of banning, itself.

       Although CNN has a good history of news gathering and reporting, its focus has markedly changed when Zucker became CEO. He's from NBC Universal where ratings rule and, he's more interested in entertainment than he is in news. That's his comfort zone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  problem is that he continues to use CNN's revered news format to now deliver entertainment, by which I mean, following stories that are more likely to generate ratings at the expense of newsworthy ones. I understand his strategy. Appropriating the news format, allows him to hang onto existing eyeballs while cultivating additional viewership/ratings from those more likely to follow scandals than news.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we stop treating treating CNN as a reliable source of information and simpy accept that it's turned into an upscale version of The View or some such crap, I'm sure you'll see fewer CNN citings because, how many "The View" references have you seen lately? CNN are surely churning out fake news. I never thought I'd agree with DT on anything.
