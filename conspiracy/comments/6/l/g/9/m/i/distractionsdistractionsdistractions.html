        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While everyone is freaking out over a CNN meme the UN just appointed a former French judge Ms. Marchi-Uhel to head investigation on Syrian war crimes.</p>

<p>Point number one: This position was expected to exclude citizens of Security Council permanent members and countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. They obviously did not.</p>

<p>Point number two: Ms. Marchi-Uhel was a former advisor to the French Foreign Ministry. The same foreign ministry that tried to declare that Assad was responsible for the chemical attack on April 4, in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria before the UN has concluded its investigation.</p>

<p>Point number three: She was the principal legal adviser for the international tribunal in the former Yugoslavia, and was a judge on the United Nations-Cambodian tribunal charged with prosecuting crimes committed during the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In France, she served on a court trying the most serious crimes and was a legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry.</p>

<p>Regarding this last part. I have done no research on either of these cases. I will not be surprised to find that no western government was found guilty of any war crimes in those instances.</p>

<p>Edit: BANGKOK — After spending more than a decade and nearly $300 million, the United Nations-backed tribunal prosecuting the crimes of the Khmer Rouge has convicted just three men.</p>

<p>Edit: The criticism of the tribunals handling of the Yugoslavia case is pretty rampant. </p>

<p>Edit: It gets better. For the first time ever a judge was removed from the tribunal for suggesting that Israel and the US were behind the acquittal of senior Serb and Croat officials.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/judge-thrown-off-yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-for-criticising-change-of-direction-in-verdicts-8837433.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/judge-thrown-off-yugoslavia-war-crimes-tribunal-for-criticising-change-of-direction-in-verdicts-8837433.html</a></p>

<p>The fix is in. imo</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We ate at the point where they will manufacture whatever is necessary.</p>

<p>Just found very interesting article about Croatia, Slovenia regarding Hague International tribunal.</p>

<p>Link to article: <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/croatia-and-slovenia-continue-maritime-dispute-after-arbitration-ruling/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement/news/croatia-and-slovenia-continue-maritime-dispute-after-arbitration-ruling/</a></p>

<p>Most important part in article: &quot;However, Zagreb confirmed last Thursday (29 June) it will not respect the result handed down by the tribunal. Croatia says the result is null-and-void because the arbitration process was tainted after it emerged in 2015 that a Slovenian official had discussed the case with a member of the arbitration committee. Ljubljana does not contest this charge but still insists that Croatia must stick to the terms of the deal&quot;.</p>

<p>Now the EU has to get involved. Apparently, we are looking at the same organization/mechanism that would decide the balkanization of Syria. So, this is extremely relevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, i did, but i&#39;ll try to be a bit clearer. The answer is both good and bad.</p>

<p>Dodd-frank did some good things for people, such as creating the consumer protection agency. Losing those perks will be terrible for people. </p>

<p>Dodd-frank also put small banks that helped people out of business, and made the big banks significantly bigger. Removing dodd-frank makes it possible for small banks to make a come back. Small banks generally make loans to small business. With no small banks, its been hard for small business to start/expand. Hopefully, removing dodd-frank will increase small businesses, which is a very good thing for the economy, jobs, and the public in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you 12? In politics, bills get passed via compromise. I&#39;ll give your side X if you give my side Y. X is good for one segment, Y another. I didn&#39;t say &quot;it could be good or bad,&quot; i said it was good and bad because the bill is big and encompasses a lot... as most bills do... and some of the things encompassed were good for consumers and others were good for big banks. </p>

<p>Prior to glass stiegal being removed, regular banks were not allowed to gamble on Wall Street with depositer&#39;s money. Only investment banks could. When glass-stiegal was taken away, the economic collapse happened because regular banks lost all the deposit $ on Wall Street. The justification for bailing out the banks was that if the big banks shut down, all depositers would lose their $.</p>

<p>So dodd-frank was implemented. I don&#39;t remember what the exact #s are, but the rule prior was banks could only &quot;invest&quot; meaning loan/gamble/otherwise tie up around 85%ish of deposits on hand. The feds changed the deposit requirement to more like 70%ish. If you didn&#39;t have at least have 30%ish of your depositors cash on hand when the bill went into effect, you were shut down. None of the banks had 30% on hand, so the feds loaned the money to the big banks to keep them open, and shut down all the small banks. </p>

<p>As an fyi, the Obama administration never held the big banks accountable. After all the small banks were shut down, they dipped below the 30% requirement and got no punishment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thing... while dodd-frank did throw some good bones to the liberals, its main purpose was a give-away to big banks. Every time the liberals tout it as a victory for the obama administration, i want to scream with anger. Solidifying the big bank monopoly is not a &quot;victory for the people&quot;. After the bill passed, Barney frank left congress and went to work for a big bank with a 7 figure salary. Fucker. Big giant payoff for screwing over small business. Payoffs like that should be illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. The dodd-frank act was basically a give away to big banks and effectively shut down most small banks. The big banks did not follow the dodd-frank rules as well as they should have, and the Obama administration did nothing about it. so that part of the bill being eliminated is actually good for the general public as small banks can return. But dodd-frank did throw some very critical bones to the general public, such as the consumer protection agency. Losing those bones will actually be devastating to the general public. As with all things political, it&#39;s complicated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just funny to me that there&#39;s so much bullshit going on, and every time something is going on, you always have &quot;that person&quot; pointing out how it&#39;s a &quot;distraction&quot; towards something else.</p>

<p>Well, no shit there are other things going on. Hundreds of things going on that we know about. What? is each on a distraction from something else? Should we only focus on one thing at a time? Who decides that? How does that thing not distract from the hundreds of other things?</p>

<p>What&#39;s your point in pointing this out? Is there some priority system I don&#39;t know about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realized that I explained why dodd-frank was bad for small banks, but not why repealing it is good for small banks/consumers. Small banks make loans to small business. Less cash required on hand = more money to lend for existing banks. Its also a lower barrier of entry for someone who wants to start a new small bank. </p>

<p>You may ask if keeping only 15% on hand instead of 30% is irresponsible. The answer is that small generally banks make loans with low default rates, so 15% reserve is enough. Big banks make risky loans/gamble, so they need more cash on hand to weather defaults/losses. </p>
