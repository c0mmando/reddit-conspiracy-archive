    <div class="md"><p>Well they knocked and I thought at first they were just mormons or Kirby vacumn salesmen. They seemded well educated and asked if they could come in, when I said no thank you one of them pushed his way in and the other one followed and locked the door behind him. My small dog was barking until the Caucasian one touched it and he calmed down, that&#39;s when he put my dog in the bathroom and closed the door. When I told them I would call the police they said no I wouldn&#39;t and then all I remember is sitting in my lazy boy and them getting up shaking my hand (which was ice cold). They winked and said to close my accounts down and then just left....one of them took one a fan of Mr. Pip from the fridge, I suspect it&#39;s glucose level was low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading your past few comments makes me wonder.  I am going to humor you but if the reptilians need to power their ships with a rocky core from Earth then why don&#39;t they just get it from one of the other planets?  Earth&#39;s core is only alive today because of the moon.  Otherwise, it would be dead.  Not only that but a space ship would likely want to use nuclear fusion or possibly quark fusion to power their ships.  If a Magma core they want, they could get it from IO off of Jupiter.  Nuclear power would be the most logical solution for a space ship of any size.  I am kind of skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;m not going to pretend I&#39;m a rocket scientist or anything like that (though I have restored my Cavaliers transmission after I blew it racing last spring), anyways earth currently is host to a large population of Greys (obviously hidden among us humans). This population accounts for approximately 30-35 percent of their fertile population which makes them a target for the much more aggressive Reptilians. By harnessing <strong>our</strong> planet, they take them out too, so a situation where you kill two birds with one stone. Remember, they&#39;ve been at war with each other for aeons and we are just a forgotten experimentation that was abandoned. You probably think I&#39;m off my meds or something but I don&#39;t see how people don&#39;t put at least the basics together you know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m deadly serious.  There are no aliens.  They do not exist.  No human has ever been off this planet.  </p>

<p>When someone encounters an &#39;alien&#39;, they are in touch with demonic entities, trans-dimensional beings.<br/>
Do you think it&#39;s a coincidence that the first &#39;alien&#39; life that was described to the mainstream in entertainment back in the 1950s etc was of &#39;little green men&#39;?  Now go investigate the creatures that were summoned by occultists as described by Manly P Hall.  &#39;Little green men&#39;.    </p>

<p>You think it&#39;s a coincidence that all over the world ancient civilisations worshipped snake-like creatures?  Your reptilians. They didn&#39;t come from space.  They were here before us.  They are the fallen ones breaking through from the other side.  </p>

<p>Is this in reference to the  Kelly-Hopkinsville sighting?  That was in 1955.<br/>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_green_men</a><br/>
&quot;Usage of the term clearly predates the 1955 incident, for example, in England reference to little green men or children dates back to the 12th century green children of Woolpit, though exactly when the term was first applied to extraterrestrial aliens has been difficult to pin down. Folklore researcher Chris Aubeck has used electronic searches of old newspapers and found a number of instances dating from around the turn of the 20th century referring to green aliens. Aubeck found one story from 1899 in the Atlanta Constitution about a little, green-skinned alien, in a tale called Green Boy From Hurrah, &quot;Hurrah&quot; being another planet, perhaps Mars. Edgar Rice Burroughs referred to the &quot;green men of Mars&quot; and &quot;green Martian women&quot; in his first 1912 science fiction novel A Princess of Mars,[1] though at 10 to 12 feet tall, they were hardly &quot;little.&quot; However, the first use of the specific phrase &quot;little green man&quot; in reference to extraterrestrials that Aubeck found dates to <strong>1908</strong> in the Daily Kennebec Journal (Augusta, Maine), in this case the aliens again being Martians.[1]&quot;</p>
