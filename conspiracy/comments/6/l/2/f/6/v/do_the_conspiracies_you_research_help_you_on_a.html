        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like many people who dive into conspiracy-tunnels, and people who can&#39;t trust authority figures, televisions, or governments end up making arguments about a battle between good and evil. My dad told me that &quot;Gods are usually inside conspiracy theories somewhere,&quot; with devils, and prophets, and strategic illusions, and madmen martyrs.  Truth is like a secret with guards placed around it, and conspiracy theorists think the truth will unlock human potential somehow, and that the truth is guarded by people who don&#39;t want the whole species to become enlightened.  God is a strange word, and there are all kinds of religious conspiracies too, but my question is this: </p>

<p>Do the conspiracies you research help you on a spiritual path, or disrupt it? Do gods live inside your conspiracies?  What do you believe in, and how do you live those beliefs?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They do neither. I research conspiracies for fun, some I find interesting because they coincide with other interests like history. For example: the pyramids, who built them and why? Same with the Nazca lines and many other historical things, wtf is up with the antikythera mechanism?</p>

<p>God has nothing to do with it because I don&#39;t believe in any of the various gods or religions. </p>

<p>I will only research modern conspiracies if something triggers it, like the official story just doesn&#39;t add up. For example: WMDs in Iraq, The USA govt lying to its people was initially a conspiracy until proven true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes.  i think the first step to truly learning is learning humility, and becoming aware of your own weaknesses.  it&#39;s from this that true appreciation comes from.  study of these god-like archetypes allows you to measure yourself against their teachings and to help learn why these archetypes/designs exist and how to adopt their lessons in your own life.  the most important thing, imo, though is learning to truly appreciate others.  </p>

<p>But yeah, been an atheist for 20 years give or take.  Then I got redpilled late last year.  While I wouldn&#39;t even describe myself as spiritual, I now believe there&#39;s something greater involved.  That death is not necessarily as final as I once assumed. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I was a complete skeptic and firmly on the scientism side of life until last year.  Read some things, did my own research, looked at stuff at a local level to verify what I found.  Nearly had a breakdown because of what i found.  Realised that if what I found was real, the opposite must be also true.  </p>

<p>So, yes.  I found God because of conspiracies.  And I know a few others on here walked a similar path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>satanic paedo rings, sacrificial altars in ancient druid sites, city streets laid out to form pentagrams, certain buildings in those streets that feature architecture conforming with said satanic/pagan activities.  Lots of news archives that detail similar satanic practices.   </p>

<p>Lots of greek, roman and egyptian connections (always linking back to death and sacrifice) such as statues, buildings, place names etc.  All this in a hugely supposed catholic country.  </p>

<p>Then you throw in the old urban legends and bizarre local history that you always believed were just stories but now they conform to what you&#39;re seeing.  It becomes impossible to deny the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;ve looked at it from the perspective of, even if all this stuff isn&#39;t real, some people believe it and IT IS HAPPENING. That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t matter to me exactly what parts of the conspiracies are real. What matters is that there are groups that perform these rituals still to this day because that&#39;s what they believe. Scary stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What really freaked me out was how pervasive it is, across all society and back through history.  So these people, the very people who control the world we live in, have been doing this for a long, long time.<br/>
And  unless someone becomes familiar with the occult signs and sigils they use, you could look at something and never see it for what it really is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it turns into a bit of both help and disruption. When I consider the implications of God and Evil being a factor in conspiracy theories, my body/mind react. Sometimes it&#39;s like a lightbulb moment, where light shines into different parts of the world, including myself. There&#39;s also times where the recognition of certain possibilities are painful and make me question why God would allow something like it to happen.</p>

<p>But God doesn&#39;t allow the bad to happen, the Evil allows it. And, since humans have free will, we allow ourselves (arguably, ourselves alone) to chose between Him and Evil. </p>

<p>Anyways, that&#39;s my 2 cents! This chart may be helpful for answering your question as well :D

<p>It&#39;s called the <strong>Problem of Evil</strong>. And its a big topic and Philosophy and Theology alike. Do your research on it. PM me if you want.</p>

<p>Help as far as I know - but I may know very little, so I can&#39;t be certain that I haven&#39;t been causing myself more spiritual harm than good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do gods live inside your conspiracies?</p>

<p>No.  None.  There is only one God - and It is <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=tat+tvam+asi&amp;amp;PC=U316&amp;amp;FORM=CHROMN">Tat Tvam Asi</a>; The All That Is.  Demiurges are but lesser beings - just like you and me.  They may be more evolved, but they should not be worshiped or looked upon as God any more so than anything else.  Again, Tat tvam asi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always looked at it from the perspective of, when we don&#39;t know enough, we always invoke &quot;supernatural&quot; as a catch-all. I&#39;m of the belief that everything is natural and what we may call demons or spirits may be actually aliens or interdimensional intelligence. A lot of the details of famous conspiracy theorists end up correct, but they get caught up in spiritual stuff because we don&#39;t have a full explanation to what it is that&#39;s controlling our world. It&#39;s very likely of alien to us, whether or not it originated from our planet.</p>

<p>Europeans didn&#39;t even know some of the larger gorillas existed until 1902. That&#39;s only just over 100 years ago. Lots of the reports of people describing large man-like beasts with bad tempers roaming the jungle. Now that we know they exist, I highly doubt it would change your perspective if you were to come in contact with one in accidentally in real life. The fear and awe would be just as impressive as the first European to lay eyes on one.</p>

<p>My point is, it doesn&#39;t matter whether or not these things are &quot;magic&quot;. What matters is that it&#39;s clear something is not right and there&#39;s a very traceable series of events that have been perpetrated by these entities.</p>
