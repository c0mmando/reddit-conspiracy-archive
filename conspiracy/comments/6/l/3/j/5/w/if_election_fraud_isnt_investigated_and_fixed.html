       Except in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. That is a 7% failure rate, if 7% of the time the NFL or NBA team won with the least amount of points, nobody would accept that. Yet, here we are with our political system..

       Would you prefer that the same NFL or NBA team wins EVERY game?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're advocating for letting the winner be whoever wins over California and New York in every election.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do you just want liberals in power forever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want an economy more like California?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you want gun control laws like New York? Does that make sense in Alaska?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we have the system set up like this is because each state is supposed to have it's on way of life, and their separate input matters more than each individual I'm the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise you end up with everyone in Alaska dying unarmed from predators, and their vote will never matter so there's nothing they can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the system is pretty fucky since the states have been robbed of their individual peer to a certain extent, but the point remains...
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really want California and New York to choose everything for everyone in America forever?
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly fucking don't. I'm very thankful there's a chance to override a shit vote due to two highly populated, extremely insulated, like-minded individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason people outside of those areas aren't as liberal. Life is different, and I don't think we should ignore the fact that the political pendulum swings in a very balanced manner in this country. I think it's better than having the same team win every game, personally.

       Okay, I may be misled on California's current economic standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still don't want the two biggest population centers choosing the president every time, and I'm certainly not alone in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want it changed, feel free to lobby for it. Protest. Organize with people who agree with you and try to actually do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I highly doubt fifty percent of the country wants that change, so you'll have to just accept it forever. Because they'll always vote the same way. And your voice will never matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like what you want for states that aren't California or New York! Sucks ass, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily we have representatives to condense the vote and give your side a better chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like the electoral college does for elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to agree. You don't have to like it. You do have to get over it or do something about it. Crying on Reddit didn't change my mind, and I doubt it influenced anyone who has any understanding of the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry your side lost in 1787. Maybe you'll have a better chance this time around.

       I take it back. I'm sorry for being an arrogant prick.

       While I can't say I've definitively changed my mind, it's clear as it ever will be that I need to educate myself more on this topic before I open my mouth about it, lol.

       I'm usually not this adamant about my opinions, either. I guess somewhere some sort of brainwashing/biased talk must have hit me hard.

       True, this will be an issue. Probably a lot easier if you only make them do it one time forever. Tie it to the SS system, or welfare, or the tax system, or something else like that. However those places verify identity, then do that. You get a token that becomes yours forever, and no one can use it except for you.

       It's guaranteed to be downvoted because there is literally zero evidence of non-citizens voting in significant numbers, thereby making your statement it "would cripple certain political parties" at nest unproven conjecture.

       There is however plenty of evidence that this "muh non-existent illegal voters" gets used to push laws through preventing or making it harder for US citizens to exercise their right to vote.

       Explain?? You want me to explain the Social Security Administration to you?? You want me to explain how insecure SSN numbers are? You want me to explain how they're not unique? Why haven't you even looked at your social security card and read the part where it says NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION?
      </p>
      <p>
       Using SSN for ID is retarded and broken and begging to be defrauded. This is common knowledge. It is common sense.

       What? Just make it a law that anyone can get a basic state ID for free if they need one to vote. Requiring an ID that costs money to vote is literally a poll tax.

       Not while they control the voting centres. It seems inevitable that things will have to be taken before they can be distributed equitably. "Out of my cold dead hands" is a saying that comes to mind which could describe the current holders of power.

       The only answer is direct representation. As long as we have representatives that can be bought, we will be controlled by the rich. Even if the rich pay us all off, at least we will slightly benefit from the pay-off.

       This is the whole reason the Russian narrative is being pushed so hard, why the DNC class action lawsuit isn't covered. It's is all a distraction. The timing fits perfectly. After the DNC leaks, the Russia narrative started getting pushed. Any conversation about electoral reform or a conversation of the neutrality of the DNC was and is still shutdown.
