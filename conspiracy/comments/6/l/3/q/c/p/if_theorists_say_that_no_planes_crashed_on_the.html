    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right 9/11 happened exactly as the official story said it does...and Saddam had WMD&#39;s which is why over a million Iraqi civilians had to die. That was the official story as well.</p>

<p>You believing that it&#39;s irrational to question the 9/11 narrative is funny. If your girlfriend cheated on you and lied a countless amount of times would you really think she was incapable of lying again? Keep thinking what you&#39;re told.</p>

<p>And if those &quot;planes&quot; are drones, then what happened to the real planes that were hijacked since they didn&#39;t crash on the WTC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you search the flight manifest a large % of the people <em>on</em> the planes were military. The other half never showed up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More than 350 people who were originally scheduled to be on the four airliners hijacked in the 9/11 attacks either changed their plans and canceled their reservations--in many cases at the last minute--or simply failed to show up for the flights on the morning of September 11, 2001. While these individuals came from a variety of backgrounds, a remarkable number of them worked in, or had close connections to, Hollywood or other areas of the entertainment industry. Some of them were very well-known personalities.</p>

<p>In 2009, a group of people, including 9/11 Truth movement activist Lorie Van Auken and others who have lost friends or relatives in the attack, appealed to the City of New York to investigate the disaster. </p>

<p>The New York City Coalition for Accountability Now collected signatures to require the New York City Council to place the creation of an investigating commission on the November 2009 election ballot.[59] <strong>The group collected more than enough signatures to put the proposal before the voters, but New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner stated that the petition overstepped what is allowable by city law, and ruled that, despite wording in the petition to allow for elements ruled invalid to be stricken, it would not be allowed to appear on the ballot.</strong></p>
