       Too much debunking her research man. 97 seconds? At freefall its about a 15 second fall. I totally believe there is more to the story, but she is about as credible as CNN. A pancake collapse doesnt mean the floors will be neatly piled at the bottom. Each floor will pulverize the floor beneath as they are demolished in a freefall. Nothing but rubble and dust left. 97 seconds is an eternity in demolition.

       No, im not a physicist. However I can use my eyes. No need to get salty. I looked into her. She is bunk and bad science man. She has been called out by many for completely ignoring the simple stuff (scientific method). Name a pancake demolition you have seen that has taken over 10 seconds. I cant, I cant even find a single demolition ANYWHERE taking over 20 seconds. 97 seconds is literally a lifetime in demolition. What specific science does she list that adds to 97 seconds, maybe you are mis-remembering. Happens to me.

       I may be misunderstanding you/him but no. Im speaking of controlled demos. From start of collapse to finish. Obviously not from first detonation to fall. 97 seconds from first detonation to finish is reasonable, but not from start of fall to end of fall. No where on earth is this a thing. From quick reading of her theory, it sounds like she means from start of fall to end of fall. A 90 second fall is unheard of. They were not 15000ft tall buildings.

       Also, It seems that the theory here is that these massive buildings don't have the energy to demolish their underlying floors throughout the floor, and that also doesn't hold water. The weight of each floor at terminal velocity absolutely has enough energy to demolish the underlying floors in a controlled pancake demolition. My sources are every single controlled pancake demolition video on youtube and seeing one in person. They are set up to create rubble.. Not a nice stack of broken concrete slabs.

       but the buildings didnt collapse to the ground in 9.2, that is when the debris first started to hit the ground.      ground hitting the debris is not the same this as the tower collapsing completely into the ground. Your research is wrong and your numbers are faulty.

       At the end of the day, humans did it. Does it really matter ultimately if it was Americans, Jews, Saudis or whoever else?
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the very end, I believe that God did it for a specific effect on the American psyche. 9/11 woke us all out of our slumber, just from the sheer magnanimity of the event. Magnanimity, does that word work here? Idk I've never used it before in a sentence....

       Imagine someone who had been in a coma on 9/11 or otherwise had no clue what was going on that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll imagine I'm that person. If you told me, "the twin towers were hit by passenger jets and came down," maybe I would assume that this was physically possible before I did any research into the buildings or the structure of Boeing jets or if I didn't really know much about physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But assuming I could believe that what you said was true, I sure as shit wouldn't be picturing in my mind the buildings turning to dust as they plummeted straight down while blowing apart in every direction. I would picture them toppling over in a huge mess.

       There was bombs inside. There a multiple witnesses saying so, seismic data and audio recordings of them going off. The only terrorists that day were those in the US government that planned this.

       Ah, 9/11...  A day of "unprecedented events".
      </p>
      <p>
       The day that 19 Saudis with boxcutters took over North American aerospace by simply "turning off the transponder" and doing what they wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most shocking thing is all those years of the Cold War and it turns out all the Soviet Union had to do is turn off their transponders and fly in and invade... And they didn't!
      </p>
      <p>
       The day that and airliner evaporated on impact for the first time ever... And it happened four more times that day leaving only a pristine passport of one of the terrorists...everything else was shredded.
Perhaps if the buildings and the planes had been made of whatever that passport was made from the outcome might have been different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day three towers collapse in their own footprint without having been rigged to do so... For the first, second, and third time ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day that physics got put on hold (or maybe just called in sick) so the events could match up to the official narrative...again.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the OP phrased the post incorrectly,  it should read "All I have to do to prove the tower did pancakes is clap 11 times a second".   It's a moot point,  so much of that day was an exercise in suspending science in favor of crafting a tale... It was obvious that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been 16 years... Time to look at who profited and how much.   It should be obvious by now to tell who did it by looking at what has happened since.
      </p>
      <p>
       The destruction of two towers and reconstruction of one in it's place suggests secret society involvement,  certain defense contractors got a lot of "no bid" gravy since then,  and the wealth gap has gotten huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally feel it was a crime 2000 years in the making,  a sick ceremony of some kind to usher in a new age,  planned for decades.

       It is even more fucked up than controlled demo. The towers disintegrated into dust. Likely nuclear or some form of directed energy. Dr. Judy Woods source.
