       I'm not really for Communism or any particular system, but I feel like people in America are sort of brainwashed that it's bad without really being given logical arguments or all the facts. I feel like people love to point out that every previous Communist system have failed as evidence that the system itself doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this makes no sense, if you build an electronic airplane using material A and none of the airplanes with that material work, and then you build another airplane with material B and it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       work, that does not mean that material B is superior. What if the way the plane was built is entirely different? What if the person controlling the airplane is different? What if the person who built the airplane was better trained...
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that you can't say for sure that the economic system is the reason it failed without presenting an argument that
       <em>
        the system
       </em>
       is what caused it to fail more than anything else, because of how many factors are at play in real life. And because we can't really "control for variables" as the world happens in real time, we have to have well thought out arguments and look back at why these things really happened (sort of like controlling for variables in retrospect). Yet, everyone likes to pretend that because countries with communist systems failed, it
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to be the system that caused it, even though by itself this makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that these well reasoned arguments aren't out there (so if you have them, please share), I just hate the "anti-Communism" propaganda mindset that we seem to have by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pretending to know much about social/economic systems here, but I also know that most people don't and still like to shit on Communism for no reason. It's stupid and it tilts me.

       Communism is a Utopia and utopias do not nor can they ever exist as long as humans are involved. Utopian systems usually get highjacked and turned into Dystopian systems. If you say "great lets us AI", well aren't most people paranoid of our AI overlords? See where I'm getting at?

       I mean I don't see why we can't have a Communist system with checks and balances, so as to limit human corruption. Capitalism and basically every society ever has shown that as long as humans are involved, corruption is everywhere. How often do Corporations do fucked up shit? All the time, but does that mean that Capitalism is inherently flawed or that people are? And does it mean that we should discount potential systems because of these flaws?

       Because that is not possible. I suppose you could just dope society up, but then we are heading into a dystopian society. Look into the movies/books Equilibrium and the Giver.

       I guess I see where you are coming from now, but I don't understand why is the "state" being involved cause so many problems for you? Is it because you are envisioning a 1984-esque future in which the government has a lock on everything? And you say that a system can't have checks and balances, but the US system does to a large degree, why can't a communist system?

       A State inherently means Authority and rulership. Remember, Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. There is also this case. Say we have a benevolent monarch, unless he/she lives forever there is no way to know whether the heir will be benevolent or malevolent. Because of human nature.

       If the US truly had checks and balances we would not be here talking about how messed up the situation is, now would we? Think about it.

       You need to learn the actual history of the US. I don't mean that in a belittling way but more as a wise suggestion. Checks and balances are good just not when the fox is guarded the henhouse.

       Maybe that was a bit too strong - it has its place in resistance. If I understand voluntarism correctly, it's deliberate non-cooperation with the state and other institutions of coercion? Which, yes, has its place. Then we face the question of how to understand and overcome - how to democratise - the other forces that shape our daily existence. How could we refuse cooperation with an economic order that is so total, so all-encompassing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I've misunderstood the meaning of voluntarism in this sense?

       Exactly and to take it one step further, what is to stop an AI from becoming self aware and has learned from his programming about dictator rulership. What if that AI in particular decided to deem humans unworthy and that they were supreme ruler?

       Communism is dumb. Economies are complex systems. They're not really something government can even control. A lot of people hate capitalism for various reason, but its biggest failure is that it is too successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no fucking way our technology would be as advanced as it is without capitalism. Power also corrupts people and communism has to have leaders. Because the leaders can just do whatever the fuck they want in the name of economic regulations, the system ends up failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of that said, capitalism has brought humans to the brink of a very bleak future. A solar flare, natural disasters, or economic disruption would turn out terribly due to our dependence upon the system.

       You obviously refer to historical communism, not communism as a system. Not an expert on the subject, but in this social system, the power goes in the hands of unions of workers, syndicates sworn to protect the interest of the working class. Of course corruption still applies (as everything human) but if there is unity, then it can be swiped around and into the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it depends on the leaders not to be ego-driven and on opposition not to be "competitively" murderous.

       It just doesn't scale up in my opinion. Communism is awesome as an idealistic, philosophical, and intellectual approach to equality, but fails to address the rights of the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think its important for everyone to know and understand communism's strengths and weaknesses, same as capitalism. Which is why I understand why a lot of people think it could work. They're just wrong, that's all.

       It's equally wrong to believe that individual rights are adequately upheld under capitalism. Moreover, the kind of individualism that flourishes under capitalism is damaging for society: by overlooking the relationships between individuals and groups that create strong communities, and responding in the main to the power of money, we destroy the basis on which persons can truly flourish.

       There's nothing idealized in what I've written: it's absolutely the case that capitalism - especially in its neoliberal form - has corroded social institutions as basic as the family.

       I'd very much agree with you that competition exists everywhere; the question is whether we want to make it the one single basic principle governing decisions over our lives.

       Not many systems of government are inherently bad or systematically evil.

       <em>

       No government works because no person is incorruptible. It's the sad truth of society that low to no government is the best realistic method to assure liberty of the individual.

       History has shown classical liberalism/ibertarianism/free market capitalism is the best way to provide for increase prosperity and greater standards of living.

       I just don't see how we can say "history has shown" when this is just one possible outcome. I would really like to see the direct reasons that it was Communism that has caused these issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is lots of fucked up shit that America has done, but I don't think it's intellectually honest to point out those examples and say that they were caused by capitalism without a proper argument.

       that low-regulation capitalism failed miserably. Great Depression. Higher regulation and higher tax capitalism did great. 1940's to 1980. Deregulation since then destroyed economic progress for people.

       The problem is communism is that it eats away at the idea of private property or you owning something. If you belong to the State or you own nothing because everyone owns it..who gets to decide what you own? Forced redistribution of all land and property...for the good of the national community.
      </p>
      <p>
       What incentive is there for someone to do the jobs no one likes? Which brings me to the point of having to force people to do the jobs that we require that no one wants to do. Also there is no real incentive to work harder since everyone is given an 'equal share'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism kills creative thinking such as there is no real value in a poet of painter as there is for say a builder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism itself does not erase class struggle, as it would suggest, but it adds to it. Someone obviously has to be in charge, there has to be leaders. Chances are that group enjoy its power and maintaining it. Look at the Russian revolution in 1905, 1917 ,Chinese 1949, and Cuban revolutions. All of these fought against an elitist upper class that they preached against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the millions of people that died to Communist rule. Stalin alone murdered about 20 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human beings are entitled to their human rights; which consist of you owning yourself and your property, right to be free, and the right to defend yourself. All which Communism take away to a certain degree.

       You don't own anything in a capitalist democracy, either. You don't own anything that can't be taken away from you. Not your car…not your home…not your kids.

       I don't understand what you mean, care to elaborate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I own my clothes, I own the food I bought, I own this computer.  Take them away from me involuntarily is theft. I own myself, unlike what Communists I've talked to will state; like for example your kids not belonging to you as a parent but belonging to the community instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with Capitalism. All Capitalism is an exchange of goods for another. I trade you something you want, and you give me something I want. What is wrong with that? What we have now is what most enlightened individuals on the subject would call 'Crony-Capitalism'. We don't have real free-trade with all these regulations and taxes. You can argue that they are a necessary evil but that's besides the point.

       Sure. Get a 20$ parking ticket and refuse to pay it…someone will eventually come take your car. Here in Canada if you get nailed with an impaired driving charge…or refusing a breathalyzer they'll take your car and force you to pay to get it back…plus towing fees and impound charges for the 30 days they keep it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't pay your property taxes eventually they'll auction off your home. If you resist they'll haul you off to jail or shoot you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spank your kid…refuse to send them to school or do anything else the state deems inappropriate and they'll take them away and place them in foster care.

      <p>
       Just a few examples.

       One thing we can say is capitalism is failing. Propped up economies floundering in debt. Communism has never been instilled properly on this planet and may only work on paper. One thing is for certain the working class in this western system is getting shafted.

       Because that is not possible. I suppose you could just dope society up, but then we are heading into a dystopian society. Look into the movies/books Equilibrium and the Giver.

        Capitalism and basically every society ever has shown that as long as humans are involved, corruption is everywhere.

       A lot now how often do governments?

        All the time, but does that mean that Capitalism is inherently flawed or that people are?

      <p>
       People are. Not all though.

       <p>
        And does it mean that we should discount potential systems because of these flaws?

      <p>
       If it involves a State then yes, imo.

       You don't own anything in a capitalist democracy, either. You don't own anything that can't be taken away from you. Not your car…not your home…not your kids.
