        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m pretty high. Did Moses have access to alien weaponry? The story of Moses goes like this: when he was a baby his mom abandoned her child (on your doorstep and ringing the bell style) to pharaohs wife who adopted him. He grew up in royalty and he learned the secrets of the pyramids (my guess) . He took his staff and split seas, summoned pillars of fire, and controlled the weather (raining frogs, hail) . My theory is that Moses had something in his DNA that no one else who had access to the staff had that allowed him to tap into the staffs powers (district 9 style). </p>

<p>Where did this staff come from? I&#39;m thinking the first kings were not like the rest of humanity - aliens or remnants of the old earth (before great catsrophy) is my best guess. Maybe Moses fits that profile. </p>

<p>Maybe Jews have special blood/DNA that makes them &quot;better&quot; than us? Remnants of the past world or alien? </p>

<p>Aside: I came to this sub after losing religion. You guys talk about the bible more than my church did and now I find myself reading the bible. Good prank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest looking into the absence of jews/Hebrews/exodus in Egyptian records and Akhenaten being mostly erased from egyptian records(so much so that nobody knew about his son Tut until the tomb was rediscovered in 1923) along with the timing coincidence of exodus and the brief monotheism experiment.</p>

<p>He means the Hyksos could have been the Hebrew of the Bibile. Akhenaton, as &quot;Moses&quot;, advocated for &quot;monotheism&quot;. The god of Akhenaten was &quot;amon&quot; (where do you think &quot;amen&quot; comes from).</p>

<p>Jewish antiquity historian Josephus is the one who developped this idea of the Hyksos/Hebrews correspondance the most.</p>

<p>Just READ the Old Testament. Genesis and Exodus, etc.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it as &quot;God&#39;s word&quot;, just READ IT, like a book - like a story.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all quite clear.</p>

<p>Of course that is not to say that CLEAR means &quot;factual&quot;, by any means - as the story of Moses is MUCH older that the fabled Book of Exodus...</p>

<p>But it all gives you an idea of the MINDSET of the HeeeBrewwwws and their conniving, grifter mindset that persists to this day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brooooooooo. Holy shit, I have a rabbit hole to end all others if you&#39;re down. I think that they ark of the covenant was a Sumerian gravity-altering, zero-point energy device of sorts that Moses stole from the Egyptians before he left, which is why Pharaoh let him leave with all the (real) Israelites, then was like &quot;oh fuck, changed my mind! Whole army, go <em>get Moses!</em>&quot;. It also explains how Moses parted the red sea, as it&#39;s the only instance where water was effected by &quot;divinity&quot; when the Ark was not present. It was just that Moses already had <em>what was eventually going to reside within the Ark</em>; a thing called the &quot;dark crystal&quot;; explained as an orb with many eyes (I think the eyes were a product of the geometry of the crystal. </p>

<p>If that sounds like your deal, let me know.</p>

<p>And, no Jews are regular people who propagandize everyone else to believe they are chosen because they can&#39;t believe that they&#39;re really just adherents of a bastard sect of mostly evil people. You can google &quot;which race has the highest IQ&quot;, and you&#39;ll see Jews win by a few points, but then you actually compete with one in an open and fair contest of some sort and they tend to come in about average, far below average with things that require physical grace or creative intuition.  They&#39;ve been many things throughout time, both good and bad, but it should be said that they&#39;ve been coopted by something very, very nefarious, typified and concentrated in Israel. Not to say that the same thing is not in many many American Jews, but it is very pronounced in Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are on the right line of thinking but im going to give you the secret people forget , the Jews are of the bloodline of angels (nephilim , half bred children ) moses had angelic magic and so have many more , the false religions of Christianity and Islam have sought to destroy this bloodline for years , the inquisition destroyed people with a gift their bloodlines have held for thousands of years , in recent times hitler sought Jewish magic and tried to wipe them out too , the angels who creates these lines were not evil in any way , just lustful ,  you have to remember the angels were only rebels who sought to destroy a dictator who held the human race in bondage as cattle and Christianity and Islam have both used propaganda to sully the name of freedom fighters and label them as &quot;evil&quot; Satan and his angels have no power of man , it is not them who whisper in the ear of man it is angels in the service of a dictator who wants things his way or the high way ..</p>

<p>back to magic .. the angelic bloodlines and their gifts , there are people on the planet with healing gifts faith healers  , i believe the3se are the last of the lineage , i do not think we will ever see magic like we had in the past , i believe the end od days is close at hand and i fear that everything we know as truth to be a lie.</p>
