<p>For this reason I don&#39;t think we should accept trumps tweets as sources on this sub. There is ZERO evidence it&#39;s directly from the president. We can&#39;t see who hits the send button.</p>

<p>While removing msm spin from his tweets, we get in return anonymous drivel that claims to be the presidents words and deepest feelings. It&#39;s a great con, but stay woketh</p>

<p>This did not begin with the Trump presidency or even the Trump presidential race.  The character of trump has been built up through TV appearances over a very long time in preparation for the current role.  </p>

<p>The impression of an independent challenging the system is large part of the persona that the PR team would like people to see.  Pay less attention to the messages coming from &#39;Trump&#39; and more time looking at the connections behind the scenes and the techniques of manipulation that those players use.
