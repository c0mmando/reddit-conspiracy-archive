       Why should we not believe that high level interns have studied trumps mannerisms and tweets from pre presidency to distract the masses from the administrations secret agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       For this reason I don't think we should accept trumps tweets as sources on this sub. There is ZERO evidence it's directly from the president. We can't see who hits the send button.
      </p>
      <p>
       While removing msm spin from his tweets, we get in return anonymous drivel that claims to be the presidents words and deepest feelings. It's a great con, but stay woketh

       I think Jezebel or one of those websites did an analysis of his tweets a year or so ago... and figured out how to spot which ones were him personally and which were tweeted by aides based some of the times, OS, and writing style... but right now I doubt he is the one running

       I think he shares that account with some staffers or something... they post all the meaningful retweets and official looking image posts and news stories... and then he personally tosses in some of his @realDT retweeted stuff from time to time.

       Wellllll... I guess that could be true. But it is really reaching... If 12-year olds can get stolen Runescape accounts returned to them I think the President of the United States of America can get his twitter account unhacked. Is English your first language?

       Does anyone think Hillary was really running her Twitter account during the campaign? Probably not. So I don't know why people would assume that DJT is behind his. Probably at least some of them are not really him.

       Trump is not one man.  There is a specific person who plays the role for the cameras, but behind that is a massive PR strategy team which decides on the actions and messaging to be put out in order to create the desired persona.
      </p>
      <p>
       This did not begin with the Trump presidency or even the Trump presidential race.  The character of trump has been built up through TV appearances over a very long time in preparation for the current role.
      </p>
      <p>
       The impression of an independent challenging the system is large part of the persona that the PR team would like people to see.  Pay less attention to the messages coming from 'Trump' and more time looking at the connections behind the scenes and the techniques of manipulation that those players use.  You could start with this:

       That is 100% true... but it seems like he'd mention it live on TV if his twitter was stolen against his will... You could really say that about anyone and their tweets... unless they like... livestream themselves tweeting 24/7?
