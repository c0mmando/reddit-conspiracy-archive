        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post is probably out of left field for r/conspiracy, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be asking the right audience if I go to, say, r/relationships. I need advice from people who are used to hitting heads with a good majority of the population, including their loved ones.</p>

<p>I come from a family with lots of competing views, so I&#39;m typically good at navigating sensitive, partisan waters. Talking with my boyfriend? That&#39;s on a whole different level. In my eyes, it&#39;s not our ideologies or political beliefs that clash, but rather our perceptions of &quot;the good&quot; in people, governments and corporations. He sees evil machinations where I see incompetence. I feel like he sees the world through a Hollywood lens, where every event is a &quot;thriller&quot; with a distinct, shadowy villain. Of course, he thinks I see the world through rose-colored glasses and has called me naive many times. (Ugh)</p>

<p>When he discusses his views on the Newtown shootings (didn&#39;t happen), the moon landings (faked), and 9/11 (inside job), my main reaction is horror and disbelief. I listen to why he believes each thing he does... and to me, it sounds totally paranoid, irrational and sometimes insensitive to a disgusting degree.</p>

<p>I tend to psychoanalyze the reasons he believes what he does (i.e. &quot;What happened in his childhood that makes him assume the worst of all leaders and governments...&quot;), but I doubt that helps our situation at all.</p>

<p>So, he thinks I&#39;m a lovable shill, and I think he&#39;s a lovable kook. We could try what my parents do---avoid these subjects altogether--but considering how passionate both of us are, I think it would suck to keep our thoughts away from each other. What&#39;s the way forward? He thinks my sources are crap and I think the same of his. Both of us wish we could change the other&#39;s mind but realize that&#39;s unlikely to happen. At the very least, I wish we could have respectful and honest conversations without either of us becoming defensive. (I go <strong><em>red</em></strong> when he starts discussing Newtown, and I&#39;m sure his blood boils a bit when I start rolling my eyes during his GMO rants.)</p>

<p>In your experience, is civil conversation on these subjects possible, or should we spend the rest of our relationship avoiding them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch a couple documentaries with him and then come to your own conclusion . You guys should be able to agree to disagree without it going farther but hey....9/11 was an inside job as well as Sandy Hook.I mean no offense but everyone is entitled to there own personal opinions and that definitely shouldmt be a deal breaker if you guys love each other. I suggest the documentary &quot;Jfk to 9/11 Everything is a rich mans trick&quot; as well as We need to talk about Sandy Hook and  Conspiracy of silence . Those 3 are good starters fir someone who hasn&#39;t been red pilled to hard yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve watched <em>several</em> documentaries together. That&#39;s what typically starts our debates, in fact! They&#39;re one of his favorite sources of information. For me, most of them are so horribly slanted that I feel better off avoiding them and just reading a few books on the subject. Admittedly, I don&#39;t get around to reading those books, whereas he is spurred by the documentary to find further details online and several YouTube wormholes that confirm/echo what the documentary says.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched some Sandy Hook material with him, but he won&#39;t watch the new <em>Newtown</em> documentary with me that sits down with the families affected by the shooting. (Or should I say &quot;shooting.&quot;) I think that&#39;s pretty unfair. That said, I probably couldn&#39;t handle his reaction to the parent&#39;s tears, which he would call fake.</p>

<p>Most of what he says might actually be true and he&#39;s not talking crazy yet if that&#39;s the topic you guys are discussing. There&#39;s much more crazy stuff than 9/11 or the moon hahaha</p>

<p>Anyways, I think they are important conversations to have but they are hard to have just because of the sheer amount of info needed to comprehend the subjects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Entirely possible, another factor is all conspiracies end up tying each other with links of various sorts. It is one long string of stories and sometimes one story might not be holding much water on its own, but when viewed in the bigger context, fits perfectly. But to end up with that result, you need to know everything around it, so an obvious link to me, would be non-existent for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a big issue between my wife and I. My profession allows me to watch lectures/vids while I work, and she&#39;s an RN, so that kind of learning is nearly impossible for her – unless it&#39;s in her &quot;spare time.&quot; We&#39;re raising a kid together, so there is no &quot;spare time.&quot; </p>

<p>For the most part, she trusts me and knows that I&#39;ve dug deeper into issues than she has; in turn, I don&#39;t try to convince her of things that, in the end, don&#39;t directly affect our lives, e.g., Sandy Hook. I don&#39;t care what she believes about it, and she accepts that I believe a different story than what was presented – and that&#39;s where it ends. We don&#39;t have a television, and neither of us consumes any mass media (esp. TV &quot;news&quot;), so that helps.</p>

<p>One can safely argue that the truth behind 9/11, Sandy Hook, etc. DOES affect our lives whether we like it or not, but for our daily existence together, it&#39;s not important to me that she accept what I&#39;ve learned. In contrast, the vaccine issue was months of discussion because we were having a child together – and she&#39;s an RN, so my 20 years of research in the matter was tough for her to swallow.</p>

<p>I would ask your SO what his lines in the sand are, and why. You mention GMOs, and because you&#39;re in a relationship, the truth about this issue might be important. Agree to look at the information he has with an open mind, consider the reliability and motives of the various sources and weigh all the evidence.</p>

<p>I also have to admit that there is much that I don&#39;t even discuss with my wife, because she has enough to worry about. I don&#39;t want her to change; I want her to keep her sense of humor – and it&#39;s hard enough for me to do that with all the shit I look at. I love her the way she is and don&#39;t need her to know about directed energy weapons and fucking/torturing children for their adrenochromes.</p>

<p>These are tough times for any relationship; the &quot;they&quot; you don&#39;t believe in are doing everything in their power to destroy our capacity for love. I hope both you and your SO can see that and help it fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My boyfriend often says we don&#39;t have to understand each other, just accept each other, and I agree. But there&#39;s always a wistful edge to what he says that makes me wish we <em>could</em> understand each other. I&#39;m not scared to learn about dark, hidden truths if they&#39;re there to find. I&#39;ve already renounced god, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a colder fact than mortality.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much spare time to be had--and I love filling that time with stupid fluff after concentrating all day at work--but if putting more time aside to read/view the same things he does would facilitate more understanding, then it may be worthwhile. Even if I do this, I may not view the sources the same way he does---but we could go back to the way you and your wife are (and my parents are), and if that&#39;s the worse case scenario, I can deal with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your position on this. I am just trying to tell you what happened with my wife and I. I am not trying to convince you of anything. And I do not <em>believe</em> most of the stuff around here, I just entertain all ideas, and suspend disbelief with the goal of being able to discuss these subjects as if they are real. Sometimes I think one of the main resistances to conspiracy theories is people are afraid of being tricked, or just being wrong, or be perceived as being a kook. I maintain this position of neutrality though, just for the purpose of exploring. And I don&#39;t feel like I can ever be wrong, because I can never be right. It is an intellectual exercise.</p>

<p>Sounds like your SO is a true believer. I think that would be just as difficult to deal with as a complete non-believer. And honestly there would be way too much anxiety over all this stuff if I believed it completely, I don&#39;t envy anyone who thinks everyone is out to get them all the time.</p>

<p>Maybe you should look up what &quot;atavistic&quot; means. And probably the definition of beast, as well, since you seem confused as to what that means.</p>

<p>my username is basically synonymous with &quot;ancient animal,&quot; but using cooler words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is my thinking on conspiracies: we basically don&#39;t want to live in a world where random senseless violence occurs. Who wants to live in a world where a crazy can get their hands on a gun and go kill a bunch of children? One of the basic precepts of society is that, if you play by the rules, you&#39;ll be able to get a little piece of the pie and you won&#39;t randomly die. Random violence violates that precept. So if &#39;the government&#39; or &#39;the illuminati&#39; is &#39;behind&#39; say, a 9/11, or a Sandy Hook, at least in that scenario THERE WAS A PLAN. This violence was ordained, it was orchestrated, for reasons unknown to us, but at least there was a reason. It wasn&#39;t just senseless. The world isn&#39;t actualy just random. People don&#39;t just die for no reason....except in actuality, they do.</p>

<p>To reconstitute an act of senseless violence as a nefarious plot is not only re-assuring, it casts us in the role of &#39;hero&#39;...the &#39;truth-seeker&#39; that see&#39;s through this dastardly plot, this is one of the only ones who can &#39;save&#39; the &#39;sheeple&#39;. I think it&#39;s a very comforting idea for a certain type of person; a way to reassert control over lives we increasingly feel not in control of.</p>

<p>When you see heinous things occur, often the only explanation is &#39;stupid (incompetent) or evil&#39;? I lean (as it sounds like you do), towards incompetence, but &#39;evil&#39; (or what we define as &#39;evil&#39;...in actuality there&#39;s no such thing, just power-struggles amongst people with varying moral compasses) is very real in this world....the executives that decide to use child labor to increase their profits, that dump toxic chemicals in bodies of water clandestinely, that push known-harmful compounds of the population for the sake of money, that go to war with others over resources, etc. There&#39;s ample real world evidence of &#39;evil&#39;...so I can see how someone that&#39;s aware of this may see it lurking around every corner. Conversely, when you start to become aware of how pervasive the mindset of Capitalism is (a mindset that often violates the moral values most of us were raised with &#39;be a good person&#39;, &#39;treat others the way you want to be treated&#39;, &#39;don&#39;t steal&#39;, &#39;don&#39;t lie&#39;, etc.) in making large-scale decisions, it may be so frightening to consider that other&#39;s retreat away from it, dismiss it, tell themselves it cannot be the way things actually are.</p>

<p>We live in a post-objective world. The idea that there is an objective truth to anything is regarded as silly...we speak of &#39;our truths&#39;, &#39;their truths&#39;, &#39;my truth&#39;. Subjectivity is king. Whether that&#39;s good or bad, I don&#39;t know....but I know the answer to bridging the gaps between people&#39;s different &#39;truth&#39;s&#39; is communication. If I were you, I&#39;d dig deep and try to figure out why this matters so much to you: you say, &#39;it feels good to connects on ALL levels&#39;...well, you&#39;ll never meet someone you connect with on ALL levels; that&#39;s a fantasy. Ask yourself: what is it that REALLY bothers you so much with your boyfriend&#39;s belief? Don&#39;t just accept the surface answer you give yourself, really think about the implications and try to interrogate why it means so much to you.</p>

<p>Then, once you have the REAL answer, figure out a way to communicate it to your boyfriend using &#39;I-statements&#39;....i.e. &quot;When you talk about conspiracies, it makes ME feel like you&#39;re not as intelligent as I thought you were, and that violates my own idealized version of a mate...I love everything else about you, but you talking about these conspiracies makes me feel bad.&#39; OR &#39;It scares me when you talk about conspiracies, because it makes me feel like you&#39;re creating barriors or excuses for yourself in some way. I want the best for us, so it worries me when I feel like you won&#39;t be able to provide because I feel like this line of thinking will hold you back.&#39; etc. etc. Frame everything as YOUR truth that you’re trying to communicate; try not to make valuations about the validity of his truth.</p>

<p>The key to a successful relationship is to to understand yourself and what you really NEED, and then to learn to accept someone for who they are (bad traits as well as good), if they can meet that essential need. All the little idiosyncrasies are what make us who we are…love em or leave em, but trying to change ‘em will always result in bad times.</p>

<p>I think your thoughts are perfectly summarized by an Alan Moore quote I&#39;m really fond of (this will be heresy on this subject but oh well):</p>

<p>&quot;The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory, is that conspiracy theorists believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is actually chaotic. The truth is that it is not The Iluminati, or The Jewish Banking Conspiracy, or the Gray Alien Theory. </p>

<p>The truth is far more frightening - Nobody is in control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I said that I tend towards psychoanalysis, this is what I meant. On some level, I believe my boyfriend finds comfort (despite his disgust at the world) in a sense of knowing why &quot;senseless,&quot; terrible things occur and who&#39;s bad/who&#39;s good. He is enormously distrustful of government and corporations. Whenever an article or a speaker is not 100% transparent, he always assumes the worst.</p>

<p>I have stated to him why his views bother me, though maybe not too coherently, and probably not with &quot;I&quot; statements. It&#39;s led to hurtful conversations for us both, where I tell him he&#39;s basically uneducated (just an eager autodidact) and has odd standards for evidence and he tells me I&#39;m not a critical thinker and that I don&#39;t really care about understanding things, since he reads a lot more (these days) than I do. That makes me feel like he doesn&#39;t really see me; my views aren&#39;t exactly common either and I try to consider multiple points of view. When I&#39;m clueless or disinterested in a subject, I simply withhold comment. </p>

<p>I have never admitted that it sort of embarrasses me when he talks with my friends, some who are highly educated and well-versed in a lot of the subjects that he discusses. His reaction to their arguments is that they&#39;re aggressive, arrogant, and clueless, while I&#39;m always thinking &quot;what they just said is spot on.&quot; I didn&#39;t get with him because I valued his insights on the world--we just have a crazy amount of fun together and he&#39;s a caring, wonderful guy. He is intelligent, but I tend to feel like he fell in with the wrong crowd of thought and just ran with it. (Sort of like libertarians, who IMO are often brilliant but misguided.) </p>

<p>I agree that it&#39;s worth more deeply considering why this is important to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will give them a listen--if they have podcasts, even better.</p>

<p>When you say serious questions, do you mean about the world&#39;s workings, or about what&#39;s important to a relationship? I&#39;ve been in relationships with people I see eye-to-eye with on things---we&#39;re no longer together, so I know that&#39;s not the important thing in a relationship. It&#39;s awesome that you and your wife have that connection now, though--I&#39;m sure it makes things go smoother.</p>

<p>I know you may not believe it, but a lot of us &quot;shills&quot; have already done a lot of questioning and simply didn&#39;t arrive at the same conclusions. I dive down wormholes of my own, just like my boyfriend does. We just don&#39;t end up in the same place. My curiosity is piqued by different things. My findings tend to suggest poor priorities, petty corruption, and pitiful governance, but nothing like what my boyfriend finds. I believe the mainstream media is mostly a sad joke (I think most redditors do?), but that doesn&#39;t mean I assume <em>the opposite</em> whenever a news story comes out.</p>

<p>I revise my positions from time to time, but I&#39;d be surprised if Newtown was one of them! There&#39;s a .00001% chance of that happening, especially considering that I&#39;ve already watched a fair amount of material that my boyfriend showed me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI, I&#39;m a woman, but of course there&#39;s no way you&#39;d know that, and it&#39;s not even important, but you said wife- it&#39;s husband.</p>

<p>Anyway, you&#39;re clearly thoughtful and educated, which is helpful bc it will mean your willingness to question will increase as you age, where uneducated and closed-minded people tend to get increasingly more closed.</p>

<p>I guess it could be a matter of degree, as well.  I can&#39;t even be around my family members who still watch CNN like it&#39;s their bible, so I know I couldn&#39;t tolerate that in a partner, but perhaps I could deal with a person who has asked themselves the questions and arrived at different answers- my issue is I would keep asking those targeted questions, like-</p>

<p>&quot;If it&#39;s petty poor governance, why would they need a national system of propaganda?  How would that be coordinated?  Wouldn&#39;t Bumbling idiots devolve into petty skirmishes, essentially ruining it for everyone?  What about the witnesses and reports of the organizational meetings that took place in the 40s-60s?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I do with my own partner, as I&#39;ve found that questions really take longer, but they&#39;re so much more effective at helping someone else see what truths I believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I know everything, by any means, so perhaps you have a patient partner who&#39;s willing to compromise on these things in exchange for a partner who is great in lots of ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your problem, I presume, is you are a good person.  Such a good person that it is very difficult for you to see the bad in people.  Again this is all presumption.  Most people are decent, caring and good.  But most people don&#39;t run and control this world.  Those roles belong to a small few and they are not decent, caring or good.  These are the people that send soldiers to die for resources, collapse economies to make profits, manipulate and divide us with racism, class-ism etc and on and on.  </p>

<p>To get to your question, i&#39;d say to your boyfriend: try to see the good in people around you without discarding awareness of how the world really is.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d say to you:  Stay good, continue to care but open your mind to the reality that not everyone is like you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an okay person. I try my best to not suck, and I think the same is true of most people. It does seem that powerful positions seem to fall to people who don&#39;t value other people very much, and I wish that wasn&#39;t so. For me, an interesting question is: how do you impact people who don&#39;t treat others well? How do we change how people come into power? How do we change our systems so that we&#39;re actually empowered as citizens--is that possible, and on what scale? I don&#39;t believe there are unyielding, pure-evil overlords want to take everything from us and ruin the world. If anything, it&#39;s those kinds of people who started off with conspiracies of their own, decided the world was against them, and then said &quot;fuck them all.&quot;</p>

<p>Look at what happened after 9/11. USA and UK invaded Iraq and surrounding countries whom didn&#39;t have a Rothschild state bank. Now they all do. Afghanistan had dropped heroin production until USA invaded the middle east. Fact of the matter is, USA &#39;won&#39; after 9/11. They got money and oil. Lots of money and oil.</p>

<p>More foreigners died in 9/11 than Americans (I think. Could be wrong though.) </p>

<p>9/11 was done to invade foreign lands, take oil and drug production and rally the world against Muslims IMO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that way fairly often, having read this sub for years (yes, random lurkers, this a fresh account, no, it doesn&#39;t make me a shill.) Most of it, to me, looks like the workings of very orderly minds trying to make sense of chaotic human societies. The lack of real meaning or motive behind so many world events can be deeply disturbing, especially if your mind looks for logic in all things. In that sense, conspiracies are basically a religion. Coming in here and asking how to deal with someone&#39;s religion will inevitably lead to defensive answers, as you&#39;re already seeing. </p>

<p>Anyways, you can find a middle ground if your boyfriend is willing to compromise as well. My personal theory is that our system rewards low-empathy people, but I think they mostly work for their own gain and not toward some larger goal. Greed, as a collective force, has pushed us into sleepy consumerism to cope with the soul-crushing aspects of our lifestyles. Those low-empathy people have a significant incentive to keep the masses greedy and barely conscious, so they do, without remorse. Lots of conspiracy theories take this concept and run with it, like reptilians. </p>

<p>If both you and your boyfriend can admit that you don&#39;t have a monopoly on the truth, you should be OK. If he can&#39;t even consider that he might be wrong, note the red flag. A skeptical mind needs to stay open, or it&#39;s just more religious dogma piling up in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you&#39;ve said makes total sense to me. And it follows Occam&#39;s Razor--it&#39;s a much, much simpler explanation for the injustices we experience, and it&#39;s <em>just</em> as awful and hard to digest (emotionally speaking) as the more complex theories espoused by conspiracy theorists. I totally empathize with the idea that a few assholes have too much power and not enough concern for the rest of us, but after that... major divergence on the fact-finding front.</p>

<p>I feel the conversations about the system you describe get bogged down in a haze of conjecture, when maybe we&#39;d all be better off figuring out how to make this obviously unfair world better. I don&#39;t think the solution entails getting &quot;the truth&quot; out there---a lot of people recognize that the world is a fucked up place, whether they believe 9/11 was a hoax or not. That recognition is what bonds me to conspiracy theorists and makes it difficult for me <em>not</em> to talk with them, because I believe we are actually part of the same tribe, the &quot;fuck this shit, it could be better&quot; tribe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people are giving you the wrong &quot;conspiracies for beginners&quot; to start with.  So far they all require a little bit of a jump from the known facts into the conspiracy bit (and similarly, there&#39;s a jump from the facts to the &quot;everything is fine it means nothing&quot; bit.)  </p>

<p>Like a group of rich assholes meeting up with other rich assholes could just be rich assholes meeting each other to talk about things only they can talk about or to expand their network within the group.  Or, it could be a bunch of rich assholes meeting each other to secretly set up a one world government under their direction.  You see it as the former, your boyfriend see&#39;s the latter.  Either way, neither of you knows for sure because there&#39;s generally a missing piece of evidence at the jumping off point to definitively point either way.  </p>

<p>If you want to understand your boyfriend, I&#39;d look at the conspiracy theories that have proven themselves to be conspiracy facts.  There&#39;s the Tuskegee syphilis experiments, MKULTRA, Gulf of Tonkin, you&#39;d probably find dozens in a google search of &quot;conspiracies that turned out to be true&quot;.</p>

<p>You might not turn into a full on conpiracy theorist yourself, but you&#39;ll probably find common ground and some understanding on your boyfriend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ever find the time, read Naomi Klein&#39;s &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;. She doesn&#39;t say evil people conspired to commit 9/11, Hurricane Kathrina or the Tsunami. She says evil people have plans ready in case something like 9/11, Hurricane Kathrina or a Tsunami happens, because people will be so busy <em>surviving</em> that they simply don&#39;t notice policies being put in place that take away their liberties and property. Collective, national trauma is the best thing evil people could pray for. </p>

<p>From there, it is only baby steps to face the cruel reality that sometimes, evil people actually <em>plan</em> &quot;shock events&quot;.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t sound like you respect him in your attempt to psychopathologize him. </p>

<p>Talk to him, and try to <em>understand</em> him, truly, find out why it is that he studies these things, what his proposed solutions are, why he thinks it affects him and you. Use your passion to help him find a way to your optimism <em>despite</em> the harsh realities of a world ruled by powerful and ruthless elites. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to convince each other, you only have to understand each other&#39;s motivations. Unless he&#39;s a total nut, he does what he does out of a deep love and worry for all that is true and beautiful. Leave your and &quot;disbelief&quot; and &quot;disgust&quot; aside. They are bad motivators, of course you&#39;ll end up misunderstanding each other, attacking each other, getting defensive. Approach his arguments and the facts he presents with genuine curiosity, intellectual honesty, and sound reason. If he&#39;s wrong, I bet he&#39;ll admit it, sooner or later. </p>

<p>And yes, 9/11 <em>was</em> an inside job. Steel skyscrapers don&#39;t just disintegrate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually did read a part of that book several years ago. I remember being disgusted but also not surprised by the theory--it reminds me of the individuals who charge a crap-ton for essentials like water and TP in the wake of natural disasters.

<p>I appreciate your last few paragraphs. I don&#39;t think he is driven by mania--I think he is hurt by the way things are and seeks to understand.

<p>Anyway, you&#39;re clearly thoughtful and educated, which is helpful bc it will mean your willingness to question will increase as you age, where uneducated and closed-minded people tend to get increasingly more closed.</p>

<p>I guess it could be a matter of degree, as well.  I can&#39;t even be around my family members who still watch CNN like it&#39;s their bible, so I know I couldn&#39;t tolerate that in a partner, but perhaps I could deal with a person who has asked themselves the questions and arrived at different answers- my issue is I would keep asking those targeted questions, like-</p>

<p>&quot;If it&#39;s petty poor governance, why would they need a national system of propaganda?  How would that be coordinated?  Wouldn&#39;t Bumbling idiots devolve into petty skirmishes, essentially ruining it for everyone?  What about the witnesses and reports of the organizational meetings that took place in the 40s-60s?&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I do with my own partner, as I&#39;ve found that questions really take longer, but they&#39;re so much more effective at helping someone else see what truths I believe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I know everything, by any means, so perhaps you have a patient partner who&#39;s willing to compromise on these things in exchange for a partner who is great in lots of ways.</p>
