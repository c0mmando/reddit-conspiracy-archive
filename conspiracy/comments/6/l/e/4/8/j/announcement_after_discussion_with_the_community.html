        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello folks,</p>

<p>As a quick recap, over the past 12 hours CNN has come under intense scrutiny after <a href="http://archive.is/1YpMf">they sought out the doxx of the reddit user who posted the &quot;Trump tackles CNN&quot; gif from last week</a>. CNN then threatened to release the doxx of that user unless said user <a href="https://i.redd.it/t2py8h2yno7z.jpg">&quot;apologized for their prior speech and promised to change their opinions in the future&quot; Going on to suggest that, were the user to not change his views in the future, the doxx would be released.</a></p>

<p>Those actions, in and of themselves, represent a grievous threat to the free exchange of ideas and information on the modern internet. While we may certainly disagree with the view points of others, threatening to doxx someone unless they &quot;change their opinions&quot; is fundamentally abhorrent in an epoch rooted in free expression. </p>

<p>That said, this goes beyond even the revered maxim of respecting the free flow of information. As , in fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/882480814499536897">reporters such as Julian Assange have suggested that CNN not only broke federal law</a>, but perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/882430554544713728">violated New York state law as well</a>.</p>

<p>By way of explanation, 18 US. Code Section 241 says;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>18 U.S. Code § 241 - Conspiracy against rights</p>

<p><strong>If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person</strong> in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District <strong>in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same</strong>; or</p>

<p>If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured—</p>

<p><strong>They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both</strong>; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.
(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 696; Pub. L. 90–284, title I, § 103(a), Apr. 11, 1968, 82 Stat. 75; Pub. L. 100–690, title VII, § 7018(a), (b)(1), Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4396; Pub. L. 103–322, title VI, § 60006(a), title XXXII, §§ 320103(a), 320201(a), title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(L), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 1970, 2109, 2113, 2147; Pub. L. 104–294, title VI, §§ 604(b)(14)(A), 607(a), Oct. 11, 1996, 110 Stat. 3507, 3511.)</p>

<p><strong>In plain English; if you, as a private person, try to threaten someone (aka by saying you&#39;ll doxx them) in an attempt to undermine their speech rights (regardless of the moral content of that speech) then you have committed a serious crime.</strong></p>

<p>In light of CNN engaging in a direct attack against the free exchange of information, and their apparent wanton violation of 18. U.S. Code Section 241, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lb94b/cnn_outs_reddit_user_over_gif_sends_warning_shot/djswh46/">the mods of this subreddit reached out directly to the user-base to determine if banning direct links to the CNN domain was something which that user-base felt appropriate</a>. </p>

<p><strong>After reviewing user input during that discussion, and coming to consensus as a mod team, we have decided to ban all direct links to any cnn websites going forward. Instead, please use <a href="http://archive.is/">http://archive.is/</a> if you are inclined to share a piece of information from that outlet.</strong></p>

<p>In this way, the free flow of information will continue unabated but CNN will not be given ad revenue. </p>

<p>The current list of subreddits involved in the direct-link boycott are;</p>

<p><a href="/r/uncensorednews">/r/uncensorednews</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/WholesomeMemes">/r/WholesomeMemes</a> </p>

<p><a href="/r/WholesomeComics">/r/WholesomeComics</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/pussypassdenied">/r/pussypassdenied</a></p>

<p>We welcome other subreddits to join as well; if you do choose to join the boycott, send the modteam or myself a message and we will add the subreddit to this list. </p>

<p>As a small addendum; if you come across another news outlet engaging in similar behavior, please send any relevant info to the modmail of this subreddit. We will review the information and update the list of excluded &quot;threaten to doxx&quot; sites as such.</p>

<p>Thank you and regards,</p>

<p>The <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about privacy.  This is about coercion.</p>

<p>CNN&#39;s actions are CNN&#39;s fault.  I think when you have a global news platform like CNN going after individuals who have broken no laws, in order to shame them in public for having the wrong politics, then I have to wonder what kind of society we are becoming when people actually cheer lead for that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A person is guilty of coercion in the second degree</strong> when he or she compels or induces a person to engage in conduct which the latter has a legal right to abstain from engaging in, <strong>or to abstain from engaging in conduct in which he or she has a legal right to engage,</strong> or compels or induces a person to join a group, organization or criminal enterprise which such latter person has a right to abstain from joining, by means of instilling in him or her a fear that, if the demand is not complied with, the actor or another will:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1. Cause physical injury to a person;  or</p>

<p>2. Cause damage to property;  or</p>

<p>3. Engage in other conduct constituting a crime;  or</p>

<p>4. Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against him or her;  or</p>

<p>5. <strong>Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule;  or</strong></p>

<p>You hope.  I tend to disagree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has no legal expectation of privacy on a public forum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never suggested he did.  But he does have an expectation of not being compelled to disengage from legal activities under the threat of publishing to the entire world his assertions, whether they are facts or not, which would obviously subject him to that which is described in the statute.</p>

<p>Had CNN simply reported this information <em>without</em> threatening the individual, then maybe you&#39;d have a point; but once the threat of exposure was tied to a forced apology, with the added bonus of CNN boldly and publicly &quot;retaining the right&quot; to expose this guy further if ha makes any more &quot;bad&quot; posts, is about as clear cut a case of coercion as I think you are likely to see.  </p>

<p>CNN, damn you dun fucked up this time.</p>

<p>Probably not, but that doesn&#39;t excuse what CNN appears to have done.</p>

<p>For me it would be worth it for a slam dunk lasuit against CNN.  They don&#39;t want to have to go to court for this.  They are already reeling from a ton of other stupidity on their part, including hundreds of former employees part to a class action lawsuit alleging systemic racism, the fake news label cinching tighter around their necks...the last thing they would probably want is to go into court and have to explain their coercive crusade against an edgelord 15 yr old 4channer.  Remember, the SCOTUS just affirmed there is no &quot;hate speech&quot; exception to the 1st amendment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good work.</p>

<p>Why hasn&#39;t reddit banned all CNN contributors from posting here?  I had my account shut down by reddit admins for PMing someone and insinuation that there was PII in his account and suggesting he delete a post where he was bullying an underage user.  Reddit was right to admonish me even though I didn&#39;t directly threaten the guy the way CNN is doing.</p>

<p>Threatening DOXXING is not ok according to the site rules, and the admins have made that abundantly clear- it&#39;s for a very good reason.  This isn&#39;t a case of an individual person being a momentary asshole- this is a multibillion dollar media corporation targeting someone who isn&#39;t a public persona.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve reached out to the admins about the issue, and hope that they will join us in ensuring that CNN does not go unpuinished for threatening to doxx someone.</p>

<p>The admins, as you rightly point out, would chastise any user for such behavior. CNN should not be given a pass simply because they may have overlap with reddit in some financial areas.</p>

<p>IMO if they give CNN a pass they need to reinstate every sub they banned for doxxing.</p>

We all called it, we all saw it coming and its FUCKING GLORIOUS to watch you burn to the fucking ground.

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re referring to the O&#39;Keefe video from last week, I&#39;d refer you to O&#39;Keefe&#39;s previous videos, virtually all of which have been debunked or found to have been grossly edited.</p>

<p>In the case of the CNN guy, I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised to find out that there is a wide spectrum of opinions held by people at every network, regarding the level of complicity and Collusion by members of Trump&#39;s campaign with Russian state actors.  He&#39;s just one guy, speaking off-hand in a private conversation.  He&#39;s not an authority on the subject.  He&#39;s just dealing with the same information that most of the public has.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not taking it as Gospel truth that there&#39;s nothing to the Trump-Russia story just because one guy said he hadn&#39;t seen evidence.  I&#39;m not saying it definitely happened.  I&#39;d prefer that it <em>not</em> have happened.  But, I&#39;m finding myself growing more pessimistic about the situation by the day.</p>

<p>Also, I change my opinion on this pretty frequently.  Lacking hard evidence but seeing a pretty even smoke to fire ratio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you. The optics of this aren&#39;t the best, especially considering how this sub has become a haven of sorts for Trump fans to cry foul about his treatment from the MSM. Still, this is bigger than who is more corrupt: CNN or FOX. They&#39;re obviously both bought and paid for, it&#39;s just that one of them just tried to use their power to doxx a private individual.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway from this is whether the mods follow through with the below addendum should FOX, MSNBC, WSJ, HuffPo, etc. issue similar threats to doxx people over free speech:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a small addendum; if you come across another news outlet engaging in similar behavior, please send any relevant info to the modmail of this subreddit. We will review the information and update the list of excluded &quot;threaten to doxx&quot; sites as such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>man I am torn about this. Fuck CNN big time. But doing this does a few things that concerns me greatly. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Censorship should not be OK when it works in your favor. People can easily avoid reading or taking anything from CNN seriously. They can down vote posts to hell so that they will not show up. In other words, they can completely avoid CNN on their own, but still retain the ability to access it if they so choose. </p></li>
<li><p>This is helping Trump and his attack on the media which will lead to his control of the media. This would not be good. Thats like step 2 of Becoming a Dictator or something.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why not just call it out, expose it, make them accountable for what they publish, but ultimately leave the decision making process on the consumer to take in the info they want to. If we all know and believe CNN is complete and utter bullshit, we will laugh and make jokes when some genius decides to post a CNN article. But censoring it from being able to offer their &quot;opinion&quot; on the internet is one of the exact things most users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would not be OK with. </p>

<p>I do not trust anything CNN publishes, but stooping to their levels is not the direction this sub needs to go in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah the vote manipulation is definitely a problem. I think the use of Tags can quickly and easily bring to peoples attention where the info is coming from, and will help them to either skip clicking altogether, or down voting. Essentially automatically down voting something because of where it came from is in itself a form of vote manipulation, but general avoidance will start to make people less likely to post links from CNN since no one will be contributing to the discussion in the thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, tagging links to CNN would allow users to down vote or avoid the links altogether, effecting a proper boycott at the user level, not forced upon them by their environment/platform. I dont think a subreddit banning a website is going to take away a significant amount of their click traffic, but forcing users to become aware of why they are purposely avoiding something will probably end up having a bigger impact. Then they know about it, they talk about it with others, share information about why they are staying away, pointing out the issues and exposing what CNN does so that bigger groups of people realize there is a problem. </p>

<p>This is why I am torn though. I am not entirely against it, I just don&#39;t feel like forcing something on people jives with the foundation of this sub. </p>

<p>Censorship should not be OK when it works in your favor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody is censoring CNN. To quote the OP</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After reviewing user input during that discussion, and coming to consensus as a mod team, we have decided to ban all direct links to any cnn websites going forward. Instead, please use <a href="http://archive.is/">http://archive.is/</a> if you are inclined to share a piece of information from that outlet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is being done is the mods have decided not to provide any direct links to the CNN because those clicks give CNN money. Why support CNN when they behave like this? </p>

<p>The mods have specifically said CNN content is still allowed, it just has to be archived. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is helping Trump and his attack on the media</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mods should concern themselves with what&#39;s best for the subreddit and for truth. Whether that decision helps Trump or not should not be a concern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>is it though? How many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users are really hitting cnn.com on a regular basis? Enough to make even a slight dent in their ad revenue? Likely not. Therefore in my opinion, educating people on why they are staying away from something, rather than just forcibly keeping them away goes a lot further. They talk to their friends, their family, coworkers, etc. It will end up being more effective to have a concerted effort to expose this shit, rather than just blocking it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree that blocking direct links from a subreddit will be the only effective way to hold them accountable for what they do. In fact I do not believe it will be at all effective if you actually want to make a difference. </p>

<p>CNN did not make any deal with him. The controversial line was a shitty attempt at highlighting that no arrangement was made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t give me that two box bull shit argument everyone tries to use all the time and hope to sound independent in the debate. There was no assumption of your political side in my comment, seriously? Just a disappointment that you sounded okay with CNN&#39;s crucification, but not extending the same critique to others. 
The point I was hoping you would deduce was that if CNN is propaganda and it can be handled like this and Fox has been considered to be propaganda also, why not treat all main stream media outlets the same here for their obvious opinions and alternative info agenda. Makes more sense, make them all hurt.
That is a great conspiracy post, but it has a good amount of politics in it as well. It is hard to get away from politics and conspiracies. The sub&#39;s definition of Conspiracy brings us into this realm. Most of them, not all, are driven, silenced, exaggerated, began, or ended by some form of political ideology or agenda.</p>

<p>1. Cause physical injury to a person;  or</p>

<p>2. Cause damage to property;  or</p>

<p>3. Engage in other conduct constituting a crime;  or</p>

<p>4. Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against him or her;  or</p>

<p>5. Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule;  or</p>

<p>6. Cause a strike, boycott or other collective labor group action injurious to some person&#39;s business;  except that such a threat shall not be deemed coercive when the act or omission compelled is for the benefit of the group in whose interest the actor purports to act;  or</p>

<p>7. Testify or provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect to another&#39;s legal claim or defense;  or</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, Section 241 is read in conjunction with Section 242. You can&#39;t just pull the statute out of the ether without context, especially not one as old these two.  See e.g., US v. Price, 383 US 787 (1966). Despite its language, the statute is far more narrowly applied than you think.</p>

<p>Second, because of the conjunctive reading, the deprivation of rights has to occur under color of law. That hasn&#39;t happened in this case.  The statute was enacted to enforce civil war amendments. It basically exists to prevent the southern states from enacting laws that permit self-help by former slave owners, or otherwise permit them to screw with the former slaves&#39; rights.</p>

<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, what constitutional right has CNN violated, even if all of the this is true and I&#39;m wrong about the first two things? There is no constitutional right to free speech uninhibited by private parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about your perspective on reading them in conjunction; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the continued manifestation of hate crimes in America, 8
section 241 is becoming an increasingly valuable tool for federal
civil fights enforcement. Since many hate crimes involve interference,
or attempted interference, with the victim&#39;s exercise of his
federal fights, prosecutors can link the protected interest to a
section 241 conspiracy charge. Section 241 has been used to punish
those who would deprive others of the use of public accommodations9
or the enjoyment of their homes or property&#39; ° because of
their race. Such uses of section 241 are not without their consequences,
however. Because some prosecutors may be tempted to
view section 241 as a catchall hate crimes statute, the statute is
susceptible to abuse.</p>

<p>This Note argues that despite the breadth of the statute&#39;s
reach, section 241 has two elements that, when properly applied,
ensure that federal prosecutors will not misuse the statute. First,
because section 241 is an enforcement vehicle for federal statutory
and constitutional rights, prosecutors must define the predicate</p>

<p>right on which a section 241 charge is based.&quot; Second, prosecutors
must show that the defendant&#39;s state of mind satisfies the
statute&#39;s specific intent requirement, namely, that the defendant
has a purpose to deprive another of the enjoyment of his federal
right. 2 These two elements are linked; to prove specific intent,
one must first identify the right of which the defendant conspired
to deny his victim.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To prove a violation of section 241, the prosecution must
show: (1) that two or more people conspired to deprive someone
of a federally protected right; 9 (2) that they acted with specific intent to deprive the individual of this right;2
&quot; and (3) that the
federal right violated was clearly delineated.2&#39; This last requirement
ensures that the statute, which is broad in its reach, does not
violate minimum standards of due process.</p>

<p>To that end, I&#39;m not sure if the limits on the application are derived from a reading of Section 242 and 241 in conjunction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve not made any indication that I feel there is any &quot;offense in question.&quot; And the answer to this question is more speculative than the answer to your 241 issue because the reason this statute doesn&#39;t apply turns on a closer examination of the facts, few of which can be reliably determined in an internet slap-fight.</p>

<p>Blackmail is fraught with defenses and &quot;exceptions,&quot; because it&#39;s so closely related to a defendant&#39;s First Amendment rights (and Lord knows how the enhanced protections the press get are implicated here).  Consider the purpose of this statute: to prevent people from demanding money/things of value in exchange for keeping quiet about crimes.  Did the redditor commit any crimes? Did the CNN employees say they wouldn&#39;t inform law enforcement about the crimes? Did the CNN employees ask for a legitimate thing of value in exchange? All of those questions should be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>If I recall, the CNN story actually indicated that they did not believe the redditor had an intent to incite violence or whatever wording they used; how then did they make a claim that they would report him to law enforcement for committing a crime? And, moreover, their only indication was that they would report him (publicly, it seems), if he actually did commit a crime (i.e. inciting violence).  </p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen, their threat was this: If you commit a crime, we will report you or publicly expose you, if you do not, we will not.  For what I hope are obvious reasons, it&#39;s not illegal to threaten to publicly expose someone, or privately report someone, who commits a crime, regardless if they used a handle to do so.  Otherwise, I&#39;d be blackmailing you if I said &quot;I&#39;m going to find out who you are and publicly denounce you if you murder my cousin.&quot; It&#39;s just a nonsensical view of the law.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, there could of course be state-based civil slander/libel liability (also unlikely, if you&#39;ve ever read the accusations some media publications put out, although more likely here because the person in question is a non-celebrity) if they&#39;re wrong and do accuse him publicly of a crime.  Or, if CNN decided for some reason to sue the guy, there&#39;s penalties under anti-SLAPP provisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like CNN used Reddit to view a users post history. I&#39;m not 100% where it falls in Reddit&#39;s user agreement, having just skimmed it, but it seems that to &quot;participate&quot; in Reddit, you have to post or vote, and I don&#39;t think CNN did either of those things. IMO subreddits have the right to ban any links they want, but they can&#39;t &#39;ban&#39; a person for reading someone&#39;s public posting history and reacting outside of reddit. I tried to find rules surrounding what a user can do outside reddit using knowledge they gain about a person inside reddit, but there don&#39;t appear to be any.  </p>

<p>Regardless, my distaste is for a subreddit to ban a news source in the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> forum based on defending the privacy of a racist, scummy persons&#39; public posts. There is no guarantee of anonymity when using the internet, and you should be ready to own the things you say. I thought the video of Trump beating up &#39;cnn&#39; was funny and no reason to doxx a person, but I think in general, the media has a right to report on shitty things people say on the internet. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s my answer, if you actually wanted to know. If you just wanted to start some sort of doxx argument, we&#39;ll have to end the chat here (: </p>

<p>We must preserve that. If you dislike racism, like I do, then you must use your inalienable right of free speech to counter the racist ideologues that our world is currently dealing with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CNN is not publishing &quot;HanA**holeSolo&#39;s&quot; name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.

But then again, how many oligarchs wait in the wings to come prop up this treasonous propaganda network, and continue their hate programming indefinitely. To all my human beings out there (; )) <strong>these people are not journalists, they are presstitutes who should be ridiculed</strong> The MSM have programmed millions upon millions of people to believe fallacies that lead to constant distraction, diversion, and death. I humbly ask all of Reddit to rein in their blind hatred, whether it&#39;s hatred of Trump, Muslims, Christians, Liberals, Communists, Capitalists, TPTB, or whatever group you truly think is the antithesis of your being. Probably the only thing that I can agree with Hillary Clinton on is we are stronger together. Hatred and anger won&#39;t bring us together. Love, compassion and understanding will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN admitted no such thing. A producer that was butthurt that his reporting on completely non-political issues was whining about Russia. He isn&#39;t in a position to know whether the CEO directs the articles. And there is no collaborating evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>cuomo, tapper, Brazil, blitzer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those guys don&#39;t really make much news. They are talking heads. The journalists that matter are the one&#39;s doing the reporting, especially the investigative team. Those are the ones that are making the news here. They are the ones going after Russia.</p>

<p>What about Carl Bernstein and James Steele? Did you know they were a part of CNN before reading this post? Those are the guys leading the team. Berstein broke open Watergate. He&#39;s a seasoned professional. But you just dismiss him as &quot;part of CNN&quot;.</p>

<p>The truth is that their investigative team has broken news about the Trump administration and Russia that the administration initially denied, but later admitted. That&#39;s the kind of journalism the world needs. That&#39;s exactly the kind of journalism protected by the framers of the constitution. The press is protected precisely because they are a counterweight to the government. </p>

<p>And its not just CNN making the Russia connection. Its every other major media outlet in the US. They are all finding the same, consistent kinds of connections with this administration. The administration almost always immediately denies, but is exposed later. Its clearly not all made up. Its also overseas media, like <a href="http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2017/05/video-dutch-tv-documentary-claims-trump-has-ties-to-russia-mobsters/">the Netherlands</a> finding different aspects of the Trump Russia relationship. If its all coordinated, why does it seem like its coming from a hundred different directions at once? The simple answer is obvious: Because. Its. True. </p>

<p>You seem to think that you blogging, where you just look around the internet for pieces to put together and talk about it. Or opine on some actual journalist&#39;s reporting. Or opine on someone&#39;s opinion of some actual journalist&#39;s reporting. You don&#39;t have any original sources. You don&#39;t use other original sources to verify those sources. You don&#39;t have an editor that says to you, &quot;You can&#39;t publish that yet in our media because you don&#39;t have enough evidence. Keep digging.&quot; You don&#39;t have someone that you pay to be objective that comes in and criticizes you. In your world you can just sit down and write whatever you want and there is no one to tell you no and no repercussions. These organizations have all of that. You aren&#39;t remotely like a journalist. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882429541981052928">https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/882429541981052928</a></p>

<p>The caveat is it&#39;s delivered by CNN, which are the source in question. However, HanASolo deleted his reddit account so doesn&#39;t have any other option to really communicate his thoughts. A new account could easily be considered fake, and other ways would require opening further possibilities to be exposed, which is something he fears. Like the end of your comment says, it&#39;s impossible to prove or disprove that he was or wasn&#39;t forced to say anything under threat.</p>

<p>On a side related note, there are circulations that the reserve comment that brought the outrage was actually put in by editors to preserve legal rights.</p>

<p>On the flip side, any legal action is really dependent if CNN is lying or not. If what Han says that he was not threatened and agrees with CNN&#39;s statement, there really isn&#39;t any legal recourse. Cheers mate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy probably did not have hatred in his heart. More likely he is just a thoughtless, cruel asshole. He is not realizing the power of words, and how it can be crushing. This is called ignorance and cruelty, but not hatred. Now hatred does come into play with racism, but usually it is people trying to be edgy, or are just laughing at the expense of other people&#39;s feelings, hopes, dreams, and desires. See, when you use a word like hate to describe everything that is really mean, the word loses it&#39;s meaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one said Hillary runs an international pedo ring. It&#39;s been common knowledge for a long time that the globalist elite cabal has practiced pedophilia. The Clinton foundation is a large player in the globalist elite and have a long history of corruption and nefarious practices. That&#39;s been known for a long time too. Now, we are getting a glimpse into how deeply interwoven and blatant the elite sanctioned pedophilia is. From comet ping pong to elsagate on YouTube.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much evidence, and more continues to come out. You&#39;re not fooling anyone. The FBI wasn&#39;t even allowed access to the &#39;hacked&#39; dnc servers. There is absolutely no direct evidence connecting Donald Trump to any nefarious ties to Russia or any other country. He wasn&#39;t even under investigation at all, according to James comey himself. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not fooling anyone, hombre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an obvious difference, the BBC was created to act as a news source and has no problem criticising its own government. RT was created to promote Russian foreign policy and spread Russian propaganda to non Russian nations. They don&#39;t criticize Putin because he is basically there boss and they want to make other leaders look bad while making Putin look like a good guy.  While the BBC may not be impartial and do favor the establishment in the UK they are not anywhere close to as bad as RT, all I know about npr is it is notorious for being boring.</p>

<p>For one.  I know you don&#39;t think that&#39;s anti-semetic.  But making a post about how many jews work for CNN is anti-semetic, because the only reason to make this post is to complain about the fact.  And the only reason you&#39;d complain about all the jews working at CNN is if you think that many jews working at CNN is bad, because jews are, for some reason, bad.  This is anti-semetic.</p>

<p>There&#39;s actually 3 posts on the first 5 pages with that graphic, for some reason.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lcfdh/has_israel_effectively_colonized_the_united_states/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6lcfdh/has_israel_effectively_colonized_the_united_states/</a></p>

<p>(but russia interfering is okay, I guess)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bad day to find posts, because the shit about cnn is flodding the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so. Reddit has very strict rules against doxing and CNN unquestionably doxed this user, using reddit to do it.</p>

<p>Now, there isn&#39;t a single CNN account to terminate for this behavior. However, reddit could extend their no doxing policy to include organizations. Repeat offenders could be blacklisted from the site.</p>

<p>True, it may not happen in this case because the user in question wrote some really vile stuff but I think reddit&#39;s leadership is probably at least asking the question internally of &quot;how do we deal with this is the doxing was based purely on a political viewpoint without all the vile toxic racism&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit has strict rules against redditors doxxing. That has nothing to do with this. CNN didn&#39;t doxx the guy either. </p>

<p>Reddit is a public platform. The idea that you can say what you want without media reporting is bizarre. This was a national story due to the president tweeting it. As such every journalist had a right to look into the source of it. No redditor has no right for them to maintain their anonymity. </p>

<p>But this and other subs, like the Donald, decided it was blackmail or something, despite no lawyer backing this viewpoint and a message from the person you are supposedly sticking up for saying he wasn&#39;t blackmailed and was grateful to CNN.</p>

<p>This whole thing is just partisan bullshit. This sub is now a conservative mouthpiece and has no respect any more.</p>

<p>I would like to remind you that your buddy Donald Trump and his Establishment Republican friends ARE NOT AND WILL NOT EXPOSE 9-11. The Republican Party orchestrated it. And now, r/conspiracy becomes complicit in covering up 8-11. Well done. You&#39;ve been psyoped.</p>

<p>At least be the slightest bit rational, moderators. You cannot seriously say that this is not about censorship. If you users from posting <em>the site</em> here, you ARE BOYCOTTING THE SITE. If your boycott is successful, the site will not be able to put out information in the future. THAT IS CENSORSHIP. </p>

<p>But yiou can have the information and gawk and laugh at CNN while denying it business doesn&#39;t change that one bit -- expect to show that you have malicious intent.</p>

Then redditors click on the link, bringing them to the CNN site and CNN gets credit for a visit to the site, which they show their advertisers, the advertisers see that there&#39;s a lot of visits and give them more money for the ad space as it gets seen lots and is more valuable.</p>

<p>Now, when a redditor sees something on CNN that they want to post on Reddit, they have to post the archive link, not the website link. the information gets out just like it normally would, but none of those people who clicked on the link to get the info actually visit CNNs site. Thus no extra visitors, no extra ad revenue, but still putting in all the work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not like it will bankrupt them... but it won&#39;t help them at all either.</p>

<p>Also, while it is true that most publicity is good publicity, I&#39;m not sure that &quot;CNN will threaten your rights and safety, and that of your family if you use your free speech when they don&#39;t want you to&quot; publicity is pretty bad.</p>

<p>Wut?  The guy deleted and apologized before he was ever contacted by CNN.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the response from Trumpland:</p>

<p>Others called for a very personal form of revenge against CNN, and Kaczynski specifically. A link to a pastebin page that appeared to contain the personal identifying information of Kaczynski, some of his family members and his colleagues circulated on 4chan Wednesday morning. And the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website called for even more. A popular post called for CNN employees to quit their jobs and denounce the network, or face consequences if they didn’t:</p>

<pre><code>“We are going to track down your parents.
We are going to track down your siblings.
We are going to track down your spouses.
We are going to track down your children. Because hey, that’s what you guys get to do, right? We’re going to see how you like it when our reporters are hunting down your children.”

<p>This is a lie. They do not ban any media for being left or right. They ban it for a history of being systemically dishonest. Never mind this sub is supposed to be <strong>a forum for free thinking and discussing issues</strong>. </p>

<p>It turns out this story the mods used to justify their ban is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/07/05/the-reddit-user-behind-trumps-cnn-meme-apologized-but-cnnblackmail-is-the-story-taking-hold/">actual fake news.</a> But the mods being clearly being Trump supporters fell for it because of their confirmation bias. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see CNN as a journalistic outfit by any stretch, they are news reporting and entertainment - but some of this push back needs to be against singular actions and carefully done.

<p>A single user however posting a list which was taken down shouldn&#39;t get an entire community banned, what if I doxxed someone on behalf of this sub, do you share the blame?</p>

<p>Huge difference between a powerful media organisations whose higher ups pushed this and a single user from a half million strong community. The organisation as a whole can be held accountable because its leadership condoned and encouraged this behaviour, the_donald does not tolerate doxxing and has banned many of its own members for doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if they were only looking for people that physically assaulted trump supporters, it would still be unethical in my opinion and result in the wrong people being tracked down. I recall a bunch of threads on 4chan after the Richard Spencer punching incident where people thought he was some scat fetishist, and they proceeded to send a bunch of messages to his coworkers and family members. Turns out he&#39;s been dead for a few years... I just don&#39;t see how this type of doxxing is more ethical than CNN&#39;s, even with T_D&#39;s pure and noble intentions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was that innocent people can end up having their lives significantly impacted when internet vigilantes identify the wrong person. </p>

<p>A key example of this was when redditors incorrectly identified the Boston Bomber and really screwed up some guy&#39;s life just because he was wearing a backpack in Boston. </p>

<p>As you said, internet vigilantes don&#39;t have the resources of major organizations, but that often makes them more dangerous. They don&#39;t have the resources to do thorough research. Additionally, they have the veil of anonymity, so they don&#39;t even have to be liable for what they say.  </p>

<p>It would be great if they did track down those who committed violent crimes, but more likely they&#39;ll just end up falsely accusing someone based on shakey evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Among the many issues with the legal interpretation, there&#39;s one that should be obvious: interpreting the statute in the manner suggested likely makes the statute unconstitutional as applied: What&#39;s Congress&#39;s basis for enacting the statute? It can&#39;t be the commerce clause because there&#39;s no interstate predicate in the relevant subsection.  The only other provisions (I doubt the Piracy Clause, or whatever its called, applies) that allow Congress to regulate the conduct of private citizens come from the Civil War Amendments, which do not cover CNN&#39;s (alleged) conduct here.  Unsurprisingly then, this statute is only applied in the context of enforcing the Civil War Amendments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on board with this. Using archived links is my preference anyway, and in this way, you are not outright discriminating against CNN, just giving them the hi-ho finger for their shady bs, i.e. blackmail, stalking, their stance on pro-censorship when it benefits them/anti-censorship when they want to squawk, and their increasingly twisted reporting. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to give them the broadest benefit of the doubt, parsing through their eye-rolling reporting to glean what valid information I can, but this deal drew the line for me. Until I hear that they&#39;ve admitted their GIANT mistake in doxxing and intimidating an anonymous user and renounce their tactics, I just cannot even look at their logo anymore without disgust.</p>

<p>Everyone in the world should just ponder:</p>

<p>&quot;How would I feel if this were me, and they found my deepest darkest secrets (oh, shush, we all have one or two) and threatened to expose them to the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Our ability to vent, discuss and create those things which we may not feel as free to air publicly is an important part of the expression of free speech in our current culture. Anyone who threatens to take that away from us should themselves be publicly skewered. And that&#39;s a metaphor, you freaks ; )</p>

<p>So many myths going around. Reddit&#39;s hivemind was completely wrong.</p>

<p>Reddit user was middle-aged, not 15 as the hivemind is claiming.</p>

<p>There was no blackmail. That man deleted his account before even talking to CNN.</p>

<p>CNN did not make any deal with him. The controversial line was a shitty attempt at highlighting that no arrangement was made.</p>

<p>The meme-maker himself called CNN after Reddit got triggered, confirmed he wasn&#39;t threatened/blackmailed.</p>

<p>The owner of the US&#39; Fox News is billionaire Rupert Murdoch, who has a much larger empire in the UK, including Sky TV (UK&#39;s largest) and all of his News Corp tabloids, which did all of the same fearmongering tactics with Brexit for their wealthy/conservative political party: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/mail-sun-uk-brexit-newspapers">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/mail-sun-uk-brexit-newspapers</a></p>

<p>The effect of just Fox News (on US biases and anti-science to stoke voter turnout around &quot;God, guns, gays,&quot; and racism to get enough votes for reduced capital gains taxes, corporate tax deductions, reduced industry regulations, and other things Republican donors want):</p>

<p>Tests of knowledge of Fox viewers</p>

<p>A 2010 Stanford University survey found &quot;more exposure to Fox News was associated with more rejection of many mainstream scientists&#39; claims about global warming, [and] with less trust in scientists&quot;.[75]</p>

<p>A 2011 Kaiser Family Foundation survey on U.S. misperceptions about health care reform found that Fox News viewers had a poorer understanding of the new laws and were more likely to believe in falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act such as cuts to Medicare benefits and the death panel myth.[76] A 2010 Ohio State University study of public misperceptions about the so-called &quot;Ground Zero Mosque&quot;, officially named Park51, found that viewers who relied on Fox News were 66% more likely to believe incorrect rumors than those with a &quot;low reliance&quot; on Fox News.[77]</p>

<p>In 2011, a study by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that New Jersey Fox News viewers were less well informed than people who did not watch any news at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Tests_of_knowledge_of_Fox_viewers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Tests_of_knowledge_of_Fox_viewers</a></p>

<p>&quot;Fox News viewers scored the lowest of over 30 popular news sources... Those who listed Fox News as one of their news sources had overall lower levels of knowledge on the factual questions. They couldn&#39;t find South Carolina on map or name the second digit of pi.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/07/21/a-rigorous-scientific-look-into-the-fox-news-effect/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/07/21/a-rigorous-scientific-look-into-the-fox-news-effect/</a></p>

<p>In 2009, an NBC survey found “rampant misinformation” about the healthcare reform bill before Congress — derided on the right as “Obamacare.” It also found that Fox News viewers were much more likely to believe this misinformation than average members of the general public.</p>

<p>Fox News&#39; cofounder worked on the (infamously racist) Republican &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; to get the South vote for Nixon. They were pretty open about their racist tactics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy</a></p>

<p>You start out in 1954 by saying, &quot;N----r, n----r, n----r.&quot; By 1968 you can&#39;t say &quot;n----r&quot; — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states&#39; rights and all that stuff. You&#39;re getting so abstract now [that] you&#39;re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you&#39;re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I&#39;m not saying that. But I&#39;m saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, &quot;We want to cut this,&quot; is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than &quot;n----r, n----r.&quot;</p>

<p>A memo entitled “A Plan for Putting the GOP on TV News,” buried in the the Nixon library details a plan between Ailes and the White House to bring pro-administration stories to television networks around the country. “People are lazy. With television you just sit—watch—listen. The thinking is done for you.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/richard-nixon-and-roger-ailes-1970s-plan-to-put-the-gop-on-tv/2011/07/01/AG1W7XtH_blog.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/richard-nixon-and-roger-ailes-1970s-plan-to-put-the-gop-on-tv/2011/07/01/AG1W7XtH_blog.html</a></p>

<p>Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan’s budding Alzheimer’s in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993. &quot;He was the premier guy in the business,&quot; says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. &quot;He was our Michelangelo.&quot;</p>

<p>Ailes has used Fox News to pioneer a new form of political campaign – one that enables the GOP to bypass skeptical reporters and wage an around-the-clock, partisan assault on public opinion... created to mimic the look and feel of a news operation, cleverly camouflaging political propaganda as independent journalism.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. In 1984, after the 73-year-old Reagan stumbled badly in his first debate with Walter Mondale, the campaign tapped Ailes to prep the president for the next showdown. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer’s, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.</p>

<p>Worse still, Bush had baggage: He was neck-deep in the Iran-Contra scandal that had secretly sent arms to Tehran and used the profits to fund an illegal war in Nicaragua. Ailes saw an opportunity to address both shortcomings in a single, familiar strategy – attack the media.</p>

<p>In 1974, his notoriety from the Nixon campaign won him a job at Television News Incorporated, a new right-wing TV network that had launched under a deliberately misleading motto that Ailes would one day adopt as his own: &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; The project of archconservative brewing magnate Joseph Coors, the news service was designed to inject a far-right slant into local news broadcasts by providing news clips that stations could use without credit – and for a fraction of the true costs of production. Once the affiliates got hooked on the discounted clips, its president explained, TVN would &quot;gradually, subtly, slowly&quot; inject &quot;our philosophy in the news.” The network was, in the words of a news director who quit in protest, a &quot;propaganda machine.&quot;</p>

<p>For Ailes, it was a way to extend the kind of fake news that he was regularly using as a political strategist. &quot;I know certain techniques, such as a press release that looks like a newscast,&quot; he told The Washington Post in 1972. &quot;So you use it because you want your man to win.&quot;</p>

<p>But in 1993 – the year after he claimed he had retired from corporate consulting – Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.</p>

<p>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting “real people affected by taxes.”</p>

<p>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the “Coalition for Fair Funding of Health Care” to deploy the same kind of “independent” ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress – cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill – and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. “RJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,” a March 1993 memo revealed. “A packet has gone to Limbaugh. We need to brief Ailes.&quot;</p>

<p>Daily memos</p>

<p>Photocopied memos from John Moody instructed the network&#39;s on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing pro-life viewpoints, the Iraq War, and tax cuts, as well as requesting that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area.[84] Such memos were reproduced for the film Outfoxed, which included Moody quotes such as, &quot;The soldiers [seen on Fox in Iraq] in the foreground should be identified as &#39;sharpshooters,&#39; not &#39;snipers,&#39; which carries a negative connotation.&quot;</p>

<p>This is you. I don&#39;t know you obviously or care about any details, but hypothetically if I had 5 minutes and wanted to find out enough &quot;personal&quot; information to scare someone by posting it to a large forum, I could. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty fucking easy, and also pretty fucking scary. </p>

<p>CNN did something unethical by giving the appearance of leveraging this guy, but if you post racist shit online and also personal details, literally anyone could find this information and report it to an employer and seriously fuck up someone life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that information is somewhat accurate, which is pretty spooky. </p>

<p>What CNN did was obviously fucked up, and I hope they pay for going so low.</p>

<p>I mean, it was a fucking meme. That isn&#39;t a threat towards journalist or anything, which I know you never stated yourself but watching the news about it, someone from CNN literally said this is an incitment towards violence, which is preposterous. </p>

<p>I think that if you say racist shit, yes, you should be held accountable for it. Like you would if you said it out in the open, but posting a meme, I see that as harmless. </p>

<p>Unless you agree to have your personal information displayed or discussed in or on the news, then no, his identify should have been kept under wraps. </p>

<p>If he wanted people to know his full name his username would have been his full name, or he would have  indicated personally he had made the meme in the first place. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s silly that there&#39;s a witch-hunt going on for a kid who made a silly meme on the Internet. Like, aren&#39;t there bigger issues going on? I&#39;m aware he made a lot of racist posts on reddit and probably elsewhere too, which is lame and inexcusable, but he&#39;s being targeted for making a meme that offended people. Very silly stuff going on these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao yeah. The dude was posting some serious racist shit. It&#39;s not like it was just the gif. They didn&#39;t say that because of the gif. They said that because of his account full of hateful rhetoric. And he was the one who asked to not have his name published. They could have done it anyway and didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Most national news in this country is shit. But this is hilarious and eye roll inducing. </p>

<p>CNN finds creator of gif as it was national attention for days. CNN finds the creator posted loads of racist and hateful remarks. CNN contacts guy as part of doing the story. Guy asks to not have his name published and immediately deletes all of his stuff. CNN agrees to not out the guy if he stops posting hateful words. </p>

<p>The last part can be questionable, but overall they did the guy a solid and kept him anonymous. Can we really sit here and say all news stations would have done the same when seeing the person posting against them had a history of super hateful remarks? Most would have jumped on it to rip that person apart. Conspiracy is basically right wing coddling now. </p>

<p>Well, according to CNN, they tried to contact him Monday. He purged his history on Monday, and apologized. CNN gets a call from him on Tuesday.</p>

<p>On top of this why would CNN post a public blackmail threat against someone they privately talked with? If CNN wanted to blackmail him, or wanted to threaten to blackmail him, all they had to do was mention it in the phone call.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you think large corporate entities should out people to public shame, then that is fine. I personally think the guy should not be afraid, and should be honest about what he did. Most people who are racist are obviously upset about something in society. Maybe instead of shaming and mocking those you disagree with, and showing hate for ignorance, maybe you should love instead. Love your enemies. You will find that most of them are not as much racist as they are angry and full of bitterness about their plight. </p>

<p>Have you ever tried to talk to folks who are racist? Have you ever thought about racist stuff you have done? I know I have been racist before, and most people if they are honest will admit this. </p>

<p>Shaming people will not solve the problem, it will just make the bitterness and jadedness sink away so that people cannot see it. You will further the so-called &quot;systemic racism&quot; that continues to hound us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racist bigots have a right to that anonymity. That is an American right. If you cannot give the same rights to your enemies as your allies, then you do not have the character to truly love liberty. &quot;CNN doesn&#39;t owe racist bigots anonymity.&quot; What does this even mean? CNN got upset that somebody made a cruddy meme against them, and then used his racist comments against him so that posters like you could turn this topic into a topic on racism. You do know that places like /pol are infiltrated by folks who spur on racist groups in order to delegitimize them, right? You do know that racism is being used to stop the spread of antiglobalist movements? </p>

<p>CNN DOES owe ANYBODY anonymity if they ask for it. Stop redefining the rights based on what you do and do not like. Grow up.</p>

<p>your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/5uw17g/trump_supporters_are_running_out_of_ways_to/ddy9rno/">post history</a> shows you are a fan of Trump and speak highly of him and an Obama hater.</p>

<p>the mods of r/conspiracy got egg on their face now that HanAssholeSolo was exposed as someone who wished for people to be doxxed prior to the current CNN drama and are now writing shit posts pointing at others to try to justify their censoring of free speech. </p>

<p>I am a Sanders supporter. Always have been.</p>

<p>What people are doing to Trump is bullshit but that doesn&#39;t stop me from thinking he is a fucking ass hat... and he is.</p>

<p>Obama on the other hand... should be drawn and quartered.</p>

<p>Also... are you really that dumb? A boycott, which this is, is NOT a ban and is not censorship. You know this but you continue to play dumb as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many myths going around. Reddit&#39;s hivemind was completely wrong.</p>

<pre><code>Reddit user was middle-aged, not 15 as the hivemind is claiming.

There was no blackmail. That man deleted his account before even talking to CNN.

CNN did not make any deal with him. The controversial line was a shitty attempt at highlighting that no arrangement was made. [1]

The meme-maker himself called CNN after Reddit got triggered, confirmed he wasn&#39;t threatened/blackmailed.
</code></pre>

<p>Check out CNN reporter&#39;s side: <a href="https://twitter.com/KFILE">https://twitter.com/KFILE</a></p>

<p>Sources: [1] [2] [3]</p>

<pre><code>FYI &quot;HanAssholeSolo&quot; just called me.&quot;I am in total agreement with your statement. I was not threatened in anyway.&quot; [1]

Again. HanAssholeSolo is not 15 or anywhere close to it. This is POTUS&#39; son spreading misinformation.[1]

Need to point out again HanAssholeSolo is a middle aged man. People claiming he&#39;s 15 are wrong. Some are intentionally spreading this. [1]

This line is being misinterpreted. It was intended only to mean we made no agreement w/the man about his identity. [1]

CNN, a megacorporation that should be expected to act in a certain upstanding manner, just undeniably threatened an individual for his/her expression of non-threatening free speech. As others have pointed out, the doxx threat is also illegal in its own right, but ignoring that, CNN just committed a highly unethical act. </p>

<p>You&#39;d think a corporation that only exists thanks to the 1st amendment would respect it a little more.</p>

<p>The same can be said for censoring the media. If anyone understands that it should be BCND. It&#39;s censorship that makes people think cops do no wrong (for example, r/videos allowing videos of cops doing good, but not cops doing bad (rule 4). Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right, and you&#39;d be playing right into the alt-right agenda if you try to censor CNN.</p>

<p>Boycotts are great, boycott CNN. It crosses the line when it&#39;s a full ban though. That&#39;s not a boycott, that&#39;s censorship.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t go to Chic-fil-a because they gave money to outlaw gay marriage in California - that&#39;s a boycott. If we outlaw Chic-fil-a so people who don&#39;t think the same way I do can&#39;t go, that wouldn&#39;t be a boycott.</p>

<p>Homosexuality is not a protected class, actually. They willingly changed their donation practices as soon as it became publicly known that they were donating to groups that supported these causes. Their funding does not go to anti-LGBT groups. You are free to continue the boycott, but the vast majority of use stopped when they changed their donation policies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They would never say this. They&#39;re very much inclined to keep their family oriented label as it&#39;s better for their bottom line. In any case, the sheer amount of money they give to charity (now that it isn&#39;t targeting the rights of LGBT individuals) is enough for me to say they&#39;re a much bigger benefit to our communities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not explicitly include sexual orientation or gender identity in its list of protected bases, the Commission, consistent with Supreme Court case law holding that employment actions motivated by gender stereotyping are unlawful sex discrimination and other court decisions, interprets the statute&#39;s sex discrimination provision as prohibiting discrimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>

<p>Over the past several years the Commission has set forth its position in several published decisions involving federal employment.  These decisions explain the legal basis for concluding that LGBT-related discrimination constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII, and give examples of what would be considered unlawful. In so ruling, the Commission has not recognized any new protected characteristics under Title VII.  Rather, it has applied existing Title VII precedents to sex discrimination claims raised by LGBT individuals.  The Commission has reiterated these positions through recent amicus curiae briefs and litigation against private companies.</p>

<p>I realize that most of MSM is riddled with problem/propaganda/clickbait but if you ban them all you ban access to direct information.

<p>If you ban all of them you end up with these &quot;alternative&quot; sources that are really just regurgitating the same info with their own spin/interpretation and we&#39;ll end up right back where we are now.</p>

The restaurant owners instagram that featured at least 12 different young children, sometimes in strange poses. The clintons ties to Epstein (A CONVICTED CHILD RAPIST).

All the suspicious videos filmed at comet pizza, including one that specifically mentions &quot;little boys&quot;. The list goes on.. you obviously don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>Lol, go look around the Wikileaks twitter account and tell me it&#39;s non-partisan. Besides, this isn&#39;t about bias, it&#39;s about revealing personal information. Accusing CNN of blackmail for threatening to reveal a <em>name</em> while simultaneously turning a blind eye to Wikileaks recklessly revealing information that is <em>actually private</em> like social security numbers and credit card information is absurdly hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, there was a gif/meme that a <a href="/r/the_donald">/r/the_donald</a> user created and was posted by Trump on his Twitter. The gif was an edited WWE clip with &quot;CNN&quot; being body slammed. This was considered poor taste considered an actual reporter was recently body slammed and assaulted. Then, people found that the Reddit user who created the gif had posted all kinds of things (anti-Semitic, racist, something about torturing his cat, threatening to stab Muslims) and then the man who owned the account (some people tried to spin it as him being 15, but this was disproven) confessed in a call to CNN stating his identity, and CNN has said that if he resumes his behavior, they&#39;ll release his information. He has deleted his Reddit account.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an official who examines books, plays, news reports, motion pictures, radio and television programs, letters, cablegrams, etc., <strong>for the purpose of suppressing parts deemed objectionable on moral, political,</strong> military, or other grounds.*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then to further show how hypocritical this argument is, let&#39;s use the second definition for your justification:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>provide them with revenue are being banned. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the second definition of censor is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>any person who supervises the manners or morality of others. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Literally censorship by both top definitions and by your own argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you mean is being censored. If you  post a CNN article behind an archived mirror, then that is allowed, by design. </p>

<p>The direct intention of the ban is to deny CNN ad revenue. The information and articles put out by CNN are not censored, but direct links to the website are banned. You can still post/link CNN content as long as it is not on the CNN website itself. Normally this would be outright censorship of almost anything CNN, if not for archiving sites, which allow you to store a publicly accessible archived copy of a webpage. Sites like Archive.is allow you to archive any webpage at any time with the exception of a NSFW/illegal site blacklist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes.  and then you must also post on reddit.  And someone who is new or doesnt see this post has to try to post on reddit, discover they CANT post on reddit, archive, and then post on reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s it, bye r/conspiracy.  CNN had every right to find and publish this guy&#39;s name when his post was controversially re-tweeted by the President of the United States.  HanAssholeSolo became a public figure due to his words on a public forum - he&#39;s fair game.  CNN is actually honoring his wishes for anonymity, which they really have no obligation to do - he is a legitimate news story right now.  He&#39;s not a rape victim - he&#39;s a guy who made public posts and was apparently overjoyed with the attention he initially received.  He has no reasonable expectation for anonymity, but CNN extended it anyway.</p>

<p>There is no difference between the Internet and &quot;real life&quot; - it&#39;s <em>all</em> real life, and public posts are just that - public.  When your posts make the news, <em>you</em> make the news as a result of being the author of news-making posts.  It&#39;s an important lesson for many to learn, apparently - when you adopt an &quot;alternative persona&quot; online, it&#39;s still <em>your</em> alternative persona.  If that persona somehow gets into the news, you may be asked some difficult questions, and &quot;it&#39;s just an alt account - I don&#39;t really believe any of it!&quot; may not be seen as a particularly valid explanation.  The Internet is not a &quot;safe space&quot; - that works both ways.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;ll find my UFO, Illuminati, Rothschild, JFK, 9/11, and other <em>conspiracy</em>-related info elsewhere.  This sub is a political no-man&#39;s-land right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you&#39;re taking my statement of fact out of context then.  Parts of the dossier HAVE been corroborated.  Beyond that, the intelligence community has voiced mixed opinions (see below), but to say that the dossier was demonstrably false (which is what u/Bacon-Is-Yummy was arguing), is in itself demonstrably false.</p>

<p>&quot;Observers and experts have had varying reactions to the dossier. Generally, &quot;former intelligence officers and other national-security experts&quot; urged &quot;skepticism and caution&quot; but still took &quot;the fact that the nation&#39;s top intelligence officials chose to present a summary version of the dossier to both President Obama and President-elect Trump&quot; as an indication &quot;that they may have had a relatively high degree of confidence that at least some of the claims therein were credible, or at least worth investigating further.&quot;[42]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be fine, if there was any consistency. But this sub is going to disallow traffic to a &quot;MSM&quot; site, while continuing to allow traffic to many, many other sites, some of which are far less reputable than CNN.

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit user created (or shared) meme video/gif of Donald Trump beating up a wrestler on WWE with the CNN logo on his head. 
Tweeted said video to President Trump.  User also had questionable post history of racism on Reddit (possibly as a troll).  CNN finds his real name and information and coerces a confession/apology from him, allegedly under duress.  CNN then posts article on their site with &quot;story&quot; and apology from user and adds that they reserve the right to release his private information if he takes back his apology or isn&#39;t a good boy and doesn&#39;t behave.  I think that&#39;s about the gist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok ya you are right. Cnn being pricks. I will say this however... We all have the right to say stupid shit. But we have to stand behind our stupid shit. Or apologize and learn. Saying stupid racial or bigoted, or anything else bad or even good, behind a username on a website doesn&#39;t mean there are zero consequences. Hence this case in point. I think to myself if my family or employers read what i posted on reddit, what would be the consequence? Would i lose trust from people? Lose my job? Likely not. Cuz nothing on the Internet is anonymous really. Its like text messages and emails. That hansolo user from what i can tell was swinging balls of steel when Trump clapped his meme.gif. But then went full uh-ohh when other things he posted were held to the light. Mind you i don&#39;t know what those posts or words were. But it doesn&#39;t matter. Mean what you say and say what you mean, but deal with the consequences. He shouldn&#39;t have apologized for anything and told CNN to straight kick rocks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so i found some other posts that hanaholesolo guy made. Obviously hes embarassed by them and especially the thought of being identified. He&#39;s choosing not to stand by what he wrote. He&#39;s likely only apologizing because of the consequences. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s actually sorry or had changed his world view. He just doesn&#39;t want certain people learning he has those opinions. Possibly his family or employers. Its not right by cnn to threaten guy. Its also not right to want 500,000 people or any religion to get wiped of the earth. This goes to the whole mindset that one can just say whatever on a dumb website with zero consequences. Looks like cnn was pressuring this guy, thus making a Trump supporter look like a chump. Junior high school crap.</p>

<p>Freedom is not preserved through the use of the tactics of its&#39; enemies.  No exception can ever be made for censorship.  What people do not understand, is that the existence of a single exception conditions the mind to allow for more of them.  In the end, the number of exceptions granted to a law, outnumber the times when it is followed.  This was Hitler&#39;s strategy.</p>

<p>4chan doxxed the u/hanassholesolo, all cnn did was contact him and tell him they were going to publish his name if he didnt apologize.</p>

<p>trump, the president of the united states has threatened countless people including the free press...yet i dont see calls to ban trumps twitter or official communication...</p>

<p>in order to charge someone with a crime, you have to find out if a crime has even been committed, who committed the crime?  where the crime was committed and who has jurisdiction...</p>

<p>you cant just cherry pick state law till you find something that works to your end.  you need to first understand the relevant information. </p>

<p>if the crime is committed in new york, you cant prosecute them in georgia.</p>

<p>fox is stall allowed here right, because fox doxxed a sex assault victim. not just their name, but phone number and address.</p>

<p>there is now definitive proof this sub has been compromised by trump supporters.  their is absolutely no pretense of impartiality.</p>

<p>thank you mods for making it crystal clear how unethical and partisan this sub has become.  hopefully one day this sub can go back to being focused on conspiracy instead of fellating donald trumps withered dick.</p>

<p>your argument is weak,  4chan was the first to dox the reddit user, u/hanassholesolo contacted CNN to apologize, and then CNN made a statement that they would not publish his name if he did post further racist, bigoted remarks. </p>

<p>u/hanassholesolo does not refute that, and did not consider what CNN wrote as a threat.</p>

<p>4chan also doxxed the professor accused of the bike lock incident, Fox news published his name and likeness before he was charged.  its still not even clear that he is in fact the suspect.  yet again, fox is still allowed on r/conspiracy?  interesting.</p>

<p>and before you go on to say that u/hanassholesolo has committed no crime, that is not even remotely clear.  in more than one of the states that reddit has servers, for example: Oregon and California, they have hate crime legislation that covers speech, hate speech, and incitement of violence...i dont know if you saw users hanassholesolos posts, but it would be hard to argue that he would not be guilty. </p>

<p>you can make all kinds of assumptions, but the simple fact of the matter is your analysis of this situation is laughable...your actions are anything but apolitical.  this sub are compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the user was already doxxed.  reporting a persons name for anyone who becomes apart of a national political news story, is not in any sense unethical.  free speech does absolve you of being responsible for public statements.  trump and republicans have been working tirelessly to dissolve everything from net nuetrality to privacy on the internet.  he should have had no expectation of privacy considering his political ideology.  he openly advocated doxxing and committing acts of violence on others.  does that escape you?  his posts, who he is, are particularly relevant to the larger story, who are trump supporters?  what is trumps relation to the alt-right, ect.  </p>

<p>the user contacted CNN after he was doxxed by 4chan, he apologized to CNN before they told him they would publish his name if he continued to post racist, bigoted, and violent statements publicly.</p>

<p>posts that likely violate actual law in the jurisdiction they were made.  the creator of the first meme posted by a president in an offical capacity being a violent racist....is in fact newsworthy.  his name is in fact relevant.</p>

<p>the ridiculous justification you use continues to be laughable.  you act with out legitimacy.  </p>

<p>Looks like someone is pretending to not know what an archive link is! Hint: it&#39;s exactly the same as the original CNN link. Using archive.is simply deprives CNN of ad revenue/clicks. DOUBLE HINT: THIS MEANS CNN LINKS <em>ARE NOT</em> BEING CENSORED AND <em>ARE STILL</em> ALLOWED.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN has an obligation to protect their journalists while in the field and this type of rhetoric can very easily influence some people into actions that may put them into harm&#39;s way. They have every right to find out who the creator of such content is and they also have the right to print their name. They took the high road and did not. They are the ones who looked into it They found him and the let it be known. Do you think that if a reddit mod contacted them they would learn anything? Nope. It would be snowflake this and censorship that #MAGA. </p>

<p>There were over 15 different subreddits that links to the comment section you&#39;re pointing to as support for your opinion, and sadly that type of brigading undermines the discussion as a reflection of the community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as you know, outside brigading is a violation of the reddit TOS and we are working actively with the reddit admins to ensure those users who did follow links from other communities into that thread are suspended. That will more easily allow us to cull down on those commentators who were here only to manipulative the discussion, and thus we will have a far better sense of the numbers in the coming days hopefully.</p>

<p>It has to do with three legal standings;</p>

<p>Public figure.</p>

<p>Involuntary public figure.</p>

<p>Limited purpose public figure.</p>

<p>Public figures becomes do by choice, so that category is obviously not so morally ambiguous.- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Magazine_v._Falwell</a></p>

<p>Limited purpose public figures, according to the court, are those who &quot;thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved.&quot;</p>

<p>As an example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Judge Saris defined a limited public figure as one who “voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues.”  The Court acknowledged that an otherwise private person can attain this status by granting interviews and speaking to the press in the wake of similar events. For example, the Court explained, Richard Jewell made himself a public figure with respect to the 1996 Summer Olympics bombing by granting interviews in which he described his own heroics during that bombing.- <a href="http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2014/12/court-rejects-glenn-becks-limited-purpose-and-involuntary-public-figure-theories-in-marathon-bombing-defamation-case/">http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2014/12/court-rejects-glenn-becks-limited-purpose-and-involuntary-public-figure-theories-in-marathon-bombing-defamation-case/</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where as involuntary public figure would be something more akin to this (this standard is highly controversial, being invoked (and shot down) recently by Glenn Beck regarding a identification in the NY Post (and other publications) of the potential person responsible for the Marathon Bombings;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A person can become an &quot;involuntary public figure&quot; as the result of publicity, even though that person did not want or invite the public attention&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the Court says;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Gertz v. Welch, the Supreme Court stated that in “exceedingly rare” circumstances, a person may become a public figure involuntarily, by what some courts have described as “sheer bad luck.” One example cited by Judge Saris was a case involving an air traffic controller who happened to be on duty on the day of a terrible accident. This case, and a handful of others, suggested that involuntary public figure status is “a rare bird, but not an extinct one.” - <a href="http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2014/12/court-rejects-glenn-becks-limited-purpose-and-involuntary-public-figure-theories-in-marathon-bombing-defamation-case/">http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2014/12/court-rejects-glenn-becks-limited-purpose-and-involuntary-public-figure-theories-in-marathon-bombing-defamation-case/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In terms of how the courts/the reddit admins/the mods decide these things, its usually this test that we gleaned from the 4th circuit (the following is an example where someone did not meet that threshold);</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In determining whether Alharbi qualified for this status, Judge Saris adopted a test developed by the Fourth Circuit: in order to become an involuntary public figure, one must “assume the risk of publicity” by acting or failing to act in “circumstances in which a reasonable person would understand that publicity would likely inhere.” Judge Saris held that Alharbi, who had merely chosen to attend a public sporting event, had assumed no such risk, and therefore was not an involuntary public figure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example where the admins determined that someone <em>was</em> an involuntary public figure- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5zraqw/an_update_with_regards_to_posts_related_to_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5zraqw/an_update_with_regards_to_posts_related_to_the/</a></p>

<p>Basically, its done on a case by case basis in discussions between the mods and the admins and requires a highly nuanced understanding of legal precedent due to the way reddit works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess the air traffic controller example clears it up more, I just didn&#39;t see it as assuming the risk of publicity because he hasn&#39;t been accused of commiting any crimes legally(which i know would put it into public figure), only by a mob.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that make hanassholesolo a public figure too? Though I guess its the supposed threat more than the actual doxxing that matters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn I am late for the party! I think CNNs statement was definitely a threat. But you know what? Good for them. I&#39;m glad they took this stance. Sure, we can all agree they are a biased network. Duh. But that&#39;s not the point. Their reporters are getting death threats left and right just for doing their job thanks to President Trump&#39;s tweets and that&#39;s not OK. If this continues and the news network does nothing about it, we won&#39;t be far off from becoming like Mexico where a reporter is found dead every other week for trying to report something certain ppl might not like. And that user is an idiot anyway. If you don&#39;t want everyone in your life to know the things you post online, don&#39;t put out personal information. </p>

<p>And as for this ban, I don&#39;t agree but will probably continue lurking around this thread (it&#39;s my guilty pleasure). It&#39;s not like CNN is going to miss the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> revenue anyway. 🙄</p>

<p>CNN is not publishing &quot;HanA**holeSolo&#39;s&quot; name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again.

<p>&quot;The suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.&quot;</p>

<p>At no point in any of the information, the &quot;news&quot; being censored. Traffic is just being directed away from CNNs domains.</p>

<p>As for your theoretical post: </p>

<p>&quot;I may get a notification about it but hey, maybe I don&#39;t bother to repost;&quot; </p>

<p>You were theoretically told why your theoretical post was removed, either in the theoretical notification, or on the sub&#39;s sidebar it will explain that archived links to the exact same information are completely allowed. </p>

<p>Your decision to engage in self-censorship by not reposting the archive is not fettered free speech. It&#39;s laziness.</p>

I&#39;m not the type to &quot;cry shill&quot;, but it&#39;s suspicious when none of the top comments have anything to do with the OBVIOUS fucking substance of the OP.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t respond to these comments and down vote them as you fee appropriate.</p>

<p>To get back on topic, this is a fantastic step.  I am disgusted by CNN&#39;s behavior and was educated about (and relieved) learning that their actions were probably criminal:</p>
