<p><em>If parts per billion/trillion are said have a physically impossible effect on humans [Homeopathy], how then are the same concentrations affecting fish populations.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In another discussion on Homeopathy a logical contradiction came up.</p>

<p>Homeopathy&#39;s beneficial effects have always been written off as &quot;natural improvement of condition&quot;, &quot;placebo effect&quot; or &quot;other&quot;. While this is not to contend that Homeopathy works as stated there are huge contradictions in the argument <em>it could not physically work</em>.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to argue its effectiveness but only to falsify the stated claims of why it can&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Currently <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/02/fish-becoming-transgender-contraceptive-pill-chemicals-flushed/">headlines are floating around that fish are being turned transgender</a> by hormones and drugs in the water supply. The recent headlines focus solely on <em>flushing medications</em> but long term research has always listed urination and failure to process drugs as a main cause.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/drugs-in-our-drinking-water#1">WebMD cites both contamination vectors - urination and flushing:</a> and also lists the concentrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although levels are low -- reportedly measured in parts per billion or trillion </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the same concentrations found in Homeopathy. <strong><em>If</em></strong> the stated contamination vector for the drug-water supply is correct then one has to logically deduce that concentrations of PPT and PPB have a mechanism which effects at least 20% of organic life. </p>

<p>Either one can argue that fish are suffering from placebo effects or perhaps that all life across various species have subtle differences where some are affected differently than others. It presents a very interesting frame of reference. If anyone argues against Homeopathy because of the extreme dilution (PPB and PPT) the argument is easily rebutted with the drug-water supply scenario. </p>

<p>However if we hold no bias we also must entertain something else could be the cause or that some deliberate engineering or contamination is being done. Logically if PPB or PPT has no effect then one must entertain the fish are being poisoned in some other way, possible deliberately. </p>

<p>Another interpretation is that all species may exhibit behaviours and changes related to one another (in their own species respects) but that would require a quantum mechanical, non-local communication mechanism. Which is not a foreign concept as it exists in metaphysical interpretations of reality.</p>

<p>No. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Homeopathy cures, not causes illnesses. So if the illness were cause by 1/1000000000 of the substance, the homeopathy would state that 1/1000000000000 of the same substance would cure it. </p>

<p>So a diluted substance of the harming ingredient should cure it - Because that&#39;s how Homeopathy works. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drug tolerance isn&#39;t the immune system&#39;s doing. It&#39;s generally a reduction in the number of receptors for something to which you are <em>already</em> sensitive in some form (otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be an effective drug).

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s massively oversimplified. </p>

<p>Drug tolerance occurs because the body aims to maintain stability, drugs fuck with stability, so the body adapts in order to preserve it. It compensates. </p>

<p>The immune system aims to identify and quarantine/kill specific things that may be harmful to the system. </p>

<p>These two things are intertwined at times, a powerful stimulant might overwork cells, resulting in inflammation and an immune system response, but the down regulating of drug receptors in the presence of chronic drug use is not an immunological response, just an typical adaptive response. </p>

<p>What are: <em>pathogenic viruses/bacteria in healthy people.</em> This is commonly referred to as <em>secondary infections</em> today. But when Bacillus Influenzae was first hypothesized to be responsible for the flu it was later contradicted when they found BI[Hib] in healthy patients. </p>

<p>Except that Bacillus Influenzae does actually make people sick and manifests with similar symptoms as viral influenza. So I don&#39;t actually see what point you&#39;re trying to make?</p>

<p>There is no broken causal link though? What are you talking about?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>You would classify the poison as have an LD50 of whatever the dosage that killed 50 people was. You wouldn&#39;t conclude that it&#39;s only poisonous to 50 people. The conclusion is: at X dosage Y kills 50% of people. </p>

<p>Not sure. Hard to know when they manipulate and obfuscate the data. </p>

<p>For instance the WHO burns the cases which are caused by the Vaccine. They purge thousands of cases of measles every year when its discovered a Vaccine was given 6 weeks prior. There is a directive for this in their manual. They also omit years and have removed data. A few years ago someone put the made up figures they create together and realized it showed a 50% mortality rate which is impossible. This is why you get infection rate for one year, next year none, but they might give the numbers of death, next year maybe something. It&#39;s junk science.</p>

<p>What happened to Scarlet Fever? The Typhus vaccine caused Typhus. This is why its not on the market anymore. Yet Typhus and Scarlet fever both are unheard of now, coincidentally they aren&#39;t marketed in the Vaccine industry. </p>

<p>The mortality rates on all the heavily cited &quot;pathogenic viruses&quot; were dropping long before Vaccines were introduced. The immune system is not a <em>thing</em>.

<p>LD 50s are created on mice for a general idea of toxicity. Im talking about finding the causal link behind the poison. A poison that hypothetically only kills half of people, at any dose but at high doses doesn&#39;t kill those immune from it. Average of 50%. There is another causal factor besides the poison. </p>

<p><a href="https://surv.esr.cri.nz/PDF_surveillance/MeaslesRpt/2016/MeaslesReport201636.pdf">This</a> is from NZ. Table 4 shows the numbers of Not Vaccinated, Vaccinated within 14days prior, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated cases. </p>

<p>What happened to Scarlet Fever? </p>

<p>Vaccines aren&#39;t effective when something has too much strain variety, which apparently was a problem for scarlet fever. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No they aren&#39;t. Typhus is massively reduced due to the widespread usage of pesticides to kill the insects that carry it. </p>

<p>Scarlet fever got stomped by penicilin, kids still catch it all the time. </p>

<p>Improvements in hygene and medical advancements will definitely have that effect. Not shocking at all. </p>

<p>Which is it&#39;s called an immune <strong>system</strong>. </p>

<p>Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just natural biological function of an organism that is made up of many, many other smaller organisms.</p>

<p>Pretty much. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If increasing the dose even to high levels wont kill those it doesn&#39;t effect, then yes, there&#39;s another causal factor involved. In the case of a poison that factor is probably going to be that the 50% which is immune carries a mutation which prevents poisons from entering cells. That&#39;s been observed before and (IIRC) is also why some people can be immune to AIDS/HIV. </p>

<p>I think I get what you mean by that though: how do we distinguish allergy from poison. I&#39;d hazard a guess that allergies tend to be kept in check by antihistamines, while poisons aren&#39;t. But that&#39;s not an area I&#39;ve studied at all. I suspect though that the distinction is pretty arbitrary, and that there isn&#39;t any particular reason to view it ones way or the other. </p>

<p>There was a time where kids died to this though. The same as the other diseases. They even had a song [remember it as a kid] and a few other things. The question is if the other diseases would&#39;ve ended up in the same bin had they not pulled out the Vaccines.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious how they showed that <em>all chronic illnesses</em> have a breakdown of cellular structure while only studying mice? Nowhere in that article do they claim that they have discovered the mechanism of all chronic disease. </p>

<p>You cited a seriously heavyweight paper and used to it support a statement that the authors themselves don&#39;t make. </p>

<p>Not that there isn&#39;t a breakdown of cells, otherwise there isn&#39;t damage occuring at all, that&#39;s literally what damage is... cells breaking down. </p>

<p>... yes. </p>

<p>Are you just trying to say that cells let things in and out, when people are sick, bad things get into cells and kill them?</p>

<p>Things bind to receptors, this opens channels. Sometimes things bind to channels to close channels. Sometimes channels just don&#39;t give a fuck about receptors. There&#39;s such an absurd number and variety of receptors that saying &#39;it&#39;s a receptor problem&#39; without specifying which receptors is about the same as shrugging and saying &quot;Eh, life right?&quot;. <em>Of course receptors are involved</em>. Maybe I&#39;m missing the point your trying to make here?</p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not really the point I assume you&#39;re trying to get at. Oxidative pathways exist in cells (otherwise why breathe it in?) but problems only happen when you encounter oxidative stress: reactive oxygen species become to prevalent and (as it turns out) reactive oxygen is fucking toxic. Too much reactive oxygen and your DNA comes under attack, cells die etc. Sometimes damage mitachondria start generating reactive oxygen themselves, which just makes the problem worse. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t make it all bad. Your body both uses and protects against the effects of reactive oxygen, it&#39;s when those mechanisms are overwhelmed, malfunction or fail that you really run into problems (like neurodegenerative diseases). </p>

<p>What does this have to do with the entire medical establishment being wrong?</p>

<p>You&#39;re also using too large a figure for the water consumption, since the actual physical water usage in Britain per capita is ~1k L/person-day or about 53 billion L/day. The rest is &quot;consumed&quot; in the sense that it&#39;s used in service of Britons for e.g. manufacturing, but it&#39;s physically not in Britain. And even then, most of that 1k L/day isn&#39;t household use, most of it is e.g. agriculture that doesn&#39;t end up directly in rivers (it sinks into groundwater, mostly).</p>

<p>Okay, for one, parts per trillion is not even <em>close</em> to homeopathic concentrations.</p>

<p>Homeopathic dilutions are measured on a scale where, say, 10C means you took your original substance, diluted it to 1/100th its original concentration, then repeated that nine more times for a total of 10 times. That means your dilution, for an example 10C dilution, would be (1/100)<sup>10</sup> = 10<sup>-20</sup> = one part per <em>billion</em> trillion.</p>

<p>But a standard homeopathic dilution is <em>30</em>C, or a concentration of 10<sup>-60</sup>. That&#39;s one part per trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion or, if you prefer, roughly one molecule in a trillion <em>clones of the Earth&#39;s combined oceans</em>. In practice, this concentration is zero, because at 30C the odds of containing even a single molecule of the original substance are so low that in all probability every homeopathic practitioner on Earth has never been so lucky as to get one.</p>

<p><em>Even if</em> <strong><em>every</em></strong> women in Britain of childbearing years was taking birth control (which they&#39;re not), and <em>even if</em> every one were dumping their medication down the toilet daily (which they are not) there would still only be a concentration of 0.1 part per trillion compared to the daily water supply.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ignoring that not every women takes birth control. Women don&#39;t flush their medicines down the toilet. Metabolites are formed when the body processes them. So you can eliminate most of the original estimated amount making it into the water supply at all, and you will be left with concentrations equal to Homeopathy.</p>

<p>This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.[84] A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100−6=10−12 (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000).</p>

<p>How many people vaccinated are maimed from polio, killed by tetnus, or whooping cough etc?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure. Hard to know when they manipulate and obfuscate the data. </p>

<p>For instance the WHO burns the cases which are caused by the Vaccine. They purge thousands of cases of measles every year when its discovered a Vaccine was given 6 weeks prior. There is a directive for this in their manual. They also omit years and have removed data. A few years ago someone put the made up figures they create together and realized it showed a 50% mortality rate which is impossible. This is why you get infection rate for one year, next year none, but they might give the numbers of death, next year maybe something. It&#39;s junk science.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT25HhAVhhU">Vaccines are contaminated with mycoplasmas</a></p>

<p>What happened to Scarlet Fever? The Typhus vaccine caused Typhus. This is why its not on the market anymore. Yet Typhus and Scarlet fever both are unheard of now, coincidentally they aren&#39;t marketed in the Vaccine industry. </p>

<p>The mortality rates on all the heavily cited &quot;pathogenic viruses&quot; were dropping long before Vaccines were introduced. The immune system is not a <em>thing</em>. There is no single element of the &quot;immune system&quot;. It&#39;s just natural biological function of an organism that is made up of many, many other smaller organisms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You would classify the poison as have an LD50 of whatever the dosage that killed 50 people was. You wouldn&#39;t conclude that it&#39;s only poisonous to 50 people. The conclusion is: at X dosage Y kills 50% of people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LD 50s are created on mice for a general idea of toxicity. Im talking about finding the causal link behind the poison. A poison that hypothetically only kills half of people, at any dose but at high doses doesn&#39;t kill those immune from it. Average of 50%. There is another causal factor besides the poison. </p>

<p>Kids get it, they get sick. In clean warm homes they tend to recover, if not, then we give them penicilin at which point they pretty much all recover.</p>

<p>There was a time where kids died to this though. The same as the other diseases. They even had a song [remember it as a kid] and a few other things. The question is if the other diseases would&#39;ve ended up in the same bin had they not pulled out the Vaccines.</p>
