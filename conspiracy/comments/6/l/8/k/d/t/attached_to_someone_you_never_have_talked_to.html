       Hello! I am a random 25 year old girl born on July 1st 1992. My family has done a lot to get here, and I have a lot of thoughts on the perception of reality. I developed a thought that I am connected and attached to somebody I was yet to meet, and yet when I met them they never actually came into my life. I wonder how many conspiracy theorists on here might be experiencing something similar, like their whole lifes purpose has been taken away from them by not being able to share modern day with something as "simple" as with another human. Please, if you can, tell me how you feel about this. Is someone being ripped from your life nowhere to be seen in fact the largest conspiracy in your mind? in my world it sure is

       I have a friend that believes we have soul twins, and lifetime after lifetime, we run into this person in different types of relationships (familial, employer/employee, neighbor, lover, enemy) until we both recognize that we are one soul. I think that's what she was explaining, at least the gist of it.

       The whole "soul twin" trope is based on ancient legends that humans were once binary beings and got separated by the gods.

       Just as there are some theories stating that humanity is amnesic, that it has lost track of most of past history, of unacknowledged events and whole civilizations from 10, 12 thousand years ago, I feel that a widespread connection between humans, a organic-level link has been severed or lost. Hive mind if you like, akin to insects and such.

       We might get glimpses of that, vestigial flashes when we suddenly  think of someone and they call you, sensing
       <em>
        something is wrong
       </em>
       with someone far away, or the societal moods, trends and discoveries that happen at the same time in distant points of the globe. Who knows if that link still exists but we can't access it properly.

       This is interesting. What do you mean that when you met them they never came into your life?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've kind of felt something similar, but I also feel like that when these opportunities arose, I may not have been ready for it yet. Maybe I won't be ready for it this lifetime, who knows?

       My experience has been quite the opposite. There have been weird moments where I was particularly struck by random people in this peculiar way I have come to recognize as them being an important future part of my life. My wife for instance, who I had a bizarre interaction with long ago. I remarked her at the time and forgot. Years later, and under dramatically different circumstances, I run into her and get involved, and later realize she was that girl. Now, I can't hope to describe how wildly different these 2 situations were, or why it was significant to notice her that first time. But I'm convinced there is some weird associative mechanism back there quietly weaving all our lives together.

       No clue what it might mean though.

       I hope you find the one you seek.  Do you have an image in your mind of the person or is this more of a feeling/sensation about a person?  For example, do you think you would know this person in  a room without being shown them?
