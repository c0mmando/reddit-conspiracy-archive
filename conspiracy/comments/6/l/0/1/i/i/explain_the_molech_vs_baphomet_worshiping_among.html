    <div class="md"><p>I feel it&#39;s roots are all in the paganism of old. Probably a long practiced ritual among them hence the secrecy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fair to say that if these &#39;deities&#39; exist they&#39;re pretty evil. If they don&#39;t it still speaks volumes on the elites who practice. However I doubt anyone would practice something so controversial in the public eye for no reason- especially politicians and celebs that rely on the limelight.</p>

<p>Now my view from a Christian standpoint is that the gods of old, and mystic traditions that came with them weren&#39;t all bull. People worshipped for a reason. However I subscribe their gods to be more alike to demons than sovereign beings. I believe that since the world is in the hands of Satan these demons have actual power and influence in it. So it&#39;s possible the people connected to these beings are given influence through them over the world. It&#39;s possibly how they became the elite in the first place. Unfortunately they are losing their soul in the process- no one escapes justice; theologically speaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It absolutely does. </p>

<p>Not all mysticism is bad but clearly there&#39;s a line between prayerful meditation and child sacrifice/orgies; generally the occult. </p>

<p>The mysticism of the pagans is generally demonic in nature; especially within the context of a monotheistic/Christian worldview.</p>

Aside from sacrifices, which Christians used to do back in the day themselves if I&#39;m not mistaken.

    <div class="md"><p>The Jews did blood sacrifice in temples at that time.  These are the birdcages Jesus knocks over while berating the moneylenders in the temple.  Possible you remember that.<br/>
In fact, it says in the bible that when Moses led them out of Egypt they spent 40 years in the wilderness.  During that time, the people lost faith and turned away from God and again started sacrificing children to moloch.   Acts 7:41-43</p>

<p>Depends who you ask. Some people say it&#39;s things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">linked consciousness</a>, getting people to project energy at a symbol that gives it power.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more to it than that. That there are negative entities (demons) behind these symbols that seek admiration and worship because they want to lead people astray.</p>

Which is carried by Hermes aka Mercury aka Pan.  Both mercury and Pan are depicted with goat-horns.  Clear links to baphomet/luciferian ideas.</p>

<p>Hermes himself originated as a form of the god Pan  </p>

<p>Hermes took over the roles as god of messengers, travelers, and boundaries, which had originally belonged to Pan, while Pan himself continued to be venerated by his original name  </p>

<p>Hermes carries the caduceus.  Mercury carries the caduceus.  Mercury has horns.  Pan has horns.  Pan was renamed to Hermes.  </p>

<p>They are all the same entity.</p>

With that being said, however, are you suggesting  Hermetism is Luciferian because of this relation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hermetisism is Luciferian..which is an umbrella term for several flavours of the same agenda. Names of &quot;deities&#39; don&#39;t mean much nor do the surface claims of their various beliefs. Break these many sects down to their symbolic language and there is a cohesive pattern.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter who these wicked groups classify as their deity, it all boils down to sun and moon worship. Catholicism and Islam are the same way; Catholicism = sun worship and Allah was the pagan moon god before being integrated into Islam. The Catholics helped create Islam 500 years ago, they&#39;re all the same.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Are they evil or are they negative entity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends who you ask. Some people say it&#39;s things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect">linked consciousness</a>, getting people to project energy at a symbol that gives it power.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more to it than that. That there are negative entities (demons) behind these symbols that seek admiration and worship because they want to lead people astray.</p>
