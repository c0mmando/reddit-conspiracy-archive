       If you break it down into these separate parts, it doesn't seem insane at all:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is an elite group of assholes running this world with a multi-trillion dollar budget.  That's a pretty standard conclusion we have all come to from our research.  Through enslavement with debt, they practically own all the wealth in the world (or at least most of it).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Humans can go to Mars.  That's not such an outrageous concept when you are dealing with an elite group of assholes in control of a multi-trillion dollar budget.  It would take many trips into our orbit to prepare the cargo needed for such a trip, but it's not science fiction.  It's just expensive.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Elitists kidnap children.  That is not a wild conclusion either if you have followed the many decades of evidence surrounding Pedogate.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Is it not possible then, with the above 3 points, that the rich assholes who control us through debt enslavement might be interested in setting up a small colony on Mars?  Obviously they wouldn't be sending their own kids...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now go ahead.. tell me why this is so absurd.  I have yet to hear a good counter-argument to the theory.  Why is it impossible?  Which of the 3 points above is the hardest to believe, and why?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: many replies later, I still don't see a valid counter-argument.  All I see are things like "We don't like to explore.  Earth has plenty for us".  Really?  Is that the official stance of this sub?  Pathetic..

       You are using a conspiracy theory to counter a conspiracy theory.  That's great, but I like to entertain the thought that NASA might not be a
       <em>
        total
       </em>
       fraud and that travelling to space is possible.

       The reason why this is absurd on the face of it, is because you haven't even provided a MOTIVE for the supposed elite pedophile rings to put their slave colony on mars.  That seems like a massive logistical problem, as well has a huge security risk, to no end.  It also seems like it would actually be a hindrance, since the next time you want to summon the devil you have to travel all the way to mars to find a sacrifice

       Like I said to someone else in here, mankind has always wanted to explore other planets and setting up camp is just part of it.  Just because you think it's pointless doesn't mean there isn't someone who is up for the task.

       I didn't say the motive was the only missing piece, I said it was the first thing that jumps out as absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that just because I can't imagine a motive doesn't mean someone else can't imagine a motive.  But I don't see why it is worthwhile to entertain your idea when not even you can imagine why someone would bother to do this.  You are asking people to consider the possibility that there are unknown people doing something unknown which seems impossible, using an unknown means, toward unknown ends.  And all without evidence!   At least give me a blurry photo of a martian rock formation that looks like a pentagram or something, jeez

       In order to get to Mars there'd have to be a very long burn in Earth's vicinity in order to set up the transfer orbit capable of carrying all the mass of a colony + children. This is nothing something that happens all the time, in fact it's extremely rare, and it is something amateur astronomers could pick up on.

       They would of course split it, but there's a break-even point where it doesn't make sense. Sending a mission for every nut and bolt is silly, as is a single mission that takes the whole shebang at once.

       "For every nut and bolt" is quite the exaggeration.  If they can build a space station, which is essentially an orbiting colony, then I don't see why they couldn't take it a few steps further.

       And Robert Steele is an agent from what agency? There's no blame being put on anyone here. Simply analytics. When Apple unlocked a phone (or refused to) Joe Rogan had "ex-CIA" agent on to explain why the FBI requests were actually beneficial to security and the people.

       There is something in our blood that makes us want to set up camp in the harshest of places.  This is why you will find more tents on Mount Everest right now than so many other places.  It's not strange to want to set up a colony on another planet.

       There are numerous tents on Mount Everest because people die, and their bodies and gear are left up there. And, relative to traveling to and colonizing Mars, that's a piece of cake. We write books about lots of things we don't (or can't) actually do.

       Of course, you'll retort with some "but they are so rich, that's exactly why they would do something this stupid!" I'll respond by calling you an idiot for such a pathetic response. Then you'll follow up by taking it personally and accusing me of being a shill or other agent of tptb. And then I'll finish this off by pointing out once again how ridiculous your claims are.

       Most children lack the technical skills required from astronauts.

       Anyway, there's not shortage willing adults going to Mars, so using children would be pointless. Willing adults will always do a better job than slave children. A community on another planet would require cooks, maintenance engineers, doctors, repair workshop operators, etc.. all which are jobs that children can't do, except for cooking.

       Anything is possible. If there is a link to children's blood eliminating disease or DMT production being stronger in a child, it could certainly add into why they are farmed on Mars on not held here. Very fucked up if true. I hope it's fake... but knowing what TPTB could and are capable of, I'm wary of the information being discredited nowadays.

       Steele stated the trip takes 20 years. We can get a satellite to mars in 7-18 months. 20 years is absolutely ridiculous.

       If you buy the whole 20 yr thing, then it might make sense to get kids.  But there isn't going to be a lot of grunt work on mars, most of it will be technical.  Just kidnapping someone who is already skilled would be 5 times as efficient.

       It's just fits the bad shit crazy narrative of theories too much.  People really need to know how to separate realistic type shit and the not at all realistic.    No matter how much secretive information is alive, what you probably think is real is very much not real.   Fake news is real, but the term just finally became mainstream for some odd reason.....?     Some of it may be real, a lot of it most likely not.

       Look into Marine Captain Randy Cramer and civilian Tony Rodriguez.  They both attest to being part of programs very much like what you talk about.

       Many of it impossible based on knowledge of outer space but, again, we must remember this info we have is what we have been allowed to know.   And what's the possibility it's a lie?

       There are many people worldwide who go missing without a trace.  No real motive to disappear, no suspects, etc.  A colony on Mars could solve a lot of missing persons.  But they old said it was a child sex slave colony?  Yes, but someone has to take care of the tots until they're ready to fulfill their purpose to create life on this new planet which would include adults from almost every profession of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's something of a Hollywood script, I tend to believe there is some truth to it.  Is it like they "leaked"?  Nah, that's total misinfo but I'd bet my bowl right now there's pieces of truth in it. I'm thinking in a few years we'll learn they've discovered Martians - and technically they will be:  the first generation born on the planet; they just won't admit we created them.

       Why Mars? It would be cheaper to do this on the bottom of the ocean and just as secretive. That's the absurd part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can fathom an evil kidnap ring because plenty of those exist. I can fathom secret space missions because plenty of those exist. I can accept the feasibility of going to Mars w/ current technology. But why put all three together?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could afford to go back and forth to Mars to kidnap and ??? children we would get a higher ROI mining the asteroid belt for the same investment.

       They'd need children because they're using ion engined craft (cheaper, more efficient but lengthier trip), the kids would be easier to groom/ train/ brainwash than adults and they would have longer life spans due to their age and the longer solar orbit of mars around the sun.
