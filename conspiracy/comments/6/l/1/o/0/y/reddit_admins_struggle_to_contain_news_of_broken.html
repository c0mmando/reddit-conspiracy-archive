       I wonder how widespread this pretty obvious problem with bots is on this site. Both T_D and at least some of the anti trump and politics subreddits seems very fishy sometimes.
I also wonder if reddit profits of this by having more clicks/votes (or however that works on websites) and potentially earning more ad-revenue?

       It isn't reasonable at all. The_donald is literally the one sub you can be pro Trump on, on this entire site without being downvoted into oblivion and insulted constantly. It's extremely active and each post has a ton of comment replies and large comment chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile you have ~40 anti-Trump subs like marchagainsttrump, drumpf, etc etc that only have a few thousand subs each. Most posts only get a few replies and upvotes a day, except that one post each day, in each sub that magically makes it all the way to the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       with 20k+ upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the track record of admins literally changing the rules of the site and the karma formula to stop the_donald from hitting the front page, it isn't at all a stretch to see the obvious shilling going on. Furthermore we have known about CTR and Shareblue for almost a year now, and anyone on this site could see the obvious political shift directly after the DNC was exposed for colluding against Sanders with Hillary's campaign and the MSM.

       Yeah, T_D is annoying but their isn't any reason to suspect botting. They are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       active with 400,000+ subscribers and 10k+ users online at any given time. It is pretty much
       <em>
        the only
       </em>
       active Donald supporting subreddit, so all of his fans just naturally congregate there. The downside is that all of the Don's supporters are condensed into a single location, so that makes them a giant target for admins and makes it easy to keep them off the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti-Trump subs went in the exact opposite direction, and scattered their supporters across dozens of different subreddits. This was originally intended to game the site algorithm by copy/pasting the same story to multiple subs and thus get multiple chances to reach the Front Page thanks to the weighting and Front Page diversity changes. The downside to that, however, is that the anti-Trump user base became severely fractured and spread thin. I personally think that several of the Anti-Trump subs tried to compensate for their lack of concentrated voting power by running vote bots and also by coordinating upvotes offsite via Discord (which is a violation of site rules).

       I dont really think T_D is annoying and that's also not why I think the sub is somewhat fishy. I just think the comment to uprate ratio seems pretty weird when you consider the 10k active users.

      <p>
       You have several topics with 3-5k upvotes but several of them are below 50 comments. I'm not saying they are using bots for sure, it just seems weird to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they are kept of the frontpage. That's true. Every once in a while a topic makes it through to the frontpage and it's usually one that makes T_D look extremely bad.

       You severely underestimate the loyalty and activity of T_D subscribers. A lot of them will literally sit on New or Rising and just upvote every post they can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is much easier to mass upvote posts than it is to manually type out dozens of post specific comments.

       yes. I saw both of that dude's posts right in the morning on both those subreddits and knew they were fucky right away. Also marchagainsttrump hasn't hit frontpage status since they banned their mod that was botting posts to the front page.

       It isn't reasonable at all. The_donald is literally the one sub you can be pro Trump on, on this entire site without being downvoted into oblivion and insulted constantly. It's extremely active and each post has a ton of comment replies and large comment chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile you have ~40 anti-Trump subs like marchagainsttrump, drumpf, etc etc that only have a few thousand subs each. Most posts only get a few replies and upvotes a day, except that one post each day, in each sub that magically makes it all the way to the top of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       with 20k+ upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the track record of admins literally changing the rules of the site and the karma formula to stop the_donald from hitting the front page, it isn't at all a stretch to see the obvious shilling going on. Furthermore we have known about CTR and Shareblue for almost a year now, and anyone on this site could see the obvious political shift directly after the DNC was exposed for colluding against Sanders with Hillary's campaign and the MSM.
