A lot of posts make it to the top of this sub, but are absolute trash and immediately do more harm than good. To fuck with this sub, &quot;they&quot; are doing some of these things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use a commonly known but easily refuted theory that attacks alternative thinking as a whole (this is why you don&#39;t see JFK posts on the front page, too many people will start talking about the validity of the theory)</p></li>
<li><p>Shitpost in a way that resemble common memes on other sub/websites. use over-simplicity to make a lack of a point, stir up the pot if you will. </p></li>
<li><p>Establish a top comment that sets the entire tone for the comments, typically condescending and leaning one way politically. </p></li>
<li><p>Vote manipulate that shit to the top, gaining exposure in a bad light, and just sit back.</p></li>
<li><p>Throw in some comments about right/left and watch all topics devolve into that.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of times there&#39;s people who post in here intentionally to egg people on. The &quot;Keep Digging&quot; slogan is a meme at this point. </p>

<p>There also seems to be people who intentionally create posts with alts in order to come in here and ridicule users on a different account. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the same users aren&#39;t cross posting their own content to the ridicule subs in order to get others to brigade and harass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the end goal though? Who spends there time trying to stop people from discussing political controversy and theories? I understand it&#39;s a joke and a meme, but the simple idea of discrediting truth efforts should make people think twice... I&#39;d hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is what we have to expect though, that is the game now. When us common folk have such a quick and easy way to access information the powers that be do not want us to know, debate, and think about, it is only understandable that they get their think tanks together to figure out how to correct the issue without total disassemble of the way we communicate. </p>

<p>We have no idea who is a legitimate user, who is a shill, who is a bot, who is some guy who has been so sucked into the main stream narrative he comes here to shit on normal users, and anything else. &quot;They&quot; create chaos and disinfo by all the means you listed and more. Sucks for us but it obviously isn&#39;t stopping us.</p>
