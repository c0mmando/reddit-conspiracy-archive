<p>Reminds me of an anecdote from a researcher living with the Fehe Pygmies of the Congo.

<p>I was going to say, I&#39;m not an expert in anthropology at all, but many (far from all) so-called &quot;primitive&quot; societies seem to handle it with an eye toward diffusion, or at the very least, minimizing the cycle of violence. Outside of shaming, exile/non-association seem to me to make the most sense. Like, if you can&#39;t work with us without being abusive, then go find your own river to fish.</p>

<p>That&#39;s extremely interesting.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if the division of society into &quot;policers&quot; and &quot;policed&quot; is the first step in creating cycles of &quot;justice-minded&quot; violence. Once that police-class is established, the issue of dealing with violence is no longer something the community as a whole has to think about, it&#39;s delegated by that division of labor instead. Also, by throwing violators into jail, we don&#39;t solve the problem so much as hide it away. Yes, the community now has one fewer vagrant who has been stealing bread, but what about the chain of events that led the person into that situation in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t, unless your definition of socialism is predicated on its application by the state. But that&#39;s only one form of socialism, and there are more libertarian schools of thought such as anarcho-syndicalism (essentially direct ownership of the means of production by self organized workers and trade unions, rather than state collectivization as in Marxist-Leninist states like the USSR/China). </p>

<p>I had a much longer response to this written up but my phone browser refreshed and woops, it&#39;s gone. But <a href="/u/groman32">/u/groman32</a>&#39;s post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6l16uo/capitalism_is_a_conspiracy_quit_supporting/djqfri7/.compact">here</a> is pretty good as well. </p>

<p>If you want an example of this sort of socialism, Revolutionary Catalonia was doing pretty well for itself (numerous writers even alleging 50% increases in productivity after the workers adjusted, the transition was chaotic as to be expected), although it was by no means perfect. That only lasted until the USSR-funded Marxist-Leninist Communist Party started to gain dominance, though (which is what prompted George Orwell to return to Britain).</p>

<p>&quot;Anarchy&quot; gets often misunderstood. It does not mean the absence of order, it means the absence of rulers. We can have self-government without creating independent classes of career politicians and police. </p>

<p>We can also have an economy, self-managed, without having a class of owners who do not work themselves. We can still have managers, CEO&#39;s, etc., but they could be appointed by the workers themselves democratically, rather than imposed from above by stockholders.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t pretend to have all the answers, nowhere near, but I think we should at least dare to <em>dream</em> of a world better than this one, which is definitely far from perfect itself. That&#39;s the first step to making it a reality, and I&#39;d expect a long process of trial and error so we can <em>discover</em> the possibilities for ourselves and build them from the ground up. I&#39;m not looking for a revolution where a new political class is installed who then dictates the new society from on high, that&#39;s Bolshevism, not my cup of tea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you not read my whole post? Capitalism lends itself to consumerism easily, even in the entirely hypothetical &quot;basic capitalism&quot;, no elites necessary. Well, except for the government elites who are necessities create capitalism in the first place by forcefully enclosing the commons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, ism&#39;s only distract us. Problem is, we do eventually need to come together on a method of organizing large scale projects to provide everyone with their needs. The satanic elite&#39;s argument is that we&#39;re all parasites on Earth incapable of enhancing the world more than we destroy it through consumption.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)"> American System</a> of economics, which has had a fairly successful history but has rarely been implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just about every political -ism has it&#39;s good points that look decent on paper/end up being fucked up once implemented. A major issue is the all-knowing/all-believing devotee to any particular system, in which only that system and perspective is 10000000% right and holy and good and the rest are fully evil and wrong. Cult-like devotion and polarization always sucks, and disregards anyone with a different set of perspectives and experiences. This seems to play into the competition v. cooperation conundrum that truly defines the basic political right-left/capitalism-communism divide. Less extremist assholes in the world would be a good start, more listening and working together. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, do I come off like a commie for feeling this way? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beware <em>capitalism</em> is a hegelian word, it means very different things to different people. To some it might mean economic freedom. To others it means neoliberalism.</p>

<p>Is a fat international banker, cigar in mouth, buddies with all government bureaucracts, who uses his influence to lobby for laws that allows him to legally commit fraud, a capitalist?</p>

<p>IMO the only political dichotomy is liberty vs tyranny. Clearly a system that relies on a politburo of old senile central planners who fix prices, manipulate interest rates and provide benefits to their banker buddies belongs to the latter category.</p>

<p>And about the vocabulary, how could we say this economic system is &quot;capitalist&quot; when it adheres almost to-the-letter with the 5th &quot;commandment&quot; of the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm">communist manifesto</a>? </p>

<p>Regardless, if everyone agreed on the meaning of words, I think everyone in the end would be pro-liberty (except 1% of sociopaths who are currently in jail if they&#39;re stupid and in power otherwise). Control the language and you control the mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This needs to be a post in itself,  excellent!    I remember Joseph Tito allowed a good deal of free market expression in former Yugoslavia which as a policy,  was much more popular than the soviet bloc policies.    We need to differentiate economies as pro-liberty vs.  autocratic,  by degrees,  and not take the basic rules of a fair and level  playing field for competition as autocratic.    No game is fair when the rules are rigged by an elite against the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is what they called the new and improved version of Feudalism. The wealthy elites and aristos set their serfs free but they still had no wealth or property were suddenly forced to compete with one another for their old positions in order to secure the basic necessities of life. The rich simply got richer and no longer had to worry about feeding and sheltering the serfs who were no longer called that, but rather &quot;employees&quot;. That&#39;s why you still aren&#39;t an equal with equal rights when it comes to any employment contract you enter into. It&#39;s still considered a master/servant relationship and contract under the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not as far from the bottom as we&#39;d like to think, as it turns out. The top 1% of the population has more wealth and property than the bottom 90% do. They also have more wealth and property than the next 9% who collectively also have more wealth and property than the bottom 90% do. So the top 10% have over two thirds of all of the wealth and property. That remaining less than a third is long gone before you reach the bottom 50% who not only don&#39;t have any wealth or property but have far more debt than any real assets to cover and remember that what they owe, they owe mainly to that same top 10% who in the end actually own it all and then some.</p>
