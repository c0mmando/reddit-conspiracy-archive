        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hugh Hefner is high level satanic priest and he is Hollywood&#39;s mind control sex programmer. Hugh Hefner is really wicked and is involved with human sacrifices and drinking blood. There are satanic rituals that go on underneath the Playboy mansion. There is a &quot;grotto&quot; at the mansion and the word grotto means a crypt and is directly connected to the word grotesque. The image that he portrays as an old harmless man that loves naked women is just a front. Hugh Hefner keeps multiple &quot;girlfriends&quot; which are really his sex slaves and mind control victims. Hefner took courses in sociology and he has a degree in psychology. He is an expert in satanic mind control and the bleach used to make these women blonds penetrates through the skull and fries the brain. That is the real reason why he prefers blonds. He uses Playboy as a recruiting center for initiating some of these women into Satanism and then uses them as agents, mind control slaves, and even assassins. Many members in Hollywood go to the Playboy mansion for their satanic initiations. Hugh Hefner is extremely evil. </p>

<p>&quot;This shows how inbred libcucks are now. Out of all the things in the world.. good and bad.. you think a handshake is number 1? Really? In business all the time everyday groups of people do awkward handshakes. That means those of you upvoting this probably have no job and have never had to shake hands with important people.

<p>&#39;Girl Next Door&#39; Likens Life at Playboy Mansion to Scientology</p>

<p>Holly Madison, Hugh Hefner&#39;s ex-girlfriend and former Girl Next Door, stopped by Good Work and shared what day-to-day life was like at the Playboy Mansion. Then she revealed that after she watched the HBO Scientology documentary Going Clear, she felt &quot;that was kinda my life [at the Playboy Mansion].&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DARPA and the Department of Defense along with Silicon Valley have developed an artificial singularity through HAARP, satellites, electronics, and chemtrails. HAARP. modern electronics and wireless frequencies are generating geometrically designed programs into society. The chemtrails are made of nano conductive particles that create an electromagnetic fuzz in the air and this enhances these electronic frequencies and creates a type of artificial singularity. These frequencies are hacking into the nerve systems and electrical system of the human biology and can manipulate chemicals, pain, arousal, as well as psychological states. The Church of Scientology is also working with Silicon Valley which has developed weaponized electronics disguised as computers, smart phones, wireless frequencies, and other systems. Sorcery is the unnatural manipulation of unseen forces like sounds, chemical reactions, and vibrational geometries with the intent of manipulating bodily chemistry, thoughts, and physiology. Kabbalah and Hermeticism are common forms of witchcraft practiced by the secret societies. Electronics enhance their sorcery.</p>

<p>The Church of Scientology, Kabbalah Center, and Silicon Valley have worked together to develop electronic weapons based on this witchcraft. The Church of Scientology considers itself a gnostic organization. Modern Gnosticism has been connected with Hermeticism which has a focus on alchemy or the manipulation of bodily chemicals. Kabbalah is similar but more about the manipulation of the mind and physiology through geometric sounds and vibrations. The Church of Scientology is involved with training members to use electronics with witchcraft. They are using electronics and wireless frequencies to torture people. Anonymous and other hacker groups are also involved with this covert persecution. Silicon Valley is partly overseen by Santa Clara University which is a Jesuit college and California&#39;s Jesuit Provincial who is SJ Michael F. Weiler. The Jesuits are also deeply involved with the US military and intelligence agencies. Santa Clara alumni include former CIA Director Leon Panetta, David Drummond the Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Google, Brendan Eich the co-founder of Mozilla and JavaScript, Jack Kuehler a former top executive and electrical engineer for IBM, former Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Peter Oppenheimer the former senior vice president and Chief Financial Officer of Apple. Santa Clara has courses in various sciences, engineering, and psychological counseling.
There is a Church of Scientology located in Silicon Valley and some companies located in Silicon Valley include Sony, Google, Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Adobe, BEA Systems and many more. Japanese electronics companies work closely with Silicon Valley. Akihito the Emperor of Japan is a Knight of the Order of the Garter and serves the British Crown as the blood appointed head of state in Japan. The British royal family are deeply involved in this criminality and have Crown Knights and Freemasons involved in the US military and intelligence which work alongside the Jesuits and Roman agents. Sky Dayton is a Scientologist and created EarthLink which is a network and communications company. This is all about domination through the most ruthless measures. Many of the leaders in the global crime syndicate refer to themselves as technocrats. Technocracy is about a technological based governing system. Many actors in Hollywood are members of the Church of Scientology like Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and Kirstie Alley. Many in Hollywood are covert members and George Clooney is a top leader of the Hollywood Illuminati. The most ruthless Kabbalists I have come across are Dwayne Johnson, Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Josh Hartnett, and the rapper RZA.</p>

<p>He was just an old manipulative soulless man who was not capable of love.</p>

<p>Oh and I guess the mansion is disgusting, old, and dirty.</p>
