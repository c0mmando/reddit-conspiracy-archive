       I know that things are looking bleak these days. It seems that almost every post is the typical my side vs. your side/ I'm right and you're wrong type deal. It's what I think of as argumentative propaganda. It's nothing but distraction at it's finest. And what is it distracting you from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's think about it... It seems to me that they want people to argue their own ideals for eternity. The arguments never go anywhere nor do they prove who's right (not that that matters in the end). So why use arguments to distract? You may think of divide and conquer and I believe that is a part of it, but there's something more to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistently reading and/ or watching argumentative propaganda has a negative effect on my own emotions and sense of awareness. I feel anger and hatred in the pit of my stomach which isn't alleviated until I realize that I'm falling into their trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that they are conditioning us to a negative state of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason I come here is in hopes of seeing those posts that come from you guys (the compassionate theorists). Posts that paint a picture of humans moving past this negative mind state and finally overcoming the evil that is controlling the masses. These types of posts give me a positive feeling of love and unity in my chest. It's a beautiful thing. I don't see any of those posts today so I thought I'd give it a shot...
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, what they are distracting us from is happiness (simply put). A collective happiness. That is strength. Compassion for fellow humans is what protects our race. Not brute force power. War, violence, arguments, negative states of mind only weakens us and makes us prone to becoming like them (evil).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay no attention to the argument bs. See it for what it is. Know that what they are doing is wrong and don't bother taking part. Bring back the self posts from you real people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're reading this, I'd suggest that you shut down your computer and go meditate/ do yoga for 10-20 minutes and maybe go for a walk. Forget all the arguments going on in your head and take control of your own body. (I'm telling this to myself as much as anyone else). Enjoy your life. Feel the happiness within. Embrace love and compassion. Wonder about nature. Encourage others to lose their negative mind state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel the true spirit within yourself.

       I agree people need moments of rest from these things but - i'm not one that feels life's ultimate purpose is personal happiness. I believe life's purpose is the "good fight". I will wear as much armour as my soul needs, but i will be a fighter in the war for truth to the end.

       Love this post. It's good to be reminded to serve and heal self in other to serve others and combat The Situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honor your body. It is the vehicle of all your work and we are all too quick to take it for granted. The mind requires the healthy brain, and the brain requires certain things of the body to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drink water. Sounds simple, but many of you may be drinking lots of coffee to dig and lots of booze to forget. Both rob you of water. Hydrate and replenish electrolytes. Take magnesium if you can, as it calms the nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are what you eat, so eat as well as you're able. Whole foods (meaning fruit/veg/grain/nuts etc rather than processed, not the chain store) will deliver the purest and most sustaining energy. Keep up with your omegas and zinc. Clean fats like MCT oil will give you more and better energy than processed carbs. Eat your greens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a walk around the block as often as you can. Fresh air, natural light, blood flow, and stimulus unrelated to the mystery that plagues your mind will all recharge you. Tearing veils and processing what is revealed can be very taxing, and we must give ourselves a break between digs to stay fresh and useful. The Wendigo depend on burnout and collapse in those who would expose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will seem hardest: get enough sleep. Balance the nightmare fuel with something light, even funny before bed. Meditate if you can to reset the mind and prepare it for rest. White noise, or streaming calm music will help. Soma FM is full of useful material for this and runs 24/7. I recommend the "Drone Zone" station.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take time to express all that is building inside you. Keep posting but also, make art. For yourself, as a release valve. Transmute the poison, or just drain it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are overwhelmed, that is the moment to show yourself love immediately and do what must be done to ground yourself. Explore meditation, yoga, or benign magick if you're so inclined (banishing rituals are a great idea). Get the shadow out where you can see it. Fill the space it leaves with light.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote another hoping to inspire those who fight darkness, "Do not lose heart. We were made for these times."
      </p>
      <p>
       We can all feel the tremors building. Babylon is nervous. This is it. Don't give up. Thank you all.

       These are my favorite posts on this sub, and I don't think there are many other subs that are as collective as the folks who post here. It seems like revealing all the suffering is what brings both hate and love here simultaneously and a for a higher reason. We are learning to grow together and work together for the betterment of humanity. Kindness is the strongest weapon, love is the strongest defense. Thanks to you, OP and all the other compassion-minded people of this subreddit.

       It's refreshing to see people speak like this on here. I feel like people fall into this spiral of hatred, they bounce from Reddit to YouTube to Infowars to Twitter and back, bouncing around getting madder and madder until they're completely unbalanced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking time out for yourself, like you said to take a walk, make some art, or just make sure you're hydrated, can go a long way. It can't be healthy to be cooped up in front of a PC getting mad about everything when you should be getting a good night's sleep.

       This subreddit has turned into such a vile shithole. Remember when we didn't call each other losers and cucks? We sited references and admitted when we were wrong? Those were the days.

       I'll admit I haven't been here before this last election. I was driven here to see how a conspiracy sub was eating up the potential for Russian interference in the election, kind of surprised to see it wasn't being believed by many, but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really really surprised me was the post where someone uploaded a snapshot of this sub a couple years ago. No political posts, no memes, no overt hatred in the headlines. Just conspiracy stuff, people asking questions that may look insane, but threads full of people discussing why it might not be so far fetched.

       It was almost like a different place, like somehow the URL got crossed with another at some point and no one noticed.

       There was an exodus of moderators early to mid last year, making way for mods that support the alt-right. I'd bet those mods got a nice check. It's now just another alt-right hangout on reddit. Conditioning to normalize this sort of behavior.

       The above post explains the method by which they shut down thought with strong emotion. I highly encourage everyone read it. Maybe any time you are going to make a response to something that has just upset you, take a step back, look at something else? Come back to it to see if you can rinse off the abusive emotional hangover the forum agents like to engender and be productive.
      </p>

       Not saying that theory is definitive, but I think it rhymes with what is really going on. I think it is fair to say if you are upset on here by a comment there is a good chance they were paid to make you feel that way. Don't let the bad guys win, stay positive and avoid nonconstructive conflict.

       I agree that the word itself has a bad reputation but i'm proud to call myself a conspiracy theorist. In reality though what we are just critical thinkers.

       Yes, you are correct. It's getting to be more and more unpopular to be a critical thinker. That's why when I'm in the company of others, I like to sit on the side and see if I am in the company of sheep before I declare my stance on any given topic. In most cases we are given 90% Of the truth, and the 10% that are lies just makes it even harder to sift out truth from fiction.

       It's a side effect of human psychology. We tend to see the world through what Robert Anton Wilson calls "reality tunnels"
      </p>
      <p>
       The brain has a way of altering our perception to fit the reality we believe in. Yelling at each other only reinforces the distinction, and I notice most of us don't try to find common ground anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though. Get off reddit. This place has devolved into a propaganda matrix.

       We keep arguing because all of our perspectives are different and we all think we have the correct one.. But there are two types of arguments. Those where you learn something, and those that are just ways to engage a conflict to actually Release negative energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So these arguments do serve a purpose, to both release energy and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not discounting this post though, it's good advice to ground yourself sometimes, but energy does collect and is held and releasing it is important I think. Especially in this type of forum. Another key to argument is knowing your judgements are made from that which you think you lack. It's a great way to observe your own beliefs and overcome their absolutes. But this is all if you have an awareness of what you are doing and for what purpose? Is it to vent energy or is it to learn? Either way there is a growth from those experiences.

       Good stuff OPie. Even the strongest of minds can be influenced over time from constant negative stuff warping our heads into a dark abyss. I recognized this a few months ago and incorporated daily morning mindfulness meditation back into my life. I exercise daily as well and I stay relatively positive throughout my days. I recommend everyone meditate for a good 10-30 minute everyday and do some sort of exercise, which could be anything from walking to house cleaning. Also taking a week break from r/conspiracy after a while isn't a bad idea either. Could spice it up even further by avoiding alcohol and throwing in some form of psychedelic substance to aid a bit. Stay positive people, live in the moment and appreciate the little things I say.
