<p>I am curious as to why Daily Stormer, Stormfront, fullchan, halfchan, and this sub, believe that Whites are superior, and Jews are always at the top. </p>

<p>Hence the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never seen anyone on this sub make that claim and I&#39;m even skeptical whether you will be able to easily source it from any of the other sites on your list, but superiority of intellect is not an accurate indicator of the political prominence Jews enjoy disproportionately.</p>

<p>First, white peoples in general come from traditionally industries societies. This means that white people as a matter of cultural heritage engage more in industries where labor and product are key, while Jews traditionally engage in professions such as banking, academia, political science, and the arts, more abstract or esoteric fields. This puts Jews at a proportional advantage in these fields, as a relatively low percentage of whites (and by the way other races like Asians and blacks) participate.</p>

<p>The other concept that puts Jews at an advantage in their respective fields is that of tribalism. Moreso than modern whites (and gentiles in general), Jews express comradery amongst their own. This allows them to take advantage of the strength in numbers they already have in said fields, and dominate in those professions as a group.</p>

<p>Hope this answers your question. Have a good one!</p>

<p>Tribalism is in every culture, long before Jews existed. Why singly fault a group of people for something every group does. It isn&#39;t a Jewish trait. We like those we know, those we can relate to. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Anecdotes aren&#39;t &quot;counters&quot; to generalizations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribalism">tribalism is a real concept</a>, and you &quot;not liking those you know&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you know <em>every</em> white person on Earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And also, who said fault? YOU DID. And you know it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the point of the question, as to why Jews are considered &quot;behind everything&quot; by those who believe Whites are the &quot;master race&quot;. </p>

<p>Not a contradiction, not a source of guilt, and I didn&#39;t blame you for anything - so don&#39;t take banal words personally. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every group does not hold the strings to most major sources of communication and banking in the world, so I blithely disagree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize, don&#39;t you, that banking was originally established by the Catholic Church, and then later &quot;modernized&quot; by the North Irish, Roman Catholics, and White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, most people don&#39;t FAKE their identities in real life to blend in with the general populace more. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people who &quot;fake&quot; their identities are immigrants who want to &quot;anglicize&quot; their names for easier pronounciation by the local populace. All immigrant groups do this, from Poles, to Indians, to Italians, to Asians. </p>

<p>Should we blame Johnny for not wanting to be known as Chung Fu? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could go on, but why? You know I&#39;m right, and tribalism is a WEAK excuse for poor behavior and morals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you could, you would. But you have no real sources other than what you believe. And that&#39;s fine, if you want to blame a group of people for things that every immigrant group does, if you want to blame &quot;mysterious strings&quot; on one group when historically it was founded by another, go ahead. But at least be honest with yourself that there&#39;s no real veracity to your claims. Admit it&#39;s a personal belief rather than anything upheld by scientific standards. </p>

<p>And no, tribalism isn&#39;t an &quot;excuse&quot; for <em>poor</em> behaviors and morals. That&#39;s just your opinion, man. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s start at the beginning. In 722 BCE, the Northern Kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians and the majority of its population was apparently expelled. These are the &quot;Ten Lost Tribes&quot;. This sort of forced migration seems to be part of standard part of Assyrian management of newly conquered territories. In about 586 BCE, the Southern Kingdom of Judah (remember, that Israel had been divided into two distinct kingdoms) was conquered by Babylon, and only the notables led off (the &quot;Babylonian exile&quot;). In neither of these cases do the Hebrew/Jews seems to be particularly singled out.
Lets skip to the Roman Era. Here, the Jews are unique. Roman policy granted wide religious freedom--however, there were two exceptions. 1) secret &quot;mystery cults&quot; were widely suspected, 2) groups that refused to sacrifice to the emperor (first Jews, later also Christians) were treated as suspect. The Jews led a series of wars against the Empire called the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; that ended up with the destruction of the Temple after the First Jewish–Roman War (67-70 CE) and ultimately the majority of the Jewish population of Roman Province of Judea being killed, exiled, or sold into slavery in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132 – 136 CE). These are exemplary of the unique relationship Jews have within the Roman Empire, but is likely not what you&#39;re asking about.
Most of what people think of are the Medieval and Early Modern expulsions from states in Christian Europe. One thing to note is that Jews existed in these places at all. No other religion besides Christianity existed in these states at all. Judaism had a special status that, say, Roman Paganism did not, and therefore they (often) were the only religious minority allowed to exist. So, it&#39;s important to note, they were the only religious minority that could be expelled from Europe (besides various Christian &quot;heretics&quot;). It&#39;s worth noting that the vast majority of expulsions of Jews were done by Christians, with a few isolated (and generally late) cases of expulsion by Muslim rulers.
Karen Barkey and Ira Katznelson have an interesting article, whose name I forgot, that argues that the expulsion of the Jews by England in 1290 and France around the same time were the result of &quot;state formation&quot;/&quot;state making&quot;. Remember, for most of post-Roman history the centralized state as we imagine didn&#39;t exist. It was an overlapping series of domains where rulers claimed varying levels of sovereignty. Katznelson and Barkey argue that the Jews were expelled in England as a compromise between the royalty and the nobility in the process of state formation (primarily, the nobility owned Jewish bankers a tremendous amount of money, as Jews often formed the only source of credit). In France, they argue that they were expelled for a different reason (I believe because the King owed them money, but I can&#39;t be sure). But in both cases, though the exact reasons were different, the expulsion of the Jews was part of the same process of state formation, a result of negotiations around the clashing interests of royalty and nobility. This pattern, they argue, is repeated in other states (Western and Northern Europe is generally seen at the vanguard of modern state formation in Europe--see Charles Tilly&#39;s epic Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992).
It&#39;s also worth mentioning that Jews were often the only available scapegoats. Many of the expulsions took place during plagues, especially in Germany, where Jews were often accused of poisoning wells. They were also often occurred after an accusation of blood libel. Historically, it&#39;s worth noting that blood libel accusation (which date back to at least the 12th century in Christian Europe) never occurred in the Islamic World until the 19th century, and even there, not coincidentally, the first several cases accusation were brought by Christians living under Ottoman Rule at the same there was expanding European influence in the Ottoman. But in general, the relationship with minority communities was different in the Ottoman World (much is made of &quot;dhimmi&quot; status, but there&#39;s a reason for that--especially in the Ottoman Empire, the &quot;millet system&quot; in both formal and informal forms was an important strategy for rule). In the Muslim World, Jews and Christians were often included alongside Muslims as (unequal) subjects in a way that they were not in Europe. Granted, even these limited rights were frequently violated, but this legal framework of (unequal) belonging provided the Jews (and minority Christians) with much more stability than they had in most of Europe of the same period. This situation remains essentially until nationalism arrives in the 19th century century.
Nationalism, the idea that the legitimacy of the state comes from its relationship with a titular &quot;nation&quot; (France is for the French, Germany for the Germans), generally dates only back to the French Revolution (this is the traditional starting date). There were of course other forms identity underlying the legitimacy of states before this--especially religion, as John Armstrong argues in Nations Before Nationalism, but this wasn&#39;t really nationalism in the sense that we see (a political demand for a Christian state for all the Christian, etc.). A few scholars--Philip Gorski, Liah Greenfeld, Anthony Marx--have argued, convincingly I think, that we should see nationalism as an Early Modern phenomenon, rather than entirely a Modern one (remembering that &quot;the Modern Era&quot; for political history is conventionally dated to around the French Revolution). Among these, Marx argues most convincingly that nationalism comes not just from union--gathering all the Rutherians into the Rutherian state--but from exclusion. He engages with three main examples (England, Spain, and France). In Spain, we see this process of expulsion--this Proto-Spanish nationalism--in the form of the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492 (and from Portugal in 1496). This sets the ground for the later Spanish nation state. Similarly, in France we see expulsions, but not of Jews. Rather, we see France kill and expel Protestants to create a purely Catholic realm (cf. St. Bartholomew&#39;s Day massacre in 1572). These sorts of expulsions were common during the European &quot;Wars of Religion&quot;. So nationalism, and the drive to create in theory culturally homogenous states, wasn&#39;t merely a process that affected the Jews, though it was a process that often affected the Jews. It&#39;s also worth noting that &quot;Jewish emancipation&quot;--Jew being able function as equal citizens--doesn&#39;t emerge until the French Revolution, and the question of whether Jews can really be members of the nation-state isn&#39;t settled until the 19th and 20th centuries (cf. the Dreyfus Affair in France, or the Nazi stripping of the rights of German Jews). Many of the expulsions of Jews (and Catholics and Protestants, etc.) that occur during the early Modern Period, Anthony Marx argues, should be seen as examples of emerging nationalism where cultural identity becomes tied to the polity (compare this to earlier empires which were inherently diverse).
So, therefore, recent social science works argues that 1) since Jews were the most common religious minority in Christian Europe, they were the ones most commonly persecuted against, 2) that a lot of the Medieval struggles around nationalism have to do with negotiations of elites around the beginnings of modern state formation/centralization, 3) I forgot to mention also the traditional answer of the late Medieval religious revival, including the Crusades, that ultimately led to the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, which mattered in some places (especially when tied to Blood Libel), just not the French and English cases I mentioned, 4) eventually the goal of religious homogeneity presaged the overall goal of cultural homogeneity of nationalism. Again, this is all primarily in Europe until the 19th century, though there were large populations of Jews in Anatolia, North Africa, Mesopotamia, Arabia, and Persia who were mostly unmolested. This, I think, is evidence that the repeated expulsion of the Jews is not necessarily something inherent in the Jews, but something (or several things) that characterized the relationship between Jewish minorities and Christian rulers during this period.
Edit: One final note. In the video, they often repeat the names of territories in a relatively short period. The reason for this is Jews were expelled, here for either reasons related to Christian religious revival or debts due to state formation, and then were at times often quickly let back in for economic reasons (i.e. the state needed lines of credit that only the Jews could provide in this period), and then quickly expelled either for economic reasons again (rulers had quickly racked up debt) or because of a deal with religious revivalists. But the reasons they were let back in hints at one of the reasons they were expelled.</p>
