But thats not the point, the stories are what trump wants to discredit and they want to wrap every news agency who is covering the russia story into it.</p>

<p>Dont buy it. I have seen multiple posts from trump fans, telling everyone to blindly follow trump and to not watch the news. There was a post here that one trump fanatic literally said the Constitution and our forefathers are the problem and we need to have faith in trump.</p>

<p>This is getting ridiculous. CNN was wrong to attempt to doxx the donald meme guy but they are also not wrong about how bigoted and racist that guy was. The donald will tell you he is just a kid, but really does donalds allegiance produce racist little bigots like that. And I know we are siding on the side of internet freedom, but we are also siding with bigoted racism.</p>

<p>The_donald has infested this place. You know a conspiracy when you see one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No just no. Republicans got all the time in the world to propose amendments, in the end the ACA passed with republicans &quot;favorably&quot; they got to pass over 35 amendments to the bill. One of those amendments was the individual mandate that republicans cried foul about. 
 So not only was the ACA a bi partisan effort but many of the aspects of the ACA that republicans dont like were actually implemented by Republicans!!</p>

<p>Then after a couple years the Republicans run on a platform to repeal the ACA, it didnt work and Obama won his second term. which during this term the republicans forced a government shutdown because democrats wouldn&#39;t defund the healthcare bill they just passed!
<a href="https://progressiveandproud.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/another-acaobamacare-myth-no-negotiation-between-democrats-and-republicans-on-acaobamacare/">https://progressiveandproud.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/another-acaobamacare-myth-no-negotiation-between-democrats-and-republicans-on-acaobamacare/</a></p>

<p>Since then republicans have been hard lining repeal, even though democrats know it needs more work and needs to be done to address issues with the bill. Insurance companies have been watching this charade by the republicans which cast uncertainty in the insurance markets. Insurance companies bank on certainty, Republicans crying repeal, while democrats cry keep created an uncertain market for insurance companies. Would you buy a car that may or may not be illegal in the next 4 years? Of course not.</p>

<p>The Republicans have opened a self inflicted wound for a bill they favorably voted for and are now stuck with coming up with something better. What they came up with was a budget bill with tax cuts and does not provide additional healthcare, or even outlines any protections, additions, or rebates on current or future programs.</p>

<p>Destroying healthcare will be the Republicans legacy not Obamas. </p>

<p>Pence has a disgusting, backwards, bigoted attitude towards homosexuals. By condoning disgusting practices like conversion therapy, he was actively contributing to the mental deterioration of young men and women. I wish he would change his mind - I don&#39;t particularly care why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually no. This sub has become a default for the independents. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> used to be a good sounding board for us. We lean toward truth, and Trump has more truth going on his side then the establishment media. I used to love this sub for 9/11, UFOs and more conspiracy based stuff. After this election cycle politics became CTR and share blue, so many of us came here. It&#39;s sad that conspiracy became everyday politics and even worse that the supposed 4th branch of our government (the press), would rather lie for money then present the truth. </p>

<p>Go over to politics right now, there&#39;s something on people&#39;s belief in the Russia story, the top comment isn&#39;t about truth, it&#39;s about how the DNC can push the narrative better. It&#39;s talking points, that&#39;s not real people talking politics, that&#39;s people pushing an agenda. Please stop comparing people who sometimes agree with the right or the left, but really hate both as aligning with any group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife calls me Captain Bright-side because I hopelessly try to find the good part in like everything haha, so good on you. And as far as the &quot;mods are censoring&quot; shit, we can literally make no move that will not draw the same attention from some faction. So on the one side I really have no fucks to give. The CTR related ones are obviously the most virulently toxic. When I first joined on they said I would need thick skin, and I do, but the real hard part is the powerlessness in serving the sub&#39;s best interests (the way I see it) and not killing the freedom of what is being accomplished here. </p>

<p>So, it is a constant game of second guessing. And I don&#39;t feel like I am the brightest or most rational person around, so even I question ever move I make, and so often probably go too far in trying to serve fairness. The comments that say we protect the CTR shills are actually the most accurate. This is how it seems to end up, because they are more organized and disciplined in their strategy of interaction. They tiptoe around rules, and assist each other in manufacturing their synthetic consensus. They don&#39;t have to invest emotionally because it is just a job. So they have a much easier time walking in and out of contentious subjects because there is no emotional cost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your right, I came here during the election trying to avoid r/politics and their Clinton spam, the_donald banned me for asking questions. r/conspiracy had your choice of content hate it or love it.</p>

<p>I dont want any sub to limit the content, just people to understand the content they see. There have been alot of accusations and narratives thrown around and defaming an entire group of journalists simply because they are covering the Russia story is ridiculous. If I get into a debate the sources I used get called into question no matter the validity of the story, simply posting a WAPO story gets downgraded as naive or uninformed. Yet often times the rebuttal they provide is a youtube link to some random person or something a 4chan user brought up.</p>

<p>The one thing I love about this sub is that users do use sources and do know how to sift through the bullshit, but when an entire groups turns this sub into their brand of media and we lose control of the content we can see, then I have a problem with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because Trump has the largest team of paid internet shills and bots of any leader in history. </p>

<p>They seems to all target one place at a time to influence, seemingly beginning with 4Chan a couple years ago to begin forming their &quot;E-Army&quot; from the outcasts of society using simple picture / neurolinguistic programming. Add a dash of paid actors that look like they can related to the typical 4Chan user (or paid actors they find attractive) and you have brainwashed plenty of people that spend 20 hours a day online. </p>

<p>Then they moved to other outlets and used their new recruits to begin creating &quot;memes&quot; and spending their 20 hours online a day attacking, trolling, belittling, or otherwise converting the other outcasts of society. </p>

<p>This also explains why people from so many facets of the outer limits of fringe society supported Trump. The anime geeks, the hard right facists, the weirdos, the furries, etc. They were pulled the easiest because they are most dependant on something to cling to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has entirely missed the real issue, whether it&#39;s here or elsewhere. The way to change the narrative is to have things that are actually worth discussing. I recently subbed to t_d to see what exactly everyone here with posts like these keep referring to, you presented something &quot;controversial&quot; that actually appealed to my curiousity. I came to this sub because I like conspiracy, I like to hear all views, even if I disagree. However, there is zero to discuss about Trump and Russia colluding for the purposes of the election, as has been stated many times, even if he would&#39;ve done so, that in and of itself is not illegal anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, if only CNN would put as much energy into doxxing pedophiles instead of blindly dismissing it as &quot;fake news...&quot;</p>

<p>My point is, there is no justification for what CNN did.  Just because we may not agree with the person&#39;a post history, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s ok to doxx them.  Conversely, just because a person has bigoted posts on the internet, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re actually a bigot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair, and thanks for the input!  It&#39;s when situations escalate to using the label to justify harmful actions towards the individual, that&#39;s when I have issue.  For example, I have a friend (tall white and skinny) with a Jainist swastika scarification.  You better believe he&#39;s been persecuted for it ever since.  Most people say he gets what he deserves for trying to use a symbol like that, when it obviously could be mistaken for a Nazi swastika.  I like the idea of a world where we seek understanding, rather than assuming.</p>
