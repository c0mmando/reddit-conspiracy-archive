       buy a used laptop cash with fake disguise on. take the battery out.  take it to a place that's sealed from em. disassemble.  remove radio.  put battery back in.  install qubes on it or kali, offline.  reinstall radio or use external radio (alfa works) that you've also bought with cash/fake disguise.  disable radio explicitly from command line.  find open wifi, or get wifi password of nearby restaurant. go near there with disguise and without any other radios on your person or your conveyance, and try not to be visible to stuff. activate radio explicitly.  log into wifi.  send files to whom you want.  turn off radio.  turn off power.  get to safe place.  remove disguise.  drink beer.  ponder existence.

       just scrap the radio would be my guess..if you've used whonix to do your sending on (comes with qubes) then i dunno if the mac or system ids pass thru.  interesting question...some hard core sec guys would likely know

       Yeah, see, I'd assume cheap devices are easy enough to find.  Each machine has too many unexpected identifiers.  State entities have too many resources coming up with ways to extrude data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, dumping the radio should be enough as the hardware mac goes with it.  But if I had state secret level data, I'd take no chances.

       Before my time, people used Usenet to trade truths among peers.  Now it seems maybe making a meme and sharing it seem fastest. It also avoids any text keyword searches.  But of course, every spam in the world does the same.

       Not a bad idea. Also consider cascading / chaining VPNs, one for your host OS and another in your guest OS, then connect to tor, and for god's sake: encrypt everything, using a combination of algorithms ideally.

       In all likelihood the vpns would be useless if this was something that the nsa or cia trully wanted kept secret. The vpns are good for hiding from companies and low levels of enforcement agencies, but when you piss of the cia enough they will drop the hammer on you.  I would say on a day of drive to another major city like 2 hours away from where you live, buy a disposable device that the battery Is easily accessible and sit out a McDonald's and use the WiFi there to upload anything using all new profiles and preferably more secure ones with impossible to guess password, maybe use a good Swiss vpn but only if you can pay with an unreadable source just in case, but considering how everything is vulnerable to cia or nsa it may not actually help much as it is impossible to know if the company does or dosent keep logs, because if they do it is nearly guaranteed they will give you up so that they don't get shut down. Then dump the thing in a trash somewhere after removing the hard drive and trashing the internals beyond repair, like drive over it multiple times and then spill a coffee in it. Then take the drive and disassemble it and bassically grind the disks into dust. Then go home.

       I would agree using public wi-fi is a good idea, in this type of scenario, but can potentially reveal information regarding your physical location at the time and narrow down the number of suspects in regard to a leak investigation. Using a VPN and tor, in spite of having potential CIA or NSA exploits, can add another layer (or layers) of anonymity (which is never guaranteed, under any circumstances). Using a private VPN (a foreign-based VPN with no US extradition treaty that does not keep logs) connected to a public VPN (with a static IP used by multiple users) then connected to tor can significantly reduce the odds of a hostile actor or adversary being able to trace your IP back through one, let alone two or much less likely all of those sources while increasing your odds of maintaining anonymity, which again can never be guaranteed but rather improved significantly when proper measures are taken. Ideally, one should do all of the above, and yeah physically destroying the device would help. You can microwave the hard drive, hold a neodymium or speaker magnet up to it, then drop it from a two (or higher) story building to physically destroy the drive platter. That should, I would think, get the job done. If not, then maybe also chuck it in the ocean (or a sufficiently deep lake / river).

       See that is why you should go to another very large city somewhat far away, and leaving all credit cards and other personal devices at home. I wouldn't want to bring the hard drive back with me, and staying in a hotel would be a bad idea because it would be able to prove that you had been there. So I would say disassemble the drive using a screwdriver, or better yet get puppy Linux installed on a usb and remove the hard drive ahead of time and just smash the drive and flush it down a toilet.

       Also not a bad idea, using a flash drive to boot with, and using a hardened linux distro of your choice, connected to a vpn, running tails or another hardened linux distro also connected to a vpn and tor in a vm, while encrypting your files within encrypted files using multiple apps and algorithms (for redundancy).

       That could be a bad idea if the data is very secret and whoever you expose would really want to find you, if there is a chance that your fingerprints or any indication of who you are at all may be on the laptop it would probably be better to basically destroy the thing completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically if you leave it for it to get stolen there Is very slim chance that it could bit you in the ass, probably less than one percent if you did everything else right, it is better to turn it into fine powder and make sure that the device is gone for good and at least the device itself won't lead anyone to you because you left a clue of some sort on it.

       Correct - MAC/Device IDs are a link layer protocol.

       I should have clarified, I am indeed operating under the assumption that —precluding the possible use of TOR—
       <strong>
        the originating LAN will in eventuality be traced.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, this mental exercise is predicated on the OP's postulated, hypothetical scenario of wishing to publicize evidence of a vast conspiracy of unparalleled societal import. A corollary of which is the existence a determined adversary, possessed of (unrealistically) limitless resources and motivation to track down our bold tergiversator; despite them having taken the usual precautions of hiding behind 7 proxies, or 7 genders, etc prior to them uploading this earth-shattering video.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose a way around having to make any provisions w/r/t to safeguarding the MAC address, would be to upload the video and then simply snag the
       <em>
        Starbucks Free WiFi™
       </em>
       router and proceed to leave the store at a high rate of speed —LOL

       I suppose, again, that it depends on whether they are anticipating his uploading it. Further, do they know who he is already? Is he a whistleblower who stole some files from the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another question is if he does upload them, will they need proof that he did it in order to take action against him? Can they fabricate that evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they don't know the data was stolen, and they don't know who the guy is, and they have to retaliate by legal means, just use tor. If he answered yes to any of these questions, then uploading may not be such a good idea.

       If it is for a simple upload of a video to the web than a cell phone would possibly be a better idea. Find a cheap android that can have the battery removed from it by just removing the case, just sit in a car outside the coffee shop pullout the phone and upload the files. If you find one that can plug a usb drive into it then you just by the device, remove the battery, drive to WiFi source, turn on phone, upload files of usb or sdcard, remove battery, destroy phone and discard of it. A cheap disposable cell can be cheaper than a laptop, in fact I think they sell disposable ones at 7-11, but I would look them up first to make sure the batterys could be removed.

       Be sure to cover up any cameras on phone - and don't speak while the thing is powered on. Also make sure to use a Wifi AP that you don't need to sign in to in any way.

      <p>
       Also you should wear a disguise while driving, and use different license plates. You should be driving a car made in the 1970's or early 80's.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your way home, you need to find somewhere (near home ideally), so you can change your license plates back. This will prevent from your false plates being visible on the way back to your home.

Also if you have someone at your house on your computer playing a game or on your phone accessing Facebook during these times you can use the timestamps of "your" activity as an alibi if something does get traced back to you...

       Whonix is an anonymity distro. Not a privacy distro. It's designed to mask your identity. It has no built in privacy capabilities. Further, while whonix is designed to protect anonymity, Qubes itself is not, nor are any of the other VMs that run in Qubes. Any of the other VMs that come preinstalled and not configured to be anonymous could easily break anonymity. Qubes is designed to compartmentalize, thus is a privacy distro, but running whonix on qubes does not protect anonymity. It's an extra layer of network privacy for qubes if needed. You can configure qubes an whonix to successfully protect privacy, but this requires a level of skill and knowledge far beyond the capability of someone asking how to post anonymous videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tails, being amnesic, and only allowing outbound connections over tor, is a privacy and anonymity distro. Anyone who has to ask should be pointed to this distro.

       Not with todays internet. But you could mail a 100x USBs to philosophy professors and various student groups. As well as local newspaper of complete backwater towns. The backwater papers are the least controlled and while higher learning organizations are compromised there are quite a few criminology, philosophy and history professors across the spectrum who are purposely muted or ignored - they are the best ones. They get to

       All the answers I've seen so far focus on distributing the footage. But even if you could do that with perfect anonymity, the footage itself is a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be endogenously identifying, if for example your identity could be deduced from where you too it and when (or the height of the camera or your voice in the background or your hair blowing into frame or a distinctive ring or watch or shoe in the shot, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, more likely, the metadata added by your device could give you away. Obviously that's a problem with phones, but even film cameras might leave traces that could connect the film to your device. I don't know if there are purposeful markers, like those they caught that NSA leaker with, but even just little physical variations can fingerprint a device. I think that's how they match bullets to the guns that fired them, with unique and naturally occurring marks left by worn firing pins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there's so much to think about, all I'd say is that you have to remember that anonymity starts
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       distribution. Think about how you capture and scrub the footage, too.

       Makes sense. Buy the VCR used in another town, then get rid of it. (I have no idea if that's at all necessary, I'm just thinking about extreme precautions.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not going to help with endogenous identifying factors though, like if the perspective on the tape identifies you.

       So it doesn't phone-home without you knowing and thereby revealing your location. While mostly well-known on mobile devices/phones, it is probably a risk too on laptops. Mobile phones can be accessed by authorities even when appearing to be turned off(!) (seriously, this is going back to at least since the 90s). Most modern phones you can't even take out the battery anymore and therefore you newer know for sure if it is switched off (pto-tip: it isn't)
      </p>
      <p>
       My current (modern) laptop has a second battery inside that can't be taken out. It is easy to notice this because I can take out the primary battery while the machine is running and it will keep on running.. So, like the mobile phones, you never know if this laptop is capeable of phoning home or somehoe be accessed even when turned off or somehow revealing your location (by accessing wifi or 3G towers etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also why you shouldn't bring a mobile phone on the trip, way too risky of revealing your location.

       A large part of this is in weighing the potential personal consequences vs what good it may bring to the greater good. Can't be 100% it'll ever be safe. Dont always know what technology they have to work with. That said it may be deemed the honourable thing just to risk your liberty and safety in order to help a much larger number.
