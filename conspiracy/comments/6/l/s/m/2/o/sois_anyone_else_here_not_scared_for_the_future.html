       Edit: I think people are misunderstanding this whole thing... What I'm saying is that not only do we have to bring our attention to the bad in the world, so we can make change, but ALSO the good in the world as well, which I felt was being ignored and had to be addressed because I'm tired of seeing videos and posts about how they've "lost faith in humanity" and "it's just getting worse".
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like people are overreacting a little bit...I'm reading the comments here on r/conspiracy and I'm seeing people talking about how our world (or more often, the United States) is going rapidly downhill, or that they are scared and afraid about the next 30 years on a range of situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else here think that the world we live in today is actually improving and getting better?
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this shit about millennials and younger generations being ruined and brainwashed and whatnot... I agree to that to an extent, but I think people are perceiving it as being worse than it actually is. For example, I was on YouTube about a year ago, and I was watching this man talk about why he decided to homeschool his 8 y/o twin boys. He said that he didn't want his boys giving Valentine's day cards to other boys (and girls) in school, thinking that is was some type of "perversion and emasculation of boys", being done by the female school teachers who he assumed were single-mother feminists. And then he got upset because they had to spell "soybean" on a spelling test (thinks that the school system is trying to fill them up with estrogen or some shit), got a peice of homework about different types of communication that involved cell phones, computers (emails, texting etc), and some kids were saying "don't judge me". When I commented on his thoughts (not going against him, just putting my thoughts) he put me off because "I'm younger than him and I've fallen for society's agenda". Like come on.. it's a bit disheartening to think that people feel like they can't take the younger generations seriously anymore as if we lack the ability to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, I hate public school too, its horrible. I should know I recently left to homeschool myself my senior year and ended up graduating early, but I don't think that the public school system is out to get our children that directly, you know? And with all the new transparency about the modern school system more people are opting out, which like I said, IS AN IMPROVEMENT, RIGHT?
      </p>
      <p>
       And when it comes to foreign policies and politics, there's this giant "Us! vs Them!" mentality going around, especially with political parties like it's so-and-so's fault things are going wrong, it's really annoying. Calling someone a bigoted conservative or a snowflake libertard doesn't do anything, just saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear people talk about social media like its some invisible laser beam that melts your brain cells no matter how or what you use it for. It can and is being used unfairly, but it also has it's pros. Many alt-media sites are using Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to grab their audience, along with the spread of information like the recent #CNNBlackmail and other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with this all being said, are there bad things happening in this world? Yes of course no doubt. But there is a good side to all of this, don't forget. Pedogate is gaining popularity and people are being arrested, the medical industry can't keep up with recovering holistic health information, the deep state is being exposed, full disclosure is on the rise, and lots of other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I stated before, most people who have this pessimistic POV are (usually, not always) much older than I am, so I can understand the disconnect or if this doesn't make any sense to anyone else...
      </p>
      <p>
       Look...all I'm saying is that if you feel like the world is going to shit no matter what, that people don't talk face-to-face anymore because of technology, or that Satan and his little demons are on the run, why not take a moment to assess and reconsider? I would hate for people to be angry at the world and have little to no faith in humanity.

       Just like how human beings are dying from the moment we are born, the world has been dying since it started. There's no reason to be paranoid or worried about the future because we really can't control what happens to world but a nuclear world war, supervolcano, giant meteor, global warning, etc could kill us at anytime. The world likely won't end(for humanity) during our lifetimes but it could. I say just do your best for yourself and family and not be so scares for the future.

       Humans are playing god too much and altering the world. The abundance of chemicals in our life's is what is going to kill off our species (and possibly all life on the planet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the school, I do believe there is an LGBT agenda going on. Testosterone levels have dropped across Europe and USA while the water has estrogen from the pill in it. I wonder what happens when male hormones drop and females hormones rise inside the male body. Wonder what happens to females when they have extra estrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human race is fucked. As for social media, far too much manipulation and brainwashing on them. Everything is a distraction from us finding out the truth.

       Yes and no. Something was always going to happen to this planet. It was up to us to use our intelligence and conciousness to get off the planet and survive the ending of Earth. Instead we are fucking about far too much with the planet which  we are going to suffer from.

       TPTB won't allow us to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human life has been constructed in a way that makes it difficult for people to break through the system and to correct the flaws we have made as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Copyright law screws over too many people (inventors.) Then there is chemicals in EVERYTHING! GMO's. Vaccinations. Brainwashing by using media and wrong hertz being used for the human brain. FPS on tv's and monitors increasing to slide in subliminal messaging. And that's not even going into the wars for money and energy...
      </p>
      <p>
       No, there isn't much we can do except either play their game, or don't play it. The people that don't play have a lower chance of survival. Those that do play the game just get used and abused.

       I am honestly only a few years older than you are, and have had similar thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly the truth is like what many have said here already. We are caged. We are not allowed to reach a full potential, because we have no freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legally in America you can't even collect rain water. What does that tell the average American? Well it would tell them we are being enslaved, but most people are to busy trying to work a dead end job. Based on a useless currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think with the removal of capitalism our future could be very bright. Local gardens that don't use pesticides etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the people really rock, and push this cage over we may never get out. I believe it will take tremendous force of will, and swift action to save humanity. Till then we are just "Citizens" AKA slaves.

       How do they enforce this illegal rainwater collecting thing? I heard about it when I was living in CA a few years ago but from what I could tell the cops in LA weren't  very concerned about it lol

       The issue as I see it is that no one is addressing the true causes to a lot of our problems. That's why I fear for our future. Until people stop what they are currently doing, where they pass of blame and responsibility. When people never accept and deal with the consequences of their actions it can have wide reaching, unintended consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently everyone is fighting over whether or not to repeal or replace or just alter the ACA. In that discussion we are ignoring how the drug companies gouge us with unfair prices that cause the necessity of health insurance. No one is talking about fixing drug pricing and the monopoly the drug companies have on our health care industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is just an example, but this happens in all avenues of our life, where people fight over aspects of a problem but never really want to change the underlying, broken system that makes it impossible to come up with the right answer.

       Cons: environmental disastor, nuclear weapons.

       Possible Pros: A.I. quantum computing, universal basic income.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to see how things can get better with regards to nuclear weapons, but hear me out. If we somehow agree on a simultaneous worldwide disarmament it is very possible that we will never make them again because there is no incentive. They were only developed because people feared Nazi germany was developing them. In fact it is one of histories greatest ironies that the "good"  side of  WWII made the most destructive weapon.

       Sometime in the near future, wars akin to WW3 will erupt. The US will hopefully collapse. It'll at least be severly damaged. Russia will be more damaged than China because that's where the US' focus will be. Then the most powerful political forces in the world will be China, the EU and maybe some Iranian axis. Wars bring misery. And rebuilding after wars will certainly be a pain, and then there will be all the conflicts between the future world's powers. If you're speaking from a US citizen's point of view, you will likely find many hardships. Conflict between humans will exist for the forseable future. It's the state of reality. Whether you want to accept it or be scared from it is your choice.

       I think that the thoughts you've expressed are the intentions of tptb, because the way they view the future is so powerful, viewing the future as you see it removes power.  When they talk about things like the law of attraction or creating your own destiny, it makes sense that rich and powerful possess those skills but also are selfish enough to want to keep those secrets from you. How you view the future is the true secret.

       The Empire is strong. The ruling people/corporations understand the real issues. They are working to lower the US quality of life/expectations, they continue to provide monsters to instill people with fear so they are easily manipulated, the media distorts and refuses to tell people the truth, or even better supports a false narrative, the global population will be lowered, and non-governmental/transnational bureaucracy will be beyond the reach of citizens if they were somehow to challenge the system. The surveillance society will engender fear and control. People will be happy to comply. Relax, everything is fine. The more you struggle the more you will be unhappy. The Empire is strong.

       For things to get 'better', we have to get rid of the evil/negative/ignorance vise that's on the planet. If a majority of the population on the planet could 'come together' en masse, I think it's possible. Otherwise we'll have to go through some shit.

       Getting 'positive' is easier said than done. More people are prone to be 'negative' than positive. The 'hate' out there is real.

       Fear is how it's done. It sets us up for simple minded thought. It sets us up to fight or flee, but the beliefs we have about the invulnerability of our enemies causes some of us to go right into submission mode. It looks like despair and apathy, inaction, rhetorical justifications for inaction and crab bucket rhetoric that attacks those trying rise out of the slavery.

       Disempowerment is the goal. Then we tacitly consent to what the elites want for us all.

       So are you saying that TPTB main goal is to get people to feel hopeless, so that it gives the elites have more power? And people like me, who are willing to stand up and fight back, are conflicting with their intentions?
