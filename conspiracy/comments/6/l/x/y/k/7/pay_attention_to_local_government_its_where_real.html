        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most of us are powerless at stopping (or even marginally disrupting) federal government corruption. We can gain no audience without organizing a large movement; even then we face numerous dangers. Tptb will use everything from agent provocateurs to mass msm propaganda to negatively distort the goals of an otherwise legitimate cause.</p>

<p>I recently attended a zoning commission hearing in my community. The commission was trying to rezone agricultural land for a very shady land deal to put in track homes, even though there are two new developments that aren&#39;t selling at the original estimated prices. Most of the commission members are real estate brokers and city councilors who stand to gain financially from approving the deal.</p>

<p>My outspoken opinion at the meeting resulted in me being yelled at (literally) by the chairman of the commission, who then closed the meeting to the public. Despite my frustration, several people were inspired by my zeal and were disturbed by how outraged the commission was at my legitimate and logical concerns.</p>

<p>In response, several people have since formed a group to play watchdog over our local government, and to ensure someone is always in attendance at public meetings to call BS.</p>

<p>The proposed housing project has since been shut down after the group spread awareness about the deal, raised enough public outcry, and even threatened legal action.</p>

<p>We have power in our own communities. Local representatives and elected officials are not above the law, and they can be held accountable in person, in front of an audience of citizens.</p>

<p>This is the real power of democracy, and it brought this cynic some much needed hope to know that regular people can still generate change. If you care about truth and justice, get involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked in a company that was getting a lot of complaints. So, the management decided to open a complaint section online. The section was closed off to the general public and general customers, but if you wanted to make complaint, you&#39;d be told how to find it.</p>

<p>You could go there and post a thread and complain to your hearts content. People could be in wholehearted agreement and fully support you. But it meant nothing. It was a cathartic outlet. It gave you the chance to air grievances, but no way to address them. Management never saw the complaints but they kept people from going to a real means of having them addressed.</p>

<p>In my province, first we are required to adhere to Agenda 21, the queen, the federal government and the provincial government. By the time the local government gets a say, the say is co-opted within the strict bounds of the overriding government, Queen and UN. You can squirm a little to the left or right but cannot actually change anything.</p>

<p>It gives you an outlet, a cathartic release that will never bother those that actually rule and prevent those complaints from reaching the ears of most.</p>

<p>Kafka wrote a book called The Trial and a short story featuring just this idea. </p>

<p>FTFY</p>

<p>And term limits != tenure limits. A term is what the law says it is. A Senator&#39;s term of office is six years. If she gets re-elected, she is a two-term Senator. If people would stop wishing for the unicorn of <del>term</del> tenure limits and ride the horse they already have — regular elections — we might get somewhere. I think you should serve as many terms as people will let you. As long as you can beat all comers in free and fair elections, with no big money donations and as little incumbent advantage as can be worked out, you can serve til they carry you out feet first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is part of the reason why I hate the whole &#39;state&#39;s rights&#39; or &#39;leave it to the states, not the government.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;States&#39; doesn&#39;t mean &#39;people of the states&#39;, it means state governments. They have a history of oppressing their own people, and some continue to do so. State boundaries are drawn like fucking Africa, and 2/3rds of them were not a thing prior to the US government; just lines on a map. The rural-urban divide is greater than and cultural shift on a straight line that ignores mountains and rivers.</p>

<p>State governments should not be held to a standard different to the standard we hold the federal government, and people&#39;s rights will always be more important than state&#39;s rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone that wants states rights wants them specifically because we know politicians become corrupt. Its much easier to canvas your own state to petition a problem. If it gets bad enough you can run and have a genuine chance at being electedas a state rep, mayor, alderman, even governor if you really try... Whereas you have probably 0 chance of being elected president and a very slim chance of being elected as a house rep.... Its much easier to influence local government and take part in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly believe that it&#39;s seriously the best thing one can do. Only when the power vested in the government is unchecked the corruption spreads. If they know that citizens are careless, they&#39;ll get power hungry and shoot for the stars. </p>

<p>John and Ken radio show in LA, they&#39;re very outspoken about anything mayor garcetti does and are exceptional in rounding up support, mainly because they&#39;re great at talking. They grill the shit out of every politician who comes on and won&#39;t let them skip the questions... And most questions come from the listeners who are concerned. Be involved, and also be a voice-hopefully a charismatic one- for the people. If your arguments align it&#39;s good; if you can include the citizens&#39; concerns in with yours, it&#39;s even better. But this takes a lot of effort which most people need time for that they do not possess. You&#39;ll sacrifice until enough ppl like you get on board, then the responsibility is shared and less strenuous. 
Best of luck and great effort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice that you had positive results. </p>

<p>I joined the parent-teacher organization at my kids&#39; school, and found out the previous pto had &quot;misplaced&quot; $22,000. Hired a firm to do a forensic audit, but the school administration handed over copies of all of the evidence to the former pto members and basically said &quot;clean this up, we want justification for these expenses/missing money.&quot; </p>

<p>So they ended up fining the former treasurer $2000 because she had racked up that much in bank fees (now, mind you, this woman had an IQ of about 85. Couldn&#39;t figure out the excel spreadsheet they kept the records with, so she just stopped using it and started throwing receipts in a box. She was the only one penalized despite being pushed to take the position which she and everyone else knew she was too stupid to do effectively. Not trying to be mean, she just couldn&#39;t keep a budget. I don&#39;t think she should have been held responsible. The people who put her there should&#39;ve been culpable.)</p>

<p>The rest of the pto officers were helping themselves to $600 gas cards on the regular under the auspices of &quot;doing pto work.&quot; These are volunteer positions - you don&#39;t get compensated for your time or the use of your vehicle. They would buy elaborate decorations and party supplies and then instead of reusing them the next year, they would use them at home. I could go on and on. If there was some way for them to pilfer money from the inflated budget, they would.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were line items for things like $1000 to each of the school&#39;s libraries, $300 to each elementary school teacher for classroom supplies...that were never doled out. Educational priorities were abandoned, all they did was run shit-ass candy fundraisers and sugar-laden junk food parties for the schools while dipping into the coffers as much as they could get away with.</p>

<p>School district insisted upon covering it up. Threatened our real estate resale values, gave us shit about damaging the school&#39;s reputation. Having kids in the district with years left before graduation, one treads lightly and chooses one&#39;s battles. It never made the press.</p>

<p>Seeing that corruption at even the lowest levels of &quot;government&quot; just put the cherry on top for me. Change the system from within? Yeah....no. Fuck that noise. I just don&#39;t have the kind of energy necessary to fight corruption, stupidity, and apathy at every fucking level of the system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tuned in, turned on and quite intentionally dropped out. </p>

<p>I was so jaded, I took my kids out of school and home schooled for years. The Great Lice Cover-up of Aught-eight also played heavily into that decision, but that is a story for another day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like my hometown.
There&#39;s an alderman who is a pedophile. After a lot of local outrage, his case was brought before a grand jury. Thing is, the charges the D.A. pushed were ones that had passed the statute of limitations. The GJ couldn&#39;t indict because of it and he is still free to molest kids.</p>

<p>To make things worse, the pedometer apparently also has some sort of blackmail material against the mayor. In a televised city council meeting where they were considering a motion to censure,  he was overheard telling the mayor &quot;be careful what you say&quot;,after which the mayor moved to eliminate several of the points of censure.</p>

If it gets bad enough you can run and have a genuine chance at being electedas a state rep, mayor, alderman, even governor if you really try... Whereas you have probably 0 chance of being elected president and a very slim chance of being elected as a house rep.... Its much easier to influence local government and take part in it.</p>
