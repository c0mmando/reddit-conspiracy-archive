    <div class="md"><p>I am not OP, but this is exactly what I am getting at. Hunting, fishing, hiking. Shoot, just go for a walk, take your dog if you have one. Even better, do it barefoot. There is like an shared intimacy with the world when you go barefoot that is hard to describe. It feels good.</p>

<p>I work out all the time, and I am a barefoot runner. Actually I am running home from work in about 5min here. It is like 115F outside haha, but I kinda trapped myself at work without a car. So I guess I am going to get to see what I am made of today.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got nothing against people who hunt, it&#39;s natural after all, but personally I&#39;d only kill an animal if It was a survival situation (which I have done before in mock situations); Rather avoid it if I&#39;ve got meat in the fridge.</p>

<p>I definitely feel it&#39;s something primal lost. I do work out, weight lifting, jogging through the woods and calisthenics 5 days a week.</p>

<p>I used to write when I was younger, 11/12/13/14, and I am thinking of picking it back up. My imagination is still working fine but I need to relearn the technical side as my writing ability decayed heavily over 10+ years of lazy typing. Maybe I&#39;ll try camping solo again and take some paper.</p>

<p>We lost communication with the people living in our neighborhoods, towns and cities. Cell phones and social media is replacing face-to-face communication which builds relationships. This is how poor people live in the hood, everyone knows everyone, if you run out of sugar or milk you can ask your neighbors, in rich communities most people probably don&#39;t even know their neighbors names. Society functions best when people interact and work together as one tribe or one people.</p>

<p>Yeah I feel like the people In poor/rough areas are actually the ones with the most potential for ability and decency. Unfortunately the areas they live in are usually diseased, which stunts or eliminates this potential for most.
Coming from one of these backgrounds I have always had more in common with the poor, homeless and broken. </p>

That&#39;s a very broad umbrella statement to make about them. Maybe LSD but mushrooms? No. They grow in nature. You can&#39;t design that. </p>

<p>Alot of these success stories usually cause many casualties. The large corporate industries for example. Want cheap clothes in bulk? Sure, but we will exploit anyone who can&#39;t defend themselves and poison the earth in countries that won&#39;t stop us; Want cheap food and more than you need?

    <div class="md"><p>Modern humans are akin to a Cub Scout troop minding the firearms superstore over the weekend while the adults are away. Eventually the bullies tie up the geeks and artists so they don&#39;t get in the way of their mayhem. And if one of geeks or artists gets caught in the crossfire, well, it&#39;s a big-boy game, and you&#39;re not invited to play. </p>

<p>Elders may not possess anything beyond having attaining a higher level of understanding from enduring change, hardship, or simply being witness to events and consequences. I&#39;m not &quot;elder&quot; yet, but as an older gen x member I grew up with no internet - not even voicemail or call waiting. I could take a shit or rub one out in peace. When work was over, there was time and a little bit of money for fun. No ubiquitous snooping, no midnight email, and if you wanted to meet people, you did it in meatspace. </p>

<p>I&#39;m far from a Luddite. I&#39;ve always made my living using technology - if the web collapsed today I&#39;d have to find a new occupation. My point is that I have perspective and a tangible connection to a radically different way of living. </p>

<p>A sample of the events that have informed my own perspective:</p>

<p>I watched my parents and the rest of their chemically  addled peers destroy everything decent their parents built in this country. I also watched as that generation turned a blind eye to systemic injustice or made it worse. </p>

<p>I remember Reagan gutting state mental institutions and the resulting homeless population. I watched him gut unions by firing the air traffic controllers. </p>

<p>I remember an entire generation of gay men die off while Reagan and the boomers passed moral judgements and wiped off toilet seats with antimicrobials in case a gay man had used it and left AIDS behind. </p>

<p>I saw the NEA gutted, which resulted in promising young artists reduced to pulling espresso shots for rich art collectors&#39; lattes. </p>

<p>I watched Desert Storm on a new 24-hour news network called CNN. Every hour I saw through the camera on the tip of a smart bomb the last moments of ordinary people&#39;s lives. </p>

<p>I watched Clinton live on TV when he signed the crime bill, media consolidation, welfare reform, harsh sentencing, and his wife&#39;s infamous &quot;predators brought to heel&quot; speech. </p>

<p>I watched 9-11 live on TV and knew it was bullshit and stood in shock while millions of dumbfounded dipshits happily gave up their rights and freedoms to a silver spooned cowboy from Connecticut. </p>

<p>I watched the march to war in Iraq and knew that was all bullshit, too. I watched the civilian body count grow from thousands to hundreds of thousands. I watched when they pulled Saddam out of a hole and I watched him swing at the end of a rope, the last few pennies of the $5 billion the US gave him years earlier clattering onto the floor. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen medical miracles become normal, and incredibly selfless acts of kindness and heroism. </p>

<p>For those in their 20&#39;s, living under a permanent microscope is their unimaginable normal. Every action can be recalled in HD to use against them for the rest of their lives, from their first login to their last. My 13 year-old has a phone and is already plugged into a very adult world. My wife and I can track everything he does. </p>

<p>Part of childhood is supposed to be the freedom to just &quot;be&quot; - without supervision. His normal is going to be even more fucked up than that of the 20-somethings reading this. I&#39;m guessing that the childhood I described sounds either antique or unimaginable. In many ways it was worse. But in terms of intellectual and personal freedom, it&#39;s unimaginable that we&#39;ve been reduced to interacting with an entertaining slave collar, a revolutionary new way of being alone. </p>

<p>Life itself is dangerous in big and small ways, but good judgement comes from experience, which comes from making bad judgements. Sometimes these bad judgements result in injury or death. Not all baby turtles make it to the sea. That&#39;s just part of the human condition. </p>

<p>Bringing this ramble back full circle, the village has a collective memory of skills, experiences, and perhaps most importantly, warnings that are lost. When young adults look around and wonder what&#39;s missing from their seeming full lives, a village would know what they seek and could help them find it, and in doing so, uphold the inherent humanity of everyone. </p>

Look at all of the dysfunction in the world that could be avoided if we brought people up with practical knowledge and benevolent mentoring in a community environment not tied to dogma or exoteric religion.

Before we advanced mentally to survive in harsh environments and deal with threats that our bodies alone couldn&#39;t overcome.

I was smoking a few weeks ago and I looked at the ashtray and just thought &quot;Man that looks fucking horrible&quot;. Then I started thinking about the fact that stuff was raping my lungs. I&#39;m brought a Vap and started jogging. God, 5 minutes of jogging and I feel like I am going to die. Haven&#39;t cut down much yet but hopefully soon.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go to the Darkside lol. I gave up smoking for a month a few years ago. It became so easy after the first 2 weeks. I really should have stuck with it but I lost my resolve and decided I would rather smoke than be healthy. Priorities have changed now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very common for people on the edge of &#39;waking up&#39; to feel incomplete like this. The feeling comes from the mind, which is separate from your consciousness. Most people exist almost entirely within the mind. They tend to be guided by emotions and seek happiness externally. They self-anesthetize to avoid looking at shame and other repressed issues. If you watch a lot of tv, play a lot of video games, obsess over exercise, smoke a lot of weed, or anything similar, you&#39;re probably in this trap.  </p>

<p>Western cultures in particular are prone to &#39;sleeping.&#39; Our society encourages personal isolation and reflexive thought over intuition, which keeps many of us trapped like children in a self-centered universe. That little ache you&#39;re feeling will never go away as long as you are trapped within your mind and cut off from larger existence. </p>

<p>There are lots of ways to wake up. Buddhism is a little dense and religious for my taste, but that&#39;s what it&#39;s made to do. Hallucinogens will get you there but usually don&#39;t last long. I used neither. I read a lot of Jung, went out into nature, and started paying attention to the way my mind and thoughts worked. After a while, I grew distant enough from the whole process that I took the step back into simple consciousness. It&#39;s a beautiful moment. You come to understand that the only way to stop feeling dissatisfied is to stop seeking satisfaction. Shame disappears. You move through the world in a different way. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what worked for me, anyways. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the answer for everyone. Whatever you can do to get in touch with your community or nature will likely help. I hope you find a solution. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You&#39;re proving my point. They&#39;re culturally-incompatible ingrates who don&#39;t care about free speech. But hey, it&#39;s more Irish than the Irish to not drink Guinness, protest free speech, and cut the clits off of little girls.</p>

<pre><code>Do you even know what proportion of our population is foreign born or first gen?
</code></pre>

<p>Why are you even asking this if it doesn&#39;t matter? You&#39;re hedging.</p>

<p>Stop being such a pussy and acknowledge that you will have failed your country if it&#39;s nothing but brown-skined, brown-eyed, brown-haired muslims. That&#39;s not Ireland, that&#39;s a shithole that&#39;s part of the Muslim world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world</a></p>

<p>Oh weird, it&#39;s like the opposite of this list: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where-to-be-born_Index#2013_rankings">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where-to-be-born_Index#2013_rankings</a></p>

<p>Seriously, stop being such a fucking cuck. I&#39;m on the left, but I understand that demographics is destiny. You gain nothing by displacing Irish people.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re not open minded for shit. Don&#39;t try and play that game. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to post links. Sam Harris disproves himself with his half truth garbage; the guy thinks its a great idea to bomb Middle Eastern children whilst claiming his people have a moral highground, and you&#39;re telling me I should bother with scrub-tier intellectuals like him. </p>

<p>Chomsky DESTROYED him; I don&#39;t need to take Harris seriously. 
The fact that you do proves you just like confirmation bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re talking about magic - or at least the magic the ancient world seems to have had or just by coincidence all believed in and practiced. We have three parts - Mind, Body, Spirit. We call it our subconscious when something happens and our mind didn&#39;t do it. But it&#39;s our spirit. Get in touch with your spirit. Go outside, close your eyes and imagine all the energy, particles, waves, etc that is surrounding you. Then inhale, but don&#39;t just inhale into your lugs, inhale with every particle in your body and focus on pulling everything into you. breathe in the universe. let it flow through you. </p>

<p>Just know, your mind, body, and spirit all grow like a plant. Try and grow towards the light, not towards the darkness. </p>

<p>Say what you will about this. But the truth about the world is simple. God exists, an so does the devil. We have an elite that worships evil because the truth is when you pray to the devil he answers back - but it&#39;s twisted lies given to foolish people who seek power in a world that is but a blink of the eye. But God answers too! And his word isn&#39;t twisted, it&#39;s given to you the way you need it. The trick is, figuring out how to listen to what he says. </p>

<p>&quot;Ask and you shall receive&quot; as the old line goes. </p>

<p>In conclusion - Be kind, when kindness flows from you, it must also flow back to you. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t go to the Darkside lol. I gave up smoking for a month a few years ago. It became so easy after the first 2 weeks. I really should have stuck with it but I lost my resolve and decided I would rather smoke than be healthy. Priorities have changed now.</p>
