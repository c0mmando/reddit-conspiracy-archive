        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was just discussing the Flat Earth psyop in another post, and we made what I believe is a very interesting discovery. The other user had pointed out that the FE astroturf campaign really didn&#39;t take off around here until around January of this year. I entered that criteria in to Google Trends, and sure enough he was right:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/N2Hoosq.png">https://i.imgur.com/N2Hoosq.png</a></p>

<p>This kinda tickled something at the back of my mind, it bore a striking resemblence to something else we have seen kicked around here a great deal. So, I added that to my comparison and we get this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zzczM1n.png">https://i.imgur.com/zzczM1n.png</a></p>

<p>That was a little bit of an eye opener. I am sure most of us are familiar with the comparison that has been made in the past with Fake News as the other data point, so I decided to add that and see what we get:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4vLRC49.png">https://i.imgur.com/4vLRC49.png</a></p>

<p>I dunno about you guys, but I think we know where the Flat Earth initiative came from now. They originally tried to put a smoke screen over it with Fake News, and it appears that was not having the effect they desired. So a little while later they decided to try to frame us all as crazy Flat Earthers, I mean how could anyone who thinks the earth is flat be taken seriously about anything else? This is shady AF.</p>

<p>This ties in with another observation I made the other day, that since this CNN situation got fired up we have seen virtually no Flat Earth posts around here. People familiar with the regular ebb and flow of this sub know that we typically get several of those posts around here a day, or we were up until fairly recently.</p>

<p>So based on this I posit that the same people that are trying to control the CNN blackmail narrative are the ones that perpetrated the Flat Earth psyop on us.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Edit: I decided to run some more search terms for fun. </p>

<p>And then I thought maybe Syria would be cool. But google has now flatlined results for Flat Earth:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s a widespread, secret organized takedown in play.  these subjects, imo, are designed to make people actually think about the problem domain and to recognize that many of the assumptions they&#39;ve taken as fact because the Hero of Science has told us, were rooted in bad experiment design, or based on flawed science in general.  timed so as to wake up a predictable number.  staggered so as to keep that cohort cohesive.  and ordered in a narrative way that leads this same Cohort of Active Resistance down the same path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those search peaks surprised me. I remember seeing a lot of Flat Earth videos  June/July 2016. That was roughly the same time I found out about the Mandela Effect.</p>

<p>The Mandela Effect is definitely real, even if you only take the perspective that multiple people worldwide seem to apparently share the same incorrect memory about a topic.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot explain one of the effects. It was an Apollo 13 movie quote that changed after I watched the video (I know that sounds insane, but please Google it, there are many, many reports of pretty much the same story as mine)</p>

<p>I had read on a forum that the Apollo 13 movie quote was now &quot;Houston, we&#39;ve HAD a problem&quot;. Whereas, I had always remembered it as, &quot;Houston, we HAVE a problem&quot;. I searched for the clip to confirm if I was wrong or right. I watched the clip and Tom Hanks clearly said, &quot;Houston, we&#39;ve HAD a problem&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Ok, wow I&#39;ve been getting that wrong all these years I didn&#39;t realise it was &quot;we&#39;ve HAD a problem&quot;, oh well, chalk that up to bad memory&quot;, I thought.</p>

<p>Then a little while later, (I think it was in the region of about 3 weeks), I read somewhere else that the quote had changed for several people. People were saying it had switched back to &quot;..we HAVE a problem&quot;. I thought, &quot;no way, these people are nuts, I only checked that a few weeks ago&quot;.</p>

<p>Well, I checked the EXACT same video/Youtube URL that I used the first time when it said &quot;HAD&quot; and now it said &quot;HAVE&quot;</p>

<p>Please see this comment thread on Youtube (it should take you to the first of many dicussions on the video about being initially hearing HAD and then it changing to HAVE the next time they watched it:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmsi05P9Uw&amp;amp;lc=z13utrlb2qixvtylg23lsff4ftypybaz504">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAmsi05P9Uw&amp;amp;lc=z13utrlb2qixvtylg23lsff4ftypybaz504</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s not the only page with people all sharing pretty much the same testimony. I&#39;ve tried to compile just a few of the comment/forum threads online that talk about the change:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/6ky4oq/do_mandela_effect_name_changes_point_to_how_the/djsfbpx/">https://www.reddit.com/r/MandelaEffect/comments/6ky4oq/do_mandela_effect_name_changes_point_to_how_the/djsfbpx/</a></p>

<p>No, I honestly do not have a clue what is going on. I know to the outside observer this sounds ludicrous, but I can assure that it feels very real to me and really shook me up for quite some time.</p>

<p>I have no idea what could&#39;ve caused this. Of course, with the Mandela Effect, the easiest (and to be fair, the most sensible) initial reaction would be to put it down to bad memory. Which is fine, however, in this instance, I had already come to the understanding that my initial memory of it being &quot;HAVE&quot; was wrong. The next time I watched the video and it changed back to &quot;HAVE&quot; was around 3 weeks later so how is that to do with memory?</p>

<p>Now, you could argue that I misheard. That is definitely a possibility. But that would mean that I misheard twice over a very short time period (again, not out of the realms of possibility at all). However, here you find the testimonies of many people all claiming they misheard exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more than willing to chalk up all other supposed Mandela Effects as my own poor memory, but this one I just can&#39;t do that. </p>

<p>If anybody has a reasonable explaination of what it might be and can link to some reasearch papers then I&#39;d be very grateful. I&#39;m not someone who thinks it&#39;s parallell universes or simulation theory (it could well be either or both of those, but I can&#39;t say without further evidence).</p>

<p>The closest I think I&#39;ve come to finding some plausible explanation outside of &quot;poor memory&quot; or &quot;bad hearing&quot; (again, not ruling those out either), can  be seen at this link here:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to research Quantum Physics as there were many reports about this being the possible cause. To be honest, I read some research papers and can&#39;t be 100% sure if I&#39;ve understood the concepts well enough to subscribe to that theory. </p>

<p>I did keep finding papers on nanotechnology and things called &quot;quantum dots&quot; though, and that led me down a path of researching various papers about something called &quot;optogenetics&quot;. Some research into optogenetics has recently been able to implant false memories into mice. Here&#39;s a link to a post with links to research papers inside</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6kxvd9/theory_mandela_effect_name_changes_point_to_clues/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Retconned/comments/6kxvd9/theory_mandela_effect_name_changes_point_to_clues/</a></p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve fully understood the science behind it or the implications so hopefully someone smarter than me can prove to me that I&#39;m talking nonsense.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t experienced the following two MEs, but there are reports from many people seeing:</p>

<p>1)Back to the Future terrorist van change from a Toyota to a VW Camper van
2)Flintstones change from &quot;Flinstones&quot; to &quot;Flintstones&quot; on various images and videos.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t believe in Flat Earth, I kind of understand their perspective to an extent though. Many of the NASA images/footage appears to be fake and many of us will be all too aware that the media lies, so it isn&#39;t a massive leap forward to believe TPTB have also lied about the shape of the Earth. Personally, at this point, I am shape agnostic, I lean heavily to it being a globe, but unless I can prove it with my own two eyes by going up into space, I cannot say definitively either way.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long comment, but weirdly, talking about the Mandela Effect in any conspiracy forum leads to a lot of people refusing to entertain the idea and being actively hostile to the idea on most occasions (which is odd to me, considering some forums like GodLikeProductions and AboveTopSecret have some really far out ideas. Also, a conspiracy forum is the place where you&#39;d assume that any idea would at least allowed to be discussed, being as these places are more likely to question every widely held assumption)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havnt cruched too much thought into it, i did some posts on this idea a gew years back.  we all accept the sun changes in size, output in luminocity, without needing more mass, just readjusting the mass that is already there.... And there is some info floating around about the moon actually slowely shrinking/compacting. Geographic models of venus and mars show similar features of an older higher elevation percentge of their surface also compacting together to form a smaller sphere. As per needing &#39;more mass&#39; i think this is untrue It is simply stating the earth has changes in volume... Which could be due to say, density and temperature changes... The mass would be the same. Is it plausable that a vastly molten/liguified interior of our planet has a greater volume than at a hypothetic time in history with a vastly cooler interior temp? </p>

Believing the Earth is flat doesn&#39;t suddenly make you go <em>crazy</em>, instead alot (most) of the other conspiracies that exist make a whole lot more sense. Why would they ever risk throwing such a volatile theory out there when it traces right back to them? (Jesuits -&gt; illuminati -&gt; CNN)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the second thread in two days you&#39;ve made about FE and both times you&#39;ve insulted people for their beliefs.<br/>
The first thread you insinuated people who post about FE are trolls and/or shills.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Almost like the folks who usually post that stuff are busy doing damage control or concern trolling or something.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now here you call people who believe it &#39;crazy&#39;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they decided to try to frame us all as crazy Flat Earthers  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For someone who is a mod of a conspiracy forum, you show a lot of bias against many users.  Should I or anyone else be worried about that bias coming through when you carry out your modding duties?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, they are allowed to be people with  personal opinions. It hasn&#39;t affected the job. The logs are posted publicly and you can say what you believe . The line is there in thick black sharpie and the mods I&#39;ve seen do a good job keeping the right baskets in the right order.

    <div class="md"><p>That picture has no idea how gyroscopes work in planes. Plane gyroscopes are small scale and don&#39;t need to be reset often. If a pilot needs total accuracy, they reset the gyro every 15-30 minutes. Big planes automate this with the use of computers. That would insinuate a round Earth because that wouldn&#39;t be needed on a flat Earth.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, gryoscopes were actually one of the first experiments created to show the rotation of Earth. You can create a clock by making a large gyroscope in a vacuum and setting 24 evenly spaced markers in a circle around the Gyro. Every day, the gyro will hit each marker. This again doesn&#39;t make any sense with a flat Earth. You can go see this yourself at plenty of museums, or you could make your own with a little expenditure and effort.</p>
