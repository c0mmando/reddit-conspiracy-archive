    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad watching people create alternate realities like this to avoid admitting Trump is just an idiot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.&quot; Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not at all.  I&#39;m saying they are dumb they take politicians down all the time but something tells me if they keep going after Trump they are going to ruin themselves.  They should cut their loses and move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotcha.. Maybe they should just report the news and stop trying to spin the narrative to direct outcomes. People might actually appreciate it. Crazy thought huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So is this what I have to look forward to in my main Controversial section every day? 100 links about CNN, or more cultish behavior supporting the shittiest, dumbest, cruelest, most fucked-up retard to ever hold the office of President? </p>

<p>Trump is a fucking moron who can&#39;t concentrate longer than 3 minutes on anything that isn&#39;t about his own glory. He&#39;s not an &quot;artist&quot;, he&#39;s a rich bully, and I will pop a cork when he&#39;s being led from the white house to spend the rest of his natural shitty life behind bars</p>

<p>FUCK TRUMP. </p>
