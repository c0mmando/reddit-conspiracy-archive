       I still think he'd use twitter but no to the extent he does now to air political grievances.  Like when he said he supports Charlie Gard and agreed to help if The British Government allows it.

       All the tweets do is decrease the public's trust in this impulse control-lacking President we have. His disapproval  is at record highs even within his own party. But impeachment is a pipe dream with a Republican Congress so we can only hope he can learn humility or least some class because we're stuck with him.

       You said the only people that think the tweeting is stupid are CNN and people that already hate him. I've talked to republicans who don't watch CNN that wish the president would stop shit posting memes like a 15 year old.

       After doing some research, it's clear the low approval ratings come from the left leaning media and high comes from conservative. So it's really hard to tell who's correct if both sides hold a bias.

       Yeah basically.  Trump and his team will just continue to play the who me?" game.  While his opposition wastes its time trying to have a rational argument with people who's objective is to take any response they give and spin it and try to make them look stupid.

       It's sad watching people create alternate realities like this to avoid admitting Trump is just an idiot.

        "In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness."

       Sad, when did American suddenly start worrying about how "The World" views them?  That is something that was started by Barack Obama and 8 years later we have more problems in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia then we did before he took office.
      </p>
      <p>
       European Countries have started every major War and needed American to bail them out and now suddenly Trump as the President is the worst thing ever?  Yeah right now who's living in an alternate reality.

       I think the Conspiracy is that Trump sets traps and most people think he is just flying off the handle or he can't control himself but I think what he does is very calculated.  Everyone who has tried to take him down has failed yet people keep stepping up to take their shot.  He slowly but surely wins every exchange and people are starting to grow tired of the whining, complaining, and lies by the left and their MSM drones.

       I don't I think he likes it, and I don't think it bothers him,  what's happening right now is what drives him.  The man has lived in controversy since he began his polo all aspirations.  He knows what he's doing and he is highlighting everything that's wrong with American Media and American Politics.

       Trump is a fucking moron who can't concentrate longer than 3 minutes on anything that isn't about his own glory. He's not an "artist", he's a rich bully, and I will pop a cork when he's being led from the white house to spend the rest of his natural shitty life behind bars
