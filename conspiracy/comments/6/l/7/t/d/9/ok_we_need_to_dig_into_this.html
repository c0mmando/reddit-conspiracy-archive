       Consistently puts out good info and truth, seems to be well connected. Some people think he's a LARP, I would say to those they need to keep researching stuff because all he says can be researched for the most part. He connects the dots for lazy people, but everything can be researched.

       To his credit, he's tweeted at Trump many times to cut the bullshit and stop working with Israel and the Saudis and get to the core of why people elected him.  According to him and many others Trump has been compromised to the point of no return, and I'm inclined to believe them.

       In his defense he said that trump is compromise. They had hoped otherwise but the VOL team reports honestly. And admitted that trump and some others had disappointed them. They seem credible.

       I admit that the misread on Trump is a poor showing. With that said, many of us overlooked or entirely missed the rumors that Jared Kushner became head of the Illuminati in 2008. On top of that, it was then passed along to us in great detail that Trump uses a political PR/Consulting firm run by ex CIA officers who cater almost exclusively to Democrats. They worked for Hillary during the campaign and then switched to Trump the second he won.

       With all that new info, an email received from a source was rather timely.

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When that person's spider senses tingle in conjunction with info received to say Trump likely conned everyone and was controlled opposition the whole time...well that right there is enough for me. I'd trust the source of that email with my life and I have yet to meet the person face-to-face. That's how damn reliable they have been.

       Seems as though there could be a lot of truth in what he says. The British Royal family has a hand in creating ISIS? Could make sense with the targets being hit (public and not infrastructures.) ET's existing for thousands of years and having a helping hand in creating the human race? Quite possibly... Then there is his interpretation's of the bible. Wow.

       I can't take anything seriously when they say things like  this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when you successfully have your soul in tune to a frequency at the end of a life cycle, which then allows your soul to go above 3D/4D
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That doesn't even mean anything.  It's just new-age garbage.  Then there's crap like this that isn't even a sentence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        your being come together in the aggregate, you'll stop questioning yourselves, start truly loving yourselves again, and then start truly

       If does make sense once you think of your conciousness and physical body are two separate entities. Out of body experiences and the likes. We can communicate without the use of verbal words or even being beside the person. I never thought it being possible until I shared the same vision as my mother, 6 months ago when we stayed 30 miles apart and weren't on the best of speaking terms. There is more to life and what we can do than what we are being let on about.

       I'm on board with the mind and body being not quite connected and the likes.. more than the sum of its parts and all, i think it's a great area of interest.  But i think that people who say things like '
       <em>
        raise your crystal vibrations to exit into the fifth dimension
       </em>
       ' just diminish what should be a scientific field of study.

       I wouldn't say all modern science is a lie. Just the 'funded' papers with choreographed information to paint a picture TPTB want us to see. Then there is the accepted theories that don't answer all questions still being accepted and no other theory can take over. So I suppose there is a lot of manipulation in modern science, some lies, some truth.

       One thing is for certain though, the world is not run correctly with all of which has been discovered in the past and more recent times.

       Seems to really be pushing for world unity and breaking the barriers of the control constructs. Can't fault them for trying at least. People always want to nit pick the credibility rather than the message being convayed.

       None of this is New Age garbage, it's ancient knowledge that has existed for ages and is only now gaining the light and traction necessary with the growing knowledge of the world as we move into the Age of Aquarius.  Research The Law Of One and The Hidden Hand dialogue from 2008 and you will see that there's a whole lot more to the world than what you see with your eyes.

       Look into hermeticism and it might start to make sense. New age? I think not. It's not something that will come to you in a eurika moment after reading some ancient texts, but a skill that is built through intentionally mindful meditation.

       I quit paying attention to this account back in May. Obviously a psyop. They call out Israel all the time,tell people to literally attack the fed, harass the "elites" constantly on their twitter pages and the account is still up. It would have been banned for anti-Semitism if nothing else. Not to mention calling for people to overthrow the government. The only reason a lot of people even looked at the account is because Obama's verified twitter was following it back then. Whenever anyone challenges them they lose their shit. I'm quite sure they'll respond to this with their reddit account. Probably say I'm completely ignorant and expect to have everything done for me instead of help in the resistance,lol. Please use common sense. Twitter accounts get banned all the time for bullying, do you really think they would let this keep going if it wasn't a government psyop/honeypot?

        Edgar wants you to know that on the issue on our nonviolent ETI, Extraterrestrial Intelligence, he was on the phone just as they were happening over Phoenix with an eyewitness describing on March 13, 1997. This incentives about disclosure, while other reports like Roswell disincentives.

         The Phoenix Lights and other sightings have provided ample evidence that Earth has been visited by beings whose intention is purely peace and who have nonviolently hovered over Phoenix and other sites, waiting to be asked to help, when they could most easily have destroyed the city with their uses of consciousness. These sightings have been witnessed by thousands of people in Phoenix alone, including my colleague Terri Mansfield, who will accompany me on our meeting with you.
