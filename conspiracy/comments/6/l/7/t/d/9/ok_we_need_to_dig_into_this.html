    <div class="md"><p>I admit that the misread on Trump is a poor showing. With that said, many of us overlooked or entirely missed the rumors that Jared Kushner became head of the Illuminati in 2008. On top of that, it was then passed along to us in great detail that Trump uses a political PR/Consulting firm run by ex CIA officers who cater almost exclusively to Democrats. They worked for Hillary during the campaign and then switched to Trump the second he won.</p>

<p>With all that new info, an email received from a source was rather timely. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ietf9">Click Here</a>.</p>

<p>When that person&#39;s spider senses tingle in conjunction with info received to say Trump likely conned everyone and was controlled opposition the whole time...well that right there is enough for me. I&#39;d trust the source of that email with my life and I have yet to meet the person face-to-face. That&#39;s how damn reliable they have been.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say all modern science is a lie. Just the &#39;funded&#39; papers with choreographed information to paint a picture TPTB want us to see. Then there is the accepted theories that don&#39;t answer all questions still being accepted and no other theory can take over. So I suppose there is a lot of manipulation in modern science, some lies, some truth. </p>

<p>One thing is for certain though, the world is not run correctly with all of which has been discovered in the past and more recent times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I quit paying attention to this account back in May. Obviously a psyop. They call out Israel all the time,tell people to literally attack the fed, harass the &quot;elites&quot; constantly on their twitter pages and the account is still up. It would have been banned for anti-Semitism if nothing else. Not to mention calling for people to overthrow the government. The only reason a lot of people even looked at the account is because Obama&#39;s verified twitter was following it back then. Whenever anyone challenges them they lose their shit. I&#39;m quite sure they&#39;ll respond to this with their reddit account. Probably say I&#39;m completely ignorant and expect to have everything done for me instead of help in the resistance,lol. Please use common sense. Twitter accounts get banned all the time for bullying, do you really think they would let this keep going if it wasn&#39;t a government psyop/honeypot?</p>

<li>The Phoenix Lights and other sightings have provided ample evidence that Earth has been visited by beings whose intention is purely peace and who have nonviolently hovered over Phoenix and other sites, waiting to be asked to help, when they could most easily have destroyed the city with their uses of consciousness. These sightings have been witnessed by thousands of people in Phoenix alone, including my colleague Terri Mansfield, who will accompany me on our meeting with you.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Edgar D. Mitchell, ScD</p>

<p>Chief Science Officer &amp; Founder, Quantrek</p>

<p>Apollo 14 astronaut</p>

<p>6th man to walk on the Moon</p>
