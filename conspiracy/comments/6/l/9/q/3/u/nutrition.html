<p>I am a vegan but I thought it would be best for everyone if the amounts for vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients were listed so that it is independent of what diet you are on.  Recommendations on organic or non-GMO supplements are also welcome.  :)</p>

<p>In the meantime, I will continue doing my own research.  Being that I am new to the topic of nutrition, I doubt I will find anything that I would be confident enough that I would recommend to someone else.</p>

<p>EDIT: Detox recommendations are also welcome.  Preferably the substance and amount.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my beliefs, I think it would be healthy for all people to eat lots of healthy fish even if they are vegan or vegetarian, just not from sources like poor Asian countries that have farm raised fish whose diets consist of leftover food scraps and poop. </p>

<p>Fish are cold blooded animals who do not feel pain in the same way that other animals do, therefore it&#39;s not the same thing as eating other animals who are treated poorly before they become food; fish are actually not even considered animals, they are a class of species of their own without lungs like the other animals, even snakes have lungs; they also do not follow the others laws of nature like those crazy zombie fish that live thousands of feet below the water where no sunlight even reaches them.</p>

<p>The start is an article about fish not feeling pain. It has about fifty responses, including one from the guy who wrote that book &quot;What a Fish Knows.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems a moral precautionary approach is called for. If you don&#39;t know, don&#39;t kill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about it is that humans are going to eat meat and fish are not easy to torture while other animals are abused before they make it to our table. Even if fish do feel pain, at least their lives are ended fairly quickly and before they are caught they get to live a natural life in the vast oceans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people I&#39;ve heard recommending fish usually mention omega-3 fatty acids, thinking more is better. In reality, it all comes down to your omega-6:omega-3 ratio. Humans were designed for a 1:1 ratio, but rhe western diet is closer to 16:1. Vegans would have a hard time getting much higher than a 4:1 ratio if they tried, and are always going to be much closer to 1:1. So there isn&#39;t a good reason to eat fish, especially when you consider the levels of mercury you might be ingesting. </p>

<p>Someone else already addressed fish certainly feeling pain, I would just confirm that too.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So there isn&#39;t a good reason to eat fish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly many people are deficient in omega fatty acids, but the reason I say to eat fish is because it&#39;s a great way to get lots of calories and protein if you are a vegan or vegetarian, it&#39;s hard to get those things unless you&#39;re eating pounds of vegetables every day, but if you want to build muscle and thrive you need to up your calorie intake, I think fish is the best way to do this without eating the hormone filled meats a lot of people get from cheap supermarkets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve got a post in the works about food and how it can effect how you feel and how today&#39;s food system is set up to agitate us and put us in a state of subjugation. </p>

<p>But to answer your question; the less processed your ingredients the better. Rice, beans and vegetables are great starters for all different kinds of meals. Some organic farms are garbage but overall I prefer organic to conventional. GMOs are a hot topic of much debate but personally I avoid them.  Meat I would eat sparingly. I think it&#39;s very important to verify where the animal you&#39;re eating comes from. </p>

<p>Read ingredient labels on processed foods. Can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve bought peanut butter to find out it has sugar in it. </p>

<p>I feel good and confident with my diet so I don&#39;t mess with vitamins. I am open to them though. I do take a vitamin d supplement as I get the winter blues pretty bad. </p>

<p>And if you&#39;re lucky enough to afford it and ones available buy from a local farmer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Was a vegetarian for 12 years before going vegan.  I&#39;m actually finding being vegan&#39;s pretty easy actually.  Lost about 5-10 lbs (am 5&#39;10&quot;.  Went from weighing 175 on average to 165 or so), and my dietary choices are, again...easier.  Just gotta eat what&#39;s vegan.</p>

<p>I used to <em>kill</em> ice cream.  The gf said it was practically a whole separate food group for me (lol).  Perhaps that&#39;s where the weight loss came from because after going vegan I pretty much stopped the ice cream eating cold turkey.  No more of it really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that water quality is important.  :)  That could be its own post.</p>

<p>I use ZeroWater.  It comes with a PPM reader albeit rounding to whole numbers.  The water stays in a plastic container without BPA.  I am aware that plastic has many other harmful chemicals than just BPA but this is what I am doing until I get a reverse osmosis system.</p>

<p>Alkalinity is also important.  Tap water usually has good levels but I am not sure about after it is filtered.</p>

<p>I tried Zeolite for detox.  I only did 1/3 of what they recommend.  I did not notice a difference.</p>
