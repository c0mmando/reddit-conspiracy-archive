<p>Interest: Usury. They make money out of thin air by printing money, lending it to you, and collecting high interest rates. Basically the lenders are parasites who leech off of all our work. </p>

<p>Inflation: The Illuminati scumbags got us off our gold backed dollar because they figured that they can trick the public into thinking this is beneficial for us but in reality, it only benefits the elite bankers. </p>

<p>These 3 are the core of their tricks. They have expanded into other techniques as well such as endless wars for profit, barbaric health care treatments for profit, controlled technology for profit, poisoning the human body for profit, etc..  They are aiming for a complete collapse so that they can install the NWO as the savior of the world! That is why the Pope is calling for an NWO. It is because most of the world is drowning in poverty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of civilians do understand taxation, especially accountants, economists and bankers. </p>

<p>Banks do not &quot;print&quot; money anymore. Most of it is electronic. Banks need to make money somehow. They take a risk by lending it to others, and they have to be compensated for it. If they do not charge interest, how else are they going to pay their bills?Go ahead, avoid banks and loans at all cost, and try to buy a house with only cash. </p>

<p>Inflation do not benefit &quot;elite bankers&quot;. It hurt them at the same level as the common man. A modest inflation is good for the economy.</p>

<p>You clearly do not understand the very basics of economics. How do banks steal when they offer a service against a payment? Do hair dressers steal your money because they want to get paid for their labour? No banks are forcing you to take loans from them. Go ahead and buy something with a loan. It is possible, but difficult. </p>

Also, if one researcher believe something, other researchers will come up with counterarguments. But you could also argue that cognitive dissonance exist among  you guys that only read work written by conspiracy theorists.

<p>I know that he has a bachelor degree in communications, and nothing else relevant in economics. He has only published two books in economics, and only a few hundred citations. If you find other multiple authors and people that back up his work, then you have a good case to stand on. Otherwise, his work cannot be considered a reliable source. This is writing a paper 101.  </p>

<p>Of course it does. Let&#39;s say there is only $100 dollars in my economy. If someone prints another $100, I have the purchasing power of the entire economy before the money hits circulation and prices can adjust.</p>

<p>In other words, when banks who receive QE bailouts first, they have billions to spend in pre-inflated dollars. </p>
