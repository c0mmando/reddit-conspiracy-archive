       Taxation: This is a slight of hand trick. The reason taxes are so complicated is so that civilians can't phathom how the theft is occurring and how they pocket our money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest: Usury. They make money out of thin air by printing money, lending it to you, and collecting high interest rates. Basically the lenders are parasites who leech off of all our work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation: The Illuminati scumbags got us off our gold backed dollar because they figured that they can trick the public into thinking this is beneficial for us but in reality, it only benefits the elite bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 3 are the core of their tricks. They have expanded into other techniques as well such as endless wars for profit, barbaric health care treatments for profit, controlled technology for profit, poisoning the human body for profit, etc..  They are aiming for a complete collapse so that they can install the NWO as the savior of the world! That is why the Pope is calling for an NWO. It is because most of the world is drowning in poverty.

       A lot of civilians do understand taxation, especially accountants, economists and bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks do not "print" money anymore. Most of it is electronic. Banks need to make money somehow. They take a risk by lending it to others, and they have to be compensated for it. If they do not charge interest, how else are they going to pay their bills?Go ahead, avoid banks and loans at all cost, and try to buy a house with only cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation do not benefit "elite bankers". It hurt them at the same level as the common man. A modest inflation is good for the economy.

       More like someone that is educated and has picked up a book about finance and economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       You clearly do not understand the very basics of economics. How do banks steal when they offer a service against a payment? Do hair dressers steal your money because they want to get paid for their labour? No banks are forcing you to take loans from them. Go ahead and buy something with a loan. It is possible, but difficult.

       I could either read papers and research from authors who have dedicated their life to the field. Or a book written by a generalist with no education in finance trying to educate me about something he has no background in. What do you think is the most sensible?

       Yes. Good idea. Better to only read research and papers that support your own belief system. That way you don't have to worry about thinking outside the box or that pesky cognitive dissonance that comes with it. Enjoy your echo chamber!

       Research papers often debunk their own theories and hypotheses. It is not like they all support their own arguments. Also, if one researcher believe something, other researchers will come up with counterarguments. But you could also argue that cognitive dissonance exist among  you guys that only read work written by conspiracy theorists. If you find any "real" readings where authors actually have credentials then I would be happy to read their work.

       I know that he has a bachelor degree in communications, and nothing else relevant in economics. He has only published two books in economics, and only a few hundred citations. If you find other multiple authors and people that back up his work, then you have a good case to stand on. Otherwise, his work cannot be considered a reliable source. This is writing a paper 101.

       How am I going to answer to that? You just pulled that out of your ass. And what system is compromised? The education system? The FED? The science community? What system?

      <p>
       Except Bill Gates is not a scientist, is he? He also has proof that he is knowledgable. Your buddy Griffin doesn't have a lot of proof or strong acceptance among anyone other than conspiracy theorists.

       And how do you confirm what is saying is true or not if it is not based on simple fundamentals, or that there are others that back up his claims?  And don't tell me that there are youtube videos by amateur film makers that will provide this evidence.

       That's the crisis of our generation isn't it? With so much information available, what can you really accept as complete truth? You have to expose yourself to as much information from all sides as you possibly can and then form
       <em>
        your own
       </em>
       opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       These credentials you mention don't really mean a whole lot to me, because through my own empirical evidence I have come to the conclusion that many of the systems you mentioned (education, the FED, the science community) have all been corrupted by money, power, and greed; the trinity of capitalism.

       I'm pretty confident you and I will have a difficult time finding common ground

       Of course it does. Let's say there is only $100 dollars in my economy. If someone prints another $100, I have the purchasing power of the entire economy before the money hits circulation and prices can adjust.

       In other words, when banks who receive QE bailouts first, they have billions to spend in pre-inflated dollars.

       Inflation is a natural outcome of economic growth. Just think about it... the more dollars in existence, the less valuable each individual dollar becomes—the same thing would happen with gold. If gold rained from the sky it would become less valuable because everyone would have as much as they want.

       Wrong. Here is a chart of inflation under the gold standard:

       Incorrect. Inflation happens whenever the money supply increases. When on the gold standard, you get inflation every time you mine more gold. The large South American gold and silver mines crippled the Spanish economy through inflation during the 16th to 18th centuries.

       Let's not confuse economic growth (increase in GDP) and growth in the money supply (inflation).
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is economic growth and the money supply stays the same, the purchasing power of each dollar increases. This is called deflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is economic growth, and the money supply stays the same, the purchasing power of each dollar stays the same.
      </p>

       If there is no economic growth, and the money supply increases, this purchasing power of each dollar decreases. This is called inflation.
