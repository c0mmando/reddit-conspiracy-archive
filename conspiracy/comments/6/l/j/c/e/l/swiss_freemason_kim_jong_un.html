North Korea&#39;s leaders are working with South Korean leaders, Chinese leaders, Russian leaders and the powers in the West. If North Korea was any real threat they could easily be dealt with. They want to use Kim Jong Un as their patsy for an attack on the United States. China also has leverage over North Korea and is controlled by Western powers through the British Crown. The British Crown seized Hong Kong and turned it into a Crown Colony and during this time established banks and merchants which still have influences over China today. Japan which is closely working with the West and and the United States have ruled Korea in the past. Korea was part of the Empire of Japan until WWII when the United States took over. This was all a strategic move to set up North Korea as an enemy state to use for threats like they are doing. Believing their lies gives them power. Americans should take the media&#39;s propaganda about North Korean missiles as a threat made by the media and US government.   </p>

<p>But the signs are not good. Despite having thousands of pounds lavished on his education at a top private school in Switzerland, he didn&#39;t leave with even the equivalent of a single GCSE. When he was just 15 his father took him out of the costly International School Of Berne, where fees now cost around £16,000 a year. He moved him to a nearby state school to save money but he was quickly put in the lower tier in class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hand under the coat is a masonic symbol used by dictators, princes, politicians, priests, generals, actors, musicians, bankers, etc. Most of the US generals on both sides of the American Civil War can be seen in photos using this symbol. Even John Wilkes Booth is in a photo doing the masonic hidden hand. The hidden hand means the hidden hand of power.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-in-waistcoat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-in-waistcoat</a> </p>

<p>The hand-in-waistcoat (also referred to as hand-inside-vest, hand-in-jacket, hand-held-in, or hidden hand) was a gesture commonly found in portraiture during the 18th and 19th centuries. The pose appeared by the 1750s to indicate leadership in a calm and firm manner. The pose is most often associated with Napoleon I of France due to its use in several portraits made by his artist, Jacques-Louis David, amongst them the 1812 painting Napoleon in His Study. The pose, thought of as being stately, was copied by other portrait painters across Europe and America. The majority of paintings and photographs show the right hand inserted into the waistcoat/jacket but some sitters appear with the left hand inserted. The pose was also frequently seen in mid-nineteenth century photography.[1]</p>

<p>The pose is commonly seen in photographs of members of the military, with a number of American Civil War photographs showing the pose, or indicated by three open buttons on a tunic.[3]</p>

<p>Is Pope Francis I a Freemason? </p>

<p>“Master of Second Veil: “Three Most Excellent Masters you must have been, or thus far you could not have come; but farther you cannot go without my words, sign, and word of exhortation. My words are Shem, Japhet, and Adoniram; my sign is this: (thrusting his hand in his bosom); it is in imitation of one given by God to Moses, when He commanded him to thrust his hand into his bosom, and, taking it out, it became as leprous as snow. My word of exhortation is explanatory of this sign, and is found in the writings of Moses, viz., fourth chapter of Exodus”: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, I&#39;m not going to comment on whether or not any supposed mode of recognition is such, but let&#39;s suppose it is for a second... First off, displaying it in public would defeat the point. But perhaps more importantly, you said that this is a popular hand gesture in the portraiture of the West over centuries. If that is true, then even if someone early on was for some reason making a masonic reference, it&#39;s more likely than not that by now, most of the people who do this are just aping a pose that they feel conveys a sense of connection to powerful leaders of the past. </p>

Bush era diplomatic staff, in response to a discussion about the then Kim Jong Il belligerence (same type of missiles and nuke tests), basically stated that this belligerence was in line with desired US policy. In other words the US wanted and liked the belligerence, despite publicly being ferociously against it. Forgive me I couldn&#39;t find the exact cable at the moment.
