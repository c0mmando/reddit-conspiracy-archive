       ''68/  FROM A UNIFIED VISION OF ADDI CTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TREATMENT
       <br/>
       Pier Vincenzo Piazza Director
Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM
      </p>
      <p>
       Bordeaux France Recently we have proposed a general theory of transition to addiction that synthesizes knowledge generated in the field of addiction into a unitary explanatory frame. Transition to addiction results from a sequential three step interaction between: (1) individual vulnerabilities; (2) the degree/amount of drug exposure. The first step, sporadic drug use is a learning process mediated by over activation of the neurobiological substrates of natural rewards that allows most individuals to perceive drugs as highly rewarding stimuli. The second, intensified, sustained, escalated drug use occurs in some vulnerable individuals who have a hyperactive dopaminergic system and impaired prefrontal cortex function. The last step, loss of control of drug intake and full addiction, is due to a second independent vulnerable phenotype. This loss of control prone phenotype is triggered by long term drug exposure and is characterized by long lasting loss of synaptic plasticity in reward areas in the brain. These studies also underpin the existence of a drug resilient phenotype, shown by the majority of subjects, that allow an individual to be exposed for long periods to drugs without developing addiction. Studying the biological basis of resilience to drugs we have identified a hormone, pregnenolone, which secretion in the brain is induced by very high concentration of cannabis active principle THC and that is able to block most of the addiction related effect of cannabis. A family of molecules derived by pregnenolone is now being developed as a new treatment of cannabis abuse.''

       ''There isn't enough information to know if pregnenolone is safe when taken by mouth. It might cause some steroid-like side effects including overstimulation, insomnia, irritability, anger, anxiety, acne, headache, negative mood changes, facial hair growth, hair loss, and irregular heart rhythm. Special Precautions &amp; Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of pregnenolone during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Pregnenolone is converted by the body to estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don’t take supplemental pregnenolone.

       i love how their analysis uses phenotypes as if they've got that classification system all worked out.  yes, UN, everybody can be classified into this box or that box, oh wait.  they can't be.  it doesn't work like that.  this things smells of bullshit.

       Anyone who claimed to be able to do that is a pack of fucking asshole liars, out to scam people. CNN talks about them as if they are clones of Jesus himself, every hour on the hour, 24/7.

       ''In 1961, the UN adopted an international treaty called the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The treaty prohibits the production and supply of specific drugs. Earlier treaties criminalized opium, coca and derivatives of those compounds such as morphine, heroin and cocaine. It was during this convention that cannabis was similarly criminalized.''

       yeah, but you can't throw out the baby with the bathwater.  that would be pointless.  we improve in steps.  make mistakes, observe mistakes, change, try again, and so forth.  i don't think anything is monolithic and incapable of change.  it's the will to change that's required.  if the will driving these organizations isn't in the right place, then you won't get the best result.
      </p>
      <p>
       there has been this habit by the people who have stuff to lose sight of the possibilities of things, and to only see what they want to see.  to those types, they'll get what they want.  it's unfortunate that they're too unwilling to conceive past their narrow lens, or they'd understand that what they want weakens them.  i dunno what else to say about that.

       Cannabis stopped my seizures. The UN is my enemy. They want to drug me with Pregnenolone.  They strongly and repeatedly assert that cannabis users have ''cannabis use disorder'', an alleged mental disease, they made up, and must be given experimental chemicals with heavy side effects, to stave off the evil and devil borne, satanic marijuana.

       every group in the world that wants to tell you what to do and doesn't know what they're talking about is "your enemy", whatever that even means.  you have to build your own trust networks, build your own capacity, and provide for yourself.  that's really what it comes down to.  listen to stupid bureaucrats at your own risk.

       Idk it works good on my tumor but it is addictive but so are all good things . Africa is fucked from drought, corporate exploitation and over fishing, not to mention religious extremism caused conflicts but tbh I can't remember a time when Africa wasn't fucked in some way. I doubt growing smoko is a major cause of their problems and I have never met a person of African decent with smoko addiction they seem to be into uppers and the drink more , I met plenty of white cunts with major smoko addiction, been thr few times myself.

       I follow your posts and comments with interest so don't take this the wrong way (not that it should matter, because anybody who makes a statement should be prepared to explain or prove it without becoming enraged), but I don't see where they apparently say we need to be drugged.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do see is them saying they found a potential treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you replace "THC addiction" with "carcinoma," you can see that they are not implying that anyone needs to be treated; rather that here is a possible solution. They even have the integrity to state that they are not sure about the drug.

       Read this dialogue by the quoted UN expert from that study I linked, and his partners in research. They blatantly speak as if ALL cannabis users have ''cannabis use disorder'' in varying degrees, and every one of them are on the slippery slope to using hard drugs, and sipping into level 3 ''cannabis use disorder''.

       The UN has ALWAYS spoken about heroin and cannabis use in the strongest scare tactic language they can, over thousands of documents.
       <br/>
       Now they have doctors who have developed a drug to treat them, and are openly accusing all users of having a mental problem.
       <br/>
       That paper suggests 100% of us are now on the slope to doom, without being shot up with pregnenolone, as it is not an oral drug.
       <br/>
       Feel free to see what the UN's expert on cannabis says, in all his verbage.
       <br/>
       Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza
       <br/>
       No where do the UN or their experts say ''cannabis use'', but rather they stick to ''cannabis abuse''. They just want to ''treat'' people over jailing them. They see all of us as subhuman filth junkies.
       <br/>
       Everywhere you go it's this same doctor spouting off about it.

       I read it. It says the opposite. It says most people are naturally resistant to addition whereas a minority amount are vulnerable to heavy addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, that doesn't address my question. My question was, where does it say they believe we NEED to be treated? As I pointed out, they don't say that at all. They simply say that there is a tool they have found and don't yet understand fully.

       They said they would eradicate the world of every bit of it by 2008. What do you think they are doing? Eradicating. It's what they do.

       All of the UN language is a series of things to eradicate.

       Again, you're not supporting your claims. I asked where it says 1/3 but you keep avoiding it. I also asked where it says we need to be treated but you keep avoiding that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say for the sake of argument that their goal is to eradicate something. When they state - as they did - that they have found a tool and also state that they don't yet know the health effects of it, that does not imply that we need to be treated with it. It is simply them saying "hey, we found this, but we don't yet understand whether it's safe or not."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no different than if you had a goal to eliminate ants from your home, and said "hey, honey, I found this mystery chemical under the sink that seems to kill ants, but I don't yet know whether it's safe or not" and someone else claiming "He said his family needs to use that!"
      </p>
      <p>
       As you can see, your claims are wrong. They did not claim or even imply that we need to be treated. Nor did they say 1/3 of us as you claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to make people aware of something, then be honest. Don't lie. That looks like is "I believe they want to treat us with a drug that seems to have negative health effects" and "I believe they view cannabis consumption as an incredibly bad problem."

       You're making statements that are true. They are not treating cannabis use as the most dangerous thing any human ever did. They are discussing data. Measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked for where it says what you claim: 1/3 of us. And I asked where it says we need to be treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also noticed that you cut and paste their number about 40%. I think you don't understand what that means. 40% increased risk of psychosis means you take the existing risk of psychosis and increase it by 40%. Risk of psychosis is extremely small. So for example, if there is a one in 1000 chance of being hit by lightning in certain area during a storm, then a 40% increase means the risk becomes 1.4 in 1000. Still very small.

       You didn't show it to anyone, because it's not there. I checked the entire document. So you are spreading lies. If your argument were so strong, you would have no need for that. You could simply point to the facts. But instead you claim to be pointing out the facts while actually lying.
