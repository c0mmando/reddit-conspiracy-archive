&#39;&#39;68/  FROM A UNIFIED VISION OF ADDI CTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TREATMENT<br/>
Pier Vincenzo Piazza Director
Neurocentre Magendie, INSERM</p>

<p>Bordeaux France Recently we have proposed a general theory of transition to addiction that synthesizes knowledge generated in the field of addiction into a unitary explanatory frame. Transition to addiction results from a sequential three step interaction between: (1) individual vulnerabilities; (2) the degree/amount of drug exposure. The first step, sporadic drug use is a learning process mediated by over activation of the neurobiological substrates of natural rewards that allows most individuals to perceive drugs as highly rewarding stimuli. The second, intensified, sustained, escalated drug use occurs in some vulnerable individuals who have a hyperactive dopaminergic system and impaired prefrontal cortex function. The last step, loss of control of drug intake and full addiction, is due to a second independent vulnerable phenotype. This loss of control prone phenotype is triggered by long term drug exposure and is characterized by long lasting loss of synaptic plasticity in reward areas in the brain. These studies also underpin the existence of a drug resilient phenotype, shown by the majority of subjects, that allow an individual to be exposed for long periods to drugs without developing addiction. Studying the biological basis of resilience to drugs we have identified a hormone, pregnenolone, which secretion in the brain is induced by very high concentration of cannabis active principle THC and that is able to block most of the addiction related effect of cannabis. A family of molecules derived by pregnenolone is now being developed as a new treatment of cannabis abuse.&#39;&#39;
---------------------------------------------------------:</p>

<p>&#39;&#39;There isn&#39;t enough information to know if pregnenolone is safe when taken by mouth. It might cause some steroid-like side effects including overstimulation, insomnia, irritability, anger, anxiety, acne, headache, negative mood changes, facial hair growth, hair loss, and irregular heart rhythm. Special Precautions &amp; Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Not enough is known about the use of pregnenolone during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.</p>

<p>Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids: Pregnenolone is converted by the body to estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don’t take supplemental pregnenolone.<br/>

&#39;&#39;In 1961, the UN adopted an international treaty called the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The treaty prohibits the production and supply of specific drugs. Earlier treaties criminalized opium, coca and derivatives of those compounds such as morphine, heroin and cocaine. It was during this convention that cannabis was similarly criminalized.&#39;&#39;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, but you can&#39;t throw out the baby with the bathwater.  that would be pointless.  we improve in steps.  make mistakes, observe mistakes, change, try again, and so forth.  i don&#39;t think anything is monolithic and incapable of change.  it&#39;s the will to change that&#39;s required.  if the will driving these organizations isn&#39;t in the right place, then you won&#39;t get the best result.  </p>

<p>there has been this habit by the people who have stuff to lose sight of the possibilities of things, and to only see what they want to see.  to those types, they&#39;ll get what they want.  it&#39;s unfortunate that they&#39;re too unwilling to conceive past their narrow lens, or they&#39;d understand that what they want weakens them.  i dunno what else to say about that.      </p>

Africa is fucked from drought, corporate exploitation and over fishing, not to mention religious extremism caused conflicts but tbh I can&#39;t remember a time when Africa wasn&#39;t fucked in some way. I doubt growing smoko is a major cause of their problems and I have never met a person of African decent with smoko addiction they seem to be into uppers and the drink more , I met plenty of white cunts with major smoko addiction, been thr few times myself.</p>

<p>What I do see is them saying they found a potential treatment. </p>

<p>If you replace &quot;THC addiction&quot; with &quot;carcinoma,&quot; you can see that they are not implying that anyone needs to be treated; rather that here is a possible solution. They even have the integrity to state that they are not sure about the drug. </p>

The UN has ALWAYS spoken about heroin and cannabis use in the strongest scare tactic language they can, over thousands of documents.<br/>
Now they have doctors who have developed a drug to treat them, and are openly accusing all users of having a mental problem.<br/>
That paper suggests 100% of us are now on the slope to doom, without being shot up with pregnenolone, as it is not an oral drug.<br/>
Feel free to see what the UN&#39;s expert on cannabis says, in all his verbage.<br/>

No where do the UN or their experts say &#39;&#39;cannabis use&#39;&#39;, but rather they stick to &#39;&#39;cannabis abuse&#39;&#39;. They just want to &#39;&#39;treat&#39;&#39; people over jailing them. They see all of us as subhuman filth junkies.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you&#39;re not supporting your claims. I asked where it says 1/3 but you keep avoiding it. I also asked where it says we need to be treated but you keep avoiding that.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say for the sake of argument that their goal is to eradicate something. When they state - as they did - that they have found a tool and also state that they don&#39;t yet know the health effects of it, that does not imply that we need to be treated with it. It is simply them saying &quot;hey, we found this, but we don&#39;t yet understand whether it&#39;s safe or not.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s no different than if you had a goal to eliminate ants from your home, and said &quot;hey, honey, I found this mystery chemical under the sink that seems to kill ants, but I don&#39;t yet know whether it&#39;s safe or not&quot; and someone else claiming &quot;He said his family needs to use that!&quot; </p>

<p>As you can see, your claims are wrong. They did not claim or even imply that we need to be treated. Nor did they say 1/3 of us as you claimed. </p>

<p>If you want to make people aware of something, then be honest. Don&#39;t lie. That looks like is &quot;I believe they want to treat us with a drug that seems to have negative health effects&quot; and &quot;I believe they view cannabis consumption as an incredibly bad problem.&quot;</p>

&#39;&#39;P
sychosis
and  Schizophrenia:
The  strong  association  between 
cannabis
use  and  psychosis  or 
schizophrenia  has been  recognized  for over two decades, in at least four ways: (1) cannabis  produces  a </p>

<h2>full  range  of  transient  schizophrenia</h2>

<p>like  positive,  negative,  and  cognitive  symptoms  in  some  healthy 
individuals
. The 
induction of
psychosis  by  cannabis  was  originally
reviewed  by 
Warnock  in  1903
92
and 
substantiated  subsequently;
93
,
94
(2)  in  those  harboring  a  psychotic  disorder,  cannabis  may  exacerbate 
symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illnes
s
;
95
(3)
susceptible 
individuals  in  the  general  population  develop  a  psychotic  illness  with  heavy  cannabis  use,  which  is 
associated with age of onset of use, strength of THC in cannabis
,
frequency of use
and duration of use
;
96
,
97
(4) cannabis use is associated with lowering the age of onset of schizophrenia
.
98
It is likely that 
cannabis
exposure  is  a 
“

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making statements that are true. They are not treating cannabis use as the most dangerous thing any human ever did. They are discussing data. Measurements.</p>

<p>I asked for where it says what you claim: 1/3 of us. And I asked where it says we need to be treated.</p>

<p>I also noticed that you cut and paste their number about 40%. I think you don&#39;t understand what that means. 40% increased risk of psychosis means you take the existing risk of psychosis and increase it by 40%. Risk of psychosis is extremely small. So for example, if there is a one in 1000 chance of being hit by lightning in certain area during a storm, then a 40% increase means the risk becomes 1.4 in 1000. Still very small. </p>

<p>You made claims about the content of a UN document. I checked and saw that your claims were false. I asked you to back up your claims and show me where the UN actually says what you claim it does.</p>

<p>You made a few posts avoiding my question and trying to talk your way around it, and now are stooping to insults because you got caught in your lies. That&#39;s pretty pathetic. </p>

<p>You claimed that the UN made claims and linked to your source. But your source proved you wrong. No dominatrix stuff is necessary. simply comparing your claims to your source exposes your bullshit and your paranoia. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re lying again about &quot;Maybe I know more about this than you do.&quot; </p>

<p>Just the fact that you made flat out claims and then danced around in your responses instead of saying &quot;right here on page 30&quot; says it all. You are a fraud, and a conspiracy nut.</p>
