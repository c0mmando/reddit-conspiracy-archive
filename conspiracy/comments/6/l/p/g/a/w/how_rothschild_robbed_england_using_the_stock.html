        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rothschild, a family in the forefront of the Illuminati, was first interested in hijacking England. He succeeded by spreading rumors that Napolean won the war in Waterloo which was a lie designed to demoralize the people enough so that they sell off their stocks. It worked. The people sold of their stocks and Rothschild bought it for pennies. The stock market made a quick recovery when the people found out the truth and Rothschild seized control over England&#39;s wealth. </p>

<p>Then the Rothschild headed to America with 4 goals. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Seize control of America&#39;s money </p></li>
<li><p>Hire people to act like stooges for the Rothschilds in exchange for rewards. </p></li>
<li><p>Create minority group strife among the people especially between whites and blacks. </p></li>
<li><p>Destroy religion in the US. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rothschilds began working the banking sector of the US by infiltrating most of it. </p>

<p>Next, Rothschild wanted to install the federal reserve but first he has to infiltrate the congress and White House. He infiltrated mostly through the Democratic Party.  </p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson was an Illuminati plant. Once he became president, Illuminati plants in the senate railroaded the federal reserve act on December 23, 1913. They did it 2 days before Christmas since most of the politicians were on vacation and the Illuminati plants were present. </p>

<p>Profits from the Federal Reserve go to heads of member banks who are in the heiarchy of the Illuminati. </p>

<p>Sadly, the Illuminati wasn&#39;t happy with only the Federal Reserve parasite. They wanted to confiscate private property as well as control earning income. They figured an income tax would suit their plans pretty well.  An income tax was forbidden in the consitution and so only an amendment would work. Using the Illuminati stooges in congress and government, the 16th amendment was passed. This amendment was used in WW2 when FDR made fake promises that the income tax would only be a temporary thing. Later, the 16th amendment was struck down as unconstitutional based on the Pollock v. Farmers Loan Trust Co case. Actually some people no longer pay income tax. When taken to court, they bring this up to the judge and ask the court to provide evidence of a law that requires us to pay income tax. Since the court cannot produce this, the defendant wins. This strategy has had a 100% success rate in court and today both retired IRS agents and normal civilians no longer pay income tax. </p>

<p>The income tax scam was designed only to rob regular people but not the elite 1%. The elite also created many fake tax free foundations where they claim the money is used for the common good but it&#39;s  just another trick. The Clinton Foundation and McCain Instittue are such foundations. They often use money to finance organizations like black lives matter and antifa. </p>

<p>Since the Federal Reserve was signed into law through treasonous methods, we the people declare it null and void. Shut that parasitical leech down. To show them we are serious, we should surround the Federal Reserve building demanding they shut down. Also, there is no law that forces us to pay income tax. We can all stop now. Anyone taken to court can claim the Supreme Court ruled down the 16th amendment and that no law exists saying we need to pay income tax. Whoever used this in court was found not guilty and no longer pays income tax. </p>

<p>Hey, <a href="/u/LightBringerFlex">/u/LightBringerFlex</a>, do you understand what a Constitutional Amendment is and how many people have to agree to pass it? First, two-thirds of the House of Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate have to agree on it. For the 16th Amendment, that happened in July, 1909.</p>

<p>Then the state legislatures in three-fourths of the states have to pass the amendment. For the 16th Amendment, that meant that 36 states had to pass it. More than that did:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the effort that you went to, but this is just historical nonsense I&#39;m afraid, as is your source. Firstly, how do suppose that the Rothschilds were &quot;at the forefront of the Illuminati&quot; when (a) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">the Illuminati</a> had ceased to exist at the end of the 18th century, and (b) when they did actually exist, the Illuminati specifically <em>banned</em> Jews from joining. At the time that the Illuminati were around, the Rothschilds were still living in the segregated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse">Jewish ghettos of Frankfurt</a>, eking out a relatively meagre living as coin exchangers.</p>

<p>As for owning the federal reserve, there is no legitimate evidence whatsoever that the Rothschilds had a hand in its creation. The Federal Reserve shareholders are made up of its member banks, and none of them to my knowledge are owned by the Rothschilds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Profits from the Federal Reserve go to heads of member banks who are in the heiarchy of the Illuminati.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. The Federal Reserve is a non-profit organisation that gives its annual earnings back to the government. For example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/business/economy/23fed.html?_r=2&amp;amp;amp;amp;ref=business">in 2010</a> the Fed made a profit of $82 billion and transferred $79 billion of that back to the U.S. Treasury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They figured an income tax would suit their plans pretty well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are, now I see where this is heading. Are you a sovereign citizen by any chance? Let me ask you, do you enjoy having roads to drive on? How about the fire department if your house catches fire? How about a welfare check when find yourself out of work? Pretty nice perks of living in a prosperous, civilised society, right? Those are just some of the many ways that taxes, and especially income and social security tax, benefits society, no matter how much or little you earn. If you want a picture of life without a strong social safety net, I suggest you take a look at Sub-Saharan Africa or the far East, e=and then tell me again that you&#39;re not happy to pay taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re describing is a kangaroo court. That&#39;s not how history works, nor should it. I could make a youtube video claiming that John Wilkes Booth shot Kennedy, and some prat would probably believe it. That doesn&#39;t make it any more true though. We HAVE to go on evidence and evidence alone, or else we&#39;re lost as a civilisation. There are tons of real conspiracies happening right now with real evidence to back it up, but most of them are too boring or technical for this sub. That&#39;s a shame, because that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what this place should be all about.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>What is true is the way the system works. Create money from thin air every time someones takes out a loan.</p>

<p>So the financial system itself benefits from debt. The more debt they issue, the more profits they make from someone else&#39;s hard work.</p>

<p>I wish I could do this. Lend out a billion dollars (to hundreds/thousands of borrowers) without actually having that much money myself. Then I charge them 5% annual interest and collect $50 Million a year for lending them money I never had in the first place.</p>

<p>Somehow, this seems like the perfect scam. But that&#39;s literally how fractional reserve banking works. You only have to have a small portion of the money you lend out... and the more you lend out, the more you make.</p>

<p>This is the real reason why there is so much debt. Not just government debt, but for society in general. Most people are so used to paying interest to the banking system, they don&#39;t even realize how it makes them a part-time slave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Rothschilds were just starting out in banking when the Battle of Waterloo happened, they were not big time at that point. Weather or not the story of them swindling the British stock market is true (there is no evidence that it is), that&#39;s not where they made their money.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds&#39; story began in the slums of Frankfurt, Germany in the late 18th century. At the time, Jews throughout much of Europe were denied civil rights and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ghettos_in_Europe">segregated into ghettos</a>, and being Jewish the Rothschild family was no different. The head of the family, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, ran a moderately successful currency exchange business from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Judengasse">Frankfurt ghetto</a>, and through this enterprise Mayer struck up a business relationship with a nobleman, Wilhelm I, Elector of Hesse, who was a keen collector of rare coins. </p>

<p>After Wilhelm&#39;s father passed away, he inherited an enormous fortune (said to be the second-largest in Europe), which he eventually sought to invest with the help of the Rothschild&#39;s financial expertise. From 1800 onwards, Mayer gradually sent his 5 sons to the financial capitals of Europe (Frankfurt, Paris, London, Vienna and Naples) with Wilhelm&#39;s money and through shrewd investments managed to significantly increase their client&#39;s fund, greatly enriching themselves from the interest in the process. Building on this fortune, by the mid 19th century they were arguably the most successful banking family in Europe, and ever since (particularly in the age of the internet) have become the subject of numerous conspiracy theories (e.g. that they &quot;control the world&#39;s central banks&quot;), practically all of which is complete fantasy and has been thoroughly debunked.</p>

<p>Today, although still wealthy by anyone&#39;s standards, the Rothschild family is no longer the banking titan it once was. Make no mistake, it&#39;s still a large and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_%26_Co">successful company</a>; but with assets in the low billions, it&#39;s a relatively small fish in the sea compared to global giants like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, or Citigroup, all of whom deal with trillions in assets.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but this is just historical nonsense I&#39;m afraid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is true is the way the system works. Create money from thin air every time someones takes out a loan.</p>

<p>So the financial system itself benefits from debt. The more debt they issue, the more profits they make from someone else&#39;s hard work.</p>

<p>I wish I could do this. Lend out a billion dollars (to hundreds/thousands of borrowers) without actually having that much money myself. Then I charge them 5% annual interest and collect $50 Million a year for lending them money I never had in the first place.</p>

<p>Somehow, this seems like the perfect scam. But that&#39;s literally how fractional reserve banking works. You only have to have a small portion of the money you lend out... and the more you lend out, the more you make.</p>

<p>This is the real reason why there is so much debt. Not just government debt, but for society in general. Most people are so used to paying interest to the banking system, they don&#39;t even realize how it makes them a part-time slave.</p>
