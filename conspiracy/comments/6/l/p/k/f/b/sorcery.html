        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorcery is the unnatural manipulation of unseen forces with a focus on mind control and the manipulation of the body&#39;s physiology. The various secret societies and forms of witchcraft or sorcery are intermixed. These groups all work together.</p>

<p>Jesuits - Jesuits use frequencies to defile people with filth. They also use extremely destructive psychological mind control. An example of a Jesuit spell is &quot;You are worm food when you die&quot; or &quot;There is no afterlife&quot;. They create very sadistic and depraved psychological constructs intended to crush the spirit.</p>

<p>Freemasons - Masons construct mind control programs and spells. They are &quot;builders&quot; and create deceitful programs in society used for distractions, false opposition, and conflict. They often focus on group psychology.</p>

<p>Knights Templar Masons - They specialize in conjuring or goetia and manipulate and cast demons at people. Demons are animal spirits or animal hybrid spirits. Demonology is about imposing animal behaviors and psychology onto humans.</p>

<p>Wiccans - Witches specialize in curses or hexes. They use disharmonious and chaotic frequencies to disrupt peoples lives or cause them injury or death. Many witches are trained in alchemy or chemical warfare as well with an emphasis on binding and creating knots. They use alchemy to create knots and chains in the body&#39;s electro-chemical energy. They use hate spells too. &quot;Everyone hates you&quot; is a very common Wiccan spell.</p>

<p>Hermeticists - They specialize in using chemicals to manipulate physiology also known as alchemy. They often use chemical warfare and demonology together.</p>

<p>New Age and Christian Mystics - They specialize in false teachings and emotional and psychological manipulation. They often use spells like &quot;Love your enemies&quot; or &quot;Love is the law&quot; especially when a person is under attack. They also use spells like &quot;There is no truth&quot; &quot;There is no evil&quot; and &quot;Its all the will of God&quot; to confuse the mind.</p>

<p>Kabbalists - Are similar to Freemasons. They build mind control programs and are skilled in subliminal messaging and manifestation through subliminal symbols, phrases, or numbers. They use forms of numerology and geometry to construct their mind control spells. Kabbalists are usually trained in a form of alchemy and sometimes demonology. Alchemy is about manipulating the physiology. They specialize in creating mental spells that trigger parts of the physiology.</p>

<p>Luciferian Freemasons - They specialize in extreme deception, confusion, and illusions. They go to great lengths just to make it appear that they can see into the future or that they know everything. They use boldness or extreme confidence with their lies. They are very preemptive, threatening, and manipulative.</p>

<p>Necromancers - They specialize in communication with dead spirits and manipulation of dead spirits used for hauntings.</p>

<p>Astrologists - They watch signs in the stars and nature to attempt to foretell likely future events based on emanations similar to the law of cause and effect. They use astrology to plan out their warfare, mass mind control, and for creating their synchronicities.</p>

<p>Shamanism -  Shaman witchcraft usually involves manipulating the dreams of others. All forms of witchcraft incorporate dream manipulation. The majority of satanic ritual abuse is carried out through dream manipulation especially on children.

<p>this is also my understanding of how some of these groups operate.  i reckon it&#39;s hard not to pickup on the indicators if it happens to you for decades.</p>

<p>is there anything unusual about your genetics, your real name, or your date of birth out of curiosity.  sometimes i suspect these groups spend a lot of their time trying to build people into certain roles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solomon was known as a sorcerer by the occult who conjured demons and used them to build his temple. I take this as he used demons or animal spirits to bring people into subjection who built his temple. This form of sorcery was also used in Atlantis which is when the pyramids were built. The deities in Egyptian Mythology often use animal heads. I interpret this as symbolic and that they were possessed or invoked demons or animal spirits. The beliefs in ancient Egypt which is a point of reference for Atlantis were very occultic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weishaupt was Jesuit educated in Canon law and founded the Bavarian Illuminati. I am not aware of any direct Scottish Rite connections with him. Jews involved in the occult practice Kabbalah. Freemasonry incorporates elements of Kabbalah which is older. The higher level occult teachings are maintained by the Black Nobility and they are more sophisticated than any known form of witchcraft. This knowledge goes back to Atlantis as well. They obtained and controlled this information during the times of the Library of Alexandria. They seized all books in the region under law and then burned down the library. They moved all the books and texts out before they destroyed the library. This is what is in the Vatican vaults today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like French Zionists? The top Zionist families from France serve or work closely with the Black Nobility of Italy. The Torlonia family of Rome are intermarried with the Javal banking family of France. The French Rothschild&#39;s are intermarried with the Aldobrandini family of Italy. The Rothschild family papal court factors. Rothschild means red shield. They are titled the &quot;guardians of the papal treasure&quot; Shields and guards are not owners. The Dreyfus family are court factors for the House of Bonaparte and a Dreyfus branch serves the House of Orange in the Netherlands. The House of Orange work with the House of Bourbon-Parma and Bourbon-Two Sicilies. All of the other French Zionists are working under these families and the House of Bonaparte.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good info. But no, I mean the cult not zionists. At one point 50% of Jews believed in Sabbatai or Frank, so this isn&#39;t some tiny fringe group. The messianic cult has it&#39;s own goals- bring the messianic age by turning the world evil. So this didn&#39;t appear until 1600, and I&#39;m trying to find any power shifts that happened after that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking maybe Rothschilds transitioned from being court jews to running the show, starting with the Frank Weishaupt Rothschild alliance. </p>

<p>I aporeciate your time though, great post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure who was behind his movement. They are definitely not a dominant group today. Seemed to be a cover for spreading Kabbalah. Secret societies are like a plague.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi</a></p>

<p>Sabbatai Zevi (Hebrew: שַׁבְּתַי צְבִי‎, other spellings include Sabbatai Ẓevi, Shabbetai Ẓevi, Shabbeṯāy Ṣeḇī, Sabbatai Sevi, Shabsai Tzvi, and Sabetay Sevi in Turkish) (August 1, 1626 – c. September 17, 1676[1]) was a Sephardic ordained Rabbi, though of Romaniote origin[2][3] and a kabbalist, active throughout the Ottoman Empire, who claimed to be the long-awaited Jewish Messiah. He was the founder of the Sabbatean movement.
In February 1666, upon arriving in Constantinople, Sabbatai was imprisoned on the order of the grand vizier Ahmed Köprülü; in September of that same year, after being moved from different prisons around the capital to Adrianople (the imperial court&#39;s seat) for judgement on accusations of fomenting sedition, Sabbatai was given by Köprülü, in the name of the Sultan Mehmed IV, the choice of either facing death by some type of ordeal, or of converting to Islam. Sabbatai seems to have chosen the latter by donning from then on a Turkish turban. He was then also rewarded by the heads of the Ottoman state with a generous pension for his compliance with their political and religious plans.[4] Some of his followers also converted to Islam—about 300 families who were known as the Dönmeh (converts).[5]</p>

<p>Conversion to Islam</p>

<p>Nehemiah, however, escaped to Constantinople, where he pretended to embrace Islam to get an audience with the kaymakam. He told him of Sabbatai&#39;s ambitions. The kaymakam informed the sultan, Mehmed IV. Sabbatai was taken from Abydos to Adrianople,[7] where the sultan&#39;s vizier gave him three choices; subject himself to a trial of his divinity in the form of a volley of arrows (in which should the archers miss, his divinity would be proven); be impaled; or he could convert to Islam.[14] On the following day (September 16, 1666) Zevi came before the sultan, cast off his Jewish garb and put a Turkish turban on his head. Thus his conversion to Islam was accomplished. The sultan was much pleased, and rewarded Sabbatai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) Effendi, and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a generous salary. Sarah and approximately 300 families among Sabbatai&#39;s followers also converted to Islam. These new Muslims thereafter were known as dönmeh (converts).[5] The sultan&#39;s officials ordered Sabbatai to take an additional wife to demonstrate his conversion. Some days after his conversion he wrote to Smyrna: &quot;God has made me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done. The ninth day of my regeneration.&quot;[7]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,  “When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Prove yourselves by working a miracle,’ then you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.’”  So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord commanded; Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent.  <strong>Then Pharaoh summoned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts.</strong> For every man cast down his rod, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.  Still Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the Lord had said.</p>

<p>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he refuses to let the people go.  Go to Pharaoh in the morning, as he is going out to the water; wait for him by the river’s brink, and take in your hand the rod which was turned into a serpent.  And you shall say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness; and behold, you have not yet obeyed.”  Thus says the Lord, “By this you shall know that I am the Lord: behold, I will strike the water that is in the Nile with the rod that is in my hand, and it shall be turned to blood,  and the fish in the Nile shall die, and the Nile shall become foul, and the Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the Nile.”’”  And the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, their canals, and their ponds, and all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’”</p>

<p>Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded; in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, he lifted up the rod and struck the water that was in the Nile, and all the water that was in the Nile turned to blood.  And the fish in the Nile died; and the Nile became foul, so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.  <strong>But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts;</strong> so Pharaoh’s heart remained hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the Lord had said.  Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not lay even this to heart.  And all the Egyptians dug round about the Nile for water to drink, for they could not drink the water of the Nile.</p>

<p>Seven days passed after the Lord had struck the Nile. Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the Lord, “Let my people go, that they may serve me.  But if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your country with frogs;  the Nile shall swarm with frogs which shall come up into your house, and into your bedchamber and on your bed, and into the houses of your servants and of your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls;  the frogs shall come up on you and on your people and on all your servants.”’”  And the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over the canals, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come upon the land of Egypt!’”  So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.  <strong>But the magicians did the same by their secret arts, and brought frogs upon the land of Egypt.</strong></p>

<p>Then Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, “Entreat the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.”  Moses said to Pharaoh, “Be pleased to command me when I am to entreat, for you and for your servants and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses and be left only in the Nile.”  And he said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “Be it as you say, that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our God.  The frogs shall depart from you and your houses and your servants and your people; they shall be left only in the Nile.”  So Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried to the Lord concerning the frogs, as he had agreed with Pharaoh.  And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; the frogs died out of the houses and courtyards and out of the fields.  And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.  But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened his heart, and would not listen to them; as the Lord had said.</p>

<p>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your rod and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.’”  And they did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there came gnats on man and beast; all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.  <strong>The magicians tried by their secret arts to bring forth gnats, but they could not. So there were gnats on man and beast.  And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.”</strong> But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not listen to them; as the Lord had said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I John am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me;  but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”</p>

<p>And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near. Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy.”</p>

<p>“Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense, to repay every one for what he has done.  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</p>

<p>Blessed are those who wash their robes,that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. <strong>Outside are the dogs and sorcerers</strong> and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood.</p>

<p>“I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.”</p>

<p>The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let him who hears say, “Come.” And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price.</p>

<p>I warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.</p>

<p>He who testifies to these things says, “Surely I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!</p>

<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Queen Maxima of the Netherlands is a top Astrologist. There are several observatories in the Netherlands. The Vatican and Jesuits are involved with astronomy because they use astrology. They read the stars to determine likely patterns that manifest on lower emanational levels. This is similar to the idea of weather forecasting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the bottom of this link is an image of Prince Alessandro &quot;Dado&quot; Ruspoli using the Yogi meditation pose. They have combined yoga with many New Age teachings and Eastern mysticism. They use yoga to promote their deceptive and inaccurate kundalini chakra system which clearly depicts serpent invocation. The Ruspoli family have been involved with the Vatican and SMOM for centuries. The Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin is a recognized as a developer of the New Age movement through his book The Phenomenon of Man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Witches are almost always depicted using spells in Latin. Most initiated witches use Latin or Hebrew for casting spells. They use Latin because Wicca was developed in Rome at the Vatican. The Vatican is the only nation that uses Latin as its official language. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the name Zeus was stolen by them. The imposter who you know as that pagan deity goes by the name of &quot;Zeus Ombrios&quot; and he even has a facebook page. He has a blood red cross on his face and is a high level cult leader. His former incarnation was known as Eurymedon in ancient Greece, Pazuzu in Assyrian Mythology, and Pharzuph the fallen angel of lust in Hebrew Mythology. He is blasphemy in the flesh.</p>
