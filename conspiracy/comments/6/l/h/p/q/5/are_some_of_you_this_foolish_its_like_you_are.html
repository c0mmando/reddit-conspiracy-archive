        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok, so let me walk you through for those who are still taking this bullshit seriously.</p>

<ol>
<li>Trump tweets gif of him looking like a badass taking down &quot;the establishment media&quot;. Everyone here thinks he&#39;s the greatest and he&#39;s &quot;against the system&quot;, and they once again draw us back into supporting the puppet douche that he truly is. </li>
</ol>

<p>Effect: This once again lulls the &quot;conspiracy community&quot; and those skeptical of Trump, Into lending him and his establishment their trust, not realizing this is all a charade orchestrated by the social engineers. It also gives the impression that <strong>OTHER MSM outlets like Fox are &quot;no longer in the doghouse&quot;, and contrary, working on our side. Do you see how this stupid charade creates more tension and polarity?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>CNN brands the guy who made it &quot;anti Semitic and hate speech oriented&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>Effect: Now, the liberal media and their base automatically see us as a racist/anti Jewish hate group, which is a great way to discredit us, along with shill Jones sucking Trumps dick and acting outlandish. This is also done by design. Remember all the recent &quot;Jews Rule the world!!1&quot; bullshit on this sub that was called out a few months ago? Yea...the shills here are IN on this and know the moves ahead of time, and are lending credibility to this narrative.</p>

<p>Now, our entire sub is flooded with fucking anti CNN stuff, and essentially this is setting the stage for 4 years of ONLY CNN/left media bashing on this sub, and siding with Trump. Regardless of whether or not they are in the wrong, the idea is that this is all fucking fake! Stop taking this events seriously, you&#39;re being sucked into partisan behavior whether you realize it or not and its hurting our movement. Yea, CNN blows, but so do the rest of them, and this is a trap, so fixate us and our culture on </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trusting Trump and his administration </p></li>
<li><p>Branding is anti Jewish</p></li>
<li><p>Get the country arguing over which phony as MSM outlet is the best. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Think about this for a minute....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is worse for the United States and the world? 1) Trump&#39;s theatrics on his twitter account, or 2) an all out war with Iran?</p>

<p>Many of Trump&#39;s supporters are veterans and Libertarians who were &quot;anti-war&quot; Ron Paul supporters. Because of Alex Jones, these Trump supporters now worship Trump and won&#39;t say anything against him when he has the U.S. military attack Iran. Trump and Jones are being used to isolate the &quot;gun loving&quot;, &quot;anti-government&quot; crowd; the one group that stands in the way of the NWO. The gun lovers are now isolated as they support Trump and his wars, and they will continue to be isolated when Trump and the government turns on them and takes their guns.</p>

<p>Now, our entire sub is flooded with fucking anti CNN stuff, and essentially this is setting the stage for 4 years of ONLY CNN/left media bashing on this sub, and siding with Trump. </p>

<p>Bullshit. The outrage directed against CNN has nothing to do with Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of whether or not they are in the wrong, the idea is that this is all fucking fake! Stop taking this events seriously, you&#39;re being sucked into partisan behavior</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing &quot;partisan&quot; about it. CNN Doxxed, intimidated, threatened and BLACKMAILED some idiot troll. <strong>Why</strong>? </p>

<p>Did they go after him because he is &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;Islamophobic&quot; or <em>(gasp!)</em> &quot;<strong><em>anti-Semitic</em></strong>&quot; NO. They didn&#39;t learn any of THOSE DETAILS until their &quot;witch hunt&quot; was well under way.</p>

<p>This idiot clown was targeted because he made a comical GIF that HUMILIATED the Mighty CNN, and the fact that CNN would do this is unconscionable - it sent CHILLS through the bones of every decent human being who cares about preserving their RIGHT to express their ideas and opinions WITHOUT being subjected to potential harm to themselves and their families by being &quot;OUTED&quot; by one of the biggest and most visible &quot;News&quot; organizations on Earth. </p>

<h1>THAT is what this is about.</h1>

<p>If it is being used as a political tool, it is because &quot;<strong><em>CONCERNED</em></strong>&quot; people like YOU are working to turn a FREE SPEECH issue into a partisan politics issue.</p>

<p>Do you even realize what you are doing?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>whether you realize it or not and its hurting our movement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is that so? Who is <strong><em>&quot;we&quot;</em></strong>, and what are the goals of <strong><em>&quot;our movement&quot;?</em></strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea, CNN blows, but so do the rest of them, and this is a trap, so fixate us and our culture on
Trusting Trump and his administration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has NOTHING to do with politics. What CNN did should raise the ire of ALL freedom loving people.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Branding is anti Jewish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you primary &quot;CONCERN&quot; is that people might see this sub as &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; <strong><em>(GASP!)</em></strong>, you are part of the PROBLEM, pal. </p>

<p>The right of Free Speech is no big deal. Everyone everywhere has always had that right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sort of. That VERY possible. I&#39;m simply suggesting (much like all false flags), that the events that transpired and the way the story is being presented to us, is largely fabricated.</p>

<p>Right now, TPTB and the social engineers are benefitting from fooling conspiracy theorists and our culture, into endorsing their puppet president. Some people on this sub, seem to support him, because of his opposition to the liberal media. The engineers know this. They browse these subs, they read our emails and PM&#39;s, they collect our days and have assessed this.</p>

<p>Trump is a very useful tool for them, because he&#39;s an insider, appearing to be an outsider. </p>

<p>I think this &quot;implosion of CNN and other liberal media outlets&quot; that we&#39;re seeing happening, is an orchestrated and planned series of events, that are being used to generate a partisan divide within the country, and further get us to throw our trust behind trump and his administration.</p>

<p>Look around you at all the phony ass &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; on this sub that are falling for this and taking the bait. What I&#39;m saying is, this is without a doubt, largely a fabrication. </p>

<p>You need to formulate a better theory than that.</p>

<p>You can start with the fact that you bemoaned the notion that our sub might be seen as &quot;anti-Jewish&quot;. Why does that concern you? Do you think it is important that we be seen as pro-Jewish? If so, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but with the racial hysteria that is present currently, if we were branded &quot;racist&quot; or something similar, it would immediately take Away from us and everything we stand for. People would reject us and not take us seriously. That&#39;s why there&#39;s a push to make us look anti semetic.</p>

<p>&quot;Those conspiracy people are very intelligent, and they&#39;re onto something, but that weird anti Semitism just kind of threw me off&quot;.</p>

<p>You know how sensitive and dumb people are. Shit like this can push them away from our culture. They want to brand us as racist and fringe even though we are not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then, it seems to me that the fake charge of &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; and the fake outrage associated therewith is the greater enemy, is it not?</p>

<p>I mean, if literally ANY conversation can be effectively SHUT DOWN just by playing the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; card - it quickly becomes clear that the ACCUSERS are holding all the cards, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Check out this article from today, for example:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Louisiana-congressman-breaks-rule-No-1-Don-t-11267131.php"><strong>Analysis: Louisiana congressman breaks rule No. 1: Don&#39;t make Holocaust comparisons</strong></a></p>

<p>Sorry, but enough damage has been done to the US and the whole world thanks to the free pass they get due to the &quot;victimhood&quot; melodrama game that Zionists love to play.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t kowtow to the whims of these fucking hypocrites, expose them.</p>
