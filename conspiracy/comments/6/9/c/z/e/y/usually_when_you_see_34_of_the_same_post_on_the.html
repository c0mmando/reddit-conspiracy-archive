       Now I'm seeing this "Neoliberal" shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       This place is a refuge from party politics, and TPTB know that it's dangerous because of that, with so many people rejecting the two party system of divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why they are trying to force us to
       <em>
        lean
       </em>
       or give the appearance of leaning in one particular side, which happens to be the arguably more "fringe" and radical conservative/republican/Muh Trump! Side...which doesn't make us look very good.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about sabotaging our image, and making this sub look like a circus to outsiders, so nobody even gives us a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's root out these cocksuckers and start ridiculing
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       instead. There are tons of organic users here. Fuck these shills who are actively trying to stifle constructive discussion. This is the most important period of time on earth, and these guys are shilling for the bad guys? unacceptable.

       Agreed. And the worst ones are the people that keep spamming the same pizzahoax links here dozens of times every day, day after day after day, week after week after week. They're even worse than the flat earthers.

       Pedo rings exist but Pizzagate is nothing more than a bullshit disinfo campaign full of confirmation bias used to distract people. That narrative has changed a million times and will change a million more if needed to keep the story going.

       Yes there is not much variety and posts seem to stop considering the bigger picture to certain topics and it usually turns into an unproductive argument of your wrong and I'must right.

       They don't have to force a view that this place leans. It leans pretty obviously one way. Look at the front page any given day and see what's posted, ask which way those posts lean. Same thing, go into any comment section look at the organic users, see which way they lean.

       The sub has a slant even though it's supposed to be non political. But a majority of people here only care about things if they can damage th other side. You can sat oh look at the page look at what agenda is being pushed, then obviously pizza is fake, so rose is fake, and Clinton is fake as those posts reach the front every day with tons of up votes and comments. You can't have it go both ways where it's only an agenda if you don't agree with it.

       Funny thing you say that.   I skimmed through FB and on my front page I saw an ad promoting drag queen Storytime at libraries across the US, followed by a video of a drag queen doing his makeup.  🙄🙄

       Strange thing is that during Bush's tenure I was always referred to as a crazy leftwing anarchist conspiracy hippy. Then when Obama was voted into office I apparently became a right wing conservative gun-touting hillbilly overnight.
