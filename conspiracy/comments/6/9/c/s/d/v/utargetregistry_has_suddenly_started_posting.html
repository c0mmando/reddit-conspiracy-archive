    <div class="md"><p>Here is my problem with this point of view that X-entertainment promotes evil.</p>

<p>You&#39;re definition of evil has been influenced heavily by your chosen holy book and while the Bible might not be as oppressive as the Quran, it&#39;s still oppressive and it&#39;s been edited and interpreted over the years so many times that it&#39;s become white noise.</p>

<p>These are the same people who charged Galileo with heresy because his observations of the natural world was interpretedâ€‹ as evil.  If these people think that the earth revolving around the sun is an evil concept then I frankly don&#39;t care what their opinion on sex is.</p>

<p>Did you know that there was a female pope that was edited out of existence?</p>

<p>Did you know that Jesus said (when asked about the end of the world) that &quot;All these things shall come to be before this generation has passed&quot; that&#39;s right he said the world would end before the people he was speaking to face to face had died.  And guess what? The world did end, the only world that Jesus was talking about was the world of the Jews.  It ended in 70AD when the Romans conquered it and when the Jews (see war of the Jews) destroyed their own hall of records while fighting their civil war.  Without the hall of records and proof of your Jewish linage you CAN NOT be a Jew.  Thus with the destruction of their records the Jewish people no longer exist and the Jewish world ended.</p>

<p>They burned their own Temple down, they turned their backs on Yahweh, brother killed brother and their records were destroyed.  The Romans occupied Jerusalem and the meek inherited the earth.  Anyone claiming to be a Jew today is grasping at straws and has zero evidence of their direct relation to Abraham.</p>

<p>Josephus the Jewish scholar who was alive during the war of the Jews even recorded that as the temple burned a great bellowing was heard as Yahweh departed from the temple.  </p>

<p>The Roman general that sacked Jerusalem recorded that his men attempted to extinguish the fire to save the temple and the whole thing melted like wax down to the very last stone.</p>

<p>Jesus said that not one stone would remain... Coincidence?</p>

<p>Now study the Council of Nicaea and understand that Christians as we call them today don&#39;t even know that they celebrate pagan holidays and most don&#39;t even honor the sabathe which is Saturday (sabado) not Sunday.  Hence the 7th day Adventist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said it was fiction. </p>

<p>Jesus said l these things will come to be, before this generation has passed.</p>

<p>It was a prophecy about his current time.  Not about 2000 years later.  The Bible is a closed book.  The story is over, the meek inherited the earth.</p>

<p>Now what I can prove is that almost all the current Christian holidays are actually rebranded pagan rites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends. Sometimes the goal is to just bury good comments under a sea of a stupid argument, so they will provoke an argument to ramble on on purpose and derail.</p>

<p>Other times, they won&#39;t comment at all on a thread. For example, I shared a video exposing that government paid trolls exist and it was on the front page. There wasn&#39;t a shill to be found in the comments. Why? Because they don&#39;t wanna make it obvious of their presence, in thread that specifically calls attention to them lol.</p>

<p>These guys network and talk to each other and strategize, there&#39;s a method to the madness. You spend enough time on this sub you can figure it out. </p>

<p>I specifically did <em>not</em> and have <em>not</em> submitted a second link to reddit, and you banned me anyway. Banned for one link and for asking a legit question about it. Not mature, not fair, and not becoming of someone in charge of a moderation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not mouthing off. Please show me what you mean. These are the entirety of the messages I&#39;ve sent. This was the first submission I&#39;ve made to reddit in a long time. </p>

<p>Original message, which is prompted and encouraged when a post is removed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My post was removed for being normal animal behavior, but it&#39;s not. Dogs don&#39;t normally shoot balls into people&#39;s nuts. Also, there&#39;s a front-page post of a goat pulling someone&#39;s hair, which is equally &#39;normal goat behavior&#39;. What gives?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My frustrated but still respectful reply after being accused of spamming:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll never understand why you are so hostile to original content creators, but whatever. I&#39;ll go elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After being incorrectly told that I submitted the link multiple times (I submitted once and only once):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One submission to the whole of Reddit is not spam. I submitted nowhere else on Reddit. Geez you act before you know anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then a ban, right after your reply. So, that&#39;s your definition of &#39;mouthing off&#39;? Seems a little convenient and easy to apply to anyone you don&#39;t like, instead of applying only to clear violations of policy. </p>

<p>But what do I know? I&#39;m just a person making original content who&#39;s getting banned for asking questions from a site that profits from reposting original content.....</p>

<p>My post was getting upvotes, and was enjoyable, but I get that you say it violated the rule about not being a &#39;jerk&#39; move by the animal. I asked a legit question and was told instead that I was spamming. I reply to comments and questions and participate in the community.</p>

<p>While you&#39;re here, can you please answer another legit question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the sitewide rules say nothing about not being able to submit your own original content. Please show me what you mean: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/">https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Framing up a conspiracy in order to push a religious subtext seems ingenuine. There is indeed a grand conspiracy to keep us docile productive slaves for the enrichment and empowerment of a very small group of elites. Whether it be the military industrial complex, globalists, zionists or extremely rich and deranged individuals who like to play dress up and pretend to talk to demons or the dead.  </p>

<p>But when certain posters take in the grand malfeasance it always comes back to Jesus being the solution. 
I just stop reading at this point.
That dogmatic approach makes it no different than other extremes of belief such as nationalism. This reliance on one&#39;s own groupthink provides a delivered divided populace for manipulation. 
We are all getting screwed together. 
Aren&#39;t we the most skeptical? We question the main narrative after all.</p>

<p>Other times, they won&#39;t comment at all on a thread. For example, I shared a video exposing that government paid trolls exist and it was on the front page.

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my problem with this point of view that X-entertainment promotes evil.</p>

<p>You&#39;re definition of evil has been influenced heavily by your chosen holy book and while the Bible might not be as oppressive as the Quran, it&#39;s still oppressive and it&#39;s been edited and interpreted over the years so many times that it&#39;s become white noise.</p>

<p>These are the same people who charged Galileo with heresy because his observations of the natural world was interpretedâ€‹ as evil.  If these people think that the earth revolving around the sun is an evil concept then I frankly don&#39;t care what their opinion on sex is.</p>

<p>Did you know that there was a female pope that was edited out of existence?</p>

<p>Did you know that Jesus said (when asked about the end of the world) that &quot;All these things shall come to be before this generation has passed&quot; that&#39;s right he said the world would end before the people he was speaking to face to face had died.  And guess what? The world did end, the only world that Jesus was talking about was the world of the Jews.  It ended in 70AD when the Romans conquered it and when the Jews (see war of the Jews) destroyed their own hall of records while fighting their civil war.  Without the hall of records and proof of your Jewish linage you CAN NOT be a Jew.  Thus with the destruction of their records the Jewish people no longer exist and the Jewish world ended.</p>

<p>They burned their own Temple down, they turned their backs on Yahweh, brother killed brother and their records were destroyed.  The Romans occupied Jerusalem and the meek inherited the earth.  Anyone claiming to be a Jew today is grasping at straws and has zero evidence of their direct relation to Abraham.</p>

<p>Josephus the Jewish scholar who was alive during the war of the Jews even recorded that as the temple burned a great bellowing was heard as Yahweh departed from the temple.  </p>

<p>The Roman general that sacked Jerusalem recorded that his men attempted to extinguish the fire to save the temple and the whole thing melted like wax down to the very last stone.</p>

<p>Jesus said that not one stone would remain... Coincidence?</p>

<p>Now study the Council of Nicaea and understand that Christians as we call them today don&#39;t even know that they celebrate pagan holidays and most don&#39;t even honor the sabathe which is Saturday (sabado) not Sunday.  Hence the 7th day Adventist.</p>
