       Satangate is a conspiracy theory that Satan is trying take control over the world through many covert and overt means and the easiest way to identify satans schemes, is by using the Bible.  If it is considered evil by the bible, then it is from satan.

       What if the Catholic authority at some point in history edited the religious texts to weigh things in their favor?  What if there is only a grain of truth still preserved in the Bible and the Bible itself is a part of the evil/satanic plot?

       Here's the thing, I accept the fact that people won't believe the Bible, but my faith is steadfast in God and from I can see, most forms of entertainment promotes evil, this is what I'm going to investigate.

      <p>
       Here is my problem with this point of view that X-entertainment promotes evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're definition of evil has been influenced heavily by your chosen holy book and while the Bible might not be as oppressive as the Quran, it's still oppressive and it's been edited and interpreted over the years so many times that it's become white noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the same people who charged Galileo with heresy because his observations of the natural world was interpreted​ as evil.  If these people think that the earth revolving around the sun is an evil concept then I frankly don't care what their opinion on sex is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that there was a female pope that was edited out of existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that Jesus said (when asked about the end of the world) that "All these things shall come to be before this generation has passed" that's right he said the world would end before the people he was speaking to face to face had died.  And guess what? The world did end, the only world that Jesus was talking about was the world of the Jews.  It ended in 70AD when the Romans conquered it and when the Jews (see war of the Jews) destroyed their own hall of records while fighting their civil war.  Without the hall of records and proof of your Jewish linage you CAN NOT be a Jew.  Thus with the destruction of their records the Jewish people no longer exist and the Jewish world ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       They burned their own Temple down, they turned their backs on Yahweh, brother killed brother and their records were destroyed.  The Romans occupied Jerusalem and the meek inherited the earth.  Anyone claiming to be a Jew today is grasping at straws and has zero evidence of their direct relation to Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
       Josephus the Jewish scholar who was alive during the war of the Jews even recorded that as the temple burned a great bellowing was heard as Yahweh departed from the temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Roman general that sacked Jerusalem recorded that his men attempted to extinguish the fire to save the temple and the whole thing melted like wax down to the very last stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus said that not one stone would remain... Coincidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now study the Council of Nicaea and understand that Christians as we call them today don't even know that they celebrate pagan holidays and most don't even honor the sabathe which is Saturday (sabado) not Sunday.  Hence the 7th day Adventist.

       I never said good wasn't real.  My objective was never to deny that God exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       My objective was to point out that the stories in the Bible were about people who lived 2000 years ago and beyond.  They have little to nothing to do with people today.

      <p>
       Jesus said l these things will come to be, before this generation has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a prophecy about his current time.  Not about 2000 years later.  The Bible is a closed book.  The story is over, the meek inherited the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what I can prove is that almost all the current Christian holidays are actually rebranded pagan rites.

       You do realize that what you're describing isn't even. Conspiracy theory, right? And also, that your "research" linked here appears to be some kind of Disney channel shit --- do you believe the "GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD would pick this as his tactical approach among all options (which go far beyond what people could do mind you). Honestly, you don't seem nefarious but you do seem like a total distraction from actual, discussion worthy theories here. At least quit spamming.

       It depends. Sometimes the goal is to just bury good comments under a sea of a stupid argument, so they will provoke an argument to ramble on on purpose and derail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times, they won't comment at all on a thread. For example, I shared a video exposing that government paid trolls exist and it was on the front page. There wasn't a shill to be found in the comments. Why? Because they don't wanna make it obvious of their presence, in thread that specifically calls attention to them lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys network and talk to each other and strategize, there's a method to the madness. You spend enough time on this sub you can figure it out.
      </p>

       Make them waste as much fucking time and money as possible on us. Downvote them regardless of whether or not you think it works, just do it. Fuck these guys.

       Been here a long time and have observed the same things. Nice to hear someone else talk about it rationally though. There are several discords and maybe even irc still where they coordinate. Part of me is like we should do it right back...But then you are burning resources on them.

       I agree, if we could network and strategize on how to spot them and make it a
       <strong>
        PERMANENT STICKY
       </strong>
       or something, it would help new viewers be aware. Because, the idea of "shills" is still not a mainstream concept. People don't know that the government hires paid trolls to Dick around and stifle constructive discussion on social media. We need to make that MAINSTREAM.

       I think they game harder here though. I dunno if it is because we are right sometimes, or it is more fun to troll us because we are aware. On the rest of reddit it is like punching kittens. The sickest ones probably love this place as much as we do.

       Well, to be a shill on a conspiracy sub, you have to essentially be educated as to the "conspiracy" playbook.

       These guys have to study up on what we think, what we're like. It's like being an undercover cop essentially. They have to pretend to be one of us, and there's a LOT of information here lol...

       With a few very notable exceptions that come to mind, I think most of them use kick the anthill strategy. We have our own energy and paranoia to fill in the blanks. This might even be the easiest place to troll.

       Banning someone is not a warning. Have you ever created something original? It sounds like you're just a shameless reposter who doesn't actually make anything new. If you did, you wouldn't be so harsh to people trying to make new things and not starve while doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in my very first reply, I will submit my content elsewhere. I specifically told you that I wouldn't bother you again, and you banned me anyway. What a great mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       I specifically did
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       and have
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       submitted a second link to reddit, and you banned me anyway. Banned for one link and for asking a legit question about it. Not mature, not fair, and not becoming of someone in charge of a moderation.

       This is not mouthing off. Please show me what you mean. These are the entirety of the messages I've sent. This was the first submission I've made to reddit in a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original message, which is prompted and encouraged when a post is removed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My post was removed for being normal animal behavior, but it's not. Dogs don't normally shoot balls into people's nuts. Also, there's a front-page post of a goat pulling someone's hair, which is equally 'normal goat behavior'. What gives?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My frustrated but still respectful reply after being accused of spamming:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'll never understand why you are so hostile to original content creators, but whatever. I'll go elsewhere.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After being incorrectly told that I submitted the link multiple times (I submitted once and only once):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One submission to the whole of Reddit is not spam. I submitted nowhere else on Reddit. Geez you act before you know anything.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And then a ban, right after your reply. So, that's your definition of 'mouthing off'? Seems a little convenient and easy to apply to anyone you don't like, instead of applying only to clear violations of policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what do I know? I'm just a person making original content who's getting banned for asking questions from a site that profits from reposting original content.....

       You're a tool and you weren't even banned... you got modmail muted by turtle for being dense; that's not even a ban. Read my edit above. I'm going to ban you from all my subs, and make sure the admins check your post history (including deleted posts) if you don't go fuck off now. Self promotion is against Reddit's sitewide rules, buy an ad. Nobody here cares if you starve to make content, get a real job if you can't cut it.

       From the sitewide rules:

      <blockquote>

        If you are posting your own content and other redditors appreciate and upvote your posts, you shouldn't have anything to worry about.

      <p>
       My post was getting upvotes, and was enjoyable, but I get that you say it violated the rule about not being a 'jerk' move by the animal. I asked a legit question and was told instead that I was spamming. I reply to comments and questions and participate in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you're here, can you please answer another legit question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, the sitewide rules say nothing about not being able to submit your own original content. Please show me what you mean:

       Framing up a conspiracy in order to push a religious subtext seems ingenuine. There is indeed a grand conspiracy to keep us docile productive slaves for the enrichment and empowerment of a very small group of elites. Whether it be the military industrial complex, globalists, zionists or extremely rich and deranged individuals who like to play dress up and pretend to talk to demons or the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when certain posters take in the grand malfeasance it always comes back to Jesus being the solution. 
I just stop reading at this point.
That dogmatic approach makes it no different than other extremes of belief such as nationalism. This reliance on one's own groupthink provides a delivered divided populace for manipulation. 
We are all getting screwed together. 
Aren't we the most skeptical? We question the main narrative after all.

       It depends. Sometimes the goal is to just bury good comments under a sea of a stupid argument, so they will provoke an argument to ramble on on purpose and derail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other times, they won't comment at all on a thread. For example, I shared a video exposing that government paid trolls exist and it was on the front page. There wasn't a shill to be found in the comments. Why? Because they don't wanna make it obvious of their presence, in thread that specifically calls attention to them lol.

       These guys network and talk to each other and strategize, there's a method to the madness. You spend enough time on this sub you can figure it out.

      </p>
      <p>
       You're definition of evil has been influenced heavily by your chosen holy book and while the Bible might not be as oppressive as the Quran, it's still oppressive and it's been edited and interpreted over the years so many times that it's become white noise.
      </p>

       These are the same people who charged Galileo with heresy because his observations of the natural world was interpreted​ as evil.  If these people think that the earth revolving around the sun is an evil concept then I frankly don't care what their opinion on sex is.

       Did you know that there was a female pope that was edited out of existence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that Jesus said (when asked about the end of the world) that "All these things shall come to be before this generation has passed" that's right he said the world would end before the people he was speaking to face to face had died.  And guess what? The world did end, the only world that Jesus was talking about was the world of the Jews.  It ended in 70AD when the Romans conquered it and when the Jews (see war of the Jews) destroyed their own hall of records while fighting their civil war.  Without the hall of records and proof of your Jewish linage you CAN NOT be a Jew.  Thus with the destruction of their records the Jewish people no longer exist and the Jewish world ended.

       They burned their own Temple down, they turned their backs on Yahweh, brother killed brother and their records were destroyed.  The Romans occupied Jerusalem and the meek inherited the earth.  Anyone claiming to be a Jew today is grasping at straws and has zero evidence of their direct relation to Abraham.
      </p>
      <p>
       Josephus the Jewish scholar who was alive during the war of the Jews even recorded that as the temple burned a great bellowing was heard as Yahweh departed from the temple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Roman general that sacked Jerusalem recorded that his men attempted to extinguish the fire to save the temple and the whole thing melted like wax down to the very last stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus said that not one stone would remain... Coincidence?
      </p>

       Now study the Council of Nicaea and understand that Christians as we call them today don't even know that they celebrate pagan holidays and most don't even honor the sabathe which is Saturday (sabado) not Sunday.  Hence the 7th day Adventist.
