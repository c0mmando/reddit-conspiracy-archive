       I've tripped more than a hundred times but the second to last time it was terrifying. It sentâ€‹ through like 15 different phases and i woke up in the living room still seeing things that weren't real. I even had a conversation with q fake woman. I haven't seen anything like what i saw that day. I had taken 47mg of 4-ACO-DMT. Since then I've only tried molly which was rather intense after staying away from psychs for so long, especially since it wasn't my first time and a small amount. These things feel intense in a different way. I ask so many questions and get so philosophical. I know i just sound like an average psychonaut. But it FEELS different all the time now. Like my consciousness feels like it could end any second, like someone could pull the plug. I've seen scary shit on that 4aco and i just feel like there's different types of reality. I smoke weed and question how our senses even perceive what they do thinking "why? Are there other forms of perception?" It's FUCKED me. When I was hardcore tripping, the first of many phases was this 2 frame gif of a weird jagged red green yellow pattern shifting constantly with a girl with no eyes floating and some phrase i can't remember repeating over and over. It felt like eternity and the phrase got louder and louder. I still had my consciousness and asked is this what it's like when you die? Am i dead? The phrase got louder and louder and rang my ears ( i didn't have ears or a body at all in this state but i could hear it ). My point is if you read this unorganized wall of text, life doesn't feel real anymore. Going to school doesn't feel worth it. Time's racing by and i feel like everything could just end right no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I'd like to add that i put this in conspiracy because there are many conspiracies involving spiritual enlightenment.

       Also this happened to me this past Thanksgiving. The molly was just yesterday.

       I really did use it like a tool. I love it. I just abused it. I've always had a thing for psychedelics. When i wasn't paralyzed it kept me away from the harder stuff my friends were on. I understand if it seems weird.

       It really only takes one trip fr. Bunk shit takes you where ever it wants to go. I've had the same feelings fr It's almost like constantly flipping between "disassociating"/"paranoid". I realized a lot of it was psyching myself up under the assumption that im not "right". I've had some wild acid before when my eyes were open everything was geometry with them closed it was like being stuck in a warping slinky.

       That's how it was yesterday when i took molly, regarding the psyching myself with my own thoughts. I ate something, got out of the bright lights and took a melatonin. I'm actually happy i went through with it cause now i know I'm not unable to do psychs ever again.

       Benzos are among the most addictive tier of drugs with few (if any) positive effects, and many many negative outcomes.  I would not travel this route if you're looking to dig out of depression.

       It's not really depression i have. I don't wanna die. Infact im afraid to die now. Before this happened i already went into cardiac arrest and was dead for two minutes so i didn't think much of it. Now though i know i wanna live. It's more like a confusion when thinking about reality. But anyway i very rarely use benzos so  i think I'll be okay

       I would recommend staying away from molly. The market has been flooded with synthetic substitutes in the past few years to the point where real MDMA is nearly impossible to find. They look and taste like the real thing, but are usually in the same class of chemicals as "bath salts".

       Good choice. It's been almost 3 years since my last real dosing. I might again in the future, but it's taken this time to get over a very heavy mushroom trip. 47 mg sounds
       <em>
        insane

       , coming from someone who knows people who dose 25 mg and can barely stand up.

       Yeah, i read about it for months beforehand and thought i knew. I allergy tested it and took a small dose. It made my stomach upset and the larger dose i talked about in this post made me throw up and unable to eat for three days. It was irresponsible but i three out the last 30+ doses. Didn't want anyone else seeing what i saw.

       I've had my hand full of experiences with psychs.
It's been 5 months sense I've last tripped and that was before I was 'Red pilled' and woke up.
I can't imagine the type of conspiracies and connections my mind would spawn if I ever tripped again.
That's why I stick to micro doses now.
But if I were you I would consider cutting all substances out of your life for awhile, at least until you feel 'normal' again.

       Well I'll probably still smoke since it's gotten easier. I can tell you, sometimes depending who you're with, conspiracies can be really fun. Especially on LSD. I'm not encouraging and don't want you to ever go through what i went through but if you're responsible you'll truly open your third eye.

       That feeling will pass. Glad you came back. I've had friends that didnt. Here's a cold hard fact and this isn't meant to scare you or bum you out so don't take it this way. Truth is your life could end at any second. It's probably not going to but the reality is it could. Anything could happen. But. Don't stop moving forward. Or school or work. When you trip on anything it takes you on a deep ride. Feels like a lifetime in 4 to 8 hrs. Let this feeling settle. Let it teach you. There is meaning. Take the negative and flip it. Yes life is fragile and we are just a blip. And we see everyday peoples lives ending. Let that knowledge of you can be here one minute and gone the next push you. Motivate you to do your best. Get the most out of life and most importantly treasure those people in your life and be good to them. They matter to you. You matter to them and someday you and they will be gone. So don't waste time. Don't spend time on petty arguments. Forgive when they hurt you and ask for forgiveness when you hurt them.
      </p>

       Last stay away from MDMA in any form. I danced with it back in my "party days" and I have mostly recovered. I went through some deep depression because of it. Depression sucks your life away. Literally. Excersize more. Eat better. Learn to cook. Let other things give you and satisfy your needs. Those will last longer anywy. Take care. Take some vitamins man you probably all sorts empty of the vitamins and minerals. Stay safe. You're loved. Plenty of life to experience and not just within your own mind!

       I've come close with death. Very very close, many times. I hadn't begun to cherish it until i became afraid of it. I'm kind of glad i did though. Maybe this experience was for the better. Maybe it's just another accolade for the wisdom wall. I'm actually paralyzed below the shoulders so unfortunately I'm unable to do these things you've listed, however, i have learned how to enjoy the simple things in life. I guess you can probably see how in my state drugs are an escape from the repeat of Internet and TV. I'll have to find a way to spice things up without these crazy drugs. Maybe going back to school would be better. Thank you for your encouragement.

       My arms don't work, don't feel like you're being intrusive, it's a fair question. I wish i could honestly. I've found out how to use my tongue on my phone to play some games (i know it sounds weird but I've got to improvise). It's difficult to occupy myself but that's probably why I've got such a tan now.

       Lay off the mind altering substances for a bit. Ground yourself.

       Ask yourself how many trippers do you know older than 30?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is psychedelics change as you get older. Older people like myself, had to stop, because bad trips become more common as you age. Part of the reason why is age= exsperience=emotional baggage.
Maybe its time to give it up...100Ã— seems like its outlived its purpose and now you get to exsperience the torture of bad trips..
Ask yourself...how many older people do you know who regularly do phycodelics?

       Well to be honest I'm eighteen if that puts into perspective how often i use to trip. I've also tried many different kinds. Most of it was me being irresponsible but it was getting harder when i would do shrooms or anything truly challenging. I don't wanna be done forever but I'll definitely try to leave psychs alone for a couple years and maybe microdose some LSD.

       Personaly, stick with mushrooms, then you know for sure its not synthetics.. my head buzzed for two years after synthetics..its not worth the risk!!!  Even of youre promised the LsD is real, it isnt.
LSD is a huge complicated process needing  large volumes of wierd ingredients....Nbombs cost pennies...there is no real lsd out on the market anymore..thats a fact

       You've been dosing way too often in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly we cannot treat these drugs recreationally, although I do understand why people do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can have lifetime affects on your perception and outlook on life, and it's not something you want to be doing
       <em>
        a couple times a month
       </em>
       !
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to give yourself time to process your trip. Break it down and see why you were given this experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't get too spiritual with you because I don't know what you're comfortable with, but let's just say you need to really think about what you saw last time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't mean the visuals or the disturbing imagery. I mean, you realized the impermanence of our nature. The impermanence of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that we could all die at any moment, but it's another thing to
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       it. Psychedelics bring our heart and mind together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please try not to despair now that things are different. Try to find peace in rituals and reflection. I'm here if you need to talk.

       I've gotten spiritual but i suppose that is my past. I appreciate your suggestions. Many people have said to meditate and try to recreationally rehabilitate. I'll definitely find time to. I'm not sitting here going crazy. I don't hear voices. I know what's going on around me and what's real and isn't. It just feels different. At least I've got my sanity. I'll extend my psychedelic sobriety and do some soul-searching.
