        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve tripped more than a hundred times but the second to last time it was terrifying. It sentâ€‹ through like 15 different phases and i woke up in the living room still seeing things that weren&#39;t real. I even had a conversation with q fake woman. I haven&#39;t seen anything like what i saw that day. I had taken 47mg of 4-ACO-DMT. Since then I&#39;ve only tried molly which was rather intense after staying away from psychs for so long, especially since it wasn&#39;t my first time and a small amount. These things feel intense in a different way. I ask so many questions and get so philosophical. I know i just sound like an average psychonaut. But it FEELS different all the time now. Like my consciousness feels like it could end any second, like someone could pull the plug. I&#39;ve seen scary shit on that 4aco and i just feel like there&#39;s different types of reality. I smoke weed and question how our senses even perceive what they do thinking &quot;why? Are there other forms of perception?&quot; It&#39;s FUCKED me. When I was hardcore tripping, the first of many phases was this 2 frame gif of a weird jagged red green yellow pattern shifting constantly with a girl with no eyes floating and some phrase i can&#39;t remember repeating over and over. It felt like eternity and the phrase got louder and louder. I still had my consciousness and asked is this what it&#39;s like when you die? Am i dead? The phrase got louder and louder and rang my ears ( i didn&#39;t have ears or a body at all in this state but i could hear it ). My point is if you read this unorganized wall of text, life doesn&#39;t feel real anymore. Going to school doesn&#39;t feel worth it. Time&#39;s racing by and i feel like everything could just end right no.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d like to add that i put this in conspiracy because there are many conspiracies involving spiritual enlightenment.</p>

<p>Also this happened to me this past Thanksgiving. The molly was just yesterday.</p>

It&#39;s been 5 months sense I&#39;ve last tripped and that was before I was &#39;Red pilled&#39; and woke up.
I can&#39;t imagine the type of conspiracies and connections my mind would spawn if I ever tripped again.
That&#39;s why I stick to micro doses now.
But if I were you I would consider cutting all substances out of your life for awhile, at least until you feel &#39;normal&#39; again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That feeling will pass. Glad you came back. I&#39;ve had friends that didnt. Here&#39;s a cold hard fact and this isn&#39;t meant to scare you or bum you out so don&#39;t take it this way. Truth is your life could end at any second. It&#39;s probably not going to but the reality is it could. Anything could happen. But. Don&#39;t stop moving forward. Or school or work. When you trip on anything it takes you on a deep ride. Feels like a lifetime in 4 to 8 hrs. Let this feeling settle. Let it teach you. There is meaning. Take the negative and flip it. Yes life is fragile and we are just a blip. And we see everyday peoples lives ending. Let that knowledge of you can be here one minute and gone the next push you. Motivate you to do your best. Get the most out of life and most importantly treasure those people in your life and be good to them. They matter to you. You matter to them and someday you and they will be gone. So don&#39;t waste time. Don&#39;t spend time on petty arguments. Forgive when they hurt you and ask for forgiveness when you hurt them. </p>

<p>Last stay away from MDMA in any form. I danced with it back in my &quot;party days&quot; and I have mostly recovered. I went through some deep depression because of it. Depression sucks your life away. Literally. Excersize more. Eat better. Learn to cook. Let other things give you and satisfy your needs. Those will last longer anywy. Take care. Take some vitamins man you probably all sorts empty of the vitamins and minerals. Stay safe. You&#39;re loved. Plenty of life to experience and not just within your own mind!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself how many trippers do you know older than 30?</p>

<p>My point is psychedelics change as you get older. Older people like myself, had to stop, because bad trips become more common as you age. Part of the reason why is age= exsperience=emotional baggage.
Maybe its time to give it up...100Ã— seems like its outlived its purpose and now you get to exsperience the torture of bad trips..
Ask yourself...how many older people do you know who regularly do phycodelics? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve been dosing way too often in my opinion. </p>

<p>Honestly we cannot treat these drugs recreationally, although I do understand why people do it. </p>

<p>They can have lifetime affects on your perception and outlook on life, and it&#39;s not something you want to be doing <em>a couple times a month</em>!</p>

<p>You need to give yourself time to process your trip. Break it down and see why you were given this experience. </p>

<p>I won&#39;t get too spiritual with you because I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re comfortable with, but let&#39;s just say you need to really think about what you saw last time. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean the visuals or the disturbing imagery. I mean, you realized the impermanence of our nature. The impermanence of life. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to <em>know</em> that we could all die at any moment, but it&#39;s another thing to <em>feel</em> it. Psychedelics bring our heart and mind together.</p>

<p>Please try not to despair now that things are different. Try to find peace in rituals and reflection. I&#39;m here if you need to talk. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with this:</p>
