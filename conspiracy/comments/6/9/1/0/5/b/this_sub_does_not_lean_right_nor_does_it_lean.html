        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: The context are the numerous comments in other threads trying to dismiss this subreddit as &#39;right wing&#39;</p>

<p>And here is some content:</p>

<p>Pride is concerned with <em>who</em> is right </p>

<p>Humility is concerned with <em>what</em> is right.</p>

<p>Even if you prove that this sub or anyone else &#39;leans&#39; a certain way, following that up with anything that resembles &#39;therefore they are wrong&#39; is a non sequitor.</p>

<p>EDIT2: &#39;What is the conspiracy?&#39; you ask? </p>

<p>The conspiracy is that outside forces are attempting to convince people that this subreddit has a specific political leaning. The end goal of this is that partisans loyal to the other side feel like they don&#39;t have to consider the issues.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton has been using this same exact tactic since the 90&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vast_right-wing_conspiracy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vast_right-wing_conspiracy</a></p>

<p>Now, instead of saying it on TV, she has paid shills here promoting it. They and the useful idiots they&#39;ve talked into being their parrots.</p>

<p>This sub talks about 9/11 almost daily. Bill O&#39;Reilly, W., and others called 9/11 conspiracy &quot;far left conspiracies.&quot;</p>

<p>Even the Trump-Russia connections, which I am still not personally convinced of, do not deserve to be dismissed as &quot;far left conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>And ironically, for a sub devoted towards conspiracies, a large part of the user base continues to downplay or ignore the largest conspiracy unfolding before our very eyes - the Russian hacking scandal. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying everyone should believe it or that we shouldn&#39;t be skeptical, but you&#39;d think an actual conspiracy theory would gain a little bit more traction in a sub devoted towards conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Dude, I saw it with my own eyes. All you have to do is compare conspiracy posts and comments from before the election and after the election but before the Syria bombings to see the difference. Just because what I have to say is inconvenient for your narrative doesn&#39;t make it untrue. </p>

<p>What evidence? All I see are ad hominem attacks. &quot;Because it came from the intelligence community, that proves its untrue,&quot; &quot;Because the documents were leaked to NYT/WaPo/Buzzfeed that proves it&#39;s untrue,&quot; &quot;Because if it were true it would help Hillary and hurt Trump it must be untrue,&quot; &quot;Well Alex Jones said...&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not evidence. And guess what - truth doesn&#39;t have to be binary: if it helps Hillary then it must be put out by her side and therefore be false. Sometimes truth can be complicated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is a lot of evidence. The problem is, everyone chooses to believe that the evidence isn&#39;t credible. Now why are they choosing to believe that? Some of the evidence is coming from the intelligence community that this subreddit is naturally skeptical of. Some of this evidence is coming from foreign allies, whom this sub is skeptical of because (((globalism))). Other evidence comes from documents leaked to the mainstream media, whom this subreddit is also skeptical of. </p>

<p>The problem is, since this sub discounts all these sources, that evidence isn&#39;t good enough in their eyes. CNN, the intellegince community, and foreign allies are all in on it together in their POV. The problem is, what if one of these sources actually is telling the truth? Since you discount them, you&#39;re also going to discount their evidence, and everytime that evidence is brought up, it&#39;s going to reinforce your belief that it&#39;s fake.  </p>

<p>So who does that leave? Wikileaks, InfoWars, Breitbart, and other alternative, out of the mainstream media sites. Basically media sources who&#39;ve all endorsed or been co-opted by the alternative right. </p>

<p>So your choice is now the media biased towards the guy in power, or the media source biased towards the other guys in other positions of power. </p>

<p>No idea.</p>

<p>To start with, we&#39;re going to have to take something as an axiom. It should be self-evident, but it&#39;s safer to state it: that Clinton should know that when something is marked &quot;classified,&quot; it means it&#39;s classified. Similarly, we have to assume that she knows that stripping classified headers of an email and redistributing it is a gigantic no-no. I don&#39;t anticipate that these assumptions should be difficult to swallow, however, as they&#39;re all security clearance 101. (And if you&#39;re saying that Clinton has literally decades of experience, yet she still somehow doesn&#39;t know what &quot;classified&quot; means, then clearly she&#39;s unfit to even be an office assistant.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the only one focused on Hillary losing and you&#39;re the only one who keeps bringing it up! Check my comments - I don&#39;t care! </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to live in a world where there&#39;s evidence that Trump did bad things not because Hillary&#39;s secret cabal is making it up to discredit him, but because he&#39;s actually done bad things! It&#39;s possible to dislike Trump not because of a love for Clinton, but because of Trump&#39;s actions. </p>

<p>Just the other day his administration implicitly said they were looking into ways to weaken the first amendment! I don&#39;t need to love Hillary to be angry about that. I don&#39;t care who won or lost the 2016 election - I love free speech either way! </p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem: the world isn&#39;t as simple as &quot;If you dislike Trunp, then you must love Hillary, and therefore Hillary losing is motivating all of your animosity.&quot; It&#39;s perfectly cogent to feel animus towards Trump because of the malevolent things he is doing! Like acting like an authoritarian! Like trying to weaken the Constitution and Bill of Rights! Like claiming large crowd sizes that didn&#39;t exist and we know because we have fucking photographs of both inaugurations. </p>

<p>Like world isn&#39;t black and white. Politics isn&#39;t just you love Hillary and Trump, or you love Trump and hate Hillary. Just because evidence hurts or helps one side doesn&#39;t make it fake. Sometimes inconvenient truths do exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Really? He&#39;s increased the federal deficit, he&#39;s increased military spending, he&#39;s filled his administration with ex-Goldman Sach&#39;s employees and executives, he&#39;s mishandling classified information, his administration is using texting apps to get around federal record keeping laws, he&#39;s using the power of the office to lead a mole hunt against a tweeter, and he&#39;s acting like a Neocon when it comes to foreign policy. He&#39;s basically Hillary Clinton. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the problem. I&#39;d show you the DNI report and you&#39;d discount it for not being credible. I&#39;d show the the numerous WaPo and NYT articles filled with anonymous sources within his administration and you&#39;d call it fake news. I could bring up the Flynn Immunity letter and you&#39;d explain away how he&#39;s not actually asking for immunity and it&#39;s really 5D chess. </p>

<p>So how about this:</p>

<p>You give me your criteria for what counts as evidence. </p>

And thank you for correctly calling the Rothschilds what they are. That one gets a lot of heat these days, as I suppose it always will given the constant propaganda. The moment we can all come together with a consensus that it&#39;s not left vs right, D vs R, race vs race, etc., that&#39;s when we&#39;ll start making real, lasting change. It&#39;s the elite few, and those who wish to join them, vs everyone else. Period. And they do all they can to distract us from that simple fact.</p>

<p>I can be intrigued by conspiracy thinking because I think it&#39;s fun and interesting to be that crazy guy with thumbtacks, newspaper clippings, and strings on the wall - but atleast that crazy guy has some shreds of evidence to display rather than &quot;obvious&quot; bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right there is a cross over.
The issue is many people who like Trump like all sheep can&#39;t see he is a puppet and throw away their political bias and misinformation.</p>

<p>The ill-teachings of the propaganda machine force people to deny credibility if it doesn&#39;t fit their agenda. (Divide) and that allows the same puppet bullshit to repeat while the perps get their way (conquer) </p>

<p>America is dead. It&#39;s a &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#39;s&quot; type situation.  America fell long ago and has been held up by &quot;friends&quot; in order to get his money, his influence, his army...all for personal gain.</p>

<p>And we were warned, we were told who the culprits would be. And we let them in with open arms. 
The Zionists have killed America have poisoned the American Politicians with their greed and need for power.</p>

<p>We now fight wars for our Zionist masters to bring forth &quot;the greater Israel Project&quot; feed them gold and power. 
We shouldn&#39;t fear a NWO we should over throw it. 
Because a NWO is what&#39;s needed, we NEED to kill the Hydra. Why do you think they spread their central banks to every country possible as fast as possible.
Take off 1 head..... The Zionists must die, Israel must be left to fend for itself with the trillions it&#39;s been given and be told to cooperate. America backing Israel due to Zionism is why the peace in the middle east has failed.</p>

<p>We allow them to occupy land, we topple governments that do not attack us. All in the name of Zionism. Through lies. GWB and Hillary and Trump and every last politician and Rothschild need to be taken in the night, assets frozen, and slowly hanged one by one in a show of force and freedom. Take back the gold, redistribute the ill gotten wealth. Fund schools, fund healthcare, fund the right to live and work FOR THE PEOPLE. </p>

<p>It is not &quot;what can I do for my government&quot; it&#39;s what does the government do for you. That&#39;s their job, WORK FOR YOU. Public Servants. 
The country does for itself, it funds itself, the government is supposed to be the middle man. Taking the taxes, redistributing it to bettering the American people. That&#39;s how we got to space, that&#39;s how we got to where we are.
And we have plateaued because it stopped. </p>

<p>Make America Great Again? America has never been great not once in the history of it. We killed native people, we held slaves, we created internment camps, we propagate wars where the poor die hoping to make a better life for themselves all at the Beck and call of the rich because the RICH want more they have beef with others.</p>

<p>We need to suffocate this, teach that history is not something to be repeated and focus on bettering America.</p>

<p>In 100 years time, we will have flying cars, space travel, renewable energy abundance, first world internet.
We do not invest in our future, we invest in death and greed. </p>

<p>It got upvoted by the massive influx of t_d and people still sucking at Trump&#39;s nob. It&#39;s getting called out because people are tired of being t_d2 </p>

<p>This sub isn&#39;t even conspiracies half the time. It&#39;s Breitbart/Fox news type sourced info bashing every Democrat possible.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything about McConnel and friends trying to kill Net Neutrality (technology is bringing to light more worthy conspiracy type shit) or people bashing Trump for his bs. </p>

<p>Where&#39;s all that &quot;drain the swamp&quot; or &quot;lock her up&quot; shit now? Trump has done fuck all since he&#39;s been pres.
Hell he skipped the correspondent dinner. Then hailed himself as a hero at a rally while Fox bashed everyone there who made fun of him.</p>

<p>Yet, they clearly don&#39;t remember when Obama did it. It&#39;s basically a roast, but we gonna demonize people because lol agenda. </p>

<p>I&#39;m ready to pitchfork march on Fox and every other mainstream news outlet. Filling heads with bs propaganda.
We need to take back our country but everyone is a bunch of subdued pussies. </p>

<p>&quot;But we has freedom, I&#39;m not hiding anything let them in my phone lulz what are you a criminal!? Why care hurr durr&quot; America is quickly becoming   idiocracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of censorship, what do you propose the mods do to control this issue?</p>

<p>The community of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> takes censorship very seriously - so much so that they rarely if ever remove posts. </p>

<p>Mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have taken a lot of time and effort to make reddit more transparent. For example, I wrote the code that initially populated <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> with posts that were censored from other subs. Other mods/community members, like <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> and <a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a> also made and continue to make huge contributions to Reddit transparency and anti-censorship. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the mod team over there would LOVE to hear your suggestions, and better still, have your help, in balancing things with transparency to the community, and without censorship. </p>

<p>Nothing. Let the free hand of karma decide what gets upvoted and what gets downvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave you my answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do nothing. Let bottom up solutions rise to the surface, rather than implementing top-down change. Not every problem calls for mod fiat. </li>
</ul>

<p>Alternative solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hold stick-post townhalls to discuss the issues and see what users say. </p></li>
<li><p>Do strawpolls. </p></li>
<li><p>Do a discussion once a week on topics that are critical of the current people in positions of authority. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, be creative. Test things out. Keep the community informed. Explain why you&#39;re doing the things you&#39;re doing. Keep the things that work. Toss out the things that don&#39;t. </p>

<p>None of these solutions are quick fixes that will fix the problem overnight. But they do set the community on the road for long-term, sustainable solutions. </p>

<p>To respond to a point you raised, I&#39;m not saying that the mods should go off and start their own new subreddits. I&#39;m saying if current conspriacy members dislike the shift in tone, they&#39;re free to start their own subreddit. Competition will figure things out. Maybe the solution is an alternative conspiracy subreddit that&#39;s more skeptical of the Trump administration. Users will be free to choose which subreddit best fits their tastes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To respond to you directly about moderation styles, I find that what you are advocating is simply anarchy. Moderation should be swift and brutal in my opinion. I never used that style except for a few bad apples in the beginning, but it worked great. When the users started demanding we take no actions at all, that is when the trolls overtook this sub. In the case of Trump always rising to the top, that falls into bipartisan American politics. I don&#39;t think censorship there would have been appropriate. But this total anarchy that you suggest is feckless and gives the sub to the swine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was never my experience while serving as a mod.

<p>I can&#39;t think of a single sub that made moderation logs/activities public, other than <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Reddit changed their mod API and prevented this from being done simply.. maybe it&#39;s possible again, it&#39;s been a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely.</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; are fairly diverse on the left right spectrum, thought often further to one side or the other.</p>

<p>Where they are generally MORE united in the up/down on the multi-dimensional models- which often refers to authoritarianism vs libertarianism.  Though as conspiracy theorists become more reactive to the existential threat (generally applied to right-wing reactives), they sometimes DO promote authoritarian practices to rid the system of the encroaching &quot;other&quot;.  </p>

<p>A good example is with Globalism, which &quot;personal freedom&quot; minded people see as authoritarian, dishonest and overly centralized/ automated- causing people to react in a populist and right-wing manner.  But this nationalist increasing of border security &quot;inadvertently&quot; leads to a more heavy handed domestic militarization.  This seems to be the dichotomy the system plays on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was frustrating to see so much pro-trump commenting prior the elections given his authoritarian rhetoric, which flies in the face of much of what this sub generally espouses.</p>

<p>And the fact the the TD sub is managed by the well-documented anti-conspiracy zionist propaganda crew.  To an extent, they managed to coopt some of the messaging we&#39;ve been promoting here for a while, and use it in conjunction with memes to create &quot;the depolorables&quot;.  </p>

<p>Remember that this is also what they did last election cycle when they created the new Tea Party.  Talking heads like Glenn Beck took Alex Jones and Ron Paul-style right-wing libertarian/JBS Society/ Patriot Movement rhetoric, and applied to to neocon zionist propaganda to siphon off supporters.</p>

<p>So I understand why people associate this sub with the donald folks- there IS a lot of crossover.  I think it&#39;s been intentionally set up that way and you can look at very specific agents who have worked to make that happen.</p>

<p>well that just ignores the reality of history.</p>

<p>Presidents always have conspiracy theories , especially when it comes to leaks. The same way the expected president, Hillary Clinton, was issuing conspiracy theories about Russian Hacks-  Who do you think Nixon blamed for the Pentagon Papers, beyond Ellsberg?</p>

They&#39;re just wild yet vague assertions tossed together with words like &#39;globalist&#39; to pander to keen voting demographics. And he&#39;s hardly the first to think of doing such a thing-- his technique has been old hat politics for years.

<p>Donald trump is a professional scammer who admitted, on a nationally televised debate, to gaming the US economic system to enrich himself at the expense of less fortunate people because it &quot;wasn&#39;t illegal&quot;.

<p>Which is just as innocuous, in context, as the one of hillary that someone has posted without context. Which I believe was his point. Someone took a photo, made up a headline, and didn&#39;t add any context and it was top post (again, not sure which photo he used but am pretty sure from talking to him it was something similar he used to make a point about posting made up bs) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was after someone rushed the stage. Hillary has been on camera falling from just walking, always using a handrail to get up the stairs and has had (I think) 3 concussions all from falls. So it&#39;s much easier to believe.</p>

<p>Hillary has also been involved in the establishment for much longer and has been on camera committing perjury. People rail against her more because SHE IS STILL GETTING AWAY WITH IT. </p>

<p>And since nothing is being done about it I am much more skeptical of Trump than before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, not sure if that was the actual photo he used.</p>

<p>The point he was trying to make stands though. Some folks were making up shit regarding hillary based on a photo to troll/etc and the mods let it stand. But his photo wasn&#39;t allowed to (and, as noted elsewhere, the photo of her in question had nothing to do with her health either - but mods allowed it even when it was debunked).</p>

<p>The issue here is one of consistency by the mods and some users. And that pans out today with how the mods have treated some threads over time differently when they came to trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK and that argument made sense before the election. I hate Presidential dynasties, it goes against the entire point of a democracy.</p>

<p>But Hillary&#39;s done. You can have voted for trump thinking he would do well and still see and accept that he is completely incompetent. The man has accidentally blocked his own executive orders. He bombed Syria and said Iraq (an accident but a diplomatically significant one when you&#39;re the president). He is on pace to spend more money on vacations in one year than Obama did in eight. And all of that taxpayer money he&#39;s spending is going right back into his own pocket.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to say Trump supporters shouldn&#39;t have seen this coming, but it&#39;s here now, regardless. Sticking your heads in the sand isn&#39;t going to help.</p>

<p>It the same here. You get rw&#39;ers running about claiming everyone is a shill and brigading when you know it has been mostly from the donald and allowed here by right leaning mods.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. This is something I always try and get across. &quot;Conspiracy&quot; might as well be a form of radical philosophy. It is outside of the normal spectrum on politics most are used to. You as an individual can be left leaning or right leaning but to practice the kind of philosophy associated with conspiracy is to look past all of that. It is about truth for us. Now that doesnt mean there arent leftist or right conspiracies, but as long as you prescribe to just one you are holding your self back from really seeing the big picture.</p>

<p>No, a conspiracy is nothing more than a secret plan (or plotting) by two or more people, to do something harmful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MSM, Academia, corporate agendas, official government statements, general public consensous ect. Conspiritorial thinking is generally counter to all of these and gets dismissed as nonsense. Fuck, even showing people official declassified documents people will still sometimes shake their heads because it is uncomfortable to know that those they have grown up trusting are not actually what they claim to be. You realize much of it is spectacle. Just to get people started the first thing I point to is usually the hillary wall street speech where she talks about how all of the above mentioned enterprises must maintain public and private agendas, literally they must conspire to act outside of what the official statements are to stay ahead of their competition.</p>

Pizzagate is a tangled mess of legit concerns and the attendant psyops and disinfo used to combat the attention into the very real parts of it.  Yes, some people were making shit up, either for shiggles or because it was their job to discredit and distract the legit parts of the investigations.

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe it&#39;s just disagreement about what &quot;pizzagate&quot; is, then, because the voat community is dedicated to uncovering high level sex trafficking.   Which is really all that matters.  There are a lot of sincere people there doing good work.   I&#39;d even concede that &quot;pizzagate&quot; as many seem to understand it is mostly bullshit, which is why the honest investigators have shifted to talking about it as &quot;pedogate.&quot;  But there is overlap and the whole thing is squirrely as fuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show me a victim, show me their family, show me an official investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If these things were at hand, it wouldn&#39;t be a conspiracy theory any more.  And in terms of the Alefantis / Comet Pizza angle I doubt you will ever see any of that, either because there&#39;s nothing there or because it&#39;s all covered up too well.  (My hunch is Alefantis is involved in something shady, but maybe it&#39;s just money laundering or something — and he clearly has powerful friends who are protecting him very well whether or not he has done anything wrong.)</p>

<p>But if you expand out to the Franklin Scandal, Hastert, Dutroux affair, etc. etc. ... there are plenty of victims and investigations to discuss, and to me they&#39;re all under the same umbrella.</p>

<p>I doubt exactly this. I dont think there is any sincerity in their motivations nor is it &quot;really&quot; about sex trafficking. Rather it is about linking the worst thing u can imagine with people considered as the enemy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s boatloads of people there, and some of them are probably exactly what you say.  But many of them are horribly sincere.  I don&#39;t actively participate in the current research because it is psychologically draining, and lots of people have burnt out and given up.</p>

<p>For the record, Bernie was my favored Lesser Evil this go-round, I voted for Obama, hate Trump&#39;s guts, don&#39;t WANT to believe any of this shit is real, but I find the evidence is overwhelming... if you actually look into it.  But who wants to do that when it&#39;s all so sick and you&#39;re inclined to think like you just said you do?  I get it.  It&#39;s a lot easier to go with that doubt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to start a whole kerfuffle about it when it&#39;s kind of off topic here, but if you have any specific followup questions or whatever feel free to message me.</p>

<p>Alternative, this podcast about Dennis Hastert is pretty eye-opening for the uninitiated, came out long before pi**agate was a thing, and shows that it&#39;s not just a partisan issue.  <a href="http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2016/05/04/processing-distortion-with-peter-b-collins-hastert-coverup-cemented-in-place/">http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2016/05/04/processing-distortion-with-peter-b-collins-hastert-coverup-cemented-in-place/</a></p>

<p>Source for big contributors who are self described neo-nazis? </p>

<p>...Not that it really matters in the big picture--there are self described flat earthers and other &#39;fringe&#39; users in this sub too, just like any other sub. I enjoy the variety of commenters, even if I think some of them have shitty paradigms.</p>

<p>Exactly. What you describe probably happens more often than we&#39;d like to think. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to gauge to the true political leanings of a sub with nearly half a million subscribers that any nameless, faceless redditor can comment and or troll and or shill in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a bit of general information for you:</p>

<p>Right wing ideology is 100% conspiracy minded. You think the KKK operates on rational thought and peer reviewed science? You think some inbred racist would rather believe in his/her race&#39;s superiority over all other races(even though there is only one race of humans on this planet) because of LOGIC?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be dense. The core of EVERY conspiracy forum/group are extremists and it has been this way for decades. &quot;Conservative&quot;(read: right) wing religious, mentally and intellectually challenged idiots are the foremost champions of conspiracy theories. Even in other countries it&#39;s fundamentalists and religious zealots that push conspiracy theories as facts.</p>

<p>in t_d implies that &gt;71% of this sub&#39;s users are posters in t_d and an even higher percentage lurk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to assume that over 3/4 of this sub are in some way involved in t_d.</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to assume that not all right-leaning r/conspiracy posters are fans of t_d.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A conspirator is a person who is engaged in a conspiracy. If you meant &quot;a conspiracy theorist should never trust the government,&quot; then I agree. There is a problem though. A lot of users falsely believe that mistrust of mainstream media claims about Trump automatically makes a person pro-Trump. This is false. A conspiracy theorist should also not trust what the mainstream media is pushing. It&#39;s totally possible to have a distrust of both the media and the government. </p>

<p>I had a similar issue in another subreddit where people were calling others &quot;alt right&quot; or nazis because they were criticizing leftwing media at the time. Going through their user histories showed they criticized both left and right media. Some people tend to fall into one extreme position and forget that there are all of these other people out there who are independent or on a reasonable part of the spectrum. </p>

<p>While we are discussing myths, another myth in here is that shills are all either Russian or &quot;Correct The Record.&quot; I see a lot of misguided discussion of shills in this thread.  In reality, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j1y5la6q&amp;amp;sh=75667764">there are <strong>tons</strong> of organizations out there that hire shills, both corporate and government,</a> from both sides.

<p>It is my perception that Hillary and her campaign staff are the progenitors of this particular conspiracy.</p>

<p>Just like in the reverse situation, it was clear that right wingers were trying to smear Obama and Hillary in 2012 over Benghazi. I defended Hillary then, because I wasn&#39;t being presented with any convincing, nonpartisan evidence.</p>

<p>When it is an election year, and there is clear motive for an out-there narrative that is being pushed, you should always be careful in forming a concrete opinion over it.</p>

<p>If anything, being anti-Hillary is proof that I stand by the original post. I am still registered as a Democrat, I voted for Obama twice, and voted for Bernie.</p>

<p>But sure. Continue to prove my point by asserting through awful logic that I am some sort of hypocrite.</p>

<p>Yes, I linked to Breitbart, but not as a <em>source</em>.</p>

<p>The Breitbart article included quotes from a book written by one of Hillary&#39;s staffers. That book is the primary source, not the Breitbart article.</p>

<p>If I could&#39;ve linked directly to the quotes inside the book, or to a left-leaning page that quoted it, I would have.</p>

<p>I avoid linking to Breitbart whenever I can, for precisely the reason that you have just demonstrated. People jump at the chance to attack the <em>who</em> instead of the <em>what</em>.</p>

<p>And yet, somehow, magically, I&#39;m still the one who isn&#39;t being objective here.</p>

<p>You accused someone that cared about Trump&#39;s connection with Russia, and a conspiracy surrounding it, with being a literal paid Clinton shill out of nowhere. The issue is a Trump issue, you dismissed it with an accusation.</p>

<p>You said, in response, this:</p>

<p>&#39;the russians&#39; didn&#39;t hack anything but there&#39;s enough collusion with russia and the current admin to raise questions and a money trail that is most definitely worth a follow up considering Syria is sitting exactly where two pipelines are proposed to be built and Exxon is deep in Russia and wanting more.

<p>No disrespect, OP, but bullshit.  Fuck the wind.  <em>You</em> might lean against the wind, but don&#39;t speak for everyone here.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#39;t.</p>

<p>I lean (or at least very much <em>try</em> to lean) on the TRUTH.  That&#39;s what everyone should be leaning on, I feel.  The wind is willy nilly - as such, <em>that</em> should definitely not be what one leans on.  One should lean on the <em>truth</em> - whatever it might be.</p>

<p>Just like the truth about the Trump-Russia connections right? </p>

<p>So you would argue that we need more transparency about this? Ranging from Trump and Kushner&#39;s tax returns to a full investigation into people like Carter Page, Paul Manafort? </p>

<p>Or pay-to-play? Like the Devos family? And the blatant nepotism that directly bypasses the middlemen to direct corruption for personal gain?</p>

<p>I agree OP. We really do need to get the truth. Advocating for transparency from our current White House is important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this used to be true.</p>

<p>I think the prevailing philosophy here is &quot;anti-establishment&quot;, and has been a for a long time. Whatever anyone&#39;s personal political leanings, we gravitate toward leaders/thinkers who not only challenge the status quo, but want it overturned.</p>

<p>The split in this sub comes here: <strong>Is Donald Trump anti-establishment, or not</strong>? As a long-time lurker/poster, I can tell you that this has politicized the sub in an unprecedented fashion, and the center of gravity has shifted beneath our feet. As far as the sub&#39;s general opinion of Trump, I&#39;d say the timeline goes thusly:</p>

<p><strong>June 2015 - December 2015 (roughly)</strong>: <strong><em>Mostly Anti-Trump</em></strong>. With Trump&#39;s entry into the presidential fray, I think most people here discounted him as a buffoon and a distraction. Best case scenario, he was an outsider &quot;celebrity&quot; candidate who may make some good points about the corrosive, incestuous relationship between Wall Street/government/military-industrial complex etc,. but ultimately had no philosophy of his own</p>

<p><strong>January 2016 - June 2016 (roughly)</strong>: <strong><em>Split 50/50</em></strong>. A lot of people on this sub saw Bernie Sanders as the best option (or least evil option) at this point, which is often forgotten.</p>

<p><strong>June 2016 - April 2017</strong>: <strong><em>Mostly Pro-Trump</em></strong>. With Sanders gone, and the DNC, GOP, mainstream media, Wall Street, and establishment politicians fighting Trump, people here bought into him <em>super</em> hardcore--especially with the famously corrupt Hillary as his foil. This is where the &quot;leans right&quot; label comes from.</p>

<p><strong>April 2017 - Present</strong>: <strong><em>Leans Anti-Trump, probably 60/40 or 70/30</em></strong>. After stacking his cabinet with Goldman Sachs advisers, reneging on prosecuting Hillary, and (most importantly) striking Syria, this sub has become very critical of Donald, though a solid minority argue that he&#39;s playing a very advanced, elaborate game of chess that we cannot detect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess first off is why is everything a conspiracy? People aren&#39;t all that different so it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that a lot of them have parallel thinking. Also why are there so many people acting like the world is ending or something? It&#39;s like you just learned about politics but haven&#39;t realized it&#39;s all a game and politicians lie. Even better is that everyone acts like they&#39;d be a paragon of virtue if they were in the same situation. In conclusion everyone can shut up and fuck off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has ALWAYS had more allegiance to Wikileaks and their charter of exposing corruption.</p>

<p>Denying the US gov narrative of Russian involvement in favor of Wikileaks narrative is not left or right.</p>

<p>What else has Wikileaks taught us? The first dump of Vault 7 showed us that tools exist to frame anyone for cybercrimes by imparting a digital fingerprint on it.</p>

<p>We know that the tools to do this and many other things in our cyberwarfare toolkit are possessed by other actors. So literally anyone could do it with expertise in hacking, including companies like Crowdstrike, and not to mention the CIA themselves.</p>

<p>This corroborates Wikileaks original claim that Russia was not their source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is an oligarchic conspiracy but the right wingers don&#39;t mind when they get fucked in the ass, as long as it&#39;s done by the rich. So they defend them, making this an issue of right vs left. And then they try to divide people by race, gender, sexuality, and the corporate &quot;left&quot; (Dems, actually just less right wing) is happy to accept those divisions and reinforce them.</p>

<p>The only people that are trying to unite people against the conspirers, against the oligarchs such as Goldman Sachs and the military-industrial complex, are being silenced by both right and center-right (<a href="http://quillette.com/2017/03/24/how-the-social-justice-movement-fuels-corporate-capitalism/">corporate SJWs</a>). People like Bernie, who the right wingers would rather call a cuck instead of realizing he&#39;s standing up for them.</p>

<p>Right wingers realize they&#39;re victims but those that cause our misery are very good at finding scapegoats/diversions, such as feminists, leftists and immigrants. And there lies the real conspiracy. A large group of oligarchs that buy politicians and that keep us divided and pointing fingers at people who have a minimal  negative impact on our lives, a group of oligarchs that invest in arm manufacturers and military contractors at the same time that they bribe (or themselves are) warmongering politicians (D and R), a group of oligarchs that invest in whole economies failing and then influence politicians into promoting devastating policies that impoverish the population and increase inequality. That&#39;s the real conspiracy.</p>

<p>BUT THE JOOOOS AND THE MEXICANS AND THE MUSLIMS AND SANDY HOOK AND DEY TEK ER GUNS!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Trump is a pawn of the DNC to destroy the Republicans once and for all. The Clintons were at his wedding and were his friends. Then the plan came to be and he slowly began separating from the left. They had seen how easily Obama won his first term on the heels of W. But even W wasn&#39;t THAT bad when you stopped to think about it. They needed something far worse. They needed something so fucking awful it would stand as something they could point to for decades in elections and go LOL THE RIGHT GAVE YOU THAT OOMPA LOOMPA PUSSY GRABBING MORON. </p>

<p>In exchange they will allow something that benefits him greatly to pass. Maybe his tax reform, maybe something else. Who knows. </p>

<p>But you can&#39;t post these conspiracy theories on this sub anymore. Because this sub is very clearly right wing ever since the election cycle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. She&#39;s been in politics for decades.</p>

<p>She and Bill were running drugs through Mena airport during Iran-Contra, and got away with it. Bill went on to become president, where he was incredibly corrupt. People want to blame Bush for the 2008 collapse, but Bill is the one who removed the specific regulations that allowed it to happen. It just bubbled up during Bush. Then as Secretary of State, Hillary herself was guilty of war crimes, and laughed about killing Gaddafi, who was just trying to escape Rothschild banking.</p>

<p>And there have been <em>plenty</em> of anti-Trump posts here. We just aren&#39;t as plastered with them as the MSM. In the weeks following the Syrian strikes, anti-Trump posts lit the front page up like a christmas tree.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Clinton gets more shit because she&#39;s done more shit, at least as far as we (I?) know</p>

And he&#39;s hardly the first to think of doing such a thing-- his technique has been old hat politics for years. Trump only seemed different because of the grating shamelessness of his stupidity and because shameless stupidity is the new motto of our reality/internet era. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t.  They&#39;re not suddenly going to after literally years and years .  The shit Trump does is in your face.  Clinton is a legitimate conspiracy.  It&#39;s provoked lots of squealing here by people who seem to contribute little else but commentary on where the sub is &#39;at&#39; because they&#39;re annoyed by the fact that nobody wants to buy the very obvious Russian hackers nonsense.  The only &#39;conspiracy&#39; there is that some people want us to ignore just what it is about the leaks that could &#39;sway&#39; an election and so cooked up a &#39;crisis&#39; as a distraction. That&#39;s why the sub might appear pro-Trump.  Because everybody has worked that one out already.  Clinton is still at large however.  </p>

<p>This is what I don&#39;t get about the people expressing so much hate for her. I <em>really</em> don&#39;t like her. See my history. Still, in this context, it&#39;s nonsense. Most of democrats just want her to go away. She doesn&#39;t have any power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how OP is trying to say this sub is neutral and the top to comments are trying to cause divide by blaming Trump and Republicans.</p>

<p>Also notice how on most posts on his sub involving Obama/Hillary/Bernie/the left, the users here begin attacking this sub, calling it T_D or saying it&#39;s conservative conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Yet when it&#39;s a post about Trump/Bush/the right, the users here are suddenly discussing only the conspiracy at hand, organically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, they are trying to say it is neutral, but it isn&#39;t. That is like saying republicans and democrats are the same. They might be on some things but overall they aren&#39;t. It is usually conservatives who rush to call them the same to hide their embarrassment over the things done by their party.</p>

<p>It the same here. You get rw&#39;ers running about claiming everyone is a shill and brigading when you know it has been mostly from the donald and allowed here by right leaning mods. Take a look at some new donald users, I saw on the other day who had 500k karma in 3 months, looking at snoopsnoo showed it all coming from the donald (via bots obviously).</p>
