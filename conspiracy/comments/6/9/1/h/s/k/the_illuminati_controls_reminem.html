       First, some background information. Eminem was a rapper who lit the world on fire in 1999 and was quite possibly the most popular artist in the world from 2000 to about 2002 or 2003. However, he let drugs and laziness get to him, and the Illuminati swept him up and used that to their advantage. As Eminem was at his worst with the Illuminati-prescribed drugs, he died in a car accident in 2007. It allowed the Illuminati to send out a clone to submit their politically-charged messages. The best examples can be seen on the 2016 Trump diss track "Campaign Speech", released two and a half weeks before election day. 2017 Big Sean song "No Favors" where "Eminem" calls President Trump a "bitch", and later goes on to say "I'll make his whole brand go under."
      </p>
      <p>
       I spoke out about Eminem on r/eminem, encouraging others to fight this evil and boycott the rapper, and, unsurprisingly, shot down as a "right wing nutjob" and a "troll" by his biggest fans. However, it wasn't until I was banned that I started to dig deeper into Eminem, which is how I found out about his death and his Illuminati ties. I made a second account and posted the same message, and I was banned again. I made a third, and it lasted a few more days, but was then banned after I asked for an apology for making a tasteless joke about President Trump, while other members of the sub would go on to say they would kill Trump, and they were not banned. I messaged the mods, and instead of explaining why my ban was a higher priority than those who hurled death threats at the President, I got no response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we know that the Illuminati is about as anti-Trump as you can get, so it leads me to determine that many members of that subreddit are in the Illuminati. I fear for it's future, as u/SpectreisMyName, who is Illuminati, wants to become a mod. I don't believe the moderator, u/Phouza, is Illuminati, but I believe he is being blackmailed into censoring anti-Illuminati messages by u/SpectreisMyName and u/EndoveProduct, who is also Illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I recommend that we fight this scourge. Keep spreading the message at r/eminem, and prevent the Illuminati from spreading to other subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       BE AWARE: THE FOLLOWING USERS I SUSPECT ARE IN THE ILLUMINATI:
      </p>
      <p>
       u/SpectreisMyName
      </p>
      <p>
       u/EndoveProduct
      </p>
      <p>
       u/LinkinKornknot
      </p>
      <p>
       u/ThugFeminist
      </p>
      <p>
       UPDATE: I have added more names. The following people are also, or might be, Illuminati:
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Dumbkidaccount
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Bigmethod (Maybe)
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Domchirico80
      </p>
      <p>
       u/carlden3 (Maybe)
      </p>
      <p>
       u/dotMP3ree (Maybe)
      </p>
      <p>
       u/jakess_86
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Boeminemlightswitch (Maybe)
      </p>
      <p>
       u/domo101dc
      </p>
      <p>
       I will continue to update this with more members as I see them. God Bless.

       This HAS to be a troll thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you going to account for his family and crazy rabid fans no noticing anything different or off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or account for the fact that he has always spoken against whoever has been President.  "I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president dead"
      </p>
      <p>
       You literally spawned a new conspiracy because you don't like the direction his music has been heading and who he dissed on his tracks.

       This is not a troll thread. The evidence is there. The real Eminem is dead and has been for years. The Illuminati now controls him, all he owns, and anything he has in his honor, like r/eminem. I have been reading into this for a long time, a lot longer than you. I take your name calling as a smear on my hard work. Do the research. The evidence is there.

       Again, you are dismissing: Mosh, We are Americans and a a whole lot of verses in all his other songs where he goes agaisnt the then Presidents.

       You have no evidence, only speculation.

       so far the only evidence he's been able to conjure up is a blog post (posted here like that 9643386863 times) whose headline is:

       so what if they replaced him with a clone, or android. I don't see the evidence for creating realistic androids of that quality. I also don't see how the clone could grow up so fast and then stop aging rapidly. The clone would have to be born from a baby and then grow up to around 40 years old in a 10 year span and then stop aging? This is if they planned ahead for eminem to die. So how do we know the original eminem wasn't a clone of something and he expired or something.  Cloning is obviously a new thing with possible problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still we don't have any evidence these technologies actually exist. If you wanted to prove your theory , you should research if these technologies, cloning, androids, are real. I personally haven't seen anything that suggests androids are real yet. As far as cloning I know it's real but the rapid ageing is not AFAIK.

       I don't think you should get too caught up on one conspiracy. Continue your journey down the rabbit hole...

       The guy is a wacky cunt. He raped r/eminem for weeks, and he is still doing it with alternate accounts. Nothing really to say but he is either:

       a. A troll (98% chance)

      <p>
       b. A nutjob who needs mental help (2% chance)

       He literally has made zero logical posts on reddit. I have run into him on several subs, and he just keeps on with that same, nonsensical bullshit. Avoid this guy like the plague. That's all that needs to be said.

       I really don't know of the thread he is talking about. I am on that sub quite a bit, and I never saw a thread where anyone actually made death threats to Donald Trump. So I see it as:
      </p>
      <p>
       a. Made up to back up his wild claims
      </p>
      <p>
       b. Someone actually did make death threats, but the mods took down the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think that the mods would entertain death threats again anyone. They aren't great mods, but they usually don't put up with bullshit like that. I think he is making it up.

      <p>
       And, no, I am not Illuminati. Don't want to speak for the others, but I highly doubt that they are Illuminati.

       It's a joke. Also, it's a reference to an old conspiracy. Supposed if you play one of The Beetles songs backwards, you can hear "Paul is dead, miss him miss him miss him" towards the end. This led to a big conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney had actually died the year before they recorded that particular song and because of the Beetles fame, they hired a lookalike or cloned him. The story varies depending on how insane the story teller is.

       Walks into a room full of an artist's fans and says, your hero is a fake, he died long ago and was replaced with an illuminati clone to distribute political hip hop propaganda.. yea no wonder they banned you, especially with all those powerful sources you linked to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can somewhat get down with the conspiracy of Em dying and being replaced with a look alike, same with Paul McCartney. But those were done, if actually done, for money, not propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people who listened to both the 2016 song and 2017 song, all agree they sucked regardless of your political affiliation.
