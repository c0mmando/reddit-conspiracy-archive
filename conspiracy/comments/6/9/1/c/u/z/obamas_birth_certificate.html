I&#39;m willing to believe he was born in Hawaii and just had no birth certificate but find it weird that the topic dropped off after that press conference. Snopes hasn&#39;t been updated to include those findings either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a matter of public record that his birth certificate was heavily photoshopped and edited.  Why would that be the case if it was completely legit?  Why does his own brother Malik claim he&#39;s a Kenyan?  Why did he and his wife consistently refer to himself as a Kenyan before he was President?  Why did he spend more money than any President in history strictly to seal his past from public view?  Even the little that we know about his past that&#39;s out in the public eye paints him as part of a CIA grooming program, likely similar to Trudeau and Macron.  He was groomed to be President long before he got the job, that much is obvious.</p>
