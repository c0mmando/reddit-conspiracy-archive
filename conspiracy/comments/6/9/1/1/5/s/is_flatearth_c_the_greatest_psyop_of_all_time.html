<p>What if there is no &quot;edge of the Earth&quot; as some Flat Earthers have suspected? What if there are more continents beyond Antarctica?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What if?&quot;..&quot;What if?&quot; That&#39;s the whole point. The 1,000 year old map shows more continents. Why? We don&#39;t know because we are not allowed to visit Antarctica. It is against the law. If we could visit Antarctica, it would settle this whole issue. Instead they have killed people who have gone to Antarctica. So, more research should be done.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a 1,000 year old map. Old maps are surprisingly accurate considering the technology at the time, but you cannot use their inaccuracies as proof.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we could visit Antarctica, it would settle this whole issue.</p>

<p>You can, just google &quot;visit Antarctica&quot;, there&#39;s loads of ways to get there commercially.</p>

<p>Who? There&#39;s some strange deaths on the continent, but it&#39;s very extreme conditions so that&#39;s to be expected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tyson is who ruined it for me. I was also angry at the Flat Earthers for what I believed at the time to be utter nonsense. Tyson went on a show featuring black artists to discuss Flat Earth because rapper B.o.B. is a Flat Earther.</p>

<p>I was cheering when Tyson first went on. I was excited because I really liked him at the time, and I knew he would put this whole &quot;Flat Earth bullshit to rest&quot;. He didn&#39;t. In fact, he looked like a fool. Instead of explaining why we don&#39;t live on a Flat Earth, he had his young nephew rap about why we don&#39;t live on a Flat Earth. </p>

<p>Tyson is a fraud. He is so full of himself, and yet Spinning Ballers look at him like he is some sort of genius.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, we share a similar story. When we first heard about Flat Earth, we thought it was stupid, and we set out to disprove it. When we couldn&#39;t, we finally calmed down and took off the concrete blinders. We examined the evidence, and I like you, was shocked at what we learned. I don&#39;t know what we live on. But, I have to hand it to the Flat Earthers for their tenacity and their desire to find the truth. They should be given all the support they need instead of all of these unwarranted attacks.</p>

<p>Fuckin&#39; weird...</p>

<p>It is weird. It&#39;s alright to froth at mouth and post stuff about multi-dimensional lizards that are part goat and bi-sexual that eat cattle for breakfast and humans for dinner, and they come from a solar system a million light years away. People eat that shit up. But, mention &quot;Flat Earth&quot; and the attacks begin.</p>

<p>I think the Spinning Ballers are scared. I really do. And, they should be. If we live on a Flat Earth, it is the greatest conspiracy of all time that has been hidden from man. Science would be finished as we know it. So, I applaud Flat Earthers and their willingness to continue to look for the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because there&#39;s no empirical provable evidence that lizards exist, but there is empirical, provable evidence that the Earth is round.  Evidence that you yourself can verify with your own experiments at home if you so chose.  You can look right up in the sky on different parts of the Earth and see different sets of stars, you can notice that the shadow on the moon during an eclipse is round because of the shape of the Earth, you can see the curvature of the Earth from 80,000 feet up or more, you can prove the effects of gravity by dropping literally any object onto the ground.  The only thing supporting Flat Earth is the ramblings of a Bible thumper that has no support from any credible scientific background and a bunch of amateur YouTube videos twisting around every single presupposition possible to arrive at their own conclusions.  See the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth by itself has never been proven and has been debunked by fourth grade science.  You can try to hand-wave established scientific fact and methodology away like it&#39;s no big deal, but you&#39;re just underminding your own arguments when you can&#39;t back any of them up by hard data.  Every single person arguing Flat Earth resorts to moving goalposts, personal anecdotes that can&#39;t be verified, &quot;NASA is fake!&quot; and circular logic.  Failing that, it boils down to grasping at straws with interpreting verse from a <em>heavily falsified</em> ancient religious text (the Bible) as your &quot;proof&quot;.  There is zero <em>scientific</em> proof, consensus or respected scientific viewpoints in favor of Flat Earth for a reason - with very basic experiments, you can debunk it all by yourself with no internet or heavily biased viewpoint affecting your judgement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth by itself has never been proven and has been debunked by fourth grade science.  You can try to hand-wave established scientific fact and methodology away like it&#39;s no big deal, but you&#39;re just underminding your own arguments when you can&#39;t back any of them up by hard data.  Every single person arguing Flat Earth resorts to moving goalposts, personal anecdotes that can&#39;t be verified, &quot;NASA is fake!&quot; and circular logic.  Failing that, it boils down to grasping at straws with interpreting verse from a <em>heavily falsified</em> ancient religious text (the Bible) as your &quot;proof&quot;.  There is zero <em>scientific</em> proof, consensus or respected scientific viewpoints in favor of Flat Earth for a reason - with very basic experiments, you can debunk it all by yourself with no internet or heavily biased viewpoint affecting your judgement.  </p>
