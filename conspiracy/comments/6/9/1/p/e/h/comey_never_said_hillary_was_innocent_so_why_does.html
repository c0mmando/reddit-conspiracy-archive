       If you recall Comey's initial press conference, he never said that Hillary didn't do anything illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation was basically she broke the law, but prosecutors won't bring a case because of a lack of "hard" evidence, her status and position, and the reasonableness of the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to argue about what she did, whether anything is right or wrong. I'm just trying to understand why we keep being told she didn't break any laws when that was never the conclusion drawn?
      </p>
      <p>
       (I know, this is a bit of a rhetorical question given that she was the MSM sweetheart and they did/are doing everything they can to show her as positively as possible)

       Well, you're wrong. Comey explicitly did say her actions were not criminal.

       Intent is at the heart of all prosecutions in law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the difference between a murder charge and a manslaughter charge in your driving example.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Clinton's case the law in question required malicious intent, as ruled by the supreme court. As none could be found there is now law to prosecute.

       Read the Espionage Act and compare your state's Vehicular Manslaughter law. You will see their is quite a stark difference between the two, namely proving intent is mandatory in charging someone under the Espionage Act.

       You need to read all the words, comprehend them then understand the writers meaning.

       <p>
        Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.

       So please, again, tell me where he says there is no criminal ACTION. just because a prosecutor won't prosecute, and this is a new domain that there's no previous similar case, doesn't mean she didn't do anything wrong. Or that Comey even remotely said that she didn't do anything criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       He only said that charges wouldn't be brought. And usually this happens because the prosecutors aren't convinced they'll win.

       That's literally saying she's guilty but we're not going to convict her and since we're the government and nobody can sue on behalf of us except us she's safe.

       I was terrified when I read the transcript and realized what it said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which was, to me, "yeah, she broke the law and yeah, she's guilty. But it's unprecedented to prosecute a crime of this nature and a person of this stature"
      </p>
      <p>
       And, going deeper down the rabbit hole, it planted the thought of "a reasonable prosecutor will not bring charges for fear of backlash, either through the media, government or other criminal enterprises"

       Why does the MSM keep saying that? Because the MSM are the unofficial propaganda arm of the Elite. They can't be trust for anything except sports scores and possibly the weather.

       Simple. Because the media when given to options on a story, one where they can tell the truth when inconvenient for their narrative, and one where they can lie through their effing teeth and assume we are all complete idiots, they always choose to lie.
