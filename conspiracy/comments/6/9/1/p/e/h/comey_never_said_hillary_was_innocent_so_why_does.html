<p>My interpretation was basically she broke the law, but prosecutors won&#39;t bring a case because of a lack of &quot;hard&quot; evidence, her status and position, and the reasonableness of the case. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to argue about what she did, whether anything is right or wrong. I&#39;m just trying to understand why we keep being told she didn&#39;t break any laws when that was never the conclusion drawn? </p>

<p>(I know, this is a bit of a rhetorical question given that she was the MSM sweetheart and they did/are doing everything they can to show her as positively as possible) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absorb these two paragraphs. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before bringing charges. There are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent. Responsible decisions also consider the context of a person’s actions, and how similar situations have been handled in the past.</p>

<p>In looking back at our investigations into mishandling or removal of classified information, we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. All the cases prosecuted involved some combination of: clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information; or vast quantities of materials exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct; or indications of disloyalty to the United States; or efforts to obstruct justice. We do not see those things here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So please, again, tell me where he says there is no criminal ACTION. just because a prosecutor won&#39;t prosecute, and this is a new domain that there&#39;s no previous similar case, doesn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t do anything wrong.
