        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They have failed to invest in technologies that could dramatically change the world for the better. For the cost of their annual budget ($30 billion) they could build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop">Launch Loop</a>, which would take launch costs from $2000/kg to as little as $3/kg. This would generate goodwill internationally and pay for itself within a few years just from launching satellites for other nations. </p>

<p>Due to increased light exposure and efficiency due to the cold, solar panels in space produce far more electricity, and run 24 hours a day with no need for a backup system like terrestrial solar. We could produce power for far less than the cost of coal.</p>

<p>Even better would be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring">Orbital Ring Space Elevator</a>, which for about $400 billion would let us deploy payloads for around $1/kg. Before you downvote and tell me we need carbon nanotubes, please read the article. This design only goes to low earth orbit, so it doesn&#39;t need superstrong materials like other Space Elevator designs you have heard of (and NASA invests millions of dollars investigating, knowing they can&#39;t be built yet).</p>

<p>In addition, it would allow us to connect tethers from solar power satellites directly to the ground. This decrease in transmission costs, along with the decreased costs of deploying satellits would let us produce power for less than 1 cent/kwh.</p>

<p>If sold at 15c/kwh (a discount to worldwide average electricity costs of 17c/kwh), the satellites would pay themselves off in 1-2 years, and the market is well supported for massive increases in capacity at very modest cost discounts (i.e. drop the price even 1-2 c/kwh and demand increases massively).</p>

<p>In the end, this means that every dollar invested into solar satellites would return at least 50% annually. It would be possible to start generating trillions of dollars in free cash flow within a few years. Enough to fund the entire government without taxes if we wanted. Enough to retire our debt, or create a basic income.</p>

<p>Yeah, NASA is a fraud.</p>

<p>They already have that. They pay people to tell you &quot;it&#39;s coming&quot; so you don&#39;t realize it&#39;s been here for decades.</p>

<p>They control the big corporations, the reserve currency, the banks, the politicians through blackmail and bribery, and the policy groups that actually make the governing decisions.</p>

<p>The question is whether you can articulate an alternative, like I&#39;m showing you with this post, so that they can be overthrown without firing a shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ISS can not be easily converted to a skyhook. This requires orbit raising after the payload slingshot and currently they use resupply vehicles docked to the station to do large orbital maneuvers. Couple this with the fact that you would have to engineer the cable and attach it to the space station in a location that doesn&#39;t interfere with solar panels, docking stations, robotic arm, etc. It would be easier to build a new space station specifically for a skyhook than to repurpose the ISS. </p>

<p>Sure, you&#39;d need to add parts. But you already have a decent chunk of mass, solar panels, and a cabin up there already. That&#39;s a good start.</p>

<p>Agreed. We would need more panels and thrusters. All I&#39;m saying is that we already have mass and panels up there. So we can save launch costs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How do you figure? Launch costs are everything, even having a giant rock to tether the thing to for extra mass would make the system work a lot better by it move less when it draws up a payload.</p>

<p>The current gen of those things are ridiculously low power, generally intended for low-mass objects where a small trajectory change can be calculated over a long period of time (and also precludes use where there would be any outside modifications, like docking).  I&#39;m not saying its completely impossible, but I don&#39;t think that the math upscales with our current capabilities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m specifically saying that the current hardware <em>doesn&#39;t</em> scale up past a certain point.  It&#39;s like scaling up model rocket engines by just strapping a fuck ton of them together.  There are drawbacks to the system that get more and more apparent as you try to upscale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, for an example I&#39;ll take the biggest problem for ion drives, which is acceleration versus mass.  They take ages to accelerate, speaking in astronomical terms.  They also have a relatively low efficiency.  The entire benefit of them is a trade-off in acceleration by being able to have less mass (and/or a longer operational lifespan), but if you scale up you&#39;re just adding more and more mass, making it less and less effective.</p>

<p>Lemme think of an example.  So you blow up one balloon with helium, just the the point where it has positive buoyancy at sea level.  Congrats, you&#39;ve made a bit of latex rise slowly with a smidgen of helium.  Now take 20 of these and glue them together: what happens?  It rises the same way.  A little less, actually, since you&#39;re adding mass (glue) to stick them all together.</p>

<p>The balloon is electricity powered thrusters.  We&#39;re currently not able to add more than a smidgen of helium to them (aka - power to thrust efficiency and weight to thrust efficiency), which means that upscaling past a certain point has no benefit and actually degrades performance past a certain point without an increase in the efficiency of the engine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s such a weird statement in context. I mean, Neil&#39;s explanation is reasonable enough, but Collins&#39;s (that&#39;s Michael Collins, right?) statement is totally off. As though it just occurred to him that he didn&#39;t see any stars while he was in space, up in the orbiter for hours by himself for that matter, with little to do other than staring out the window. </p>

<p>What&#39;re the three things you&#39;d be looking forward to find when traveling into space? 1) Weightlessness, 2) a stunning view of Earth, 3) the most breathtaking sea of stars you&#39;ll ever see.</p>

<p>So if I went up into space and saw only blackness where the stars should be, that in itself would be such a mindblowing observation that a shoulder shrug followed by &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing any&quot; really calls into question if the dude was ever up there in the first place.</p>

<p>Had he said, &quot;and the weirdest thing to me was that we could barely make out any stars at all, and we still don&#39;t fully understand why that is the case. Something, something, atmosphere&quot;, it wouldn&#39;t be as strange as just saying &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing any.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a weird claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but if the first divers to Mariana&#39;s Trench claimed that they didn&#39;t remember seeing any fishes, I&#39;d be wondering if they ever went too.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#39;t expect them to be gazing out the window like kid on a planeride, but they were in transit between Earth and the moon for four days one way, spent almost an entire day on the surface of the moon (in which time Collins was orbiting the moon), before landing in the Pacific another four days later. Don&#39;t you think they would have checked out the stars on the way, just so they had something romantic to tell to their wives back home?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of exposure and contrast issues in photography, thank you. But nobody is talking about the photos. They claim they don&#39;t remember SEEING any stars on their 9 day journey to the moon and back. </p>

<p>That, to me, is unfathomable. If the stars are in fact visible in space, as optical theory predicts common sense dictates and ISS astronauts claim, then the Apollo 11 astronauts should have seen them. If the stars, for some unexplained reason, are not visible from space, than that should have been a definitive and ground breaking observation in itself. </p>

<p>The fact that Collins says that he doesn&#39;t remember seeing any stars, as though that only just occurred to him, raises all sorts of questions in my mind.</p>

<p>The photos and videos of the event are a topic all on its own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not supposed to prove anything. What gave you that idea? I find that the astronaut&#39;s statements during that interview make little sense, which makes me suspicious. But that is all it is. It&#39;s language, it can be misinterpreted, so I will never claim that language proves anything. Collins could have had a slow moment or could have had a case of stage fright or all number of things that might have made him say such an ambiguous statement when the truth of the fact should have been the most obvious aspect of their voyage.</p>

<p>It might not make you suspicious, but that&#39;s none of my business. And who knows, maybe there really is nothing to it. Who know, maybe there is.</p>

<p>Nope, we have quite a few unedited uncorrected images of the Earth. Composites are simply because there is no reason to move these satellites that far away so you take a bunch of pics and stitch them together. Shitty part about that is none of the clouds will match up so some license is taken to make it look &quot;pretty&quot;. NASA has never once denied this. </p>

<p>Again Im pretty familiar with what NDT just said. The Earth isnt a perfect sphere because of tidal forces around the equator and the unequal distribution of land then add in an active core with plate tectonics and you get a slightly oddly shaped planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you were wrong in your assumption that you cant go to antarctica or fly over it. Thats the first one. </p>

<p>Then you were unaware that there is a sailing race around antarctica, further reinforcing the fact the Earth is round. This was again unchallenged and seemed to be unknown to you. </p>

<p>You never bothered to address why you think NDT saying the Earth is an oblate spheroid supports your position. You actually dropped that one altogether. </p>

<p>You never addressed the fact that there are unedited whole images of the Earth. Look up DSCOVER - EPIC a satellite that routinely takes images of Earth unedited. Same with some chinese satellite they launched last year. </p>

<p>You never bothered to address my claim that other planets are round lol</p>

<p>Thats off the top of my head of points you dropped or were proven wrong about. You arent doing a very good job of defending your position. </p>

<p>Ah.  Ok Richie let me explain.  When Neil said it was kind of pear shaped he was talking about one portion be about 0.6% wider than the other.  That would be about 1 pixel different on a 1920x1080 image.  Check my math, I could be a bit off.</p>

<p>The question I have is why haven&#39;t you checked for yourself?</p>

A launch loop would be held up at this altitude by the momentum of a belt that circulates around the structure.

<p>He doesn&#39;t actually work for them. Browse his history. The guy is a straight-up troll. This isn&#39;t me calling names, it&#39;s me stating a verifiable fact.</p>

<p>He also claims to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5zpol9/whats_getting_cut_in_trumps_budget/df0aq17/?context=3">not be on the government payroll</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/5zsd6n/follow_this_simple_guide_to_chase_all_your/df1rafi/?context=3">to be a Mexican immigrant</a>, and other tall tales.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont see where you are getting $400 billion from. By your first source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If built by launching the necessary materials from Earth, the cost for the system estimated by Birch in 1980s money was around $31 trillion if launched using Shuttle-derived hardware, whereas it could fall to $15 billion with bootstrapping, assuming a large orbital manufacturing facility is available to provide the initial 18,000 tonnes of steel, aluminium, and slag at a low cost, and even lower with orbital rings around the moon. The system&#39;s cost per kilogram to place payloads in orbit would be around $0.05</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if somehow someone figured out how to do the project for 400 billion, that is still 20 years worth of expenditure for NASA, for a project well beyond the scope of NASA&#39;s charter. I don&#39;t think its fair to blame NASA for a failure of Congress to allocate such staggering sums to a project.</p>

<p>2nd paper, bootstrapped cost estimate p.3. Updated from 1980s figures. <a href="http://orbitalring.space/setting-the-record-straight-on-orbital-ring-systems/">This</a> might shed some light on things, although he uses more optimistic launch costs of around $200/kg, and I&#39;m using the very conservative number of $2000/kg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a really neat idea, but as your link points out this cost is <em>just</em> for launch of mass into orbit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the final cost would have worked out to 44.2 billion without space manufacturing facilities (but including the $173/kg launch cost),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, just launch costs at the  $2000/kg launch price is your $400 billion. And this is for the &quot;bootstrap&quot; version. This is ignoring the cost of the materials were launching and the engineering costs, let alone the upfront and one time costs of building the infrastructure to launch these millions of kilos of mass into orbit via rocket. I think, at the very least were looking at a cost in the low trillions of dollars. </p>

<p>If people started taking the idea seriously and pushing for such an expenditure, id be pretty happy - but it would be one of the modt expensive projects ever undertaken </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think you&#39;re doing your cost allocation wrong. The cost of space to build rockets is already baked into the sale price of the rocket which is already baked into the cost of sending payloads to space.</p>

<p>The cost per rocket would go down as you build more.</p>

<p>The materials are not raw commodity steel &quot;some magnets&quot; and Kevlar. The materials are engineered finished pieces. You might as well say the cost to build the Burj Khalifa should have only been a few million instead of 1.5 billion because its just a bunch if steel, glass and concrete. Or that the Large Hadron Collider is just a hole in the ground and &quot;some magnets&quot; so shouldn&#39;t be $13 billion. </p>

<p>The engineering and machining costs for a project this size and of this uniqueness are going to be huge.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;m glossing over some welding costs of a few hundred million. But the Burj Khalifa isn&#39;t in space. That&#39;s why the Orbital Ring costs so much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not &quot;some welding costs&quot;. Do an experiment: Buy 1 kg of aluminum. Itll be maybe $1.50. $2000 to get to orbit.</p>

<p>Now get a machinist to cut it into a high precision custom part for you. That alone will cost about $150 on the very low end - probably closer to $300 if there is any complexity.</p>

<p>Now get an engineering firm to engineer the part specs you give to the machinist. Even if this is a simple support strut, they are going to wind up charging you at least several hundred dollars. So now we have something close to $1000 in design costs for an engineered and machined part with no moving parts.</p>

<p>Scale that up for the complexity of this project, the testing the &quot;some magnets&quot; etc etc </p>

<p>For example, Google &quot;texas a&amp;m estimating cost of spaxe systems&quot; and download the pdf produced by the University. Youll see that for a communication satellite one can expect $55 million in launch costs and $75 million in engineering and materials cost.

In addition to administrative saleries plus the costs of making sure the commercial entities are safe. Then they have all the R&amp;D that they do on Earth or on the ISS that they can slice but it&#39;s fucks over so many people. So yeah the NASA budget is whatever it is but they can&#39;t just slash everything for a hyperloop. It would be like if the military decided to take their whole budget and develope a death Lazer.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Later vacuum-chamber experiments suggested that the unwinding of the reel uncovered pinholes in the insulation. That in itself would not have caused a major problem, because the ionosphere around the tether, under normal circumstance, was too rarefied to divert much of the current. However, the air trapped in the insulation changed that. As it bubbled out of the pinholes, the high voltage (&quot;electric pressure&quot;) of the nearby tether, about 3500 volts, converted it into a plasma (in a way similar to the ignition of a fluorescent tube), a relatively dense one and therefore a much better conductor of electricity.
   The instruments aboard the tether satelite showed that this plasma diverted through the pinhole about 1 ampere, a current comparable to that of a 100-watt bulb (but at 3500 volts!), to the metal of the shuttle and from there to the ionospheric return circuit.

    <div class="md"><p>This is an actual engineering issue. This is a long power cable in space, exactly like you propose in your post. Any conductor in the ionosphere will have related problems. </p>

<p>The multi-trillion figure is not even remotely fabricated -- $31 trillion is the original cost of the proposal by its own author. $30-$400 billion is your wildly optimistic cost, which <em>only</em> accounts for launch cost and not engineering cost. Even there you are estimating $200-$2000 per kg, when actual current  costs are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-cargo-price-by-weight-2016-6"><em>much</em></a> higher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For SpaceX — the cheapest of NASA&#39;s new carriers — dividing the cost of each launch ($133 million) by the cargo weight of its most recent resupply mission (5,000 lbs.) gives you about $27,000 per pound.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a high estimate. SpaceX told Tech Insider that its Dragon cargo spacecraft launched on a Falcon 9 rocket can carry up to 7,300 lbs. — and that you could bring just as much cargo back to Earth, too (something Cygnus can&#39;t do). So if a Dragon is full of supplies at launch and on landing, the cost dips to $9,100 per pound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, under an optimal current scenario, prices are 4.5x higher than your <em>conservative</em> estimate of $400 billion -- ie they are <strong>$1.8 trillion</strong> just for launching, and this is for the cheaper &quot;bootstrap&quot; option.</p>

<p>Like Ive said before, this is a fun and interesting project. But there is nothing to be gained by claiming its going to be orders of magnitude cheaper than it actually would be, and certainly nothing to be gained by downplaying the (expensive) engineering challenges beyond the logistical problem.</p>

<p>So, you stopped at the part where he said &quot;this is a stupidly expensive proposal, here&#39;s 6 more ways we can make it cheaper?&quot; and assumed that I&#39;m just too fucking retarded to read? This is what happens when you don&#39;t think critically, and look for any possible reason it can&#39;t be done.</p>

<p>Look at the bootstrapped cost estimate. We need about 160 million kilograms of materials launched into space. At $2000/kg, that is about $320 billion in launch costs. An extra billion or two for the actual materials (which are almost nothing), fabrication, safety cushion, etc. And we have a conservative estimate of somewhere around $400 billion.</p>

<p>Falcon Heavy is running at $2000/kg, and that&#39;s with no cost decrease from massive scaling, which will happen.</p>

<p>Falcon Heavy is not operational yet. $2000/kg is <em>best case</em> advertised by Space X. I dont see why you think it would get cheaper with &quot;massive scaling&quot; -- the estimate already factors in full utilization of the rocket. More rockets wont make the per kg price drop. </p>

<p>This is by no means &quot;conservative&quot;. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/media/1832106/Estimating-the-Cost-of-Space-Systems_2014.pdf">Here</a> is a link to a PDF source estimating that the <strong>engineering costs on a simple communications satellite is about $75 million, while launch costs are $55 million</strong>.

<p>This factoid is a Wikipedia goof that happened because someone skimmed the source and didn&#39;t understand it. Read the original paper and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s saying nothing of the sort -- he&#39;s setting up an argument for cheaper and more realistic projects and quoting a nominal cost to show why it wouldn&#39;t be done that way.</p>

<p>The ORS bootstraps itself ridiculously well, so the obvious approach is to start much smaller than the target goal and work your way up. Nobody has yet done any research to determine the smallest possible ORS, so the 180,000 ton version he calls a &#39;bootstrap&#39; is probably overkill.</p>

<p>The PORS further down in the list of options is similar to Lofstrom&#39;s <a href="http://launchloop.com/">Launch Loop</a>, which has been worked out in a lot of detail. However, I haven&#39;t seen the arguments why we could not build a very lightweight proper orbital ring of similar scale. Why not 180 to 1800 tons instead of 180,000? Birch admits that the number is chosen somewhat arbitrarily (he wanted it to bootstrap to 1000x the mass in about a year).</p>

<p>One possible thing that affects minimum size of a circumglobal ring is that it has to be big enough to support at least one sufficiently durable elevator. But there are other logical options to consider besides the ground anchored tether, for example you could have an ORS that rotates slightly and supports a series of vertical tethers that dock to a high altitude plane.</p>

<p>Couple this with the fact that you would have to engineer the cable and attach it to the space station in a location that doesn&#39;t interfere with solar panels, docking stations, robotic arm, etc.</p>

<p>Sure, you&#39;d need to add parts. But you already have a decent chunk of mass, solar panels, and a cabin up there already. That&#39;s a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an actual engineering issue. This is a long power cable in space, exactly like you propose in your post. Any conductor in the ionosphere will have related problems. </p>

<p>The multi-trillion figure is not even remotely fabricated -- $31 trillion is the original cost of the proposal by its own author. $30-$400 billion is your wildly optimistic cost, which <em>only</em> accounts for launch cost and not engineering cost. Even there you are estimating $200-$2000 per kg, when actual current  costs are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-rocket-cargo-price-by-weight-2016-6"><em>much</em></a> higher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For SpaceX — the cheapest of NASA&#39;s new carriers — dividing the cost of each launch ($133 million) by the cargo weight of its most recent resupply mission (5,000 lbs.) gives you about $27,000 per pound.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s a high estimate. SpaceX told Tech Insider that its Dragon cargo spacecraft launched on a Falcon 9 rocket can carry up to 7,300 lbs. — and that you could bring just as much cargo back to Earth, too (something Cygnus can&#39;t do). So if a Dragon is full of supplies at launch and on landing, the cost dips to $9,100 per pound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, under an optimal current scenario, prices are 4.5x higher than your <em>conservative</em> estimate of $400 billion -- ie they are <strong>$1.8 trillion</strong> just for launching, and this is for the cheaper &quot;bootstrap&quot; option.</p>

<p>Like Ive said before, this is a fun and interesting project. But there is nothing to be gained by claiming its going to be orders of magnitude cheaper than it actually would be, and certainly nothing to be gained by downplaying the (expensive) engineering challenges beyond the logistical problem.</p>

<p>Yeah. It&#39;s not difficult, though. Just taking an existing system and scaling it up.</p>
