    <div class="md"><p>I see.  Now, I&#39;m a salaried doctor who doesn&#39;t have anything to do with vaccines. I don&#39;t get paid any more or any less personally for what treatments I think are best.  Never in my education was I told/recommended to base treatment decision based on money/pharma interests/etc, and we study what the evidence shows with regard to vaccination (e.g. as a simple example, how polio does not exist in the U.S anymore and used to be common before the vaccine).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to convince you at all.  I just want to know why your think I am wrong.  I assume your argument is that the information we are taught is censored and controlled?  Because the money aspect truly is not discussed in medical education at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I remember hearing about this last year.  I wonder how the case will resolve.  Pretty slimy if Merck lied about the exact percent, though nothing surprises me about business ethics.  Nevertheless, MMR works, well, though- just look at the number of cases of measles, mumps, and rubella since it was introduced.  I wish it worked 100% of the time- I just had my blood tested last month for work and my measles immunity had worn off.  </p>

<p>The problem is that decisions about health have to be based on good evidence. But, here we have a company getting busted, about a controversial vaccine anyway, of falsifying results, destroying evidence and threatening whistle-blowers.   If we are going to be consistent and destroy Andrew Wakefield for research misconduct,  what do you thing we should do about the MMR research? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I am alarmed by the allegations if true.  I never have fully trusted industry-run research.  There should be serious consequences.</p>

<p>I think we are talking past each other a little.  Your focus, to me, is- see, look how bad pharma is.  Why would I take a vaccine based on falsified data.  My focus is- see, look at the data on how well MMR works.  I can&#39;t testify to their internal data, but I look at the graphs of how measles, mumps, and rubella have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>I think so as well, at least we try to avoid the implications of each others points.  Let me share this link which found the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The peak of the outbreak was in April and seemed to be focused on college campuses in 9 midwestern states with Iowa having the highest attack rate. College campuses with mumps outbreaks included ones with 77% to 97% of students having had 2 doses of a mumps vaccine. Diagnosing mumps proved to be problematic in vaccinated persons (ie, laboratory tests seemed to be insensitive and some apparent mumps cases had mild nonclassic illness). The outbreak demonstrated that mumps can sometimes transmit efficiently in highly vaccinated populations and the clinical and laboratory diagnosis of mumps in vaccinated persons is more difficult than in naive persons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820583">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18820583</a></p>

<p>Now I looked at the epidemiology graphs. Since you have expertise in the field, where could one find annual breakdown and methodology utilized to gather the data? </p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>I can send you the full article if you would like and if you can&#39;t access.  The methods state: </p>

<p>Mumps cases were reported to CDC from the respective
state health departments using a clinical case definition
for a probable case of “illness with acute onset of unilateral or
bilateral tender, swelling of the parotid or other salivary
gland, lasting for 2 or more days, and without other apparent
cause” and a confirmed case as “one with laboratory confirmation
or epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or probable
case.” Mumps antibody were detected at CDC using the indirect
Mumps IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay II (ELISA
II), (Wampole Laboratories, Inc. Princeton, NJ), and an IgM
antibody capture assay based on a previously described assay for
measles IgM antibodies19 using cloned, expressed mumps nucleocapsid
protein. Virus was detected using tissue culture isolation
usually in vero cells or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay. Virus was genotyped based on sequence studies of the SH
gene as previously described.</p>

<p>Are you also asking for a source for annual count of measles, mumps, and rubella?  It seems that you may be suggesting that any sort of outbreak, especially in highly vaccinated areas, is proof that MMR doesn&#39;t work?  I agree that this is a perfect example of how the vaccine is not 100% effective.  If you look at the incidence of these diseases since 1970, though, I think that helps depict the full picture and effectiveness of MMR.</p>

<p>Yes, but prior to 1987.  More specifically looking at the data when the vaccine was introduced, which seems to be in the late 60&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there is a safety sheet that is published and looked at.  Does that address your concern?  I am assuming that is just part of your argument, and since I have said this safety sheet exists, maybe you will say that it is inaccurate.  I would then reply that public health groups also independently monitor the side effects, but I am guessing you might also say this isn&#39;t accurate.  If you are convinced that the medical industry- all the way from top to bottom is a scam- this debate might not be fruitful. That wasn&#39;t my purpose in my initial comment, as I even pointed out that I didn&#39;t want to debate the vaccination facts.  My purpose on commenting was to try to establish I am acting out of good will and based on my understanding of the facts and that there isn&#39;t some grand conspiracy that involves tons of individuals doctors acting nefariously.  </p>

<p>i don&#39;t know how many hours I&#39;ve spent on vaccines, but its probably as much or more than the average nurse or doctor who has lots of other things to study on their way to becoming a &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot;</p>

<p>consider how long it takes to become to be a master plumber, and then compare that to how long it takes to become a nurse or physician. if the human body is infinitely more complicated than plumbing, then it should take a lot longer to become a competent doctor than a competent plumber... and yet thats not what we see at all. if the doctor specializes in something like eyes or feet, then they probably don&#39;t know too much about vaccines and immunology. </p>

<p>perhaps it is because i have a sincere interest in hearing out all points of view, and work very hard at active listening, even if i already know i will disagree with what they are saying. listening is a skill that must be developed, and its not easy. i always try to listen to whatever video, or read whatever study or article, regardless if i agree with its premise. there is always some obscure vocabulary, facts or names that pop up and i learn from that. usually if someone goes to the effort of citing a source, i will go to the effort of hearing them out. i have learned something from every person i communicate with, regardless if we agree or disagree. i would say that i have learned more from being challenged by people who disagree with me than those who agree with me, and i appreciate that.  </p>

<p>so to answer your question, it might just be that you are either not exposed to enough dissenting opinions, or choose to ignore them because you assume you already know what they are saying is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jack of all trades, master of none is somewhat accurate, but I guess it is easy to forget how long it takes to become an MD.  4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, 3-7 years of residency.  There is a lot I have forgotten outside of my speciality, but in medical school, you need to learn everything.  For example, I had a one-month immunology block where I spent all of my time studying immunology.  So your characterization is partially true, but incomplete.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not necessarily important because this is specifically related to vaccines.  You definitely have spent more time studying adverse effects of vaccines than most doctors- I don&#39;t doubt that.  But what about the doctors of the CDC?  Are they all bought off?  They started as doctors and can switch areas of study very easily, so it&#39;s not like their livelihood depends on vaccines being perfect.  And all of their national data that they use to make recommendations is public and able to be rechecked by individual doctors to verify.  Is this data falsified?  </p>

<p>As far as openness, I agree that many doctors would not consider alternative views.  That&#39;s not me.  I&#39;m here discussing and listening.  I&#39;m not ignoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a dog in this fight, just some questions for you as a physician interested in this topic. I am not an anti-vaxxer, although I have decided it isn&#39;t a bad thing to be curious about the relative safety of different medicines, beyond blind acceptance of FDA approval.</p>

<p>So, are there lists or references of vaccines that are considered more or less safe, sight unseen, among your professional community? Do docs have preferences, is there any special attention that you pay when acquiring them? </p>

<p>Or when you go to order vaccines for your pharmacy supplies, do you just tick off the box for mumps, measles, etc and then just get what the manufacturer provides, considering that due diligence has been made in determining the relative safety of the compounds before they were made available for retail at all? </p>

<p>Are these decisions delegated to non-medical administrators? And Is any mind paid to &quot;hey, this is $700/ml from this vendor, but we have this generic here, or is exactly the same thing and is only $500/ml. Never heard of them, but we know that generics/isomers have to be chemically identical to their name brand varieties, or have identical properties, so this is totally OK.&quot;?</p>

<p>This ties into what I believe the other commenter always has in the back of their mind during discussions like this. It isn&#39;t that the knowledge or ability of the physicians administering the treatment is being called into question, nor their ethics or morality. It is that the process has been subverted before the medicine even made it to the shelves. </p>

<p>Also, I have known and worked with many doctors, and they all seemed to miss out on that sitdown meeting with GlaxxosmithKline, or whatever, where they handed out the bonus checks and told you guys how to make undesirable babies retarded, but get rich doing it. There is no MLM malicious pharmaceutical marketing scheme that regular docs are getting into. There is a perception that there are shenanigans going on like this in maybe the less diligent anti-vaxxer community, but I don&#39;t think educated rational people are thinking doctors are compromised in such a way. </p>

<p>The belief is that problem lies in what happens long before the medication gets to you. That people were bought off during the clinical trials or approval process, and medications with dangerous attributes are being submitted to doctors as safe. </p>

<p>And I should say I am not exactly a laymen, I am a chemist myself, but although I have worked with pharmaceutical formulators on various projects, just want to be clear I am no expert. I also saw no real malicious activity. I did see a certain lack of concern regarding various binders and filler ingredients. And there was a bit of &quot;everybody uses this, it is fine&quot; attitude. But I did environmental chemistry, these kinds of projects were a novelty. Not pretending expertise here.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on any part or all of that would be appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the thoughtful post and questions.  I&#39;ll answer the questions first to be clear.<br/>
1. I would not say there is a unified list rating vaccines on their efficacy and safety.  However, for each vaccines that information exists and is readily available.  Is that information regular used be individual doctors?  I do not think so.  For a lot of doctors, you may look at that information from time to time in your career, but most of your energy is spent keeping up with the guidelines that are created by the doctors that are experts in the field and the research. 
2. I work at an academic center.  There is definitely some committee in charge of acquiring and selecting vaccines, but 90+% of the doctors are not involved in that.  I have no idea what the process is for that, but it would be good information to share if I had it.  I am certain there is involved of medical professional in these decisions, not just medical administrators.</p>

<p>For both these points, it might seem like doctors are blindly trusting.  And that would be correct.  I never argue the fact that individual doctors don&#39;t know the individual ingredients of vaccines, which is a focal point for many vaccine skeptics.  My point is I care if vaccine are effective and are safe, just like any medical intervention.  I am not using clinical trial data to support this; I am able to veritably see the results of nationwide independent studies about vaccines.  And being a researcher at an academic institution, that would be a conspiracy of unbelievable proportions to have that data faked; it would be impossible.  I can&#39;t vouch for every ingredient in a vaccine, but I trust the national data on vaccine-related side effects.  </p>

<p>But if you think that a doctor should know every ingredient in a vaccine, you would be dismayed (and not surprised) to know that is not the case.  I don&#39;t like to make points through analogy, but I think of it like eating food (admittedly, less body altering by 1000 fold). I like to eat Taco Bell.  I have no idea what&#39;s in it.  I trust the public safety department has done a thorough check of their facilities.  Sometimes, people do get sick from certain restaurants and many people will get salmonella.  Public health departments will quickly pick up that trend (many people being diagnosed with salmonella) and work to identify the source, which they are incredibly good at.  While the medical community is profoundly in favor of vaccination, if there was a trend of adverse effects from vaccines, there would be no hesitation to report it.  Andrew Wakefield&#39;s 1998 study was published in one of the top medical journals, as true science-minded folks care about the truth, not financial implications.  There truly were problems with that paper and it was rightly retracted.  But anyways, the point I am trying to make is that I do not feel that I am putting in too much trust into the system, as the safety and efficacy is so easily verified and rechecked by many all the time.</p>

<p>Did that address your questions?  Hope so.  I appreciate your perspective, and that is interesting about the attitude regarding binders and filler ingredients. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I had a very good relationship with my previous doc. One time I came in and there was some question about what medication to use in a certain situation. He pulled out a laptop and started googling haha. At first I was like whoa, but then I thought about it, no doctor is able to read probably even 1% of all the data about all the medications that are available. And I think it is unrealistic to expect that they would be knowledgeable in that way. There has to be a certain amount of trust in the work done by those who came before and support your work when you work in science.</p>

<p>My only issue with vaccines, actually modern pharmaceuticals in general, is there are some indications that trust may be violated from time to time for financial gain. I don&#39;t think it is systemic, and I definitely don&#39;t think it happens at the level of general practitioners. But, I think in general when there is a way for money to be made, regard for public safety has been given a back seat enough times to at least warrant a certain skepticism. </p>

<p>The flu vaccine, for example, I don&#39;t think it is unsafe, but I do think it is a racket. But, and huge but here, I know that regular vaccines are not profitable. In order to encourage pharma companies to stay in that game, and to potentially fund further research into vaccine related medicine, maybe I will allow for a little snake oil if that is what it takes to keep them interested. This will not be a popular view, but I am practical. </p>

<p>Anyhow, really appreciate you taking the time to respond to my post. You have a great day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I sort of agree with your premise, but I made the above argument because the poster, to me, implied that there is some sort of bonus check.  But the point I was making still stands- I make medical decisions based on what the existing evidence says.  And the evidence involves certain drugs or certain medical procedures being indicated for certain problems.  I can&#39;t vouch for all the evidence, but as a research, I can personally attest to doing studies where I look at the medical records of 100 people with a certain disease and see that people who receive drug X recover faster than people who receive no treatment.  This is an incomplete argument, but the overall point I hope to make is that I act in good faith and can attest to the legitimacy of the research I do and those around me do.  If you are willing to believe me but think the whole system is a sham, I guess the explanation is that I am either clueless or brainwashed to be missing the big conspiracy of it all.  And I&#39;d be willing to entertain the notion I am brainwashed, but I know that I look at the specific data for the diseases I deal with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>doctors have a lot of training and knowledge. Unfortunately the medical field is very corrupt and in dire need of reform. For example the opioid crisis illustrates that really well. Purdue pharma created the theory that opioids are not addicting. Right? Doctors believed it and now we have a national crisis. Doctors could and should have looked at independent studies. Now we have a mess. 
The vaccine issue is similar. Evidence has been destroyed by the CDC. 
Pharma companies cannot provide safety data. 
Patients are forcibly vaccinated against their will with out informed consent. (Hep b vaccine given to newborns) most mothers have no idea their baby is being vaccinated for an std. come on a little bit of informed consent!
So are you brainwashed? I think you might be unknowingly part of a system that views people as commodities. Much like livestock, you are a care taker in that system. 
Doctors should be speaking out. If you really are a doctor than you and I both know those formula are outdated and could be made better. There are no screening methods to see who might be suceptible to vaccine reactions. It&#39;s like shooting targets in the dark. Well patients deserve better from the industry, an antivaxxer label does not replace the burden of researching and developing better therapies. Anyways I apologize for the rant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the comments.  I was always taught how addictive opioids are.  It is a very sad situation, and you are right- doctors need to be better at saying no when patients request them.  It is hard to, at times, when a patient is in pain and wants something to feel better.  Same is true with antibiotics.  </p>

<p>You bring up a lot of concerns- some of which I have disagreements with (I never have seen any baby ever vaccinated against a parents will, Hep B is also spread through blood not just an std, etc) but I understand how to a skeptic (like me on other issues) it seems like a big scam.  My best advice, though, is to look at the overall data.  Look at the cases of Hep B over time.  Look at the number of cases of measles, mumps, and rubella since 1970.  Pharma might be corrupt, but there is an indistinguishable link between vaccination and immunity.  And there is indistinguishable link between deferral rate of vaccines and new outbreaks of them.</p>

<p>I would love for there to be better recognition of who will have reactions to vaccines, and I hope that type of research is going on. </p>

<p>I still what to figure out why we disagree so much.  I think the key is the reaction issue rather than the efficacy one.  The World Health Organization says oral polio vaccines result in vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in about three per million doses.   To me, that is not a concern at all with the benefit the vaccine has provided.  Maybe to you it is.  Either way, that information is still on the safety sheets given to all who receive the vaccine.  This is an extreme example, but maybe that&#39;s why we disagree- consideration of the risks vs. the benefits?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not against vaccines per say. In fact I believe that pharma companies need to invest in research and development and design safer vaccines. Better screening methods require collection of massive amounts of data from the populaton.  I believe the delivery method and design to be out dated. Much like chemo. Chemo used to cause sever side efffects. But the benefits out weighed the risks. Now we have safer and The problem is the parents and patients who want to exercise due dilligence are labeled antivaxer and the concerns are not addressed. 
Finally hospitals automatically vaccinate against hep b when the newborn is first born. How can anyone know whether that newborn has allergies tendencies, or any other risk factor? It is bizarre especially since the baby chances of contracting that are very low. Especially since the baby has the mothers immunity for at least the first year sometimes even until the second year. Hospitals have patients waive their right to informed consent when admittng a patient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my only source of income.  Every vaccine I have gotten, including one last month, I received a safety sheet and was warned of side effects.  I adjust therapy to each patient, and the majority of doctors I have worked with do the same.  As far as the vaccine bundling, there is a set protocol on who should get what vaccine at what time based on the scientific evidence.  It doesn&#39;t save any time for the doctor to bundle them, since it is the nurse who actually delivers the vaccine.  </p>

<p>The real point I think is that perhaps you think the safety sheet is not accurate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more vaccines are administered to the patient the more can be billed to the insurance. That&#39;s how it works. It might not save you time but it saves the practice or hospital time. 
The safety sheet does not include and ingredient list. 
It also does not include safety data. 
It is a brochure without data. It is not a prescribing insert. 
Now the problem is pediatricians typically prioritize safety data over efficacy data. 
Not providing safety data is bizarre and makes no sense unless the safety data is not positive. What do you think? Why don&#39;t they publish safety data?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many well meaning docs that simply take the CDC&#39;s word on &quot;safe and effective&quot;, browsing over the literature provided, not examining closely for possible industry bias or misdirection.  It has been shared by doctors that there is very little time spent on vaccines in medical schools, certainly most are not experts.  Yet, they are making decisions based on recommendations provided by entities with very $trong conflicts of interests.  It&#39;s not like fraud and coverups by Pharma are unheard of, and some specifically related to vaccines have occurred. The behavior by Pharma revealed in these cases is nothing short of monstrous. It has been noted that industries have created a revolving door with gov&#39;t regulating agencies, neutering them.  We have also been seeing reports of massive undue corporate influence on all research, yes, all. And one other thing, what happens to any doctor that sounds the alarm or tries to protect their patients?  They are called negligent and prosecuted. That sounds like strong conflict of interest even for a salaried physician. The have it locked up from every side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I had more time to respond, as I don&#39;t like to give an incomplete response.  I just want to establish that if this was a conspiracy it would have to involve 10000s of people covering up data of vaccine adverse effects across the country.  Would that be fair to say or do you think it is a smaller number doing the actual covering up and indirectly/directly pressuring many more?</p>

<p>I bring that up because I think numbers matter with conspiracies.  If the science just depended on data from clinical trials that would still be quite large, but since there is so much continuous surveillance dedicated to the topic, it seems to be impossibly large. </p>

<p>To directly address your points, yes, doctors take the CDC and other groups&#39; word that the data is accurate. You are correct in saying little time is spent in going into the specifics of what&#39;s in vaccines.  As far as corporate interests in research, conflicts of interest are a real thing, and I wish I could discount them.  I can attest that my clinical research is not influenced by outside sources at all, but I&#39;m not trying to say that means anything in this discussion.  As far as whistleblowing, you are right on about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t take that many for a conspiracy. All you have to do is look at the recent coverup from CDC whistleblower regarding autism association in black males under age 3 with the mmr.  They silenced the research. End of story. This high level researcher&#39;s conscience could not live with that. He submitted all research notes to Congress, I believe the congressman was named Posey.  Pharma, by the way, had destroyed their own copies of the research.  Hmmmm.   And what has come of it?  Nothing. Could it be bec Pharma lobbies with astounding amounts of $ for lawmakers to look away?  Everyday docs are told it was nothing, and bec of cdc&#39;s reputation, they are trusted. But, CDC may no longer be in control of their own agency. Thus WHISTLEBLOWERS. </p>

<p>So how can you know they&#39;re shills?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1) do we acknowledge that vaccine shills exist?</p>

<p>2) can we point to actual examples of real vaccine shills</p>

<p>3) if vaccine shills exist, how would they behave?</p>

<p>4) does this person behave like a vaccine shill?</p>
