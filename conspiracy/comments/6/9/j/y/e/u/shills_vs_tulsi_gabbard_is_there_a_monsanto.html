        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the elections I&#39;ve seen quite a few obvious Monsanto shills in popular threads about Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein. Especially Jill Stein, since she has a stronger stance regarding GMOs.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen shills literally link to Monsanto&#39;s web site to support their arguments. Not very bright.</p>

<p>But most would simply engage in never ending name calling. The main thing that gave them away as shills was that the same accounts would show up in almost every thread, within few minutes after the link was submitted, at any hour, day or night. Some, or even most of them were probably Correct The Record employees, but I would not be surprised if Monsanto&#39;s shills jumped in on the action, without necessarily attacking GMO stances of the candidates they wanted to smear.</p>

<p>Apparently Tulsi Gabbard <a href="https://www.votetulsi.com/node/25047">is a leading advocate for mandatory labeling of genetically engineered (GE) food</a>. So I wonder if attacks on her in &quot;mainstream&quot; subs have a Monsanto link as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s different. They were promoting Trump because they thought he would be the least likable of republican candidates in genera;, and so they wanted for him to win the primaries among Republican base, but also build up a dislike for him among independents and the left. I think one of the leaks mentioned this strategy.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think anyone thinks that promoting Tulsi will alienate independents and the right. If anything, she is probably the one Dem that would be the most liked by independents and the right.</p>

<p>So if they are not including her on those lists, despite her being constantly mentioned in the comments sections to those lists, they simply don&#39;t want to see her run.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me see if I get what you were saying. Whoever planned it, knew in advance that Sanders is going to get hugely popular, back in early 2016, but at the same time he was not going to win, and Clinton would lose as well, but Sanders movement would still be hugely popular to decide elections in 2020, but Sanders himself would not run, and so they planted Tulsi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point of my previous 2 comments was that idea that she is a controlled opposition just does not hold up.</p>

<p>So that leaves the theory that she an agent simply promoting CFR agenda as the only other possibility.</p>

<p>And that just does not hold up to scrutiny either. She is very vocally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSD4tpNazlk">opposed to mainstream narrative</a> on Syria. She <a href="https://gabbard.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-tulsi-gabbard-itc-s-report-confirms-tpp-bad-deal-american-people">opposed and voted against TPP,</a> which is arguably one of (if not <em>the</em>) top item in foreign policy agenda that CFR would be interested in getting through the legislature.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just straight up contradictions.</p>

<p>And my personal issue as a progressive is that there is literally not a single progressive journalist that went after CFR, despite many of them having no hesitations going after other similar organizations such as Third Way. If a conspiracy theory does not have a bipartisan buy-in, I am much more likely to think that the real conspiracy is an attempt to mislead people&#39;s suspicions and focus them on a relatively benign organization, away from the real conspirators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are going to Syria, like they went into Iraq. Was anyone able to persuade them not to? Aren&#39;t reasons for war on Syria looking just like reasons for war in  Iraq? You have WMD, dictator who murders his own people, all they need is another terrorist event to link to either Syria or Iran? Nobody can stop them and MSM is pro-war! You can forget about American people, they are in coma.</p>
