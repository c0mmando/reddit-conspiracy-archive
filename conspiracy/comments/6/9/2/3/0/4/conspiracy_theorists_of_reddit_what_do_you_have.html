<p>And as for the FEMA Camps, pretty sure that was Alex &quot;He doesn&#39;t speak for this Sub l&quot; Jones&#39; brainchild. i could be wrong, but he&#39;s the only guy I heard talk about that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say anything about the number of Executive Orders, and this has nothing to do with FDR.  It&#39;s about the nature of Obama&#39;s executive orders and how they were used specifically to go around Congress, and the contents of the Executive Orders themselves.  Look up Executive Order 10990, 10995, 10997, 11000-05, and 13603 for starters - just those alone is a dictator tool kit that any tinpot dictator would dream for.  You can also look at his creation of the DACA to get around illegal immigration, and the creation of the Obamacare mandate.  Considering he has the background of being a Constitutional scholar that past tons of unconstitutional laws and mandates, the irony is palpable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unconstitutional is sort of a misleading word these days, because we really don&#39;t have any Constitutional &quot;rights&quot; left when it comes down to it.  If the government ever wanted or needed a reason to go after you, they don&#39;t need and never needed a reason to do it.  Have you ever read your Bill of Rights?  Quick, make a checklist and make a tick on the box every single time one of them is blatantly infringed by his and the vast majority of post-9/11 Executive Orders, or any other number of laws that infringe on your rights passed in the last 16 years.  Obama is no different from any others before him who took it upon themselves to give more power to the Executive branch.</p>

<p>You never had rights in the first place, you have <em>privledges</em>.  Obama was just the latest PR frontman of the criminal cartel that controls our government and (mainly) all governments.  We are ruled by criminal families and their proxies that create law through our &quot;President&quot; by Executive fiat because they are completely illegitimate in the first place.  They enforce their will by force because they have no option not to, and we gladly let them do it thanks to being duped by indoctrination, dumbing down and propaganda.  We have not been a true Republic since 1871 when London and the Vatican&#39;s banking cartels bought out the bankrupt American government and installed the vassal Corporation of the United States America in the Vatican/London-inspired Federal city state capital of Washington DC, the military arm of their Cabal.</p>

<p>Every President since with the exception of a very few are all servants of the British Crown and the Roman/Vatican Cult.  Bush, Obama, Trump, Clinton and virtually every single President since at least JFK are all coerced, more than willing or forced to do their bidding.  The ones that get out of line even a little bit gets smacked down hard and reminded of their role as Rome&#39;s bitch if they live through it.  Just look at what happened with Trump, Reagan, JFK, Nixon, Eisenhower, or any other President that gets &quot;uppity&quot;.</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s EOs expanded executive power.  Obama presided over such a vast and incredible expansion of our surveillance powers, and authorities to enact them!</p>

<p>You can muddy the waters with hillbilly rhetoric conspiracy theories all you want...  but the reality of what Obama did was actually pretty insane.  The most terrifying part is that he is an incredible lawyer who obviously has some very high level intelligence training, so the gravity, breadth, and scope of his actions will take years to fully understand.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re one of those guys who can&#39;t stop complaining about Trump...  Do you understand, now, why people resisted the expansion of executive powers that Obama oversaw?  You cheered while Obama turned the office into a kingship, now you lament that that power was handed over to someone you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>You came here wanting people to eat crow for you, but I bet you&#39;re not willing to eat it yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that was kinda my point. My post is complete sarcasm, and then I turned it around and did the same thing OP did in his post. </p>

<p>Also, I understand the flat earther argument. But if you look through OP&#39;s post history he spends a lot of time on r/flatearth debunking the whole flat earth theory. He literally spends most of his time on reddit trying to convince people on r/flatearth that the earth is a sphere. </p>

<p>Right, because only deeply deluded people believed he would do that. But that is a strawman.

<p>Part of that conspiracy involves controlling the narrative on social media, and so they have both bots and employees posting ridiculous content on here with titles like &quot;Does obama make christian baby smoothies for breakfast?&quot; But that is just to discredit us. </p>

<p>Basically if the powers that be are able to convince people like you, u/Sly_and_the_3rdStone, that conspiracy theorists are all nutjobs then they can get away with things like saying Wikileaks is a Russian scam. We can post details on here that prove otherwise, but you won&#39;t read them because they are next to a link that says Atlantis was found buried in a cornfield in Iowa.</p>

<p>And if they can get away with making public statements that defy basic critical thought then they can get away with anything - like starting a global war on terror for nothing more than profit and continuing that war through all presidencies. I mean, you get that, right? After eight years of Obama we are more at war than we were when he started. This is never going to end.</p>

<p>So really you just need to decide if you want to make up your own mind about the facts that are presented to you or if you want to believe some official narrative that has been crafted by a corporate bureaucracy. Coming in here and saying, &quot;Hey, you guys are all crazy right?&quot; is just kind of ignorant. If you spent some time sifting through the bullshit (not easy, I know) you would see that this sub is full of deeply thoughtful people who are trying to make sense of a world where we cannot trust traditional sources of information.</p>

<p>If almost doubling the national debt counts as selling Americans into slavery you could say he did that. Under his we rule are divided more now than ever as he did nothing to prevent the outbreak of BLM riots (funded by people who have a lot to gain from the working class not being able to rise up).</p>

<p>Some of the things we feel the most but notice the least is how public opinion was strategically manipulated with propaganda, traditional, and social media.  </p>

<p>In an effort to keep us eating RoundUp Ready foods we were coerced to fight back against gluten. To keep the medical monstrosity healthy we were told to attack anyone who questions vaccines. The military industrial complex needed a new bad guy and Arab spring needed to end, he rose to the occasion creating a new monster which will last us decades, could have came up with a cooler name though like AllShaaHabinea or something more Arab.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the people in jail, a full 1% of the country did not receive a trial. They were threatened with exaggerated charges and signed a plea bargain, often bringing in $40,000+ a year to a corporation like Corrections Corporation of America, a fortune 500 company. We call North Korea&#39;s prisons labor camps but so many people work for much less than minimum wage in American prisons. They&#39;re not camps persay but you&#39;re definitely going to be forced to work in federal prison. </p>

<p>As for the guns were are actively cultivating a society where the rich  are happy to turn them over and the poor can&#39;t afford the fees to own them legally. Growing inequality is the single biggest threat to the nation in my opinion much worse than imposing sharia law. The industrial revolution brought labor reform but the computer revolution pays the workers 5x the wage of other people. Just keep working and don&#39;t do anything stupid or you might become one of the many poor. Every major city in the country has a ghetto and they&#39;re only growing bigger as the gap between rich and poor becomes larger. It cultivates a mood that the relatively rich won&#39;t challenge the status quo and the poor can&#39;t do anything about. We&#39;re not the same country were when things were good and it&#39;s not getting better for most people.</p>

<p>Well there was certainly a conspiracy to side-rail the Democratic National Convention when Bernie Sanders was pushed out in favor of Hillary Clinton, even though Sanders clearly had the upper hand. There were leaked emails about this proving it. High level DNC members ended up resigning, it was a mess.</p>

<p>I never believed that Obama would impose sharia law because I never believed he was a muslim. I do think he wanted to take guns though.</p>

<p>I think that he failed due to guns being popular and the president not having the unilateral ability to. I absolutely still believe he wanted the 2nd amendment striped out of the constitution.</p>

<p>FEMA camps are real but I don&#39;t know that they have anything to do with concentration camps. I do believe there are concentration camps set up throughout America as part of a SHTF scenario. I just don&#39;t think we&#39;ve reached that DEFCON yet. I also don&#39;t think that has anything to do with Obama specifically. </p>

<p>Yeah, like once a president takes power and gets access to all the info he realizes that there is a reason why Obama did the things he did and why Hillary was planning on similar things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unconstitutional is sort of a misleading word these days, because we really don&#39;t have any Constitutional &quot;rights&quot; left when it comes down to it.  If the government ever wanted or needed a reason to go after you, they don&#39;t need and never needed a reason to do it.  Have you ever read your Bill of Rights?  Quick, make a checklist and make a tick on the box every single time one of them is blatantly infringed by his and the vast majority of post-9/11 Executive Orders, or any other number of laws that infringe on your rights passed in the last 16 years.  Obama is no different from any others before him who took it upon themselves to give more power to the Executive branch.</p>

<p>You never had rights in the first place, you have <em>privledges</em>.  Obama was just the latest PR frontman of the criminal cartel that controls our government and (mainly) all governments.  We are ruled by criminal families and their proxies that create law through our &quot;President&quot; by Executive fiat because they are completely illegitimate in the first place.  They enforce their will by force because they have no option not to, and we gladly let them do it thanks to being duped by indoctrination, dumbing down and propaganda.  We have not been a true Republic since 1871 when London and the Vatican&#39;s banking cartels bought out the bankrupt American government and installed the vassal Corporation of the United States America in the Vatican/London-inspired Federal city state capital of Washington DC, the military arm of their Cabal.</p>

<p>Every President since with the exception of a very few are all servants of the British Crown and the Roman/Vatican Cult.  Bush, Obama, Trump, Clinton and virtually every single President since at least JFK are all coerced, more than willing or forced to do their bidding.  The ones that get out of line even a little bit gets smacked down hard and reminded of their role as Rome&#39;s bitch if they live through it.  Just look at what happened with Trump, Reagan, JFK, Nixon, Eisenhower, or any other President that gets &quot;uppity&quot;.</p>

<p>You know what that would result in, right?  If everyone&#39;s currency goes down then there is literally no change in trade.</p>
